able to other issues of the of the economy and Nikki Haley and all the other problems with the President Trump has addressed this past week and getting a pastor Brunson back from a from turkey but to make this a ... one of the things we talk about on this show frequently because\nThe violence in Chicago is a national issue yes or a and there's an epidemic in Chicago or\nIf I were to say to you name to things that must be done if we want a really eradicate crime in Chicago and on gun violence what would what would it be\nWell first of all we got the reached the demographic for was during the shooting\nYou have to do the sixteen hundreds of ... million that around the around the country right a police department as a dental ... sixteen hundred people mostly gang members in Chicago or responsible for a large portion of the crime so that's the sixteen hundreds go yes\nUm and like I said I'm with replays ... which is an initiative that I'm looking to start which is getting young men with guns in the hands of hopelessness and they are out of the streets into the trades really going on that block loving them where they are and building up them up to where we want to\nDo what I talk about how we have to have a partnership ... academic you a lot of times you write up a really great grant and your your I saw you have the best intentions right\nBut the on the boot ground piece you don't even know that your target group can't even walk these two blocks to get to your brick and mortar to even be successful in the program because of the the violence like these some of these young men can't even walk two blocks away from their home\nThey are trapped on these in these areas\nBecause they're my anger um members of gangs yes\nUm and so just the other day right it was a young man shot Twenty years old\nOn fifth the sticks in Michigan right so and a lot of these things are fueled by Instagram and social media right\nSo I'll go on his on his page and use the rest and pissed and like all we glad he's murdered and this and that so All right on that and then the very next day I guess his friends caught some people\nAnd it caught one and the other what these these young men consider as ops and shot half his face off like\nThese you also you also told me the interview the other day that that that that parents uh who frequently we see on a gonna grieving on television or in many cases or their children aren't that innocent and\nThey are they not only are none of that is amazing ...\nI wouldn't anything that can you talk to father had\nI'm a talker Parenthood period okay um\nAnd and and the thing about it as a I have difficult conversations so one day I got I was upset and I said look when your child is shot\nAnd you've been like in his pictures with the guns in their hands with him smoking marijuana with him drink and lean and all that\nWhen he gets shot I don't want to see a damn graduation pitcher I Want you to be the parent that you just was before he got shot maybe Fifteen minutes before did you push that like but no\nShow that side of them because that's who you truly is don't don't own\nBut I think it is time for the fed to take a break and see how the economy fares under the slightly higher interest rates\nBut in terms of the stock market's going to go up and down a there are a lot of people that believe that it is um overpriced right now so there's going to be some adjustment\nWe've had the longest Bull Run in the history of the stock market where between what are called it a um corrections which was a ten percent change we'd gone longer without a correction than anytime in the history of the stock market so the fact that we might actually have some decline in the stock market\nIs completely understandable and again if you are so fearful that this could happen that you might end up selling low then you probably should not be in the market in the first place\nAnd ... and was what five percent only yeah only about five percent typical that we do have an October cracks yes and it's just something about the month of October is very weird you know why that is you know what I mean does it have anything to do with the expected stimulus around the holiday time\nNo but that's all she that when something like that is what we call 'em seasonal it's already built into the pie so they already know that just has to do it earnings come out and and we're at a situation right now where the economy\nIs if we can grow between now and next July first on July first this will be the longest expansion in the history of the American economy it will\nBe a years long you'll does hurricane Michael and the devastation it has caused does that have any ripple effect\nIt will be minor are partly because it did not hit a major urban center I feel terrible for the people who were wiped out but we're not talking about it here in Tampa or or New Orleans or something like that [noise]\nUm it could have some effect in terms of the price of crude oil or the price of gasoline more importantly than that well how have they have a fleeting effect they'll just go away once the uh the refineries are up and running again in the pumps are\nAre going to impact on the the Chinese trade war\nThat trade war is surprising in that many of us argued of course I the one reason I could not vote for Mr Trump though I'm a Republican and conservative was because of his economic policy I think that the trade war is a dumb thing to do\nEconomically it turns out he may be right though politically this may be a political coup that will get the rest of the world to actually have lower um terrorists across the board because of it\nBut almost every analysis I've seen the economy based upon what has been this battle between us and China is at the effects have been minimal\nNow of course if you're one of the families affected because you can't get your soybeans sold it's gonna affect you dramatically and we'd be in Illinois we were big into soybeans and soybeans is one of the markets who's being hurt by this\nBut if you look at the economy as a whole even if trade with China in a sense all the money that we are all the experts that we have the China disappeared [noise]\nIt would still be maybe one tenth maybe two tenths of GDP so instead of growing at four percent we would grow three point nine or a three point eight kids it's not as relatively important as the other parts of the important ... south and now it is in Illinois ... I don't want to understand\nThat kind of it is to Peter is a Democrat um how did the Democrats make their economic case against the Republicans as they try to regain control of Congress I mean I think I think Jeannie made an excellent point right there soybeans\nAnd a number of these markets that are being a very very impressed by these tariffs there in areas that supported the president and so you go there I think you do not come out a single county to say that this is red and forget they voted last time this\nDoes preaching one for the president so I think that's where Mike you made an excellent point with while it might be a while it might end up being a political benefit to the president\nIf you if you and your family are up at four thirty AM right you know every day to to work hard on your family farm and your crop is Sawyer it's another one that's being crushed by these terrorists\nYou could care less about someone's fickle fortune ... yeah\nThe from the Democratic side what's what's interesting of but I think there's a case to ... Sanders made all many of the very same arguments that Mr Trump is making regarding these particular terrorists who does not ... and Larry what's interesting again about Trump pieces I think he's such an interesting man\nIt is clear he's he has this view of trade which is simply wrong from an economic standpoint yet he hires Larry Kudlow\nWho is a free trader bar none but he and he accepts advice from the man and I just think it's wonderful that he would bring in somebody who he truly disagrees with and and cut those going to do everything he can to try to get Mr Trump to come around\n... and President Trump says he's playing for the long haul he is he's playing the game with China is absolutely spot on the fact that they ... their intellectual property theft tear up their currency manipulation\nOr the real cause they have that uh that much give them technology ... they're they're absolutely close enough some of the market is absolutely fight on that China is not a good actor when it comes to trade and what he's\nTrying to tell you are the largest I mean so so that's the thing that we that for every one dollar we're not saying they should roll over for any foreign power but but to the extent where it really is hurting American families and I think there was very little warning\nWhen these terrorists hit and it was more of a reactive rather than proactive response from the White House rats very or the for this aid package\nI Do not show up and he was\nHe he absolutely he is actually continuing on one of his campaign promises that he's never going to bring back but I understand as\nWell just like Jeanie said the Chinese are behaving badly and no one knows what to do about it and the Chinese and they're no that accept Mr Trump in the one thing he does just like with the cabinet thing I think if any other president\nHad face the scrutiny that Kavanaugh did and the attacks he did he did the president would removed as their candidate and tried somebody else I every ... Trump clearly you only have horrible happened and he plays the article he removed um\n[noise] he did he really a Harriet Miers and say here's like when you're ... and and Mr Mr Trump just doesn't do that and he's not doing it with China and he's not doing with the Europeans and now the Europeans are at the table he didn't do I I I think ... agreed to it after putting\nInto some of these trade deals that you too much must also not trade with China as well so that he get the whole coalition amenable telling sign that\nThat they you know another and also a different issue within the ... I mean I think there are I'm sure for the president\nA justice Kavanaugh felt very personally because being accused of sexual misconduct something the president has also faced I'm sure there was a personal appeal to\nHis stance as opposed to I'm a secretary price the former health and she said that there was his misuse of public funds there was ...\nOr the gentleman who was in charge of the ... yeah you're not going to let the Democrats are ruined his agenda and ... probably hardball he plays hard but like nobody else does then they're not used to the doctor mob mentality\nThey think that they're in and I don't think that the president I think it perhaps it's a combination of hard boiled but also what's important to him I think his priorities are far different than than Washington Republicans are the hour in order to have you not out of identity shouted\nDown no bite and bite and but\nI I I live in an ocean to out shout but again in any\nIn any presidency you know you like to be able to say that you like to play on things and again you know a ... a\nA President Trump is really delivered on a lot of his campaign promises and he makes a big point of it as he should\nAny any has also shown an ability and the case of the return of a pastor Brunson that when when he gets involved personally own a you know people are are released a and and pastor Brunson was released it was at the White House yesterday\nBut sometimes there are there are things that pop up\nOr whether it is a terrorist attack or whether it is something a foreign issue pops up and it really can discombobulated anybody whether it's George Bush or a ... bomber any president that can be thrown off and I'm Wondering whether a the apparent murder\nOf the Washington Post journalist\nAnd with the allegation being made that the Saudi Government was behind it and I'm Wondering if that's one of those outside issues\nThat's going to put the president the United states and specifically Donald Trump in a very difficult situation because you you you have the the fingerprints at the moment looks like they lead to the royal family\nYou know I don't disagree with you I mean who would ever have anticipated that type of a current on the national they know where you've got even I mean Turkey's not than our friend lately no they've not been a good actor in the region um and yet we're finding ourselves on the same kind of turkey\nWondering what went happened and we need answers so I think he doesn't know what to do yeah I think\nThey're trying to figure this out and hurt gas and the turkey and Saudi that they've never gotten along either now at this particular point of point it's the it's the Turks who are basically saying we have the video that explains this to the world will tell us a lot about Donald Trump how he\nHas a certain town in this situation and what I think it's one of his great challenges remain just behind North Korea\nThis one's going to be this is going to be very and\nYou know from the three paragraph to drive\nOur we had our destiny of doing the opposite of this program [noise]\nI've been told many many times the exact opposite [laughter]\nStill have this question though the ... has been such a key a participant in ... at the end so cheesy alliances for that region yeah how do we handle that that is a huge a question it something they could have never anticipated to have to\nDeal with it on the night before the break I said that this is may maybe this is as complicated as\nAs North Korea I think it's more common could be I mean North Korea doesn't have any oil and doesn't have any it isn't a strategic partner to us in a in a strategic part of our\nUh our big picture so it's it's so scary Tom thank you very much for your call from Pennsylvania let's go to Alan listening to us and WC geo in park ridge Illinois go ahead Alan\nThanks for taking my call good try to earlier but anyway uh I don't think anybody brought up what happened in Charlottesville but a white power people like you know what their torches an hour that escalated the car back up and the feeling that lady you know uh that's ...\nYeah you're talking about doctors that work at abortion clinics bitten killed\nYes so that I Know where that's quite a few decades since then has occurred I did but it isn't and it's still it's still evil\nYours yeah your your point is that there are there had been acts of violence and and mob rule on the right not just on the left\nI guess ... years ago we had the Democratic convention with the parking lot of the demonstrations going down there and protest in World War or for testing Vietnam War you know so it is is always going to be around\nBut Allen here's one it's very important point the fifty years ago on August twenty eighth when the big uh a riot or a demonstration and it was described ultimately as a police dry it by Dan Walker who set up a national commission looking into it [noise] um\nWhat do you head there as it was an early there was an early thing that was happening in television videotape was relatively new\nAnd historically or the news networks would go out and get film of an incident and then they would go back and the editing and then they would present it to the national audience\nWon't because it was a news event was happening right then and there and this new thing called video could be turned around very quickly what happened on that night by the major networks NBC being the most watched network at that particular time\nIt ran it without any editing\nAnd they and and there were very little if you listen to it there's very little commentary you know today it would be some reporter that would be chirping over every piece of video they wouldn't let the video tell the story and so they ran a law almost about a seven minute these\nAre what was happening at Michigan and bell bell bell bowl and Chicago\nWhen the anchorman came back\nThe anchorman took the position that the police overreacted\nThey took a more sympathetic view of the protesters\nWhich certainly many would have described as a mob than they describe them in a different way yet ... average citizen home and they're in their living room and the ... Kansas\nWatching on TV I'm Talking about masses tens of millions of people they saw that videotape and they saw a completely different than the news media\nThat was that was the moment\nThe split between the audience and television news broke\nIt broke on August twenty eighth of Nineteen sixty eight because the people at home sought differently just as many people during the campaign of two thousand sixteen saw the rioting and the protests vehement violent protests against Donald Trump and his supporters\nThey were watching it at home on television\nAnd like the people fifty years ago they saw that story differently and I'm just saying that right now even though the demonstrations that I saw you know uh you know against a\nA you know the capital hearings they were not like the riots in Chicago the police riots in Chicago a and they tear gas and everything else in Chicago\nBut again if you're home in t._v. land I think you're going to react the same way I think that's why there's going to be a huge\nFor Republicans and Democrats that they're going to energize their base but I think the Republicans are are making a comeback\nBecause of that video and that's why I think the president knows to refer that do\nIt as a mob [noise]\nHe's got a method to his madness members do my back shortly\n\nThe Los Angeles looking for the ideal place for you and your family to relax

T. H. E. Y. B. Y. pronounced it may be parents have decided to raise the they'd be without the construct of gender\nSo that the child can choose it's sex when the time comes now this is not\nA big movement like the me too movement or that we talked about a sea change or the folks\nThat are doing this uh parents that are doing this as social scientists jealous that\nThey are part of a small but a strong minded group of parents who have chosen to raise their babies their babies that is in early childhood with our gender\nBecause\nThey think that that would cast them as male or female against the possibility that as a child grows the child does not want to be male or female giving that child the air go time to make up\nIts own mind I Hope I'm saying that right with the appropriate prone\nTo get the story describes got your thoughts on that um let's just tell them science doesn't exist and the numbers\nReally don't equal or the you know let's just go ahead and start telling them everything that is real and normal and and\nJust obviously is not because that's what these people are doing they're not strong minded they're stupid sheep I mean really you're going to now be told how to ... your child\nDo they not think for themselves do they not kids have this natural ability and I love it because it makes adults look stupid all the time they know right from wrong they know what's normal and what's not and they identified and say that's not normal they see a guy walking in addressing go that's not normal\nSo these parents\nI Love it because in Eighteen to Twenty years these kids are going to start realizing what normal human beings realize and that is that their parents and liberals are\nAnd it she just continued conservative rebellion from the use the hippies are\nDying quickly and

happens when you're trapped and you're dying you just do whatever you can to survive and it's going to be nice it's going to be\nAll right to your point and dig are they dying to be sure these parents are a small group\nThey've decided to raise the baby without to construct of gender or they want the child to have their own opinion on gender um do you think that's poor parenting a or is it and giving the courtesy to the offspring can make up its own mind\nWell they're in the heat of psychiatric care [laughter] I mean there is only two sexes male and female and they're actually harming the child there been a reason like this the kids are going to be a good school are gonna be ridiculed\nThere is a bunch of why I was looking for attention as we are to boil down to they have no ... life there for ... and I don't know I Would have to say these people are not what\nThis means is that not only do the children not no they're assigned sex until maybe they were in kindergarten and the little boys sitting next and Billy says you're a boy\nAnd his little classmate tells them your a boy whether you know it or not but for the sake of argument it means that they don't know they're assigned sex and no one else will either\nNot the frenzy acquaintances the fellow employees the family including the grandparents that wouldn't be in a Fishell\nAssigned set so the children who are naturally aware of course of their own body parts and might find out for sure that there are a boy at school or a girl in school they um are given the freedom to be and ...\nAnd that little Billy

attention and love and hugs and compliments and petting and training and helping\nEvery kid so don't minimize the severity of the problem my child has\nBecause she is in fact defective she can't\nTalk the way a six year olds supposed to talk\nThat unless the language gets correct did and we start saying I start saying I Can't say well you should do what I Need to do is say that she's retarded and effective and I do and the teachers are like whoa we don't like to say that that's what it is\nYou stand with her and the playground you watch how the other six year olds deal with that child and you tell me if the problem is and profound and serious let's not make it all nice by saying she has special needs\nShe's not performing at an age appropriate level I'm [laughter]\nI Know no boys who

her\nThat's a big hurdle that's a high wall for another six year old to climb over what am I was six year old seven year olds do when they realize that my daughter has trouble speaking to them as appear they make one of three decisions they are either very special\nAnd they engage and they do to work to be her friend but it's work six and seven year olds are not in the mood to do a lot of work\nOr if they come from a nice home they get quiet they get quiet or [noise]\nThey walk away\nMy child has a defect that's what it is and she is retarded that's what it is that language makes me

Richard you're on with Mark Mark thanks for taking my call\nElection but in the mid term elections could be a watershed moment teachable moment I'm for all for all Americans um I think that uh the Democrats\nHave not learned their lessons or in the has shown by the door they treated Kevin all and the ... in the Supreme Court hearings\nUm they of assumed that they could slander and live or person but they disagreed with politically than get their way but\nUm [noise] than they've been doing the same thing to trial for two years but\nUh it's really come to the head with a camera and all of the nation and I think we need to use the midterms to show them clearly that that's not the way to do politics in America that what what is needed in America is\nThe parties to\nTo debate the issues then to use reason Twitter\nToo but you know they come yeah they they don't go ahead\n... we\nHave Richard ... that's yeah that's been there playbook though not just since the last two years with Trump\nTheir play book and I remember Harry Reid saying that Romney didn't pay his taxes here from someone and humid later on I was a lie but he said it was effective well they'll do anything in the book and the worry is it looks like they could win a house representatives and if they do you can't imagine what the next two years ago and it'd be like for President Trump and for all that's right\nThat's right and it's it's the idea that uh you're selfish and justify yourself which means\nI'm that's what the Democrats are using as they're guiding principle of their self ... is a justified by their selfish Maine's\nAnd ... and they also think they have truth on their side they're arrogant as I said and when you arrogant and you think if you think you have the truth than you could do anything right at the end of the ... the means are justified by the ends right or\nThe ... either way you said it works because they just feel they can say anything and do anything because

radio I'm meteorologist John drought\nAnd it's mark I live with you all week on\nMy radio was talking about the last person [noise]\n\nWhere the effort Cumberland talks news talk Ninety four point one where the upper Cumberland streams taught high school playbook sixty minutes of exercising does sixty minutes of football a high school playbook\nI'm OK what it is is that a ... father and my mother and my\nGrandmother passed away a notice that um\n[noise] I joined the cigarette butts laying on the Republican caucus committee got people who are at the polls go now it'll take a look at you know all of you know they see how people are voting\nAnd I've noticed that no one looking through records that for some reason my grandfather and my grandmother and my mother all voted for Obama twice even though they die before [noise]\nDid you report it to anybody tried to take some action [noise] I\nAnd it's just that it it was kind of like a yelling at a stone wall\nYeah no ... this is a real problem with voting integrity in this country\nAnd we've known for years that people in Chicago people voted in Chicago but now across the country there are people voting in your case you twice they voted for Obama I mean if you don't have integrity election system anything could happen it's amazing when you look back on it that Trump won that Bush won\nBecause ... I Believe that we're finding that kind of fraud that uh people who wrote in in California you you know you can vote by DMV and they admitted that thousands of people voted there they said there was some things with voting machines\nWe got a real problem when you can trust the outcome of the election [noise]\nWell the thing is is that how the link county Republican a cock his committee changed\nHere in Cedar Rapids pledge that we got a whole new Patrick people in a whole new batch people actually interested and say I'm going to make sure my vote is actually\nCounted and so we got all these younger people who says I Love this idea I'm just going to make sure that this guy over here that I don't trust is being equal [noise]\nAnd that's how we changed from eight Democrats city so the Republicans city getting this last election\nSo that's good so there's still some good news even despite the fraudulent voted by the way that doesn't take into account illegal immigrants right\nIf illegal immigrants are voting and that's my whole point that's another topic if we ever allow illegal immigrants to vote Republicans aren't going another election or at least nationally uh in in our lifetime or there's no hope when you let people vote who aren't qualified or are not citizens of United States\nYou brought up a great little election\nActually got to get our gay guy will suck on their ... their [noise] okay salt ends on how you treat the end of the\nTree and us people who may be here illegally but are contributing to society because I worked you know many aware out at the agency jobs where there are plenty of illegals that were working\nBut as long as you treat them like human beings that not you know being angry because they're illegal just realized that our system itself for so long that we know integrated people that you know\nAnd uh and another no way should have been there and the first place but because they are good to us that we are good for them [noise] maybe\nThe idea that illegals would probably vote Republican is not out of the questions not probably not quite as\nIt's not yeah ... just because it's tied to want to get on to our topic necessarily the problem is\nIf you don't have a way of entering the country legally then you're sovereignty your borders me nothing I mean there's a big topic I don't want to go into it yeah I certainly think people should be treated well but whether they should be allowed into your country is another issue you have borders or you don't\nBut I don't want to open up that can't worms right now uh you know it it's bigger than just a few minutes ... is not a matter of treat them well in fact I\nDon't even know I teach at night and many of my students may not be here legally they degrade people that's not the point I fault the government for not having a system that makes sense for all of us that's the real issue\nAnd speaking of issues let me know what you think at eight six six Ninety red eye that's also eight six six or seven\nThirty three thirty nine let's see we have time for another call ... in the segment Charles been waiting Sheryl in spots where does that New Jersey\nAnd by now in New

the vandalism you spoke about New York city with the uh in New York Republican club being hit\nWith vandalism and broken glass this is all orchestrated then promoted by Hillary Clinton\nBill I don't I don't know if it's all orchestrated by her because she laws if you're done such a great job but the fact is you're right the certainly the playbook Solomon skin and Obama followed that\nAnd taking over the young right so they get a doctor named for the most part and he knew if you capture them when they're young you'd have him for a lifetime\nAnd that's why the nice guy a you know not forget the last caller name but the idea that uh you know if you're just treat illegal immigrants well that's okay 'cause they're good people you know we know they're good people but that's not the point you know what I often say\nI've been saying it's amazing it's not amazing that the students graduate and they're on the left\nWhat's amazing is if anybody goes through the school system has come out as conservatives\nAre they just don't hear the other side they never hear our side actually when I think about I'm pretty optimistic that we could win elections after all that indoctrination because eventually you get a paycheck because there was the second\nWas the government taking all my money what did I don't agree with the stuff right but they've got to grow up they gotta get out in the world and they\nTend to be a conservative\nBut I Want to know what you're thinking I don't I don't want to be unfair to anybody you know I I think there's a civil war going on in this country the second civil war between the left and the ride battling for all the issues are brought up at the beginning more regulations more taxes\nI'm more government a lower military it's funny in that sense they want less of a military\nAnd again they don't even believe this American exceptionalism that is something special about this country how can ... go to a you know Berkley and not let people speak or black lives matter when did that start\nAs I mentioned Alan Dershowitz who is a big Hillary Clinton supporter speaking of Hillary said this is not the liberalism that he knows you let people who have opposing ideas speak and he tried to win the battle of the the dialogue about which which system which candidate are just better\nI don't see that going on not when you can't even go to a

and they ended up losing in the course they were angry they stood up the KKK and they've been\nAll about and sleeping all the people now and they were going to be the masters and that's pretty much how they [noise] the only one benefit out of time until we're totally dependent and we are so stupid will take the money and give up our freedom now [noise] is there anything we can do about\nThis that got a look at what John back it up is where are you familiar with this author no\nJohn back it up you know it ...\nUp online I could do was look it up the fate of empires anyway um [noise] he talks about how [noise] nations rise to prominence I'm looking at it all happened before\nAnd then late fall again and he talks about the stages I go through up [noise] um I'm conquerors and then pioneers in the age of of commerce and the flu and then up electrical ism\nYeah well is you're right in the sense that in Rome and other empires and let alone countries a country has come and go empires\nThe fight hard for it and that's part of my message tonight if you don't get out there and vote we're going to be in trouble let's go to Fred in Tallahassee, Florida Fred you're on with mark\nMark Gary for it real well how are you doing\nI'm doing good yeah the uh the stability or character so stay above a minister I shouldn't says his goal to\nPot a\nNow he was banned in the last ... started\nVoting but not the first\nPresident I got a full load for unfortunately got impeach but and that was a real sport oh my dad was a staunch\nConservative but him and all the child was good buddies who wanted to gather\nIn there and done all kinds of stuff you know you might be a different party and a few different ideas but you got along and you know you can have a conversation without it turning into a fish but about politics\nAnd the way things are going nail file Hillary brought up the poor balls\nThe Democratic party has turned into the party of the poor bulls the way they did judge Kavanaugh\nSays\nTotally deplorable the way they do anybody that tries to stand up for what they think is right if it's this agrees with the Democrats\nIf they disagree with the Democrats they're not gonna let me know what you're saying [noise] marks on\nFilling in hundred Iranian [noise]\n\nNews talk Ninety four point one they are the early riser hardworking neighbors planting the seeds raising the crops getting ready for the next\nThe vote for him because they don't share your philosophy or your principles of courses another issue\nWhich is as a teacher part time teacher I can tell you this most students don't know our point of view what I often use is the minimum wage laws they'll say oh of course I Want my re uh want to get a raise or what do they call it also not just minimum wage livable wage I Love that one like it's a job of a business this may sound heartless\nA job of business to give you a livable wage no it's not\nIt's a job I teach economics java business to make a profit if they don't make a profit they won't be known you won't have any work or they won't hire you or the lay you off when they won't hire your friends\nThat have the job of a business they give you a livable wage and it's not the job of government to decide what wage to give you\nThat is what the Soviet Union did not communism is that's what's socialism is and as most young people but they've never heard the other side where does money come from I've said that for years people do not know including adults not just young people young adults\nThat the government has no money to tone it just takes in ... from some group of people in the form of tax and give us gives it the others when students here the snake I never heard that\nI never heard that before [noise] see conservatives can win it's a harder thing to explain\nA than just being emotional and say you know whatever livable wage pro choice global warming of course it changes the climate change when it gets very cold just seeing these catchy things they left and the Democrats are much better at that than conservatives are takes a while to explain\nWhy they shouldn't be a minimum wage if there is you you just can't raise that arbitrarily or the government should do it some bureaucrats shouldn't do it\nIt takes a long time to explain capitalism why that's the best system ever created so far\n... this is tough to be on on our side it it takes a while and if you have a meeting against or oh good luck it's a wonder we win any elections is one of the President Trump won with all the things stacked against him [noise]\nAh and let's go to David in Greenwich uh let's see where that is in Greenwich New Jersey and sounds like\nFire David [noise]\nGood morning thanks for taking my phone call um I I guess mine are six quick points on that you know President Trump has hated for what he says and and I get it it's not for what he does you know let's not forget in this country that on President Obama came then I didn't vote for him but I liked them as charismatic\nThe money in this country and you should know this uh come as you're teaching the money in this country dried up and it went back up on the shelf ironically it comes right back out again President Trump cannot force corporations to invest money or make things happen I mean he's a businessman he's a wheel on your show he's hated for what he said\nNot what he done second I think the people in this country should understand that the Democratic and Republican Party are are are corporations just like if you want to I wanted to start our own\nRight eye radio corporation political party we could do it too so when they take it so personally thinking wishes us and this is it's not an us and them their corporations and the up that that's how I let myself again I think to vote in this country you should have to pass a set the question test and at least get us\nWhy you're voting where you're voting what parties coming\nUh as far as the civil war in this country at a friend of mine told me when I Lived in South Carolina once I mentioned the civil war and he said it wasn't the civil war it was a war of northern aggression because there was nothing simple about it well we are in the ... civil war right now and with regards to this next election I Can't see\nIt not getting more ugly than it was I personally predict there's going to be a red wave come along this time in Congress and that's because of the Kavanaugh hearings themselves\nA and you know I'm and I'm just not a question it's it's a it's a screw in question but if somebody turned around tomorrow and said I mean the bottom of the bus drivers are taking the bathroom break at a fast food restaurant and he says Mr Schumer\nMr or ... or or or Mr selling so expose themselves to be in the bathroom do they get a hearing from that do they not get a hearing I mean isn't that ridiculous I understand what happened with the Kavanaugh herring\nBut ah this country's out of control but doesn't straighten out there could be a civil war aware of the national guard protect our borders and if nothing else anyone living at listening out there should understand that you know there are countries out there that are that are against us\nThat don't like us and they want to sit down and they want us down in the dirt and this is going back ... years and a hundred years we leave our guard down and we start caring ourselves apart internally\nSomeone's going to make a move on us and I appreciate you taking my culture\nAbsolutely no ... you know you're pretty articulate about it the only thing I don't agree with you for sure is a I don't I don't want to give a test to see because just because you're going to answer questions I guess your test would include questions about government and so on\nBecause I've seen very bright people who don't have wisdom just because I have a master's degree I don't have a doctor but I Know people doctors at just because they have a degree\nDoesn't make them very wise\nSo I don't think I Want to test for voting I Do want to make sure we had a caller about the integrity of the voting system that isn't real big trouble but I certainly don't want to test for voting but I I\nI Know I certainly won't don't want to make it easier like you can a motor voting rights you can or voting the day of the election\nThings you know or or voting even three months before things happen right that was a problem in Florida I think you know where where people had voted and they didn't get to see what happened the next few weeks I Want to be a reasonable effort I don't want to go out of my way to make a difficult\nBut there are people who die I remember in El Salvador they stood on line and they were bullets being shot at them obviously and bloody some of them to vote and they held up I don't know ... I Can't even think what color or as they\nHeld it whenever they were using to signify that they have voted we we don't take that seriously enough so I don't want to make it easy for the people here it sounds like I'm contradict myself\nTo make it easier to the people on a reform to vote same\nYou cannot voting in of course a test of course that was has a bad history in terms of the south\nTerms of trying to get and keep the blacks from voting and others so that that's not my idea or not you know but I certainly don't want to make it so easy that they go through the DMZ and vote well go to the DMV the department of eagles that's\nThat's a chore too so yeah I've got a story later weekly here at\nThe Generation Z I'm giving away they're not voting because they this is great they got their ballots I guess maybe through the Internet or whatever but they don't know where to get postage stamps that's a true story they don't have to get postage stamps\nAnd I bet you there on the other side so maybe there was something to with the caller was talking about let's go to John in Denver\nKmart [noise] ah I don't agree that the Americans in a civil war the vast majority of Americans today first syllable upstanding people were very bright line and the reason Trump got elected to\nThe American public are disappointed I mean the legislator what got elected because he was an outsider than the because he's a businessman and then the money that his business\nBurns he's very a proven and he knows when he's in a bad deal and he [noise] I think a great job for all of the I I I really admire him that he puts American ... the first\nA lot of recognizing the international court system up when you get the influences the in our world\nA like a little not either do to reverse they they're so\nPowerful and wealthy and as a group [noise] they can walk to control the world they don't walk sovereign country they don't want them there they don't want a constitution they slowly or could lead to\nA lot to be infringed upon you know no pledge of allegiance and across criminals\nAre invaded in ... with a ... you know tolerance is uh what else [noise]\nHarlem you may I thanks I [noise] yeah I was going to say you you made your point there\nUh I don't have to agree with the villa breweries necessarily but the you know right we have the Europeans who have a you know a whole system now that looks like it may be falling apart because people don't want faraway governments to determine what goes on their lives but I don't agree with you I mean the I don't have to write the civil war you can call it what you want\nBut the anger and the differences between the left and the right is very strong and I said if if the Democrats take back the house this next few weeks\nYou know for like would you say you're just not going to like what you're saying it's going to be worse than what you saw the Kevin are here let me know what you think eight six six Ninety red eye which is the same as eight six six nine seven thirty three thirty nine Marcus are filling in on Red Army radio\nGeorge with radio told me to be with us [noise]\nCBS News on the hour sponsored by Sarah works relief\n...

KBC board that sounds familiar saying that in fact I got so used to saying that\nThat I went to another station another network showed the engineers said to me or Muslim or ... or you know a practice run here and we did in the civil wrongful over the news station\nBut I guess that's what happens when you're so used to it but we know the number here let's do it correctly eight six six Ninety red eye\nOf the same thing as eight six six nine o seven\nThirty three thirty nine and we'll be taking your calls in a little bit but first I Want to tell you that well we've been doing the last couple of hours\nWe've been trying to talk about the civil war between the left and the right and that's where I think has been occurring here for the last couple of years that I think it's\nThe second civil war and you've been reacting to that on line I mean a through your calls\nBut first of all let's get it straight if you don't already know what the left liberals Democrats whatever you want to call them will do anything and everything to when they have no limits and they have no guard rails as to what is acceptable this isn't\nEven the era of Ronald Reagan where he can be friends with ... speaker Tip O'Neill I mentioned this last hour and have a drink with him at night\nAnd President Reagan will ask what had happened with all the vitriol during the day and Tip O'Neill way was the speaker of the house at the time he said that's the day time does that night we're way past that and you saw Senator Graham talking about that that these were his friends\nThat he he was saying all those things about because of what they've done\nSearch for power and oh yeah\nProbably now you can't even have a drink a night because look what it may have done to judge Kevin uh\nIt has become an all out war anything as I said and everything goes now lying as commonplace as with her image of this with Harry Reid claiming Romney didn't pay any taxes someone as friends or someone told them that wasn't true and then he was called on that he said well it would work didn't it\nOr the total insanity of the charge that Kavanaugh was part of the group allowing for women to be gang rape so much so that even the New York times didn't print that accusation\nOf it is fair game now and now any accusation is to be treated seriously if it has made this key if it is made by someone on the left against someone on the right\nSo the assault you may have heard about this maybe you didn't hear about it that Keith Allison may very well have made a else and sorry may very well made against this girlfriend is not important news running I guess Minnesota for something I think it's one of sort of turn in general are lieutenant governor whatever it is\nHe's on the left and maybe even more telling he's a Muslim which isn't exempt group I'm up against Muslims but you can't attack them\nThese new rules are only for those on the right the ends justify any means\nWe're evil and they're right check that correct they never want to be called right right side but that's all that matters there is no issue of whether they can go to sleep at night because there knowing I guess they know they're doing God's work\nAnd here's my summation and then we'll take your calls the only force is the way you and your cronies conducted the circus\nAnd maybe the ... to cross the ACLU the American civil liberties union yeah right\nThey chimed in because they to her left this group before they our civil liberties group and so they came out against his nomination and I quote\nAnd he said he was born and records deeply concerned by the allegations raised in recent weeks has made a rare exception to his longstanding policy and voted to oppose the nomination of Brett Kavanaugh they passed a resolution stating they oppose the confirmation of judge Kevin of the Supreme Court there aren't credible allegations\nViscerally ACLU allegations that judge Kevin O's engaged in serious misconduct you mean like Bill Clinton did you say anything then set of not fanatical investigated by the Senate what would it be advocates adequate seven FBI checks eight nine what does it Dr Ford's credible testimony subsequent allegations of sexual misconduct\nYou mean the great thing that even the times wouldn't publish the an adequate investigation maybe they can investigate better and judge Kavanaugh says ... just the data about is a fitness to serve as an associate justice of the Supreme Court\nThis is not a decision take lightly we cannot remain silent under these extraordinary circumstances about a lifetime appointment of hardest core to land on trying to shorten it the standards for such an appointment and the burden is on the nominee the burden is on the nominee to prove that something that happened how exactly does one do that\nThe burden is not mad as long as they're unresolved questions regarding the credible allegations of sexual assaults assault get it on resolved allegations so if they can never resolve it which they can't because there is no cooperation then while I can never be confirmed\nAnd it goes on and on I I don't want to make your two depressed but there does again based on allegations I Want to know I just want to know where in the past the ACLU wanted someone convicted because of allegations\nBut this is what the Democrats on the left have no soul there was no place to go with all of this except down on the other and the loss of a piece of America\nApplication of the Simpson of innocence and the self righteousness of those on the left and the fool's on our side and

there's a look at your national forecast red eye radio I'm meteorologist John trout\n[noise] that eight six six Ninety rent I call me at that\nThat number is eight six six or seven thirty three thirty nine and my feeling in on the radio\nTown of Monterey want to invite you to come home\nBut the thing that that there are several things but one of them is that if Feinstein really wanted to get to the to\nWin that letter came in a month ahead of time they could have went to the background checks and done all that she wanted political theater and she is getting me too movement to try to do this and it just made up of fires and unbelievable\nI Am a survivor of a neat to see it happen to me and I didn't believe by the board for a minute not per minute and they use that to make everybody I mean they just made a stand out of the whole thing and they said it back Thirty years in my opinion and I just I could just green\nAnd I hope that it motivates everybody\nOn the Republican side to get out there and and vote because to me that was or what they did pick carbon now was absolutely just back about I Can't even it unbelievable to me that you would do that for an innocent man for political gain that complete craziness\nYeah so I understand where you yeah thanks Sally I understand where you're coming from it was hard for me to watch when you know it was the Democrats turn to a question him or not but the question and they just put on a show\nIt pretty disgusting and of course as grand pointed out he voted for uh you know liberal or leftist Supreme Court judges and they won big numbers who we we often are the party with the stupid party and then in my opinion then the evil part I heard someone else said this\nAnd um we've got to learn that we're in a civil war and I want them to get someone who fill the greed\nMay have dropped off let's go to Tyler in Reno nevada Tyler you're on with mark\nHis Nevada mark and it's I\nI think that ah I've heard all the way too much of rehashing of the last you know a couple of months of political he said she said and all the other nonsense [noise] one thing that the folks that listen to your show could do to help put the ball over the line so to speak\nFor whoever Canada that you want to support\nIs to actually get off your ... and go out and volunteer to sit at the polls on election day and Greek voters or what we found time and time again I've been doing this since Barry Goldwater ran for office years ago\nOr is that if you have a friendly face at the polls\nYou have people going to the polls that are still kind of on the fence of where they're going to go you get a seven to twelve percent push\nAt those particular polling places where you have these friendly faces now it won't do any good if you got to curb margin that's all grumpy and you know wants to get in fights with everybody but the thing is is you just have a nice pleasant person there\nUh I always set up a little card table with a bullet candy a couple of smiley balloons and you know say hello to the kids that come out with their parents\nAnd you can make a significant difference in your community both on the down ticket people and on the main ones like I'm going to be out there for a Dean Heller are starting here in Reno or on the twentieth of October or we start early voting I [noise]\nI I think that everybody else if they would take a few days off and participate at the polls they could really make a difference\nYou know you you make some good points to the ... that personal touch I've run for office of course in California last\nAh Republicans don't usually win in California but I'm the personal touch makes a difference because they've done polls and and I've seen it in the audience is where they ask people have you ever met a candidate and almost all say they never have and when they meet someone and you had a great point in their reasonable decent that's how you can get a vote\n'em and then Republicans used to be very good at doing that and then they went over to consultants and TV and I think we went astray in some ways let's go to April in New York City Hi April you're on with mark on the road I radio\n[noise] um I wanted to comment you said you wanted to hear a comment about whether we're going through a civil war\nAnd I believe that\nThere's a difference but civil war I think we are going to prove\nSomething similar to that but on the civil war both sides are very boisterous and we're willing to fight to the death for what they believed in what's happening now with the media and entertainment and the and the young people they and they don't they only hearing one side we're not organized\nConservatism organized because men nice\nGuys we believe in being in a civil but this is not the time to be that way because the kids are watching and the nature of young people as they want to be on the winning side they don't even know we exist well all the young kids in school or in the high schools and colleges the minute they have a conservative view\nThey screen that oh how can any person as a young person is in college be strong enough to stand up against this title wave and the media and the

you also made a very good point which is and I said this before\nWho the president is makes a difference who the people young people grow up with that is what they hear and that's what they learn right that's why during the Obama administration to get a lot of young people all they hear is that side and now with Trump although we have the media against us which hurts a lot\nBut if they see the economy's doing well and their lives are improving the lives of their parents that starts to influence them in more people like that was in his own microcosm in his family\nThe ten year old is a Trump

you may be just joining us and the first hour suggests that we have a civil war going on now\nFor the fate of this country whether it's going to move far left\nAnd forget how we started what made us so special American exceptionalism with very little government people at a face tyranny\nAnd dictatorships and ruled by the kings are queens and they want to get away from that and they want the less government they want the liberty and they want the freedom to reform the republic\nThat's how the country was founded on where the declaration and the constitution making different than any other country before it was the first time we said\nThat ordinary average people could make decisions about what was best in their lives and they didn't need these dictators kings queens tyrants to make those decisions for them that battles against the left\nWhich thinks there should be more and more government and individual rights are not uh not as big an issues they once were\nAnd that in terms of of the world situation America's just as bad as everybody else that there was nothing special about western civilization and very little that we could learn from it so in the Kavanaugh hearings which I bought a brought up the next hour\nYou saw it on display there they're less things that they're right and that anything goes so you could destroy a man's reputation weather just by something that

they didn't want any part of the government to get too powerful soon and everything we do you're right you know how to make a law the house has to pass the soon as they agree the president can veto it or they can override it\nOr you have the court system to try to you know slow down too much power certainly to make sure it follows the constitution these people were geniuses and created this country

there's a look at your national forecast read our radio I'm meteorologist John drought nine months\nSix Ninety red eye we're taking your calls [noise]\nIt's going to be the talk of a town who saw Ninety four point was\nIn like to see it\nIt's a tax you can get repeal attacks like they got rid of it just got that that's why it passed has gotten Robert me to act out of it in a margin unconstitutional the words that choice for that and why is Nick how can we get it Congress should do with that he helped me\nOur [noise] ... yeah I think I can I don't think they have courage or they're afraid you know the poll numbers are actually I don't know if you can believe them but the poll numbers seem to show that the repeal is not as popular as it was I don't know if that's accurate or not because we have problems with the polls\nBut you make another point jury which is what I said there's John Roberts appointed by a Republican president\nAnd all of a sudden he changed on Obamacare we're pretty sure we're going to win that\nYou can't even trust wrong which is how about the Democrats they complain about them Kevin Oh they voted ... ...\nAnd it doesn't matter the issue or you don't ever see them deviate\nBut even on the Supreme Court is the Republicans who deviate from what you thought they believed in\nAgain you're not supposed to question them on every single issue now they don't even answer it but you couldn't even trust John Roberts to be a good a Supreme Court justice who else then who's the awful won the suit or that the H a Bush a point that I mean he wound up being a disaster\nSo we we we have this problem and thanks so much for your call Jerry the problem is\nThat people are not as you point out John McCain was probably trying to get back and President Trump but you can't even trust trust you don't have to worry when you vote for a Democrat when you vote for a liberal when you vote for the left is that what you're going to get\nYour vote for our own I mean I I gotta tell ya I wasn't even sure that Susan Collins was going to come down on the side of Kevin I was worried when she was going to give her speech it I don't know if you remember a few hours before she gave a speech people weren't sure what she was going to do\nAnd they often you have people like Jeff Flake right the wife dimension him\nHe didn't even run again because it's so unpopular hates another one that aids Trump so much\nAnd you could even be sure his role and what did he do uh a woman it costs them which looks like she may have been part of the ... gang but I don't want to see if if it's not accurate you know some of them were paid the ... did you watch them by the way clawing at the Supreme Court you know try to stop his nomination of these people losing it or what\nAnd that's why for those are just joining us now I said of the very first our we have a civil war going on but we can't even trust the that's the answer to Jerry's question\nThey run as Republicans conservatives whatever and then they get in there I don't know they want to be in favor at the parties or they want to get good press who knows what it is it gets them that's why I say this for years and it's good time to say to the audience and now\nWe didn't first become Republicans and then the site on our principles we had a series of values and we said oh with those values than the Republican Party makes sense and if ever they deviate from that what is the point of being Republican what is the point if the party can stick to it what's the point of John McCain you know\nChanges his mind or voted or what he said he would do or Jeff Flake 'cause he's angry at President Trump and we can go down the list of others like that\nWhat you don't see the Democrats doing that now you could say you got mentioned in there but heck didn't Trump win West Virginia by forty points or something like that I don't think he had much choice and he tends to be somewhere in the middle but that's unusual\nFor the most part they never deviate and that's why I said in that and we'll take your calls\nThe if the Republicans lose the house of representatives\nGood luck with the next two years they're going to have subpoenas they're gonna have hearings that go into a peach President Trump there's no doubt in my mind if they have a majority they'll be able to do that in the house representatives they'll have hearings they'll try to teach the judge Kavanaugh\nThis is going to be chaos and I am sure one of the color set up a number of color city you better go out there and vote you better get your neighbors to vote you better get your friends to vote this is serious stuff\nThis country will never be the same if these guys getting power and it doesn't matter if President Trump when's the next time if you have a house representatives that trying to destroy him and his people as Lindsey Graham pointed out they only care about power\nI mean I'm not going to say they don't have any principles any views but I'm just trying to say they think they're so right there so arrogant but anything goes and you saw it and you watched it at the Kevin are hearings they they didn't care about ruining his reputation and in fact as I pointed out before they didn't even care about the Ford they didn't care so much about her she was just a pawn\nAnd when the phone is like Cory Booker said or do you think she's making\nWhole about winning your point of view or in your case running for president next time and the same thing with Kamala Harris you can't trust these people\n[noise] we we know what they're in for a you know why they're in for this stuff to gain the power to win the election to take over the presidency they never accepted his win and

I don't really remember what Bush did on his\nBut right now the president being a factor thirty five percent of voters said yes and and that's why I'm supporting him\nThose who oppose I'm thirty eight percent yeah I'm boating just to oppose them twenty seven percent said it's not about him\nYeah look Mitt turns a referendum on President whether you acknowledge it or not Trump's clearly acknowledging it but I don't think that's what that was always going to be the case what's happened in the last ten days two weeks since the Kevin I'm hearing\nIs not about Donald Trump it's about Republicans in the Senate it's about Mitch McConnell not being seen as sort of a hero for having the strength and courage to sort of push this through when\nYou know ... one of the reasons Trump was elected was because Republicans were dissatisfied with Republican leadership they didn't like Mitch McConnell he had a terrible favorable approval rating among Republicans\nThat is completely flipped around now than it's unify the party so the energy coming not necessarily from from Trump but from Republicans in Washington\nYou know it was interesting too and you tell me if they're shows up in the polls that we know there's a lot of never Trump voters on the right there was no I don't remember seeing any never Obama's and very few ... Bill Clinton when they had the impeachment thing well some people seem to have gotten him back\nBut when when when you Brett Kavanaugh you really had a Bush favorite son and when things got trouble for Brett Kavanaugh George Bush was working as hard as Donald Trump they were on the same page does that allow a road in for the never Trump ... well\nIt certainly was the case and we saw anecdotally I'm ... you know you had folks like Brad Stevens who was one of the lead never Trump first come out with a column saying thank God for Donald Trump Erick Erickson who is one of the original never Trump or saying\nI'm voting for Trump and twenty twenty because of this issue in particular so they're certainly anecdotal evidence to to suggest that the never Trump hers are now sort of have been have been welded due to Trump because of this issue but\nIt's not really showing up at the polls because they never traumas will never that big they were allowed but there were lab very loud because they are exactly cause they occupy spots in the media and McCain exactly but but as far as how big they were as a percentage of the Republican base is it was never that big and so it's not it's not generating a big bump in the in the numbers for for Trump\nI been watching a lot of the rallies and they are even loud for rallies and especially when the capital things started heating up and they'll

the\nThe speaker there Brian is is generally right but but I think that there is a big hole here is what do the Democrats really stands for I mean I don't think they nationalize the issue of health

for president\nAnd now as as the race comes down the stretch he fades so what is that what did they really stands\nFor I think that's why their voters are not as galvanized as Republicans because there is no real platform it's at the end of the day\nIt's very hard to elect people if you don't eat it too if you don't have a platform but they are running for something and I think right now the

give you what happened today the upper Cumberland at five in the afternoon\nWe are going to leave nothing on with that being said became firmly denied any knowledge of it he didn't really know maybe I don't want to get his mind but it sounded to me like maybe it is for the role\nGetting to the bottom of it but it is what is a flat denial\nWell the real killer is going to get to them and they're going to get on the president returned to the king not the crown prince but I actually think of somebody you didn't get permission to say it that knows politics says was genius for the president said he talked to the king because the crown prince would know but the king is in charge\nSo the president wants to get to the bottom of this but he's trying to blow up us Saudi relations you might not like that but he's thinking very trends actually here's my morale on what's at stake with the murder or the Washington Post columnist got twenty eight\nAnd we need the Turks to share with us wherever information they have I Believe that they had intelligence sources inside that conflict\nI Believe that that's where the recordings come from they need to share those with us and they need to share that soon\nOn the Saudis nature share with us what they have\nAnd then we need to collect our own intelligence so that we couldn't corroborate whatever the Turks and Saudis are telling us the only one we have all of that information that the intelligence community will be able to tell the president with any sort of confidence in what we think happened inside that conflict which is still murky because there are two narratives and there's two competing narratives\nMy morale would know hate when we come back we'll the bones we talked to mark teach and then you this is the brand kill me Joe don't go anywhere busy Monday the president on the road to hurricane rabbit Florida\nIt's going to be the target of a town from me it was Ninety four point one\nUh so that's what he's doing but I mean ... you know and even in the areas where he hasn't kept his promise like building a wall of repealing Obamacare he's been trying\nA you know that that's because of democratic obstruction that he hasn't done that and then you know in the ... the few rare instances where he has backtracked like you know he promised during the campaign to pull all our troops out of Afghanistan he actually studied the issue very carefully if you read the Woodward book it's actually very comforting the process by which he went through a\nReally tough question the salary and and he can he concluded that he was wrong and that was that's that's good\nOr bad is said to him with that is said to me it was Mr President amount of what you accomplished in your term if there was another attack coming from Afghanistan he pulled the troops out that's all anyone ever remember and that's who it hit home with him\nYeah absolutely and then you know if you look at it you know he goes off ... when I say that he tells lies like he says\nUh our biggest tax cut in history what is worse to ... to claim that your tax cut is the biggest tax cut in history when it's really not the biggest tax cut or to take your say or to sell your ... your main legislative achievement Obamacare on on the basis of a lie that you can keep your doctor in your health care plan\nA I Would say that it's a lot worse to tell people that can keep their doctors and health care plan and say whoops I guess that wasn't true ah you know he hasn't sold any any any policies on the basis of ally\nMark when did you go aboard the Bush administration ...\nI've been I was there for the whole eight years I started in the Pentagon and two thousand and one went to the White House in two thousand foreign stay till two thousand a\nYear President Bush you watched his dad and Ronald Reagan up close and he was governor how much ramp up time did he need he didn't have much in nine months and nine eleven attack to really feel comfortable this is just more seasons opinion looking at the present\nIt's hard to say because I by the time I joined him and had a lot of face to face contact in two thousand four I was at the Pentagon for the first three years or so I didn't see him in those early years but by the time I I engage with him he was you know he was fully in charge and you know people who I work who said he was a he was he said he was comfortable from the very beginning\nSo here you're a man named Andrew I'm here as well as we saw said about when she questioned him last night about him being more comfortable as president cut in\nI think so I mean I felt comfortable at the beginning other than it was a little surreal to say I'm the president of the United states but I think that's true with everybody\nHow it is now I very much like how it is I Do I feel like the president you know for a little while it's like a Mr presidents or and even my friends they called me they they don't call me down and then they called me Mr President I say we please loosen up I've learned on the job I have when you feel comfortable I feel very comfortable here\nAre you sensing that or is it or we over exaggerating that since we're talking about over exaggerating the role he's been on\nYou know I Know I don't think we're already that during the role you've been on I think he's got a roll of an enormous accomplishment I mean if you just if you took the litany of accomplishment that this president had and went to\nNever Trump or a three years ago and said we're going to elect a Republican president who is going to pass historic tax reform huge regulatory roll back destroy the ISIS caliphate a you know down the line uh most people would sign up for it um it's it's\nOut you know the the difference between him and George George W. Bush or even you know to some extent is that he's he's not he's the first president we've had has never held political office before\nUh so you know he came out of the world of business he's got a learning curve of how government works versus how business works in the end of things on foreign policy just didn't have a lot of experience and all this stuff but he's surrounded himself with really good people\nHe's got a great foreign policy team now with the with a bolt in ... uh you know in in advising him I mean and you know Gina Haspel at CIA [noise]\nSo you know he's he's you know he's he's learning and he's growing in an office in in a good way\nSo I don't have any problem with me about him he'll walk over to the cameras and let the press talk to them with a chopper going in the background he just did it in the rain I'll be very head out to Florida to talk about Saudi Arabia so he talked to us brought a doctor Shannon Thursday took the sixty minutes over the weekend\nAnd I'm Wondering first off from a communication standpoint would you recommend did he do sixty minutes I think\nHe came off well you know from what I've been reading from beginning to end but\nYou know yeah why not I mean I think the key thing you have to worry about where the presidency in a long long period of an eight years is over exposure right so eventually people start tuning presidents out but then they see too much with them it used to be you know from a Reagan's day\nAnd I just looked at it from the volume of speeches that we were doing in the Bush administration you know he had two or three events a day where we had to have a written text of some kind of the Bush in the in the Reagan Administration because you didn't have twenty four hour cable news and all the rest of it\nUh presidents were much less exposed and so when they went out and spoke a people paid much more attention because all the president's talking we better stop and you know pay attention\nAnd now you know and it's not just him it's Obama or George W. Bush presidents are so overexposed and there are so out there all the time\nOr that it's you know at some point after you know we're still early in his presidency but some people just get exhausted and and stopped paying attention so he's got to worry about if he's got an eight year term or that you don't want to be so over expose that people aren't listening anymore\nWhen you hear Leslie stall and sixty minutes over time about what went into the interview was a third cut fourteen\nWhy do you think President Trump decided on an interview with you and now at this particular time\nI think he's trying to win the mid term elections for the Republicans and I believe in all his people believe\nSome out there publicly the stronger the chances are for the Republicans are\nThe better for him and I think the White House has come to believe it's a mistake to try to restrain to keep them off television to keep them away from these rallies or who loves doing who ... who who gets a lot of energy from crowds I Want to get a lot of energy wrestling with no\nYeah I don't think he minded I that's what people don't understand he takes questions but he doesn't really get a bill if you get a noxious gas noxious go nuts sit down but you you actually sit down as we still\nHere's a here's the problem right is that there's exposure and there's exposure\nIf you're ... if you're doing these interviews and you're a message discipline and your message a goal is to\nPut out there and let people know what what you're accomplishing an office what's your agenda is that's all good it's when the president goes out and completely distract from his successes with the rants about the Mueller investigation and the Russia probe and then the sort of these these crazy asides that he does all the time\nThat make people exhausted by by the by the seeming chaos you know the fact is if you look at his set of accomplishments and then you look at their their thing where there's a poll now that he was like at forty one percent which is like the highest he's had one of the ... got one of the highest poll numbers of his presidency but he's still in the low forties\nWith a guy with his level of accomplishment should be in the fifties or sixties and\nPresidency is he's not building his base beyond his base right when you come in you got your core base and then you go out and you reach out and you're trying to accomplish certain things and you get a get a level of accomplishment that people should be looking at this economy that this is one of the best economies we've had in in generation\nAnd they should be saying you know what crops pretty good president maybe I should give him a second shot but he keeps doing all this stuff\nThat just makes people dislike him and ... not not as core base his core base loves everything he does but he's not persuading the persuadable\nBringing them along the same as president\nAnd that's one thing that you know he got a few of those questions from was we saw biggest surprise since she took over that's when you human on yourself well the biggest surprise for me was when I ... you know you could just tell a story that makes you seen\nA humble or the magnitude of the office or the biggest you know just as soon as he does it does those who went over independence that's when people say I really like this guy\nAnd he said no I'm going to bull straight ahead not show any vulnerability we all make mistakes I'm my mistake was not blowing up NAFTA early but that just the way he does thing is going to change but I think if someone talked to him and say he won independence human as yourself\nYou know talk about you want to uh you want to bear and game and you said in the background and you're seeing how well he's playing with the Dc United academy which he is evidently is a great soccer player and just simply corner and know what he's sacrifice to come here and seemed fitting in so well with his teammates you realize\nHow much it's so much more than just me and then people go oh my goodness you forget he's a dad he read these data teenager now I think he's Thirteen twelve or Thirteen but he's being you know he's like six one that's what those people off [laughter] but but I mean those those are the moments when asked you know what I'm asking them to cry\nBut you just say give me that other side\nOr the end that would be fantastic but I'll I'll give you a perfect example okay so ... African American unemployment is the lowest on record right remember Donald Trump went to that that that African American church in Detroit during the campaign and he said to them whether you vote for me or not I'm going to fight for you\nAnd I'm going to I'm going to I'm going to we're going to crack down on crime we're going to ... we're going to crack down on on on drugs were going to create the opportunity and unemployed didn't people don't know this but like the tax overhaul that he did include something called opportunities on a bill introduced by Senator Tim Scott this kind of ... that's going to attracted long term investment into inner city communities\nHe ought to go to an African American church and said you know something I promised you I Would fight for you I said what do you have to lose and I'm delivering for you and here's what I've done and again if you don't vote for me that's okay but I just want you to know that I'm president of all Americans I'm going to find out\nHe might not convince the African American community but those persuadable and independents would look at that and say wow the president he's fighting for people who didn't vote for him was I didn't know that African American unemployment was the lowest on record\nNext news in one hour or on vine news talk Ninety One done [noise]\nCBS News on the hour sponsored by their works relief\n...

Clark though I have a question for you yes\nIt is that the uh I was just wondering what kind of show\nIt is not easy for people in their seventies to find affordable life insurance because usually by the time somebody's in their seventies they've got something wrong with them some form of pre existing condition that insurers are afraid of\nTell me specifically what is the insurance need for your parents\nTo go to a show that ...\nOkay so the older All right so when somebody dies and less debt is jointly held in most states the survivors are not responsible for the debt\nSo you don't normally have to have life insurance to deal with a let's say with a husband and wife only and trying to remember is that six states are eight states that are known as community properties states\nEverywhere else the debts of one state as the debts of that one and do not become debts of the other\nOh life insurance is not something normally you would have to worry about um one thing I recommend with people who are getting up in years like your parents is that it's not a good idea to have joint credit cards\nOkay because with joint credit cards what happens is the one dies the other is responsible\nAnd like uh if there's a car loan you don't want to have the car loan necessarily in both names\nFailed so so having debts that are separate as someone reaches um the later stages of life is something that is a better plan so do your parents have a great deal of debts though\nUp to this is a but I'm Out sort of make sure they called\nRight right so I'm so speaking of leaving this or ... have they talk through review\nWhat they want to have happen at time if they're passing if they want to have a traditional funeral they want to have traditional burial do they want to be cremated like it has it been a family conversation\nSince it sounds like you're the one who's going to be responsible and be helping out [noise] have you had those kinds of conversations\nOkay we'll get on it\nRight so that's a conversation I'd really like you to have because nobody really seems to want to address the subject and you may be surprised that one or both your parents really do want to talk about it but nobody's gotten around to asking them\nOkay because that makes a difference as well you know if somebody says oh no we don't want anything fancy don't go spend a lot of money on a funeral and this is what we want or whatever it gives you some peace of mind and understanding and also you know\nHow they feel about spending a lot or a little or whatever on final arrangement some people\nWant very very specific and what really fancy funerals was special things in them and whatever but the more you know the more you understand about that the better\nOne other thing about that is there's a website I'd like you to look at coal funerals dot org okay and\nThese co ops that you can join for like almost no money they give you access to much cheaper funerals much cheaper burials if somebody chooses cremation and much cheaper cremation\n[noise]\nAnd so I you know when when someone asked me about how what should we be doing with our parents and their expenses and\nWorried about that one of the things that your parents tend to ask me about his this kind of stuff and that's why the more you know when you go to talk to them about what they want you were able to give advice and guidance and suggestions but\nI don't know that life insurance at this point really sounds like a big priority\nSteve is with us on the Clark Howard show hello Steve hey how ya doing great thank you Steve how can I be of service to you\nOh I've got a retirement planning question I think sixty one my wife is sixty to\nOur house which is valued by an online service said just a little less than four hundred thousand dollars is completely paid a\nCombined annual income now is about a hundred and sixty thousand kids are grown they're on their own them but my wife is retired she's right pension and she's also working part time jobs I Do right\nNow in your wife is a retired has a pension and is still working two jobs\nShe ... she is the definition of Taipei she has a personal trainer and she's also working at a daycare center has a blast there is no stress and she loves that\nThat's neat okay\n'cause I work fulltime but I'd like to retire soon um we do keep track of of networks on one of the ... and I met with a check but this one is just about one quite four million that includes the value of the helps\nHow'd you know that was my next question [laughter] so you can say listen I listen to too much\nOf a house cannot generate income for you but a million dollars you have the way you figure that is you figure the million dollars will generate a and grow to cover inflation about forty thousand dollars a year\nOr so if you base the fat at this point would generate forty grand and your wife has a pension generating so much and at some point you'll one or both of you will be eligible for Social Security\n... yeah well well she has um she's eligible now for the minimum I Believe but I think we'd like to wait until\nYou want a way you want to wait as long as you possibly can for both of you so the question ultimately is can you live on a theoretically forty grand coming from what you've saved\nThe money she has her pension money both of you would have from Social Security and whatever part time stuff she and you do for a fine like she's doing it or because you want to supplement income if you can live on that you can rest easy\nChair that sets a curiosity is timing and an dollar amount has done a lot of reading and it says that ah you can take between three and a half and four percent of what you've gotten the retirement out because it'll continue to generate and and so the question is yeah um you know what kind of planning and services are available and\nAll right okay well I don't ... I Would think when you are one year out from when you think he won a bag work yeah I think it'd be wonderful for the two of you to go sit down with somebody with a Garrett planning network okay Garrett planning network I don't know if you've heard me mentioned them before\nIf they don't sell any products at all you just pay them for advice just like if you went to consult a doctor and he paid his or her bill you go to an accountant pay his or her bell\nYou go to somebody who is a financial planner to look through what you're doing go over your goals were the you make sure you've got all the paperwork done you should have done and then what you know you're on a clear path to do what you want to do or you're not\nOkay [noise] okay I can definitely do that that's a huge house\nAnd so a congratulations for being in a position where you've created choices by owning your home free and clear having saved north of a million dollars having your wife's pension I mean you've done everything you could do including one thing that is\nNot so often in the modern era\nYou got your adult children financially independent\nYeah that is true they are out and living on a switch sides of the country\nWell how about ... congratulations to you you're listening to the Clark Howard show [noise]\nOne hour or online news talk Ninety four one dot com\nEve CBS News on the hour sponsored by Tara works relief\nI'm Jim shown to be President Trump is sent his top diplomat to Saudi Arabia for talks on the disappearance of journalists ...

I thought that's what you might say I'm okay what's your house all into\nA one hundred and bought a hundred and sixty five thousand\nOkay so let me let me let me kind of walk into the equation went there so clearly okay let's say that we pay off the car with this money and then loses twenty thousand dollars put down on our house\nAnd if you are the exact same house you're talking about buying earlier I'm a centrally you have financed your car on your home mortgage would you agree with that\nYou are correct\nAnd um that would take a dumb car purchase and make it even worse if okay\nThat's where that's how I got there so quickly because okay basically we're financing a Cornell over Fifteen Years\nWhich I'm not going to do whatever obviously what ... what I refinance my house in order to buy a thirty thousand dollar car\nNot a million years you know and it's basically the same equation were just saying it in different ways as we continue in our conversation here and sometimes you just look at it through a different different stand over on the other side of it and look at it from the left rather than from the right you see oh my God that really is done you know and so it's not\nIt's not as a you know it's not just Dave says sell the car it's do you really want to finance this car over Fifteen Years\nYou know what I Want to do that so\nAnd the car and Florida can afford to pay for it um if you didn't pay for when you can't afford it so yeah I'm Sorry dude I Know it's a sweet car my car guy like nice cars but I'm\nToo many times are nice cars have us instead of us have them

unfortunately I'd Fifteen five and a vehicle and then a hundred and twenty seven thousand to good old Sallie Mae so wow\nHow long have you guys been married three years three years and so shortly after marriage the two of you look at this pile of debt and something happened tell me what kind of your story\nWhere we were just kind of doing a normal thing um we were actually started out on the the ten year for doing this program and I actually heard you come across the radio I'm driving around in my work track and just was always interested in finances but really never knew\nUm where to start or where to begin and we picked up on your program and within a few weeks I purchased a total moneymaker ever read the book I talk or and I said we got to get on this I said we're doing it all wrong and we started it out and she just kind of followed my lead on it oh I Would just like that yeah\nIt was it was I mean she's a follower and she\nWas really I have some leadership [laughter]\nShe's into orbit words she didn't read the book really at all um and then eventually after I don't know about a year into the program she was starting to get mad at me because of the program and everything I said we just need to\nUm instead of yelling at me we need to go to the financial peace and then you can hear it from the source right from Dave ... and and you can you help you take somebody does my back exactly\nYo yo yo the video guy yeah very cool okay so you got in there then and you saw it for yourself rather than just going oh the engineer knows the numbers because kind of how it started right yeah the engineer guy he's going to do the numbers I'm the\nMedical personnel let him do the numbers and then you get in there and you see for yourself so what happened when you went to the class coordinator gave you a emotional ownership really in this thing\nSure I think it made it very tangible for me something that I can see in the the leaders of our class they were very open about their debt and how they had read it and that was something motivating for me\nFor me it felt like it was this constant uphill battle and I had this crazy burden because it was all mine yeah it's a little bit of a guilt trip yeah ... and so that class honestly made me feel a little more support it and just give us the opportunity to truly jump in and know that actually get\nOr do you have to do with this fast we a lot of debt and twenty a month it was a long yeah it was hard we started the ... the very beginning of January in two thousand and sixteen now and uh it was\nIt it was hard I mean two years and four months right and then yeah and that's that is a long long time but it's a hundred and forty three thousand dollars and you killed at all yeah how old are you too

beginning we we didn't talk about it a whole lot um we kind of had some friends and families that were saying like what what are you doing and uh I think after we got\nRolling through the process and we were getting some traction paying off quite a bit of money are quite a bit of dead people started come around then when you look at somebody go body paid off a hundred thousand dollars income shuts 'em up you know absolutely yeah\nYeah it's like you don't have to shut up it just says it\nThat's great very cool you guys very very well done what is the key to getting out of that\nFor us I think it was giving it together first of all the also being willing to work very hard I work three jobs and worked overtime and also never really strengthen the path I feel like once we decided to jump into the plan\nWe did not stray from that in honestly whenever I Would buy something like if I spent too much on groceries I Would feel bad because that was money that would be knocking out my lens Mm\nMhm

for us but she but she already knew that\nI regret to have you on those who were were at the first that we're we're we're done with the first offered the midpoint\nShow of talk about your observations of what we have seen what stands out [noise]\nI'm trying to find different creative ways to say it's Alabama and everybody else and so uh in this piece I have up there today I just talk about\nAlabama's dominance which I think has been the number one storyline so far just the way that she would go buy low has taken over at quarterback and now the favorite to win the Heisman we're seeing in actual off and that can score many many points for Alabama that's been the overriding storyline but I also\nThink that a lot of the biggest surprises that we've seen in college football have come from the SPCA it's not Alabama it's what LSU has done its what Kentucky has done its what Florida has done even Texas paying them the way that they played the way that they are now ranked in the top Fifteen top sixteen\nThis is what makes the SEC a conference that it's so good urine and you're out\nAnd you know Paul as well as I Do the SEC is better when there are more ranked teams in the SEC is even better when you've got those blue blood like Florida and LSU in the top ten in the top that you know those raking to join Alabama so I really do feel like this is the conference getting back to\nMega strength so to speak the way that we've seen in years past\nAndrew Alabama heads to Baton Rouge and two weeks ... well that's always an intriguing game is do we\nHave a reason why we should believe the real issue can be ...\nThey've had they've got a great defense and so I think that would be the number one reason to believe I still feel as if Alabama's going to beat everybody by double digits\nThis season I've gotten a chance to see them play a couple of times this year but you know the tricky thing is the knee injury to to tackle by law and I know that he's going to practice\nToday but any time that you've got a player now who's already\nBanged up at the midway point of the fees and that could be I'm not saying it's not that could be a cause for concern moving forward especially if he continues to take some hits to that knee and LSU has got one of the most aggressive\nVicious defenses that I've had a chance to watch in person I saw them play against Florida and as a lost that game\nBut the defense for big stretches of really gave out unless you an opportunity to win that game and we saw what they did to Georgia\nLast week and they were the most physical team the most aggressive team and I don't think Alabama has played a defense says physical or aggressive as what they're going to see against LSU so I Do think that that defense is going to give you an opportunity in that game\nWhich will be on the certainly are there are many many other stories or you mentioned some of them took some say in um Kentucky Florida or what's we'll start with the gators are still\nSo we're going to have two weeks before George ... book for him to a game for such a big one\nWas there in person to watch Florida beat LSU couple of weeks ago and even that game was over I said to myself I don't think Florida is has a chance to be Georgia but after watching the game this past weekend what LSU is able to do to Georgia and Florida is going to have a chance and again I don't mean to sound like a broken record\nAnd I have an opportunity to keep this team and the game especially if they can dominate the line of scrimmage the way that LSU did last week against Georgia you look at what this team has done under taught grant them their defensive coordinator specifically up front\nThe ... the tackles for last polite has really come on and had an outstanding season for them at the midway point the way that Jefferson is playing and also the aggressiveness that they're playing with in the back and vote Sean jokes if I hadn't played terrific them the blitz sings a linebacker\nUm so I Do think even though Florida as often remains a work in progress it's going to be that defense but it's going to have an opportunity to\nHelp when that game especially because they are so good in that front they're going to try and put that game of make from when it and if she is going to be the guy for this team Kirby Smart is not going to play Justin feels as if it's going to be from I think that really does plan to Florida's hand\nShould be moving player Justin Fields\nI'm Still trying to figure out what the decision making process was in the game last week and he's played both quarterbacks route the fees and then when you get an a whole the way that they did I Know we played him for a snap or to or a couple\nWhy would you not just at least try to do something a little bit different so that it's not completely on your running game you can at least open things up more a little bit in the passing game\nFlorida was able to do a few things in the ... not a lot on L. S. U. V. friends but they were able to stretch the field a little bit and so I still continue to wonder why he didn't play fields are still more in that game just to give them a little bit of\nA change of pace for the passing game and I wonder now is she reevaluate the film and they start preparing for Florida and that type of defense that they had knowing that Florida is probably going to attack the box try and slow down Holyfield that running game whether he might reevaluate the way that he plays those quarterbacks against the gators\nBefore you go a resume in order for God and about some some should be overtime laws to them but to Kentucky so it was a lot to say about the FCC's Andrew\nMountain bomb builders use locally sourced quality materials and solid men are craftsmanship so did my garage Twenty years ago last year with a tree fell on it\n[laughter] it was retrieve it broke my garage there's solid river or while\nOkay I guess I'm gonna call mountain born builders you'll be glad you did ...\nQuality local materials workman\nShip that stands the test of time mountain barn builders are surprisingly affordable they design and build would or middle storage building garages garden sheds on board with an eight year workman ship warning that any of the melting barn builders locations across the upper Cumberland or mountain barn builders dot com they buy local you should do\nKnew you were billionaire Michael Bloomberg is throwing his liberal money behind Phil Bredesen campaign Bloomberg has already spent tens of millions of dollars attacking the second amendment now Bloomberg is hosting a Manhattan fundraiser for Phil Bredesen Senate campaign\nBecause Bloomberg knows British and will vote against the second amendment\nReticent has a rating from the n._r._a. because of his increasingly liberal views on gun control\nSo liberal reticent supports a gun database making it easier for government bureaucrats to track down and take away our firearms there's a reason New York liberal Michael Bloomberg is trying to elect bill reticent British and Dutch and respect the second amendment\nAny vote with national Democrats to violate our Second Amendment rights the rated by the n._r._a.

Want to make Kentucky's not going to be Georgia because Kentucky officers scored six points to seven quarters because the quarterback can't throw the ball\nHe can throw the ball now he won't be able to throw the ball with the Georgia game because everybody has figured out that subject to say to beat us\nThey figured out what we do we screen T. throw short quick passes around the line of scrimmage and we run the football [noise] and that's why you name was able to keep us a beat his twenty to fourteen ... just because I got to him and get the credit they deserve and got tremendous football\nTeam they really do\nAnd uh [noise] like Georgia and as far as Georgia I don't even know how he hung on a big number five when you get it right by the by the twelve or Thirteen grand Cayman

now this year we're very very young do you really say\nThat here in Studio ... all of those young town here can win ballgames this year you have to see who's going to be quick he who they're going to be great Harlem is\nClearly understand but let me ask you a question or\nAt what point did you think that game was over Saturday because I thought it was over pretty early\nWent to school and got Thirteen nothing\nYeah to me or you just have to make a ... at at Thirteen to nothing gamble but doesn't work it doesn't work I understand you don't want to throw up or young player to the fire but I don't think you had any choice and to me it's almost like Kirby Smart was saying we can afford to lose this game\nOr who is this game and went out we're still in the playoffs and um maybe maybe he played that that bad versus a shaking the confidence of the young player but I didn't like it\nOkay well that's a good point that's a good one but I still think Kirby is trying to get back to the FCC championship\nGame and I doubt they no doubt I'm here the the best chance to do that\nWell he probably ... he probably does but I I was I was just thinking about trying to win the game that are here I'm ... years but I tell me though is against the need vowing to\nHave those moments like that from time to time and\nI I ... it OK against the better defenses Auburn last year Alabama and this year

aren't that many schools to choose from right now when trying to place a top five team now tell me who should be in their place\nBut I I hate to say but I you know I Know about rankings they know they're they're from one to twenty five but we got to admit some of those teams got no business in there and when you go from editor for anything could happen again even though the Ford\nTop forty could lose as well why don't we turn now to recall for re I think they could beat Notre Dame and\nNo matter I I'm a broken record but one out uh with the playoffs or reveal coming out in two weeks these rankings are are irrelevant they're just they're just a barometer right now but they don't mean very much and the reason I said that it was two weeks ago Auburn\nWas in the top eight ... on the top eighty right now [noise] Morgan is up next a hey Morgan good afternoon\nBaytown from a ham how are you I'm well thank you uh\nIf I promise not to ever murder store is there any way I could buy a

you can't teach you\nTeach your kid to play with heart unless you've got a heart and\nDon't even think the coach has heart or I'm I'm Sorry\nAnd more and more you know first of all a talk of I'll be happy to sign your book and maybe John can get Wayne Woodrow a haze loves a blow to biography for you\nOne more time one more thing in August still writing checks to cheers\n... [laughter] I don't know what\n\nManchester brought\nThe route is president either did you guys get anything for being ready you know\nI'm feeling very ready today you miss the Lance call your since I'm sure he's still listening watching I was just making a point\nI thought that Florida would have lost at tiger stadium and he told me I was an Indian\nSurrogate whereas nobody Florida does anything wrong I mean is is he loves the first half on Saturday especially yeah that was how you know manage this you know he he has his niche\nYou give them the boys Paul well that's what the shows about about the gas is about to call that you do so so he's right my answers right nobody else he is you know we know the whole scale but we ... we could probably wait for that game that's it's a week author or\nA little bit deeper 'cause uh I Do want to ask you Greg about the first the quarterback situation at Georgia there's now a lot of back and forth about what Kirby's march or should not have done Saturday your thoughts\nI've watched I've watched Jake from for two years now and have been very impressed\nBy everything that he's done and still\nFeel quite strongly that he gives them the best chance to be successful I really do because I went back and I studied every single throw the Justin feels may not had a chance to last time last week and I get a little crazy when it comes to quarterback play I went back and I watched Justin Fields and I watch him go through his progression and he's just a step late\nOn just about every throw it takes them just to have second too long before he cuts\nYes yeah he's a great athlete and he will have an opportunity at some point whether it's in this season or in the spring what have you to compete and show that he's capable of handling that job but based on the seven game sample size that we have and all the plays in the throes of decisions that he's made he is not yet\nCapable of running this team as efficiently as Jane from is\nHaving said all that let's go figure that is that not the answer you want to or Georgia I well I think I Know what's been the conversation today well it's it's it's been a lot of that but fans are are going to react um\nAnd you you've given us a sound reason unlike anything I've offered\nOr anyone else was always the quarterbacks fall right like if you are winning and the ... a quarterbacks roll right if you're not playing well the quarterback is clearly the reason why and if you actually watch I I Would take exception a little bit to the game plan that they rolled out there\nThat they abandoned the downhill rushing attack and got a little bit too perimeter heavy\nAnd the game and he got a force feed that and that's who you are I give you watch\nRefused to say that as an example text say them on Saturday and the first three quarters of that football game really the first two and a half quarters against South Carolina they didn't run the ball that well especially up inside but they stuck to it they committed to it and those three are runs in the first two and a half quarters became six yards around you\nAnd the final quarter and a half or so and I thought they abandoned that just a little quick and the situation in the game would dictate that when you're down that and then he points against the quality defense so\nI'm not just a tough game for George and just to just an average outcome outcome and uh it was kind of slipping away in that direction for a little while but you shouldn't just playing the quarterback the office of line has a lot to do with it the running game or the inefficiencies there have a lot to do with it as well\nMarcus how ... how is LSU pulled the season off so far apart\nYou know we talked about I thought they would be better than we thought but we looked at their schedule and was like man this is\nThis this is murderers row when you think about what they had coming up\nThe the one thing I think they did in the offseason power they address the line of scrimmage and you know how I Am when it comes to your office in defense of learn\nUm the reason Florida BTLS shoes because their lines of scrimmage perform outperform LSU and then you saw this past Saturday the same thing transpire would this game against Georgia with that being said Joe borough has been the difference I mean he's been the shot in the ... needed\nNot from a ... and I was talking earlier it's not it's not garde numbers is not hasn't been conversation or even SEC player to your offensively\nHe's a he's a gamer is nothing else that are pretty are really can say about him other than when you when you're in the situation that trend um mine is last week when he threw it in a stepson he owned that\nBut when you when Joe borough has the ball at LSU needs a drive\nThe confidence for the other team around him is that they will get it done and I'm not sure if that really was at LSU the last three or four years we're having a guy behind centered at everybody on the team could look at it and say if we give them a chance we got a chance to win the game\nAnd ah I thought he performed well he's making really good decisions with the football as well so\nHe's been the story of the year for el issue but from a football standpoint the line of scrimmage for el issue is is a lot better than it was because we talk so much about the quarterback position\nAt LSU LSU was getting dominated the line of scrimmage and and that's just not the case uh so far this year [noise] Greg\n... goes on this is probably not the most the most of the game of the year but in\nOf our recipe for an offense that struggling for all of you know I'm a bath at it\nIt's funny we having that conversation 'cause we help Saturday on ... ... the second half team what did I say ball besides destroying them up and say well you're thinking about so it it it is it is they have not identified who they are off into ... and\nI could see fans frustration from that standpoint but the office of land is is is a is a bad problem I mean I'll watch Tennessee Tennessee pressure drifted I'm an entire game\nEven on the roads that he made and they were able to complete that was the guys in his face guys around and that's one part of it and then but for me you know I don't understand\nWhy this friendship and then there's the feds has become what they make up\n... it seems like a ton more central way that's where I was going it seems like a of a very I\nI Know at times when you lose games they can be depleting they can deflate you as a foot in the locker room when when the defense is is is up here the officers here and then finally returned ... is is is\nIs it can get rough it can get bad you have those conversations look everybody is there to win\nRight and and you get to a level of frustration and I'm sure now that has spilled over losing the Tennessee but there is a disconnect on this football team for sure between the players between the coaches\nI still don't want to believe that ... this bad like your record stay as what you are but author looks bad Islam as to Tennessee and yeah and I hardly a that close\nOr no bearing on us performance though is coming for a while tendencies all fence was getting ready to ... like you you got the sense that that was where they were in our into the impression I got to give them some credit and Auburn back to the issue at hand though\nThat yes they can boil over I was on the team that are often struggled in the month of October and in two thousand nine and the defense carry the load and we won the game against tendency twelve ten\nAnd it it's one thing to be in a slum but another thing to be completely and that then with the exception of the Alabama State game\nOne game have you looked at from Auburn this year and said that all fences rolling okay aren't going to pass other mess Arkansas on paper these four thirty four points you had two hundred twenty five hours of office you know again sorry ... who's not a bad defense but certainly not\nAn elite defense so I look at Auburn and what's starting to bother me a little bit they do that little huddle\nAnd they bring it to the line of scrimmage and they're getting an overload information and we all know where the ball's do like it's the same tricks that we've seen for the last decade\nFrom Auburn at some point we need to see some tendency breakers like we need to see for instance there was one play I was looking at\nThey had five defensive\nLine or five defensive players in the front seven on the left side of the center they had to on the right side of the center all we all know ... Oh yes I Wonder what they ran ran left yeah because that's what was called and they had a jet sweet this way and they were going to hand it back to the left hand side\nThey didn't have just like the model huddles great but there are things that you can do built within the office by looking back to the sideline are allowing your quarterback the check to get you in the best possible sometimes I feel like they're so insistent on trying to trick\nThe opposition they don't always give themselves the best chance to be successful and at some point you have to evaluate\nEnd to bridge to your point and and what we talked about a little bit Paul is when\nI was only got used to have employers that could overcome that\nHe doesn't have that this year I'm sure ... like if you are to talk to ... miles on a chip Lindsey or somebody within it all fits this game they'll say well we're doing pretty much the same thing we were doing last year\nAnd it's not players overcompensate you'd think it'd be I mean I'm just like beating a dead horse by saying it but think about the guys that were in that bag field that could overcome you not being in the best situation\nJim Cheney ... yeah well not now from like I I think he's from ... well the beach from but if he feels then they think they have to respect\nFeels like they were they from like why pay bills out at that point when they start with ... and feel Holyfield is how we start we bring the ball down as well\n\nBut then after that happens you get from back in and\nGive it to Harry and our third string renting it makes no\n[noise] I'm going to tell you right away I Can't wait another day Amanda\nYet though\n[laughter] I was scared of that those are the lyrics from the song from the seventies um\nThe would that be Waylon Jennings and well he's got a yeah a lot\nMore thinking of the the I think the Boston or rendition merger I'm Amanda thanks for the call uh I think Greg Greg has his opinion about fields um I I frankly would have made the move myself but I don't study tape I just give opinions yard is up next to John go right ahead\nPaul Paul and when you were speaking with for one quick last week I really enjoy the commentary and reminding me of an old story thank you run run the coach for thirty six\nYear old yeah I Do remember the state of Illinois to hear from you about the way\nAnd I'm worth a drink relays and boy there's\n... wherever I I used to be addressed\nI Wonder just so we're in the ... and John Mitchell and LOU LOU gaining from Georgia John Mitchell from Alabama and I used to sit together\nAnd said the John I said John why did you leave Kansas which was a great top notch program to go to Alabama he said well let me tell you a little bit of a story behind the scenes Richmond flowers was the attorney general served in the state of Alabama in the late sixties\nAnd he had a son Christian flowers junior who was a fantastic football player\nAnd also raised burglar well he wound up going to Tennessee and no one can believe it but but to Richmond said was well I wanted to run track in football and Alabama's football pro program was really non existent\nSo what happened was there Brian came in and said we're not going to lose another foot tall prospect 'cause we don't have track and field\nSo we're going to go out and hire the best track coach we can put money in that program and make it work then of course it did but I thought well it's amazing how one sport especially football can influence what's going on in the athletic program\nIn ... by the way John ah I happen to know or or or or new uh Richmond fairly well and his father ah was very famous I'm In a movie was a TV movie was ultimately made about that and there there are there may have been a little more to uh\nHim going to Tennessee than than just the tracker although you're right that was a part of it but the but it's very humid you maybe it shouldn't digging that up uh because uh that uh\nThey had a lot to do with the civil rights movement at the time and uh the feud between Richmond flowers senior and the former governor George Wallace\n[noise] yes I I knew a little bit about that too and I think you're really right Paul because uh Richmond flowers was a real when he was ahead of his time as far as dealing as an advocate for all the citizens of the state of Alabama\nYeah no but it's a fascinating story and I remember talking to both ah both Richmond ah junior and senior many years ago a but a John Mitchell was a it was an amazing athlete the thank you John always a pleasure to hear from your always\nI'd ever de Paul love your show\nThank you so much great to hear from a someone with that type of a historical perspective Bobby is up next Bobby go right ahead\nOr like you said Powell I thank you for Kelly or taking my call thank you\nAnd uh I just wanted to\nTalk about the Florida game I mean I Know where he will leave one or the Georgia game but I wanted to talk about the Florida game I ah had reservations when we went to Florida or about that in the cause of the injuries that we had on or off and said blind we had\nPlayers that were playing a let's just say they were in jury injured but they were able to play but you know if you play at the fans like Florida hero quarter to a half step slow because with an injury that's going to create a problem for you\nAnd I thought he would and it did we also had our number to tackle or\nThey didn't even playing that game and one of our basketball on the hill didn't play so we were playing at full strength when we bought\nAnd I think it show as a bad or good\nUh [noise] they took advantage of it was\nPart of a supportive athletics [noise] tendencies and taking advantage of the others deficiencies a thank you very much for the call Mike

you're going to get a bunch of retractions a bunch of corrections a bunch of changes but but the the most up around it really is kind of David ... they do this in the morning knowing it's going to get all the steam that they wanted to get them to read you know the ... the changes of the stories with the corrections won't get anywhere near the eyeballs right\nSince the outcomes become president we've had about I don't know you know a thousand big giant breaking story is I Would say that Ninety nine percent of them turned out our last in the opposite of what story\nYou know it was saying it's true you know so I saw this I assume that I should take it easy it would have the power you know take my time went into it and the thing is is I think since they have a Supreme Court thing\nThe media has taken sort of a heart for enforced by if I were a quarter weeding the story out as if it was some sort of indication of war and and that Donald Trump or some sort of racist about that and a\nAnd a correction team so slow and many of these reporters haven't even sort of taken his back and they just retreated it in the morning and then we find out that it's not that so\nIt's really I mean I think it's actually helpful that we see these reporters are now about Twitter is really help to to you know let allow us to see a more transparent bias on an orange or about you know these are ... but uh\nYou know it's just the same thing over and over again\nThat you and I have talked many times a day with our son he's senior editor over the federal is and I made my living as a as a reporter as a journalist for a long time as a TV news anchor and I tried to do the job the best way I could down the middle of I've also found journalists are not stupid\nThey're not dumb people don't realize that Kavanaugh has been the opposite effect of what they thought it would have don't they realize that fake news as the opposite effect the more they get what little conservatives and Republicans generally speaking go to work\nPay attention to that their their paychecks are pretty good right now the taxes are low right now that can go out to even go buy stuff at the corner store\nAnd they probably would not have been as engaged in the terms don't these journalists realize that they're actually empowering and re engaging people who otherwise might have ignored it [noise]\nWell I think in the law in the moment\nI think they have in in liberalism grasses and I I mean that it has all the ... you know is that they don't really think about thinking through in that way and their their objective was simply I think that ... as long as you obviously stop having all the other is near him\nOr in the third one was to de legitimize the core meaning once he's on the court they say is or you know the sexual assault or this and that and go and they don't have to follow\nThe opinions of the court so I think they weren't thinking about long term political uh you know blowback from that they're just thinking about it in the moment like shoulder frankly and I have a active\nWhen you're banging on the door of the Supreme Court when you're stopping people from eating at a restaurant or acting like a bunch of children except that it can get violent and dangerous in the long\nYeah H David our son he going to follow him on Twitter and go read everybody did but he does\nOr if you were advising Elizabeth Warren I Know ... the thought but if you were advised her we would have told her just to forget this\nLet Trump keep on looking like the bully every time he calls her Pocahontas she can play the victim at least on the left that's what they like to do why would she come out and act like this was a vindication like she shut him up because now she'll even dumber than she did this morning [noise]\nI think you're right I I mean she she could have said lucky such a bully is making fun of India and blah blah blah instead now she looks small and petty and she you know and she's given all his ammunition to Donald Trump so I don't know why she did it\nI'm I suspect what she thought what happened was that the media was block and run for her and don't dare try that\nAnd that you know it would just divide among the usual lines in the lab with supporter but in the end I I have a feeling that it's going to be our last this sort of real hardcore identity politics spoke we're going to bring her down because of this I think a is just so transparently fraudulent\nThat uh that she's going to pay a price and the ... not just the right but when it's all said and done\nIt David is it your opinion that she's actually the heir apparent on the left because I'm looking in Massachusetts specifically she might not win re election [noise]\nShe is not very likeable when you get it up close look I Know I I don't think she's going to listen if you're going to go socialist you get a whole socialist right in ... I don't I don't really see her lane hurts your I mean I've been wrong about this before you never know how these people are fickle and people are we are voters are weird but\nI just don't see a land for her I think it's all taken off so I don't I don't think she's going to have much success but who knows\nBut ... I'll ask you a follow up then why does she think she is she's been astronaut has been running for the past two and a half years I mean I I how does somebody like walk around look at the mirror and say yeah I'm an ex president and here's why there's I I have no here's why I came through in the blink well\nWe get I think we can all agree that many politicians have masses egos and they see they moved to the way we do so uh I'm sure she thinks very highly of herself and she just sort of worst kind of kind of\nCause I stayed at socialist because she looks like the kind of bureaucrat over ... service
