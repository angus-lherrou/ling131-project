of fact decker goes being overweight increases your risk of developing breast cancer is that a myth or a fact\nThat is indeed a fact a ... a weight is one off our breast cancer risk factors and so\nThe more we can do to keep a weight down the better it is so actual management off that and eating healthy with regular and regular exercise when we say eating healthy it's actually cutting down on fat intake I Would definitely be a risk factor reduction and regular exercise\nUm the other thing that will help but as a watching the alcohol intake um because access to alcohol intake is a risk factor for breast cancer also\nSo we we have the obesity family history obviously ages you get older you're more likely to get breast cancer alcohol sedentary lifestyle their misses me\nSounds like what a lot of our expert guess to a lesser [laughter] I've\nWritten for a lot of and yes I Would lay let's talk about the different types of breast cancer because I Know there are several different ones can you outline that for\nSure the breast cancer marker it's kind of help identify what kind of cancer is these are so um we have what is based on the location of the abnormality we can call it breast cancer can be ... or ... cancers\nA but in general what we're finding is that the biology matters and that tumors that are estrogen receptor positive\nEstrogen approaches strong receptive positive or hurt too positive or negative for each of these markets\nKind of identified what type of tumor this is so an estrogen positive project trying positive hurt too negative the breast cancer differ from her too positive breast cancer and as different also from what is called the triple negative breast cancer\nAnd the treatment for those is different than that we really loves to board and\nThat's exactly right because now biology is what drives to cancer treatment so it's very individualized to the type of cancer the person has so if a woman has an extradition positive cancer there are medications that go after the estrogen receptor\nAnd the patient has a hurt too positive breast cancer we have targeted therapy for the hurt too positive to see\nWhat ... what are ways that has come I mean I'm not a breast cancer survivor but I Will meet women who are thirty or forty or cancer survivors and back then there was like one treatment and that was it is that right\nThat is exactly right I mean initially it was women with breast cancer had the option of mastectomy removal of all lymph nodes and when chemo came into being everybody got that chemotherapy but\nResearchers who have really advanced to understand number one is that what is the biology of these cancers and then based on the biology try to find targeted treatments that work well and so even conditions such as triple negative breast cancer at one point these with diseases which were hard to treat\nAnd now we're coming up with new or therapies um managed by our our special oncologist who come and\nCreate a treatment that is very specific for the patient\nYou know what I forgot what are the risk factors what is a little bit ... radio show which includes you because you had to pull but when you were a kid or\nVery much so yeah that's why I bypass all those other things that goes straight to the um All right\nThat's right I mean these kind of exposure to radiation therapy to the breast region does increase one's future risk of breast cancer usually we say about eight years out from the radiation the woman should be you're having yearly screening mammography and MRIs\nAlright genetic testing confusing subject what tests are available and who walked or be genetically tested\nSo when we talk about women with a family history of breast cancer\nUm you're always trying to understand anybody who has a family history we're trying to understand based on the family history is there evidence to suggest that this family maybe a family of carrying a gene genetic abnormality that puts them at increased risk\nWhat we used to know really it was the are the one NBRC it to a two genes associated with very high risk of breast and ovarian cancer\nAs information has evolved as gene testing has become more available and knowledge has increased we have found that there are other genes also that may be associated with breast cancer\nSo what does a woman do typically what we say is that if you have a family history discuss with your physician let ... plan that shouldn't let them know that this is what my family history is and it's not only breast cancer if you have a family history of breast ovarian colon cancer males with prostate cancer melanoma\nUm and even pancreatic cancer these me all the Lincoln really any cancer ... seek help from your clinician so that then we can say does this patient qualified to be sent for gene testing now usually what we prefer is that when there is a family history like that\nWhich they meet with a genetics counselor seek the expert opinion\nAnd then they can guide you as to what is your likelihood of carrying a gene mutation and that guides what kind of testing to be done\nAnd depending on how you test and you can give a woman advice about what you ought to do whatever frequently she ought to be tested et cetera\nThat's exactly right there are very clear guidelines that a woman who carries a beer or see one or two gene mutation\nWould benefit from MRI in addition to mammography and the timing of initiating the treatment generally we start MRI at age twenty five foot bracket carriers and then at age thirty we add memorable graffiti for these ... carriers\nThen at some point when they're finished it child bearing earlier that is some around thirty five to forty years usually close to forty we start talking about risk reducing surgery so again I'm a very important for these patients to be in touch with experts\nAre rated as breast cancer awareness month with the most important thing you want women to\nBe aware be familiar with your breath seek medical attention if you haven't noticed any changes [noise]\nAsk your doctor about going in for a mammogram be an advocate for yourself\nJust like Dr seuss [laughter] stuff because they go to the rest of his or her for the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota Dr ... thank you John Tracy it's been a troubling become a Mayo Clinic radio we'll discuss treatment for low back pain and later on in the world where the importance of strictly for the women\nThat uh if we put ice on it to reduce inflammation from an injury well that's not necessarily going to help the low back because the the cold from the ice doesn't get deep enough to affect the physiology\nDown around this fine and the same way with heat the heat doesn't get down there far enough and so it's probably affecting the nerves and the muscles that it can penetrate more than anything else in affecting\nThe pain that way certainly ice or heat can reduce or some pain and it can help with muscle ... some of your having spasm\nBut I Can't tell you that there's a right and wrong application of ice and heat in that situation if it's a cute I Would go with the ice first I Am I at first\nAnd when you say ... what do you mean by ... laid out her bet\nNo arrest has relative rest and we know that if you lay in bed for three days it's going to be more damaging than helpful or when we lay down we lose muscle mass will leave lose bone density and it doesn't take very long and not being active before those things can become measurable\nShow arrest is reducing your activities to the point that you're not making yourself miserable as the way I explained it to my patients\nIt's not likely you're going to do additional damage unless you have like pain numbness in tingling down your leg where you probably have a pinched nerve if it's back pain I Would do whatever I can reasonably do without making myself miserable and I would expect things to get better\nOver a course of a week or maybe two weeks sometimes\nTreatment night me my favorite and a size ... what else\nThere is evidence\nBut for back pain none of the evidence is strong ...\nWhether it be a the anti inflammatory medicines or spinal manipulation such as a chiropractor physical therapist might provide are massage acupuncture or tai chi or yoga there's some evidence for most of these things but the evidence is not strong for any of it\nAnd that's why we have so many different treatments that people get to choose from\nOf one of my my friend Scott hauled him in\nA wrote an article a few years ago and they described it like going through the back pain supermarket you can just pick things off the shelves that you wanted to try and that's because none of them work wonderfully show as far as what is best in your case I Would say what's worked in the past\n... what do you tolerate what are you willing to do but not only can you do those past things you have to do smack things you have to keep moving with relative or a story\nAbout prevention of you are hearing about that and then we don't have to worry about all those options\nNow that would be wonderful if we can prevent all this from a half from occurring to begin with again we don't have good studies that tell us that we can prevent back pain we know that we can prevent episodes of back pain at times and the only thing it has strong of answers exercise\nNone of the rest of the treatments are we to can really prevent pain\nAnd ah there are certain factors do risk factors that we can alter if you smoke stop smoking because smoking nicotine effects the blood supply to the dust that outside of the desk\nAnd uh the small poor to go in and out of the disc from the the bone and it can increase just a generation if you're overweight if you lose weight it's probably going to help [noise]\nUh if you don't exercise that's a risk factor being sedentary is a risk factor in were more sedentary now in our society than we've probably ever been in the past\nAnd that's probably one of the run of the reasons that there's so many people who suffer for back pain yeah obesity problem yeah how many of us are thirty pounds overweight\nSo carry a thirty pound backpack around and see what the difference it makes it a little bit of course to a slow we don't think of it over time but if it occurs quickly then you become very aware that\nThis is a stress in my back doesn't need\nRight well common problem low back pain unfortunately we don't have all the answers but they are some things that you can do to prevent it Dr update physical medicine and rehabilitation\nSpecialist as another name for that take so much for being with us we're going to take a short break and when we come back we'll learn about the importance of strength training

how we're getting becoming so prone to try and and just like you said shove so much stuff in there there's only so much bandwidth until you can't take any more and maybe part of the reason that people have trouble remembering things\nIs ... think about it on our cell phones we don't have to remember the numbers right we used to memorize everybody's phone number all these digits all these things memorize and now you just have to look it up and and hit a name if you want to remember facts I get to Google it\nSo we've almost crippled our style crutches or yeah so we're not using our brain I Would\nArgue I mean I agree with you I Do agree with you to a large degree I could argue also argues that you've relieved yourself of having to remember the minutia that allows the brain tend to explore other areas and maybe have a broader with Anna Marie right now\nI don't have to take up that data space with phone numbers I can use it to remember the other thing that the scientists physiologist and says you know memories are made by hormonal imprinting and now that physiologic changes that take place so just reading something is not going to\nTrigger that memory respond okay only a little fear like I'm studying for that they test the final two quarters all adrenaline going you know and then he asked me to make you remember better I'd check up on caffeine little fear of toys good\nFor you [laughter] well not always [laughter] than than out much right okay so I'm going to ask you are you a are you more likely to remember something you read something you heard or something you saw\nMine is visual um so I had a patient they were talking about it that uh\nI'm going to class and they actually she does better if she she's older she's a you know she's not as a kid but\nUh so that's the way she and I want you to a lesser degree we're all taught as of his classroom stuff so you know when they talk about new today's online schools are like when I have to do continuing education it's on line [noise]\nBy nine seven forty two Ninety eight book your phone retreat now see retreat at ... dot com\nTwo hours of beauty conversation foreigners Sunday\nFor a nation

down to just study angle gene that Iran or is a key step and sell aging and we're just going to turn it off and you'll be useful forever okay [laughter]\nWell see they couldn't publish it if it wasn't true out of the entire Internet full of stuff that's not true but the real\nOne gene triggers a key step and ... published June twenty fifth of Eighteen a is at the University of buffalo and the scientists have identified a protein on the cell membranes that they refer to as CD thirty six\nAnd a just in a nutshell what they did is I took this chemical and if they put it in a petri dish or to cells\nAre basically uh started the aging process so that started the cells aging if they were held so you know the big problem is are are healthy normal cells age but cancer cells don't age\nSo this holds a couple of opportunities one is they could use is induce aging in cancer cells yeah make them more susceptible to treatment to help cure cancers\nAnd the other is it offers the you could slow down the aging process but interestingly that even when the cells were exposed when they added other cells to the culture\nThat hadn't been exposed to it they started age to even the protein already been taken up so it's almost like it was a viral deal so it's like oh crap all you have to have is one cell that decides who wants to age and everything goes to hell and a half as good\nBut they're starting this is you know we've talked about this for years we have the technology is the treatments now to slow the aging process down eventually we'll get to the point where we literally can shut it off and uh you know you can see the aging for the most part it's thirty five forever\nI Want to be thirty five for him but anyway as we got a grand gas coming up right now and African currency author of the book cracking the study showed a hundred and one kitchen techniques to raise your grades and test scores he has been a life long students as anybody can memorize anything remember step it's got to be this guy\nBecause he actually has a is empty from Harvard Medical school\nConnecticut then and master of science regulatory signs or San Diego State University and then general surgery on him John hopkins university and the list goes on and on I mean I can sit here and talk about your doctor ... hours because you just have such an amazing by now and I'm so excited you're on the show with us today\nHow it's going to go out much been fun already listening very interesting that I got to get that thing [laughter]\nThirty six is like where I got away as\nLong as you want to block already go a little bit already do very well yeah\n[laughter] so okay I'm going to ask you first why do you decide to write this book cracking if any can answer that but also why memory tiny are saying\nWell I I wrote a book about\nUm I work a lot with kids in a volunteer program involved with a lot of US marine corps has a voluntary program during the summertime uh I'm I'm I'm not a millionaire explain but I work with kids aged fourteen to Seventeen and pull up to recap Palin and I've been giving talks to them about\nUm how to build character how to do better in school and it sort of inspired me to go back and look at all the ways that I improved my own grades I used to be a football player for a short period of time\nI always dreamed of being a doctor but a football scholarship out of area like a ... grade average I and I transferred the University of California Berkeley I knew I'd never make it if I didn't get my grades up so I went on this fanatical campaign\nStudy using every technique I could think of and I always managed to get virtually straight A's and get into Harvard Medical school and now years later I decided to put it all together in this book to help kids they don't have to do what I did a couple of an addict\nBut if they just use a few of the things in their their grades will go up but I think that the school system I don't think is teaching kids how to study they want them to study but I don't think there's a special place where they could share them here's how you study and here's how you train your memory also that's the key to linkage between\nYour topic on memory and this book which is\nYou can train your memory the way you train your body for sports the way you train your mind for any skill\nI think it's not well understood that memory as a training process and any a memory athlete so called memory of that will tell people they have a normal average memory but they trained it to a high level that as the optimism we want to get kids and adults\nWhich is no matter where you are in a life no matter how you feel about your memory you can always train it to improve it and um and that's the message of the book\nAnd we see these guys come on and you know they can memorize your car or a deck of cards right right and and the other guys I think you're referencing and say you know my memory is any better than yours that just learn to train themselves throw a\nStone before an intro that you know I my practices every day I Try to memorize license plates on the way into the office just the right or a little bit\nAnd so I I agree with you I think you can bring that up I tell patients to memorize Bible verses or a poem or something that you know to use it or lose just like any athletic skill\nDo you remember Lucy Lucy I tell you this current she was my best friend she died just shining hiring for but we go to the grocery store and she just like to give me some of the main I gave her name she ran off their phone number and I mean she can rattle off homes and all this stuff that she every day\nWe're trying to test her brain do you think that we should be testing our brains a little bit more tendons only\nYou know right now you test your brain only if you have a test or somebody else wants to see even member something that should we be self caffeine herself\nWas really fascinating topic that you bring up because I'm here's the situation where the memory of modern modern people don't need to use their memory that's a big problem because we have all these electronic\nAnd damned tired ... it's about these ... desire for each of these problems are eating putting many relationships endanger\nYou'll be happy to learners and exciting natural solution available biology your body reduces important hormone production each

survival\nAnd it's always changing and um to get a memory to stay the way it is is over every time you bring it up it's\nProne to change and that's when there's nothing wrong with that just people have to recognize that even hold grudges let's say from past emotional events bicycle or something I mean it may be completely wrong about what happened because every time you remember the auto its\nOwn little like even that is is almost pointless in a way\nI think you you're watching current event [laughter]\nYeah I Am actually is a fascinating thing about it because\nEverybody wants to be politically correct and all that but this is an interesting situation because um they're actually well we could talk about things such as people being convicted and going to lead a execution who've been wrongfully convicted on eyewitness accounts\nAnd I think about ... percent of people executed or whatever innocent\nSo under a severe emotional episode you can fix and memory in your mind is completely wrong and this is a well known fact and it's interesting that and I don't want to get into you know\nIt is\nThis does point out the problem of cooperation you see it\nAnd the question is how is collaborated where's the evidence for it and of course that's different than a political issue which I don't want to go into a very important fact that I Wish to count the matter who it is prone to air because memories prone to Arab because we are not videotape recorders\nA senior biologic system I should have been better educated\nWhen I was in high school cause I could've used some of these is defenses when my mother was accusing me of things and I said no no that's the memory I had I was under duress and that changed it versus we've got ya\nOkay and the other hand I mean alcohol can modify member yeah forty channel you know the alcohol or not is right\nCan modify memory so what this means is whoever testified that somebody did something to me and they were under the influence of alcohol at let's say there were a teenager drinking a beer or whatever and the person to show somebody ... how do you how can you say that members accurate if they're on the show again\nUh I wouldn't ... couch a but anyway let's get away from that on to the fact that people age\nWe're always worried about their memory they worry about recall function they worry about how fast they can

I'm not sure what I mean [laughter]\nI I really don't know ah ah well I think\nYou can you sometimes you can go through a lot of Cairo journey is what he said yeah you're you're there you go through a

you in one for me it was on yeah which was actually the tax rate at the time you know and I\nThink the but\nIf you look at his demeanor and the way ... is actually taught I think he was on chemical things where he said a couple of things and listening to him it was like I was like if you don't look at the video you're like is that Congress talking because his demeanor\nWas calm and straight to the point\nThat wasn't the Taylor Swift moment that wasn't that it wasn't the moment ah after Katrina the George Bush um it wasn't that\nIt was something that the content of the comment really couldn't be debated by the left so what do they do\nWell to go to the labeling in the name calling and then you know all of a sudden will now he's crazy which means he's not capable of making a thought at all you know this goes beyond the Mia Love thing\n\nOr you know and and the comments were all over the place you know the the token comment a from a Thursday or you know to the

happen and that's essentially the point the county I made on ...\nYou know this this is ridiculous that someone can't think independently but they've got they got to be a part of groupthink I mean imagine Trump had said that\nThey will be done that\nNot that all blacks think alike but they should think alike politically it would be over CNN would have a twenty four hour special report on

I don't believe that uh you know popular opinion or you know you should a substitute for\nUh the presumption of innocence and due process and I started thinking about it when you know you and I I said\nThe last hour the the one thing that I got out of the whole Kevin all thing is the Democrats were trying to sell us that if you believed in due process and the mindset of due process and that the accusation alone isn't enough and you disagreed with them with this message think about this\nBut if you don't believe the accuser no matter what\nIf you believe that not the allegation but the evidence is what should be the determining factor then you are an enabler\nThat's what they were trying to sell us think about that and that's why after ... when he said you know he's voting because of that\nThat I started thinking just in our popular culture that all the different lawyer shows from Perry Mason to matlock to law and order from it because I think law and order started what an eighty nine or\n... I yes Eighteen eighty nine [laughter]\nBefore TV so much but you you think of all the lawyer shows out there uh-huh right for that and and so when we talk about the fact of the\nIgnorance of the American public ignorance does not mean stupid\nNow the Democratic leadership may think people are stupid we believe people may be uninformed we don't believe people are stupid and never had a ... have ignorance simply means you lacked the fax it doesn't mean that you can't understand the facts and you can go search for the facts or that you're dumb it simply means you don't have the facts but whatever reason\nYes I I Will say I do believe some people are stupid like those Republicans who made my taxes go up\n[laughter] than that of the [laughter] other than there were no problem with them [laughter] you know we have a problem with who have a problem we have a problem with everybody let's be honest oh trust me\nBut and and and so but but think about this ... the Democrats are trying to sell to the American public after how many decades of television shows pounding lawyer shows at odds over and over again where it has become\nAbsolutely crystal clear to any American out there you need evidence before you and convict somebody they're saying no that think about that that's their biggest push going into an election mid term election\nIs the fact that no no evidence doesn't matter only the allegation matters evidence doesn't matter really\nThat's what you're trying to sell the American public\nAnd that's why when the last caller just the way that just the way that he explained it\nThat no you you don't go public opinion doesn't decide public opinion does not decide\nThe guilt or innocence of anybody it's the evidence it's ... and ... and so everybody everybody should get

pass it along to the consumer\n... plain and simple [noise]\nAh this news item the co founder of the opposition research from behind the Steele dossier Ga for those of you that are brand new listeners\nWill do it very quickly because we we can do it very quickly an update you so you understand completely what we're talking about uh the Democrats accused the Trump or the campaign of colluding with the Russians\nTo hack and or change the outcome of the election ... the evidence we have found out is it's just the opposite the DNC and the Hillary campaign\nPaid a law firm ... who paid and opposition research from a ... a fusion GPS who paid the former British spy Christopher Steele who got\nOr information he says from the Russians close to the Kremlin in order to change the outcome of the election by getting unverified salacious allegations against Donald Trump\nThat they were going to use to kill his campaign and when they couldn't do that they wanted to use in order to destroy the legitimacy of the twenty sixteen election they also use that information\nAs a basis to get a secret warned against the Trump campaign while the campaign was actually going so you know you see fusion GPS was a part of it well\nThe co founder of the opposition research from Glen Simpson will invoke his first and Fifth Amendment privileges to avoid testifying before Congress next week his lawyer has told Congress\nAccording to the hill Simpsons attorney told house a judiciary chairman Bob Goodlatte the Simpson will not appear for a deposition because the congressional investigation is not designed to discover the truth\nReally know the average Virginia Republican subpoenaed Simpson on September twenty nine\nSolitaire early for an interview before members of the house judiciary and the house oversight and Government Reform committees Simpsons from a fusion GPS was hired during the twenty sixteen presidential campaign bottle law firm that represented the DNC and the Clinton campaign\n... fusion GPS hired former British spy Christopher Steele\nTo conduct an investigation into Donald Trump's possible links to Russia the result of the probe was eight thirty five page report alleging collusion between the Trump campaign and the Kremlin Republican lawmakers are interested in the CIA\nLargely because the FBI reportedly relied on the unverified documents to obtain surveillance warrants against former Trump campaign adviser Carter Page so of course a lawyer is going to say you're not trying to get to the truth\nWell then what does the lawyers say they're trying to find here's I either get are they going to ask are they going to ask him about his personal taxes I don't think so right are are they going to ask him about a ...\nWho he believes is the best running back ever and the national football league if you are listening earlier to the show you understand why I brought that up\nUh I don't think so what are they going to ask him up on me I Would begin to ask him about Kanye West [laughter] probably not they're probably going to ask him about fusion GPS and\nTheir role or in the uh entire flow chart of the Democrats and the Hillary campaign colluding with the Russians to change the outcome of the election\nSo here's my question thinking a of a fusion GPS Bruce or his wife was employed at fusion GPS yes the\nInspector general's office of the department of justice where Bruce or was employed as the and an associate deputy attorney general\nAh the inspector general would have then access to any communications if they're still there between Bruce or and his wife if there were any to begin with and if they're still they're\nInspector general gets them for the asking\nA does he\nOh he but he yes from the department of justice yes yes yes because because they were done internally yesterday right on right on unofficial yes device from the department and I and then again if those are the ... that's the number of it\nRight away from the point being is that you look at all the in this case basically it's a it's a block because your GPS doesn't want to cough up the truth they have no interest in doing that\nBut how so how how would you find it otherwise well part I Would think part of that would be looking into Bruce or his involvement with a you know it\nProfessionally possibly with his wife and if there were were any communications I think the number one thing you would do the first thing you you would do as you would look to see if there were any communications during that time and if they were on a those devices if they're still\nIn any way we we know you have the you know you have the right to claim the fifth mhm yes I have to incriminate yourself yes and we understand than what I Would wonder is a blend Simpsons lawyer ... what is he worried about if they\nMhm that the house Judiciary Committee\nAnd the house oversight committee aren't trying to get to the truth right then I Would ask ... lawyer then what do you think they're going after right\nIf they're not well look at ... ... is is part of what they hypothetically as part of what they are concerned with is the same thing as the Mueller investigation\nThe Mueller investigation has had nothing to do with actual Russia collusion with the Trump campaign right so that would be the question are you worried because of where the mother investigations is going is at the same thing might happen to you\nThat there was nothing wrong that you did nothing wrong and I don't know I don't I don't know what I don't see any crime from what I Know\nOf of fusion GPS committed any crimes\nI don't know about I don't know where there was any evidence of it you would uh concerning you know get gathering the information and getting the money for

no right ... doesn't have any rights\nI assume all of the the guns rights when I put it in my cold live fingers right it's the people's right yes\nA very interesting I just want to get to this topic because you happen to bring this up and I didn't know about this many employees on the Las Vegas strip fear being replaced by robots and you were telling me there is actually these and I'm looking at it right now that they've come up with these drink robots that will make bartenders obsolete yes\nAnd you can come as the design I've seen I don't know if this is in place in Vegas just yet\nBut the design of seen also includes you walk up to the kiosk or the chaos cause even embedded into the counter like they do the are they actually have like a a if you go up to a bar in a gambling city ah for those who don't gamble or never been\nWhen you sit at a bar you can get your drinks actually for free if you're gambling and they'll put the right there\nAt the seat there is a video poker thing you can play mhm right by the way the drinks not free [laughter] it'll cost you whatever you lose and video [laughter] to be clear you mean they're not given yeah anything ...\nNow that uh uh just that they don't deserve to buy a bunch of alcohol and lose money on it\nNo I'm the those are the [laughter] getting back to the robot thing I'm hey I'm not sure what the\nStrippers will look like I'm ... but but for the bar it they'll move away from ...\nHome man oh no no no no right now bartenders robot brothels yeah I guess\nBy the way we never really talked about it we didn't talk about Houston didn't we talk about and we did last week of well I mean you know if you think about remember the old but I guess they still have them the coffee vending machine where would make you a cup yeah yeah I always go back to terminate her to the security\nGuard making or it was a cop actually uh that went to make a a cup of coffee didn't work out too well known did as tea to walk up behind them and then became him which was weird but\nYou think about robotics in serving food that's been around for a while but it will be different\nIn a bar like this where you go up and you basically a border it you know and uh you know the type it in a you're going to insert your credit card\nAnd then all of a sudden the drink is going to be made and even delivered to you depending on the set up on the counter ... by automation\nYou know I think John ... a guy who has a pretty good uh business uh or has over the years in Las Vegas and also from uh the the bar rescue\nYou're never going to see a well first of all there's no way to steal from the till I'm not blaming bartenders from for that I'm not condemning all bartenders but that does happen in the business and you know ... caught it\nWhere they were you know skimming or whatever from from the register but even to a greater extent pouring way too heavy\nThey're one but I did here's the other point 'cause I was thinking the same thing I'd asked John tap or how far can you go with the robot bartender ...\nKind of regular Barbie all robots right and just a person walking around or do you have to her is is there a 'cause he talks about the science of a bar mhm and the science of the bar is about people and interaction\nAnd wrote a a a robot can't be pleasant trust me I Know a few of them\nWell a robot also can be angry either right MBA an angry bartender right\nOr can't can't be a drunk bartender [laughter] well that's that but how how far do you go with the science of it you mean I I can see this working totally in a place like Vegas where the focus is gambling not not communicating with the bartender or not walking into your corner bar\nSo my wife and I uh recently went to a place that had\nA robot roulette wheel now we walked by it several times we didn't we didn't look at it\nBecause it was often like they have a a a a what would you say it it's there's there's there's poker and blackjack were you walk up and the screen has\nYou know a dealer but it's it's animated right and so that you know the the whole tables animated the cards were animated well\nOn this roulette that's what I thought I was ... that I thought it was all animated it's actually\nIt's it's an actual wheel in the center and you don't you're not close to every one it's not crowded like a real roulette table\nAnd so we thought okay let's see how this works and it was interesting we played it for a few minutes and it was interesting because I said you know that's that's not the animation thing is still gives you the view of a real roulette wheel right and that's important for a lot of people they don't trust right ... well\nIn in the case of a a a Vegas in in a in a bar setting there's a couple of settings you're going to be a nightclub kind of setting in nightclubs are huge in in Vegas um where they don't care they just want to drink\nIt's not your pub writing where is that where the bartender right things to be pleasant needs to be a companion for and carry maybe a little bit of a conversation on with you in Vegas it's not that\nIt's not that for the most part it's either the gamblers or ah like I said the nightclubs and no one cares anything except about the alcohol when it comes to the bar is all about the alcohol or it'd be interesting to see how far this goes\nI Want to be alive when they come out with the whole version of the robot bartender\n[noise] ah yeah ... you walk in your house and they basically you've got bottles that you insert vodka whatever I mean right ten different types of alcohol that you put in their right and the mixer and everything else and then you just walk into your house\nYou say Alexa give me a screwdriver\nThere you go out and then she hands you affiliates\n[laughter] no life so [laughter] I doubt it oh my God [laughter] and then it's ... alcohol know Alexa drinking out [laughter] hey I Want to get drunk\n[laughter]\nSix six Ninety red eye\nEngine report is brought to

go right off the sun was anywhere but the Florida coastline on Wednesday as hurricane Michael's slammed the shore with nearly category by force beach towns where the hardest hit but the damage from Michael is being felt all the way to the mid Atlantic\nCBS is Omar via Frankel reports from Mexico Beach Florida ground zero for Michael's most devastating impact\nFrom above Mexico beach town of more than one thousand people it looks like it was hit with a bomb\nWorld after row of homes were reduced to rubble\nOvercame Michael one hundred and fifty five miles per hour winds and nearly the foot storm surge level almost everything in its path [noise]\nWe followed first responders as they went door to door for the first time looking for survivors who wrote out the hurricane\nLooked into this crew from Louisiana task force one has worked big storms in the past and Dan Simons says this catastrophic damage looks familiar\nWhat we're standing in right now is what Katrina did to New Orleans\nAnd you know exactly the Lower Ninth ward\nJust over here there's some duplex is homes that foundation but they were just completely pushed off and wrecked a matter of fact the cleanup process of starting over here with these people this way this was ocean front property and these people took the brunt of hurricane Michael though was moving back to work at like\nAnd so that boy like China and Russia but at this point the question as well if it is proven that Saudi Arabia\nIs to fault did actually murder ... shouldn't vis a commitment this military agreement this sale a be in jeopardy and that's what senators are arguing but the White House has yet to say that that would be the case\nAnd there's clearly a difference between how the White House is approaching because she'll be compared to the senator's we heard from from the Foreign Relations committee\nYeah so it's really a disconnect um in terms of how they want to approach the situation the Trump Administration is saying we need to get the facts here yes the Turks say that they have evidence that as you read earlier the Washington Post is reporting that they have\nBoth a video and audio of this murder happening but the U.S does not yet a claim that they believe that that is the case they haven't seen everything lined up that completely proves the allegations that the Turks are making here so yesterday the state department said\nWell well well let's not get ahead of ourselves but not let all these rumors dominate the conversation\nBefore we talk about the repercussions that the Saudis will potentially see\nOn the other side of the coin you have senators on the health saying let's put the threats out there had\nOf what we know happened so that the Saudis know that they can't do this that they can't kill journalist who say bad things about the leadership and Saudi Arabia and get away with it saved two different\nKinds of tactics here and we're going to have to say if the White House um get the hat and starts paying out any threats before a conclusion has come to in this investigation\nAt CBS News State Department reporter currently would there's reaction to this from virgins sir Richard Branson who says he isn't spreading parts of his business with the Saudi kingdom as the investigation into the disappearance of cars show continues\nYou're listening to the CBS News weekend roundup Supreme Court associate justice Brett Kavanaugh hurt his first cases this week on the high court\nAfter bruising confirmation battle that his lip anger and resentment boiling on all sides on this week's edition of the takeout pod Josh CBS News the White House correspondent major Garrett sat down with Republican senator Joni Ernst of Iowa voted in favor of Kavanaugh\nBut I Do think that judge Kavanaugh was eminently qualified I did support him in my vote\nI also do believe that Dr Ford did experience some sort of trauma in her lifetime\nUm I don't believe that was Brett Kavanaugh that perpetrated a that that intimate crime against her but I think she was outed um she wished to remain anonymous\nAnd unfortunately she was outed and she face those same threats against her will be blamed for the housing I work I Do blame the Democratic committee staff\nAnd what do you think their motivation was to help her or dissing too\nI think it was to think Kavanaugh I think they put her feelings of an immunity aside and they were to the wolves and I think by doing that I think they hope to think that Kavanaugh's nomination\nDid you strike you as a reluctant witness once you do to us for ... and you know she did not seem\nTo be reluctance by that point she had already been outed\nAnd I think it was at that point then she was able to make her statement I'm and she did and I think every accuser has the right to be heard I I've been adamant about that for years I did work with sexual assault a survivors back in college so this has been a long standing issue\nFor so looks like a pause give my audience a bit of your ... important to you it's important to services\nAbsolutely so going back to my days at Iowa State university um it was just a a personal decision of mine to volunteer at a women's Chrysler shelter and I worked\nDeeper as a responder for those women that had been either physically abused and domestic situations are those that had been a intimately violent violently sexually abused so I Would do calls to women at the jail um sometimes they would\nRetaliate against their abusers um I get calls at the hospital if they were doing rape kits\nUm I get calls on the crisis line I Would respond to go with women to pick up groceries and you know mundane things and things even if it's a very important topic to me to make sure that uh women and children are protected and sometimes those survivors were men as well\nSo we got experience what was your own emotional reaction and what did you see or did not see a doctor forge testimony that reminded you of what you actually experiencing those coach\nThere well I think that um it it did remind me of the fact that I felt that she actually had been abused at some point I felt that\nAnd so I have no doubt that she has been abused at some point but what there was was a lack of cooperation from the witnesses that she identified and so when they came forward and in their statements basically said you know what this didn't happen or there was no such party [noise]\nUm it it hurt her credibility\nSenator Joni Ernst of Iowa was CBS has major Garrett on his superb podcast the takeout coming up easy takes

in fact it's growing at a nice clip probably for all of twenty Eighteen will see somewhere around three percent GDP and that would be the best and a bunch of years\nBut as a result of that stronger

then behind them was the CIA director of the Korean mission Andy Kim and the U.S translator\nUm and so they sat in their cars you know all prepared ready to head off to this a\nMeeting that everyone was anticipating and then they sat there\nFor about five minutes but it felt like a lifetime because North Koreans were running around and kind of whispering to one another and\nI'm us Secret Service personnel were giving each other I'm nervous glances as to what the hell is going on here and then they went to the secretary's car a had a discussion that I could not here\nI'm from where I was standing and um right after that the u._s. translator was got out of the car behind them and didn't go to the meeting\nNow I Want to point out that indeed Kim\nWho is the CIA mission\nI'm director of Korea he speaks fluent Korean I mean I saw him interacting with the north Korean throughout the time there he's very comfortable so he was in the meeting it wasn't as if they were just taking\nKim Jong un's translators word for what was happening um and ... did go with his Secret Service detail but you know that conversation on the runway wasn't forgotten by north grants they they hold us

and the upper Cumberland from news talk Ninety four point one am sixteen hundred [noise]\nThem first became known to scientists over one hundred years ago back in Nineteen oh wait\nSince then medical science has come to know the condition is not merely one type of autism but across the spectrum disorder while we know it is a developmental disorder that affects communication and behavior there's a wide variation in the type and severity of symptoms\nWe continue our discussion of autism with Becky Davidson president and executive director of rising above ministries\nHere's they work with families to deal with the challenges of autism but help them understand the ... and how autism happens\nThat is a tricky subject I'm there you know there's so many\nTheories out there as to why it happens and you know as a mom if it's a specially like want to try to find out why did this happen I finally got to the place of just going you know it it just it happened and I'm there I'm sure there's a reason why that we're going to\nJust we have to this is what we where we are going to deal with it um it it's ... like Chris was saying before is it it says spectrum and so if there's just it's so wide and far reaching and\nThe reasons why are as far and wide reaching I think too and I think we're just I don't I don't know why we're seeing so many more increased the increase in the numbers\nUm but it's sort of reality is the reality of what we're we are in this day and age and so you know I had a doctor that I that ... worked with us with our son and he said if you seen one child with autism you've seen one child with autism meaning they are all so unique\nAnd different and how they respond ... my son has autism along with other diagnoses and he is so completely different than my friends who have children with autism every ... every child we deal with\n'em in the ministry they all are so unique and that's just part of the spectrum\nDisorder ... start looked so you're on the left side of the spectrum so someone who might have a mild form of autism what kind of things would we expect\nUm typically it would be mild behaviors and socially socially I'm delayed and maybe some anxiety typically find ADHD or ADD along in with autism and\nMost of the time high functioning at can can interact but very liberal very ... and even as they grow older and

family is the impact on siblings can often be dramatic absolutely\nAnd I see I think we're seeing now I'm even more so some of my friends that I've met three rising about who have um children close to my son's age and that they're the children who are typical that are older are now\nReally dealing with a lot of mental health issues\nBecause of how um because of all that went on in their family growing up and we're seeing a lot of that right now\nIs that what you think about you know a lot of cases you know they can't go to the amusement park as I can go to church they can't go to school functions so many of those things that the ordinary child thinks of as part of life you can do right\nEven having a friend over your typical kids like to have a son to a party for the first well you'd have a special needs sibling having friends over it can be traumatic to that child so being able to do that a lot of times isn't even able to happen you know\nAnd you would think Becky a mean obviously you love your your your brother or sister but at some level is there some resentment\nOr I mean that's just a natural thing for any child I think it I think that happens in families anyway that went but this just compounds that it makes it so huge and I think you know when we were growing up\nWe didn't have Facebook or you know Instagram or other things that you could really compare with other families are doing but when you were looking in your same families getting to go on Disney vacations or getting to go on trips are getting to do all the fun things that you your family can't do\nYou know that gets so hard on the whole family on the parents and on the siblings you love your child I Love my child with everything in may but yeah our life looks different than what a lot of my friends on Facebook but their life looks like you know he said yes absolutely there's resentment\nUm which is a natural part of it\nAutism has been around a while but we are really getting to that point where the generation of autistic children were so many diagnoses were made\nAnd becoming adults or are we ready as a society for what that means\nI say absolutely not I Know I mean we're dealing with that now is my son is now Twenty one and just trying to find the resources for him he's out of school\nWhat can he do on a day ... who can he ... he can he hang out with who can help me with care for him those kinds of things and you know especially with the number's growing as the as they are we're absolutely not prepared how we get repaired I don't know the answer to that but we with the numbers being as great as they are\nAfter I don't even know exactly what the as of today what the numbers are but there is so huge that like I said if you if you have not met someone or been affected by autism yet you will be um you'll know someone a family who has individual with autism and their family and so no I Wish that that we weren't prepared but we're not\nGoing again we're talking of spectrum are on the lower end the lifting looks or you have people who can function but they've got to have special job environments right met a we believe that all too strict young people there are some specific jobs that they are\nAbsolutely absolutely there's there are there are jobs out there that those who are higher functioning on the spectrum\nTotally can have a full life don't need care just may need some assistance with maybe managing their money but they totally can work a job and be a be part of that part of of adulthood\nFinding places that are willing to um hire are friends that are at that level that's such a huge need that we have just give somebody a chance\nTo give us a chance to in fighting the the thing is once you find a way what works for someone\nThen they can they can do things it's just being willing to take the time to figure out okay if we switch this one little thing up\nThen it's going to help them to be able to totally do this job and and it's not going to make a difference I let's do that so that they can be a part of our community we have found that and people just are friends on the autism spectrum bring so much joy and you just think you just have to look at things and trying to figure out how to adjust them to make it work for them\nBecause that requires training employers road\nYes definitely and\nI don't know how we get to that point just awareness is the main thing just getting awareness to people that autism is there and there are ways that you can work with it and there are ways to work with our friends with special needs\nAnd I'm just awareness is the number one thing and then\nAgain you would that just because like she said earlier you know one child with special needs you know one child let special needs because they're so different what works for one may not work for the other so even if they make an adjustment for one\nIndividual with special needs if they hire somebody else it might be a different little niche they need to do so I think just making the more people who are aware of that\n... they don't fear it people tend to fear individuals with special needs because they don't know what to say or what to do but just getting people aware and understanding and inclusive just understanding that they're just the human being just because there's a little bit of difference doesn't make them any less human\nAnd white world they live in\nBecky Davidson Chris peers from rising above ministries thank you both for the work you do in for educating us to the\nSame things thank you

in American farmland have so little in common when it comes to the daily grind political leanings interviews on money and\nWorking hard in this curiosity has come a boom of books about the residents of rural America the latest is my author and journalist Sarah ... marsh\nSo I grew up on a wheat and cattle farm thirty miles west of Wichita\nAnd in some ways that I was a child in the eighties and a teenager and the nineties and by then there were seven major technological shifts going on in the country but because of our socioeconomic station we didn't have any of those things so I didn't have

pretty beautiful thing I was a pretty solitary kid by necessity to start sort of geographic isolation but I always had\nAnimals and nature to interact with meanwhile within the walls of our house

a book about geography it's about what it felt like to grow up poor she say she was inspired to write her memoir because of the way she sees America putting such important son wealth and status\nI Can't say that in those moments let's say as a child qualifying for\nFree school lunches or as a first generation college student not knowing what the term in graduate school man when someone talked about applying to graduate school not having the right clothes and so on those are things that I see now looking back that I did feel that\nConscious of that I wouldn't have necessarily articulated it

to places that\nDo oil changes and pick up their spin to oil and such\nAnd somewhere along the way you know nobody knows exactly what had happened but likely one of these are businesses that he picked up the chemical waste from had improperly mixed things that weren't supposed to be mixed and so that was in the back of this than my dad was driving and the fumes seeped into the cab of van and\nAnd nearly killed him so he was in the hospital for weeks and for probably three years after that was in a kind of mental Hayes\nAnd you know this is just being a human being on planet earth comes with dangers that you can't necessarily escape with money but so often people who need money than most are the ones that do the least desirable job and they're the least desirable jobs because they're the dirtiest than most dangerous work\nMarsh indicated that there are two particularly destructive causes the wealth divide in America first the way our capitalism can push those living in poverty turned their own to the fold\nNo I'm not a political scientist and I'm not a policy expert\nEverybody's got a camera so everybody's trying to outperform on another all listen my wife and I were the Grand Canyon recently watching teenagers see is how close they can get to the edge and how many chances they could take the edge of the Grand Canyon oh it's amazing because it makes for a great picture I\nHad their stuff like cutting I mean there's so much anxiety depression\nThat and it's interesting none of that was a part of my life growing up but yet what we were doing was dangerous mhm but now it's gotten to the point where it's not a lot of it's coping a lot of it's the the the societies pressure of this culture that that saying kids do this\nAnd so I Do think there's a lot more dangerous behavior harming themselves you know we ... we were making go carts that would go twenty miles an hour\nAnd kids are driving cars that go a hundred and twenty now I mean it's just different completely different so how do parents deal with this well you know I said I think the first thing is that you need to set some boundaries before the dangerous behavior begins\nKnow what you value and what you do and do not want to see in your home communicate those boundaries to the whole family and build these boundaries into the rules of your home and here's the thing it's it it may be saying that\nThat you know when you get to be a team there's going to be occasional drug test you cannot drink and drive there are certain dangerous behavior we don't want you to be sexually involved with somebody else we don't ... I mean there's all these things that we say we don't want you to be involved in it now at the same time\nThere's a lot of dads it take their sons out and they go hunting and it's not necessarily dangerous\nBut it's it has the potential of being dangerous they go motor cross racing they do bicycling they get on motorcycle there's there's a lot more flexibility\nThat when parents are engaging with their kids that that it works but the parents are involved with them and that kind of take some of the danger out of it\nWow yeah well okay so I mean when you got into that did you did you ever sit back or when you went to sleep at night and think\nOkay have I gotten myself into a mess or or was the desire to belong and you fill only met need greater than the guilt you may have felt for smoking pot and doing all that stuff\nMan the guilt crush me at first and I mean I was like what am I doing yeah but it's like the more I felt that guilt and the more I felt these emotions the more I wanted to push them down and that's another reason why I feel it's a big reason why I'm here because like\nThat's the only way I knew how to cope as I didn't know any other way and I was just like I'm feeling these feelings well I'm feeling rejection of feeling sad yeah feeling guilty for giving all this let me get another high\nBut but you belong to a group now too mhm so I mean did you climb that that social wow I did and now people are looking at you going [noise] [noise] yeah I mean kind of\nThing but I mean it it came to like a crushing factor whereas like they only want to you know I'm only accepted by them because on their dealer or like I I'm doing the same things as them and they came to like this thing it was like [noise]\nThe only thing that we could talk about was just that next Hi well as as nuts I mean it drove me crazy sometimes but you know the more drove me crazy the more I wanted to get high okay\nSo so what was the crowning blow that your parents finally said okay we're not doing this anymore we gotta we gotta come up with an answer because I imagined while you were climbing the social ladder and and feeling guilty on that I mean things with mom and dad weren't going so well where they will tell you I mean I like like how\nI was like barely any communication with them I was coming in and out of the house like not even talking to him just going in my room just isolating and\nYou know and like whatever they can from me about it it was like let me do my own thing I was just so blind to the fact of like what I was doing I just thought it was like so in the rye and like doing what I wanted\nDid you just get where you couldn't see what you were doing in one sense because you really winded by guilt or blinded by just popularity\nBlinded by the popularity blinding by like wanting to fit in\nAnd said that became almost more important than relationships with mom and dad definitely or did you feel guilty that you were losing the relationship with mom and dad\nIt was definitely in the back of my head but like you know like I said like everything that I had to deal with like anything that came to that emotion and it was just that was my coping skill\nWow okay so so what happened that they said okay that's it we're done\nMan [laughter] I was just so to find like I mean I actually got transport it here but I didn't have to really get transport it because whenever I'm I figured out that there is sending me here I just kind of was like okay\nWhat kind of relief or was it\nWas more confused than anything because I didn't understand I mean I didn't understand until being here for like a month yeah that I was just like what am I here for like I only smoke we like there's nothing wrong with me later yeah yeah and what not but I mean definitely like wow being here\nSo where do you see yourself where if you change the most\nUm I've realized that I was a pretty selfish person and I'm\nBeing here and being around others I've seen that I Try to fit in and they'll have to separate myself and that really I don't belong you know what I'm supposed to be you know that outcasts I'm supposed to be myself mine I mean being myself isn't being anybody else but it's being\nUh so so how are you getting along with your parents now\nI'm getting a lot better I'm looking forward to pear tree coming up and really [noise]\nI Know they can get more proud of me because you know it's that unconditional love but I definitely feel an additional love kind of just messes with everything in it but I mean I feel like they're definitely more proud of you know and especially like me like trying to grow more in my face yeah just get get all that back well\nYou know I I think too that that they probably love the fact that they're now building a relationship with the and they probably see the old drew\nThen yeah that is exactly like that at times they're like I really feel like I see my old drew back and I'm like cool\n[laughter] what's going to be exciting to see the new ... not as something that's kind of a combination of all the good stuff that you got going on so that'd be kinda cool excited wow wow well look thanks for being a part of the program I you know I just know their parents out there going okay my son smoking pot and he's starting middle school he's being rejected\nQuarter why do\nWhat would you tell parents what what did your parents have done differently that could have helped you during that time could have done anything\nReally it was I was such a defiant kid that really this was the best thing that could have done the only thing I Would have changed the semi hill a little bit earlier [laughter]\nI'm not you don't hear that that often anyway I'm Glad you're here man I'm proud of you thank you and we're proud of

click on\nDonate now today he's dollar wearing parenting today dot ORG\nAbout teens and dangerous behavior by that we mean behavior that really can\nHarm them that you know it's always interesting to me that that um I Would rather have kids do things during their adolescent years\nThen wait until they're older to start doing the stupid things when no one is around to speak truth into their life and so when I see kids that are that are pulling what I call just stupid stunts you know then I I Am glad I have the opportunity to speak into them\nA while they can learn from the problem that they're causing in their own life rather than just waiting and kind of postponing to a later time so there is something about\nThe expectation level that a parent has to know that your child is an adolescent which means that\nThey have a curiosity and they don't have their decision making muscle developed totally yet and they're going to do some things that you're not going to agree with and some of those things are going to be dangerous they don't understand what it means for a car to be going a hundred miles an hour and what you could do\nBut I tell you there's a lot of kids that will take your car and go do that and they'll learn the hard way but you've got to help them learn also in some way and so\nThat's where I tell people all the time start at a regular time to meet with your teen don't wait until your team that's right now it'd be a student of your teen don't wait for things to fall apart start asking questions people say well my child never talks to me\nYou're never talks do for a reason so you have to figure out what that reason as if you're always teaching teaching teaching a teen\nThey're going to walk away from you if you're always suggesting correcting they're going to walk away from you you've got to be engaged with him in such a way that you are\nListen to you now it's your time to listen to them right and so I spent some time doing that the more you know your child the better you'll be seeing when things go wrong and this also gives you Tina space to bring up things that they're struggling with\nThat might lead to this dangerous behavior that's really important that they know they can talk to you about this to well I I Want them to know that and if every time they say something that I don't like a slap him on the hand or I\nOr I ground them or do something and they're never going to come back and talk to me and so it's more important for them to have a place to to discuss difficulties and hardships than it is for me to enforce the consequence\nBut that's no excuse for not enforcing the consequence I Can't use that say wow I just want to get to know him and there's never any consequences in their life\nToo many moms and dads do that and the child never learns\nAnd so that I Would tell you get to know their world to find out what's going on and be a student of your teen and the other thing is get to know your kids' friends friends can really be a bad influence they can be influenced or a bad and that's right and ... and they're going to be something and so it means I Want to have an influence on them\nAs a parent as well and if you can't really figure out what's going on\nConsider having your team sit down and talk to a councilor I mean if you if you know something's going on mom dad\nIt it it may be the Holy Spirit ... news saying you need to pay attention here and it's dangerous behavior is present you must do all that you can to stop their actions and get to the heart of the issues surrounding your teens behavior\nBehavior is the visible expression of invisible issues you need to know as a mom and dad what those invisible issues are\nMarks there right there for a final thought in a moment as we wrap up but let me encourage you to get a copy of marks book when your teen is struggling there's a chapter in the book called war spinning out of control and it's followed by a chapter titled hope and difficult times read this book when your teen is struggling ordered online\nParenting today's teens dot O. R. G. again parenting today's teens dot org\nMark thanks for bringing this topic up today I really appreciate it I Know parents appreciated as well but why don't you give us your final thought as we wrap up hey moms and\nDads a part of parenting demands that we protect our kids from their foolish thinking and\nDamaging decisions all the while training them to become independent and learn about choices and consequences it's a delicate balance\nBut one that is necessary for going to raise healthy teams you know how to make wise decisions Dangerfield culture and how you do that you ask us God for wisdom you ask your teens what they think\nSeems to me that after you've couples skated with someone the decent thing to do is to at least break up with them face to face but Katharine didn't see it that way and just like that the relationship was over\nIt was less than ... for a friend of mine in eighth grade\nShe called up or boyfriends Steve delivered the bad news\nThat they would be breaking up but oh Steve he saw it coming a mile away and wasn't about to let this relationship ends so he had this boys to men song playing in the background when she called till the end of\nGirl I can let you go it son not to row you\nBe long to me ah be long\nTo you know with that song playing this break it wasn't so easy and maybe the breakup should never be easy maybe the breakup should always be hard\nThat was a time when a group of ... came to Jesus to test him they asked\nIs it last fall for men to divorce his wife\nThis is a significant question because what divorce meant back in the time of Jesus was that a man could drop his existing family to start a new family in a time when only men could work unknown property\nSo if he decided that he would rather start another family he could just write her a certificate of divorce and can move on from that first family as though nothing ever happened he could just\nHand her that certificate of divorce on her way up into the school bus and it was over she and her children\nWould be without a home without a source of income and without an honest named to make their way in the world\nSo Jesus said to them because of your hardness of heart Moses allowed you to divorce so easily but if you have become one slash you really think they could ever be separated again\nYou really think a man can just walk away as though nothing ever happened do you really believe that a man can just pretend that the children never happened that the life he made didn't really happen that he can just hit the reset button and start all over again\nYou know what some people do but not so with God\nAs among the most beautiful in the Bible but not only is the passage beautiful it's\nPowerful in the sense that the profit Jose ah is married to a prostitute and he's married to this prostitute to illustrate his point that if God is married to us than it is a marriage just like a holy prophet being married to a prostitute\nThat have gotten married to me that have gotten married to you it is like a holy prophet being married to a prostitute\nCertainly any Ferris the would have approved should God have wanted to issue a certificate of divorce given our condition\nBut Jose ah won't divorce his wife going where the prostitute even though she keeps returning back to the brothel despite who he's married to\nJose ah like our God just won't let the relationship in\nAnd Bible studies on this passage of heard women and men identified with God is the divine takes on even more human or superhuman attribute Cindy eleventh chapter\nSeveral years ago a woman named Mrs Jane and words pronounced that this is a mother talking here and Jose ah\nWhen Israel was a child I loved him and out of Egypt I called my son\nBut the more I called them the more they went from me yet it was I who taught at frame to walk I took them up in my arms\nHours to them like those who lift infants to their chi\nLet's does sound like a mother to me or grandmother\nThe kind of grandmother who loves her grandson so much that's even love the little greasy hand friends they leave all over her sliding glass doors and won't clean them off because of how much she loves the greasy little hands and put them they're\nThe kind of mother who can't help but by the little cheeks of her daughter smell that little smell that only comes from her baby girl\nThe kind of mother or grandmother or a father and grandfather who are members lining up the cheerios on the couch cushions so that the baby would pull up and shuffled down step by step cheerio to cheerio until little Israel could walk\nAnd the couch is still there years later\nEven in those days when he doesn't come around because he has other people to impress the couch is still there even in those days when the baby now grown seems to think only of himself\nThe couch is still there\nEven if he falls farther and farther down the pit of drugs or alcohol crime or indiscretion oh God still looks at that couch and remembers the baby we used to be\nEven if we've forgotten who we ever war and I walk so far away from the light that we can see all the way back home\nAnd this moment\nIt's easy for us to believe that our God will be like our sixth grade girl friend considering all the wrong we've done it's easy to believe that God will just issue was the bill of divorce and be done with us\nYou've been to a church their whole lives completely sure that they're going to help the only question is how soon but we read here in Jose a God saying something different my people\nAre bent on turning away from me\nBut how can I give you a\nHow can I hand you over my heart recalls within me\nMy compassion grows warm and tender for I Am God and no more though\n\nI Believe that too often we miss understand but love really is\nAnd I say so because\nI miss understand it all the time last July my mom sent me a birthday card\nAnd on the front of a card has this little boy with his bike helmet on any pushing his little blue bike up a gravel road\nAnd the card says son sometimes I find myself smiling just remembering something you said when you were little and there's a big part of me that expected to open that card to read\nThe words but then you became a teenager and you're hurt me again and again and again\nBut instead you know what the carts ed and today I just hope you know\nHow very much I Love you and how grateful I Am to call you\nMy son that's kind of a miraculous card but this kind of miracle isn't so far away and I say that because I Know\nThere are some of you who have known friends to cut ties with you maybe even friends that you've had to cut ties with\nMaybe children who are you still love but you don't ever see parents who you loved at one time and wonder if you still do there may be\nWives listening now who have been issued that certificate of divorce tossed aside like yesterday's news and that there are husband's listening who have loved in laws didn't want to tell that poll with Alfred lord tennis and then he's crazy thinking\nThat it's better to have loved in laws the never to loved it all\nI Know that there are people here who don't\nFeel world the of the love of God\nBecause they've learned about divine love based on human love but the love of God\nIs more and the guy who wants to lift you up to his cheek who've been down to you and said you can't just walk

Christ this Jesus whom you crucified X. two thirty six no that Jesus is lord\nThat word lord mange master and that means he has the authority the right to direct our lives and command how we should live\nAfter his resurrection of Jesus told the apostles all authority has been given to me both in heaven and on her Matthew twenty eight eight team\nThe apostle Paul wrote if you show confessed with your mouth Jesus Says lord and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead you shall be saved Romans ten version then\nYou see to acknowledge him as the lord has to acknowledge that we

sinful behavior that's what he's warning us against and that's the key remember saints when Jesus was addressing his disciples on the sermon on the mound he explicitly tag them but they won't be

who encouraged me to do the same thing to embrace local ministries and I'm I'm loving the process of doing that but I Want to urge all of you that if you haven't done that yet\nEspecially students if you haven't met a local ministry where you can embrace and take do part of life with God has got you in this place for two three more years there's a reason\nAnd your four years in college are an opportunity to move away from God but to move closer to him to love the place where he's planted you just like we are called to do so let me encourage all of us to do that today\n\nAnd as we do this we need to be watching we need to be on the lookout\nWe not to succumb to those same temptations we see that the people around us has to come to ... but we need to remember something it's only because of God's Grace that we are having already succumb to those temptations you know we're not any better than anybody else we're just saved by grace\n\nAnd what we come to realize is that since we are now in Christ our love of God compels us to act differently\nPower this way infusions five eight at one time you were darkness but now you are lights in the lord that's our new identity that's our new address and that's who are called to be\nIt's just like Jesus told his followers in the same way like your lights shining before others so that they may see your good works and give glory to your father who is in heaven\nNotice he didn't say if you do good works he said let them see your good works it's an obvious outflow of who we are in crisis\n\nDoes this different lifestyle look like you're wondering well at this point I could try it out a long list here the simple behaviors you got to avoid hasn't ... God has given us to grow but you know what it seems to me that during that week after week isn't very helpful\nIt creates a legal or stick mindset or rural keeping bent and that's really destructive to us as Christians\nWho believe in grace trusting writes\nLove his amazing grace\nSony's illustration that I help I think will help us all understand a little bit better and it's an honor of the Olympics and this is a wonderful movie called chariots of fire perhaps you've watched it and it tells us the story of two different Olympians and they were from England and Nineteen twenty four\nOne of them and little he was a Scottish Christian he'd been born and raised in China his parents were missionaries to that land he ran for God's glory\nAnd then one of his friends his friend named Harold Abrams he was English Jew he ran to overcome the prejudice of his time\nAnd in one of my favorite sees all the movie ... Mrs prayer meeting he's not running he just he forgets and his sister Jenny school's handling mercifully\nGod tells her you know what I'm going back in the mission field one day I'm going back and serve China\nBut when I'm running I feel inspired here's this quote I Believe that God maybe for a purpose but he also made me fast and when I run I feel his pleasure\nBlood but I've never been fast enough to feel God's pleasure when Iran but I imagine that's got to be wonderful\nFor us later in the movie as their boarding the boat to Paris to take them to the games\nWas it has have for the hundred meter races going to be held on a Sunday\n... was a Christian we wonder what's he gonna do\nAnd despite pressure from the prince of Wales despite pressure from the British Olympic Committee he refuses to run its the large day it's the Sabbath I'm not going to run\nI'm going to worship my came\nSo it seems as if all has been lost\nLife dedicated to running is now without an opportunity\nTo run for the glory of God\nBut then hope appears in the form of his friend lord ... Lindsey he's his teammate and Lindsey has just won the silver medal in the four hundred meter hurdles\nSo he proposes to give up his place to Eric in the four hundred meter dash\nAnd little great fully except that offer and in a race he's never run before and all of his life against all odds he wins the gold medal in the four hundred meter race\nNow if you haven't seen the movie I didn't do any justice at all it's a great great movie get a copy watch it\nIt's a wonderful story it's true story or at least mostly true in the movie and it's a wonderful glimpse of how one disciples love of God compelled him to act differently to use his gifts to be solved the lights forgot it planted\nSeats\nWe pursue holiness when we escaped the entanglement with children of darkness solar\nPower goes on to remind us here that when we seek personal godly miss when embracing are calling his children of lights walk as children of lights for the fruit of light is found in all it is good and write and true and try to discern what his pleasing to the lord\nNow that's not really an extraordinary command as it\nWe shouldn't be at all surprised to find Paul encouraging to us to walk his children of light why not only because he's just told us that's who we are\nThis is our this is our identity and this is our reality so be who you are called to beat that simply what he's telling us here what God wants us to be in crisis that's all it is\nIt's living with our new ability according to our new identity\nSee once we were all darkness\nEnraptured with the ... sparkling trinkets that the world has to offer us with a false promises of a fallen deceitful master\nButton now\nNow we are light in the lord now our love for him constrains us it compels us to behave like it\nTo be different than the rest of the world for all disciples reflects God's glory as we imitate his behavior that's the key\nWhat this means is that since we were chosen by him before the foundation of the world and since we love him now because he first loved us\nGrace by humbly loving the lovely by cell foolishly serving the and thankful and by joyfully embracing trials and tribulations gestures are Lord Jesus Christ did just as millions of Christians who have come before us have\nSo that God's king dome so God's glory so the gods fame my spread across the globe\n\nChurch the love of church children used boys and girls moms and dads students single folk senior saints are I mean we have a new identity and it says children of lights\nAnd it's our great calling as disciples to walk in that light to walk as those children so let's covenant together to act like it shall we\nNews talk Ninety four point one brings either weekly worship survey of heavenly health Lutheran Church presenting worse at every Sunday

them ... the lord God and whether they hear or refused to hear for they are rebellious ... they are rebellious house they won't do that a profit has been among them this is the word of the lord\nThank God [noise]\nThe episode today is from pause letter to the current the un's chapter twelve I must go on posting though there is nothing to be gained by it I Will go on to the patients and revelations of the lord I Know a man in Christ to fourteen years ago was caught up\nTo the third heaven weather in the body or out of the body I Do not know God Knows and I know that this man was caught up into paradise\nWeather in the body or out of the body I Do not know that God Knows any hurt things that cannot be told which man may not occur\nOn behalf of this man I Will both spent on my own behalf I Will not those except of my weaknesses though if I should wish to boast\nI Would not be a fool for I Would be speaking the truth but I refrain from it so that no one may think more of me then he sees in me or hears from me\n\nSo to keep me from being too elated by the surpassing greatness of the revelations ... was given me in a flash a message or of Satan to harass me to keep me from being to related three times\nI have to do with the lord about this that I should leave that it should leave me but he said to me my grace is sufficient for you\nFor my power is made perfect in weakness therefore\nI Will post all the more gladly of my weaknesses says that the power of Christ may rest upon me for the sake of Christ than I Am content with weaknesses insults hardships persecution and calamities\nFor when I Am a week than I Am strong this is the word of the lord [noise]\nThe holy gospel according to saint Marc districts chapter a\nJesus went away from there and came to his home town\nAnd his disciples followed him and on the Sabbath he began to teach in a synagogue and many who heard him were astonished saying where does this men get these things what is the wisdom given to him\nOur such mighty work's done by his hands is not just the carpenter the sort of Mary and the brother of James and chose this\nAnd judicious in Simon and are not his sisters here with us and they took offense at him\nAnd Jesus said to them a profit is not without honor except in his home town and among his relatives in his own\nThe work there except that he laid his hands on a few sick people and healed than any marvel because of their own belief and he went about among the village is teaching\nAnd he called the twelve and began to send them out to buy two and gave them authority over the unclean spirits you charge them to take nothing for their journey except to staff\nNo bread no bag no money in their belts but to wear sandals and not put onto to nix and he said to them whenever you enter a house stay there until you depart from there and if any place will not receive you\nAnd they will not listen to you when you leave shake the dust that is on your feet as a testimony against them so they went out and proclaimed that people should repent\nAnd the cast out many demons and anointed the oil and anointed with oil money who are sick and healed then this is the gospel love the lord Mm\nGrace mercy and peace you from got our father and our lord and savior Jesus Christ of and\nIf you would open your shoe Bible to second Corinthians eleven if you ... it's hard to find the smaller and testament books in the back uh nine six nine page nine six nine if that helps you find that easier\nWe're going to look at chapter eleven the whole the chapter before we get the chapter twelve [noise]\nSo we're looking at chapter eleven of second Corinthians chapter St Paul writes I Wish you would all bear with me and a little foolishness\n[laughter]\nI've given this a shot I Wish she would all bear with me I'm not going to be a full don't worry just um but to bear with me\nOr for pulses for a few of drawn jealousy for you since I've been true is due to one husband to resent you as a pure aversion to Christ but I'm afraid\nThat is the survey deceived eve biased cutting your thoughts will be led astray from a sincere impure devotion to Christ for someone comes in for claims and other Jesus then the one we proclaimed or if you receive a different spirit from the one you received or if you accept the different\nGospel from the one you accepted you put up with it readily enough\nIndeed I consider that I Am not in the least inferior to these super apostles\nPaul's being a little snarky there by the way\nEven if I Am unskilled in speaking I Am not so in knowledge indeed in every way we have made this plane to you in all things or did not commit a sin humbling myself so that you might be exalted\nBecause I've preached God's gospel the free\nOf charge I'm Rob other churches by accepting support from them in order to serve you and when I was with you and was in need I did not burden anyone for the brothers who came from Macedonia supplied my needs so I refrained and we'll refrain from burdening you in any way\nAs the truth of crisis in me this boosting mind will not be silenced in the regions of Cairo\nAnd why because I Do not love you God Knows I Do and what\nI Do I Will continue to do in order to undermine the claim of those who would like to claim that in their boosted mission they work on the same terms as we do for such men are false apostles deceitful workman\nDisguising themselves apostles of Christ\nAnd no wonder for even Satan disguises himself as an angel light so it is no surprise of his servants\nJust as there and we'll correspond to their deeds\n... right\nI repeat ... no one think needs foolish but even if you do accept me as a fool so that I too may boost the little what I'm saying with this both will confidence I say not with the Lord's authority but as a\nFool since many boast according to the flush out you know boast for you gladly bear with schools being wise yourselves\nFor you Barrett if someone makes slaves of your devoured your takes advantage of you or puts on airs or strikes you in the face\nTo my shame I must say we were too weak for that but whatever anyone else dares to boost up I Am speaking as a fool I also dare to boost of that\nOr the Hebrew is so high or the Israeli lights so am I why\nAre they offspring of Abraham so am I why are they servants of Christ I'm a better one I Am talking like a madman\nWith far greater labor's far more in prisons with countless beatings and often near death five times I received at the hands of the Jews\nThe forty last is lashes less won three times I was beaten with rods once I was stone three times I was shipwreck a night and day I was drifting sea on frequent journeys in danger from rivers danger from robbers danger for my own people danger from gentile danger in the city danger in the wilderness dangerous see\nUh in our world but but but also as we look at the Christian life Paul says I think that the Christian life is is not meant to be chasing the next revelation or the next vision because it goes on to then say my grace is sufficient for you my powers made perfect and weakness\nAnd and we're supposed to think that yes he's some sort of a super apostle that he would have this kind of experience but he's really more spiritual than any of us\nBut to keep me from being too elated says the text God gave him a thorn in the flesh now who knows with a thorn in post flesh was nobody does there's endless speculation about what it is it could be an illness it could be that he never fully\nRecovered from the the blindness that he had when he was on the Damascus wrote it can be a number of things but one thing we do know is that he never recovered from even after he prayed\nThree times for it to be taken away now how many how many stories that we heard with I prayed once and it didn't happen I prayed twice and that didn't happen but I pray the third time and it happened\nWell Paul saying look I pray three times and it didn't happen the lord didn't take it away he did give him a word though and in my fancy Bible [laughter] not are few Bible spending the fancy bibles there's red letters there where it says my grace is sufficient you for you my powers made\nPerfect and we that's the lord speaking best Jesus speaking DePaul with this word\nAnd So Paul then says therefore I Will boost all the more of my weaknesses so it was a power cries me rest upon me when he's talking about is the surpassing power of God and that's what we posted not her own spirituality not our own experience of\nVisions of revelations but in the all powerful\nGod who has worked something in us by his grace by his love\nBiased mercy and all that we've all had an experience and that's why he says the very end for the sake of Christ and I'm content with witnesses insult\nHardships persecution and calamities from when I'm week then I'm strong if\nPolls making this argument in this larger context which I Believe he is um the the detractors of Paul pulse critics the Corinthian Christians were trying to say that Paul's not worth following\nBecause good things don't happen to him he just seems to be one of these kind of guys it's always beat up and Paul says no you've got the exact opposite way in fact amazing things happened to me and yet I still have this thorn in the flesh so that I can confess my weakness not my strength\n\nHow do we apply that to our own lives well I mean I\nThere are some people I Know who say they have a wonderful per life\nUm but I got to tell you sometimes I struggled to pray\nAnd and it's a weakness or sometimes it's hard to see the end of the week uh it's it's hard to see any result ah it's hard to see any movement\nAnd people's lives are last week when so few people were here I went home depressed okay that's my weakness this week I'll go home happy because so many people were here\nAt least relatively to last week okay but those are the kinds of weakness is\nI think that we all have in that we all share and yet God says you know it's Smith is not about you it's about my word and people's hearts in lives and so the whole point of the\nThe whole point of the next steps that I've been trying to do for about two years was free to take one part of the message home with you and sometimes they connected with you and sometimes they didn't and that's fine [noise]\n\nBut I'm I'm running across more and more former Christians\nWho didn't really get it while they were there didn't understand what they were doing in church who heard things that the past\nAnd so um I I I don't believe that Jesus stood up on a well he did sit down and when he gave that a certain amount but I I don't believe that\n\nI Believe that the faith has caught not taught and so I'm One of\nThe things I'm going to try to do is to create a little bit more of an open ... or in our in our time together or during the time because I think it would um maybe you appreciate the format maybe you're mad\nAt me let's just try it and see where it goes power made perfect in weakness Paul says grace is sufficient don't look for everything to go from strength to strength to strength boasting what God has done for you in the name of Jesus\nI mean we stand to pray\nLet us pray for the whole church of God in Christ Jesus in for all people according to their needs almighty and everlasting God your son rains over all the nations biased gospel pour out your Holy Spirit on your people\nAnd open your lips to speak to your word with boldness one and all by the mercy that we've received and your son holy

groups like black are facilitators in small groups are worst shepherding our home\nWere shepherding our children see we're at some point you know so I don't have any of those you got a girlfriend your shepherd you got a boyfriend your shepherding you know what we have been called to be shepherds David didn't always said she now will tell you\nThis ... ... she's been written down since June they didn't always said the sheep and when the line roared he recognized\nWhen the line roared he recognized and this is why I picture it the lines real stealthy\nThe ... largest real real real real on a proud real stealthy any keys and you know I see cats you know he just real so and so slow it's so methodical and when he gets to the point where he knows he's got enough space\nTo out run that thing in a surprise and he lifts this rural route and the entire heard goes into a frantic chaotic running everywhere and and all of a sudden the like he's in in a split second and he's gone he's after that one that's on protected\nSeat on\nThe line roars and David understood it but the day the way from fading sheep to protect and cheap David knew what it was time put the bucket down you know what\nI Am a shepherd David says I feed my sheep but you know there's no point in time when I hear the law roar that the bucket get sit down and when the budget gets set down the state gets picked up and when I get to stick picked up this is my first line this is the stick is the first thing but you don't want me pull muscling out\nI'll get my slaying out but if you if you don't want me to you better get out of here see the same reaction that's the same reaction that drugs your six year old out of the street\nSo you say well okay uh what do you mean by that I Am a living example at my mama beat the living daylights out of me right over here by manual officer store when I was the kids out there it's the uh the the veterans part I wouldn't running across the street my mama grab me and I'm gonna tell you I'm going to kind of probably role play it harder and what it was\nMy mama grabbed me and I my arm went completely out socket\nAnd she joined me around and when she took me around already she already hit me with what the what she got me around and everybody driving through reminds me of it to this day still your mom a weapon in the street when you're little\nI've got my whip and and you know what got my rabbit run after that so so she went she jerked Marty ... back because that's the same knee jerk reaction that we have with a six year old that we had we win the six year old turned sixteen and the drug kids come around\nHow jerk your arm clean out a sock it to\nThat mom I don't know no different that momma said I'm not feeding you right now I've got to stick and I will be you would if I have to\nBut when I start beating off the line and you might get you know friend of mine said one time we better get to what matters get close to him because he did he couldn't extend as much as they said I just get close to me that we have been it hurts but sometimes everybody gets it when we were going up everybody got it once was a whipping outgoing everybody I liked it\nSo I Am pro I'm pro disciplining our children so in the same reaction\nLet me explain to you what that means the same slaying that we used to kill the line with today is going to be the same slang that we're going to have to pull out and used to kill the giant went down the street\nA week now a year from now or two years from now the same slaying is gonna have to kill a different kind of line\nThe same thing David tended his father she did a good job\nWhen the line came he came with the roar\nSee she ... she will scatter\nAnd when they hear this roar they'll scattered but David shows us how to lead lack of shepherd\nSee when the shepherd's calming voice speaks louder than the lion's roar man we're getting somewhere now when the shepherd's calming voice speaks louder than the lines roared than the sheep don't scatter\nSee the launch job is to devour and when the ... when the shepherd's calming voice speaks louder than the lines were or the line can't devour\nHe can't devour because you know what he comes off of that roar and the first thing that they do in David's camp in David's field where he's got all these sheep the first thing they do is they look up and they start trembling but they start backing up to the shepherd\nThey start getting close today that they start getting you know what sometimes when the line roars way where it might be advantageous for us to back up to the lord just back up to the lord don't don't run frantic because that's what the devil wants us to do I'm\nGoing to back up the lord you know I don't know what's going on but I'm back up to the lord here's where I'm going straight down here will start praying we're going to start praying\nDavid shows that lead like a shepherd to keep us from being devoured David rescued his sheep on multiple occasions\nThe word says lions and bears\nSo we know that there were multiple occasions now David's Davis finds himself now in the store that were red he's defended himself himself he's definitive shape he's defended on the fields where nobody knows anything about it man he's the greatest underground success world's ever seen at this point\nHe's the greatest leader that nobody knows about David's out an artist picture this way David that over rock watching cheap in the middle of nowhere\nAnd now all of a sudden he comes onto the battlefield inverse them in chapter Seventeen first Samuel he comes onto the battlefield and he's just bringing some food he's bringing some stuff to the king and to the to to to the soldiers into whoever's brothers he's just doing what his dad told him\nHe was there for ... to bring provisions\nAnd David is a boy let's not forget David is a boy David is a shepherd boy at that and\nNobody is going to get any attention to a shepherd boy\nHe don't even have a sword hate it when he walks up he don't have any ... you don't even have a resume they don't even have scars on him David walks up he's just a shepherd boy and David hears a familiar roar coming from the valley floor\nWait a minute I've heard this before it don't sound like the line I've heard before but it's all too familiar I hero or just like I heard when that line roars and I I Know his voice he's heard the sound before and the giant descended to the valley floor twice every day\nAnd have roared obscenities at the armies of Israel and insulted are living God that's what he did and everybody stood back and took it and David walks up and David says I hear it\nThis is what David saw you heard it he saw he fell to tell us among I've done this for you before this is ...\nAli plateau over here got Phyllis things over here\nAnd they're like yeah yeah yeah and then when you got the valley and then you come back up and you got the Israelites so the Israelites are simply for battle and the Phyllis things are similar for battle twice a day and their champion this great big guy walks down into the valley and says give me one person\nTo fight me and if you win will be your service if I win you will be my service just gave me one guy just taunting and and and just ugly and you know what\nAll the army's the visual stood up here\nI don't I Hope he goes away I Hope he goes away secret Philips things on one side Israelites on the other the judge from the Philippines side comes into the valley some say nine feet tall over nine feet tall some say I don't know exactly how totally was but I guarantee he was big\nAnd this is what some people say some people say uh some scholars say that he weighed somewhere in the six hundred pound range\nYou know what a full grown line ways somewhere close to five or six hundred pounds so what everybody saw was this great big Guy Davis things differently this is what let me show you what David sees David walks up and he says wait a minute I see armies of Israel\nI see armies of Israel scared and trembling lack front and sheep\nI see the army's what is wrong with our army\nAt this point they're just really foreman so that you know maybe only Dave in Seoul have armor and and and soared so these guys don't even know how to fight but I see armies serving the living God that don't even know how to ... they don't eat their front and black sheep\nI hear the roar of the line throwing these guys into panic\nI see it and I hear it making them doubt God's ability to deliver\nI hear this guy screaming to these people based people David sees them as sheep I see them trembling in fear I see this got casting doubt into their their God what their God can do\nI see a man the size of the line Standing Alone by himself at the right there mistake number one Phyllis things you say one guy down in down in the bottom of the valley to fight the Lord's army it's mistake number one\nOur music or ministry the chance to acquire the ensembles

from a flight from his\nOf Christ edition of righteousness of God that is based\nOn\nThe ... the writer says that I have come from knowing prize the power of his resurrection\nAnd the participation in his sufferings you didn't Clinton's means conform to his\nDad so that I made for have reached the resurrection of the day\nIt is not that I have already reached Israel or have already taken effect but I pursue in so that I may grab a hold of yet because Christ grab a hold of me\nBut just for this purpose brothers and sisters\nI must say I don't think I've reached yet but I think that's one thing\nI forget about the things behind me and reach out for the things I hear that to me to go to the prize\nI've got a call price jeeze this is the word of God or the people in the yard signs seat to a\n\nCertain man what's your stories and start with that line of certain man worked hard for nearly Twenty years in hopes of a major promotion\nHe got climbed a ladder as far as he could and now I hoped to jumped to jump over to the elevator that would take him to the executive suites\nHe had participated in professional development programs leadership workshops he'd gone back to get his MBA he had done everything the right way checked all the right boxes understood the politics\nSo to to avoid\nDone all that he could to make himself ready to be known by the right people and it came to a point where he was convinced that his role did not match the value that he brought to his organization\nBut finally excuse me finally he achieved his promotion and was named vice president of the division that he'd worked so hard for for so long\nAnd honestly truly it wasn't so much the pay change that excited them although\nThat wasn't nice bright product it was the title and the meaning that that held for years he'd watch all these big and important people in their tailored suits had to their big well fashions offices\nAnd now he was that\nSo he had a party to celebrate\nWith his friends and he was in his family and he was so excited and he just went on and on about his new role about the perks that came along with it\nThe the the benefits the company car but mostly that he had done it finally all of this work was worth it he was now a VP\nAnd later in that night maybe because he had been so tired of hearing about it one of his friends looked at him and said you know\nThey'll make anybody vice president these days I think just to ... just down the street is that everything is a dollar store I saw that they had just hire new vice presidents\nIt's really not that big a deal\nSo our friend didn't really think that was funny and the next day it bothered him so much that he called that everything's a dollar store and he said I'm yes hello I understand that you all are just tired of vice president I wondered if I might be able to speak to that person\nAnd the person on the phone said well sure we have three which one would you like to speak to\nYou didn't really like that answer\nIt's our human nature it's certainly mine um to define our self worth our own success based on our accomplishments are accolades the knowledge that we have gone about things the right way\nThis is nothing new we see this tendency not really a tendency it's a trace of humankind throughout the scripture of people who were comfortable proud of how they were before they became aware of who they were\nAnd here we see this perfect example of Paul had spelled out so well in this letter to the Libyan church in his letter Paul writes about what he considers considers to be the parts of his life that made him so successful\nAt least successful before his life was changed for Jesus if we take a deeper look at what Paul reflects on to be his success\nWe begin to understand this immense transformation is taking place in his life\nPaul writes in his letter that if anybody if anybody has reason to be proud of themselves that was me and then he goes through this list of why he was allowed to feel this way\nFirst he had followed the most important and sacred tradition he was he mentions that he was circumcised on the eighth day just as any self respecting males you would be\nThen he tells them and you can almost hear the echoes of his whole life that he was of the tribe of Israel but more specifically that\nPaying I Belong here because of who my parents were\nAnd with respect for the law which he wants to dedicate his entire life to which all Jews were to dedicate their entire life to he was a fair see\n\nHis life was the law he was an expert I was to make sure that everything about our way of life in our face was exactly how it was supposed to be and I went so far in my devotion to that law\nBut I personally Kate persecuted the church of Jesus Christ because what it was claiming was so profane and so blasphemous\n\nAnd then he says because of all this because of all the things that are done because of all that I did because of how I Lived I was blameless I made myself blameless\nThis mindset\nMakes me squirm a little bit because it's just so reliable the idea that he's states basically I'm here where I Am because I deserve it I've done things the right way I made the occasional mistake but in relation by comparison\nI did fine who're you to tell me what I'm supposed to be\nBut thankfully Paul does not in his words there he can't in them there because if he did we would not know what the transformational power of Jesus Christ this power that turns this persecute or of this church tend to perhaps his most dedicated and fearless leader\nPaul became aware of how he was because of Jesus Christ showed him who he was and then he continues\nHe goes on these things were my assets these things that sent me apart that brought me honor and success it was how I measured myself\nBut then he says I wrote him off for the sake of Christ\nBut he takes another step he didn't just write them off he considered them losses they were now dead to him those old ways when he compared them to his new life for face of following Jesus of allowing this dedication\nTo lead his life his new life is now superior to his old his priorities have changed\nThe important things had been reassigned\nTraits that Paul once considered to be the very definitions of his greatness\nHe now considers to be sewer fills there's nothing that he wants anything to do with any more\n\n\n\n\n\n[noise]\n\n[noise] [noise] Mm\n\n[noise]\nAh [noise]\nAh\n\n[noise]\nAh\nOr be with you lift up your heart's let us get back to the lord our God [noise]\nIt is

local issues point neighbors and newsmakers today in the upper Cumberland from news talk nerdy four point one am sixteen hundred [noise]\nAutism first became known to scientists over one hundred years ago back in Nineteen oh wait\nSoups and medical science has come to know the condition is not merely one type of autism but across the spectrum disorder while we know it is a developmental disorder that affects communication and behavior there's a wide variation in the type and severity of symptoms\nWe continue our discussion of autism with Becky Davidson president and executive director of rising above ministries and the group's community outreach director Chris piers we work with families to deal with the challenges of autism\nBut help them understand the wives and how autism happens\nThat is a tricky subject um ... you know there's so many\nTheories out there as to why it happens and you know as a mom if it's a specially like want to try to find out why did this happen I finally got to the place of just going you know it it just it happened and I'm there I'm sure there's a reason why that we're going to\nJust we have to this is what we where we are going to deal with it um it it's ... like Chris was saying before it's a it's a spectrum and so if there's just it's so wide and far reaching and\nThe reasons why are as far and wide reaching I think too and I think we're just I don't I don't know why we're seeing somebody more increased the increase in the numbers\nUm but it's sort of reality is the reality of what we're we are in this day and age and so you know I had a doctor that I that ... worked with us with our son and he said if you seen one child with autism you've seen one child with autism meaning they're all so unique\nAnd different and how they respond ... my son has autism along with others diagnoses and he is so completely different than my friends who have children with autism every every child we deal with\n'em in the ministry they all are so unique and that's just part of the spectrum disorder\nChris let's start let's say on the left side of the spectrum so or someone who might have a mild form of autism what kind of things would we expect\nUm typically it would be mild behaviors and socially socially I'm delayed and maybe some anxiety typically find ADHD or age along in with autism and\nMost of the time high functioning at in in in Iraq but there are all their ... and even as they grow older and things\nHappening across the upper Cumberland this week Putnam county commissioners meat in regular session Monday

[noise]\nFocused on autism with Becky Davidson and Chris veers from rising above measuring\nThe good often lift up part of the story of autism and her family is the impact on siblings\nCan often be dramatic\nI see I think we're seeing now I'm even more so I send my friends that I've met three rising about who have um children close to my son's age and that they're the children who are typical that are older are now\nReally dealing with a lot of mental health issues\nBecause of how um because of all that went on in their family growing up and we're seeing them\nYou know a lot of cases you know they can't go to the amusement park or you can go to church they can't go to school functions so many of those things that the ordinary child ... as part of life you can do right\nEven having a friend over your typical kids like to have a son for a party for their birthday well you'd have a special needs sibling having friends over it can be traumatic to that child so being able to do that a lot of times isn't even able to happen you know\nAnd you would think Becky a ring obviously you love your your your brother or sister but at some level is there some reason\nI mean that's just a natural thing for any child I think it I think that happens in families anyway but win but this just compounds that it makes it so huge and I think you know when we were growing up\nWe didn't have Facebook or Instagram or other things that you could really compare with other families are doing but when you were looking in your same families getting to go on Disney vacations or getting to go on trips are getting to do all the fun things that you your family can do\nYou know that gets so hard on the whole family on the parents and on the siblings you love your child I loved my child with everything in may but yeah our life looks different than what a lot of my friends on Facebook what their life looks like you know instead of yes absolutely there's resentment\nUm which is a natural part of it\nAutism has been around a while but we are really getting to that point where the generation of autistic children were so many diagnoses were murdered they are becoming or they're coming of age right now becoming adults or are we ready as a society for what that means\nI say absolutely not I Know I mean we're dealing with that now as my son is now Twenty one and just trying to find the resources for him he's out of school\nWhat can he do on a day ... who can he ... he can he hang out with who can help me with care for him those kinds of things and you know especially with the number's growing as they as they are we're absolutely not prepared how we get repaired I don't know the answer to that but we with the numbers being as great as they are\nAfter I don't even know exactly what to as of today what the numbers are but there is so huge that like I said if you if you have not met someone or been affected by autism yet you will be um you know someone a family who has individual with autism and their family and so no I Wish that that we weren't prepared but we're not\nGoing again we're talking a spectrum of on the lower end the lifting looked so you have people who can function but they've got to have special job environments where I met a we believe that all too strict ... young people there are some specific jobs that they are\nAbsolutely absolutely there's there are there are jobs out there that those who are higher functioning on the spectrum\nTotally can have a full life don't need care just may need some assistance with maybe managing their money but they totally can work a job and be a be part of that part of of adulthood finding places that are willing to\nUm hire are friends that are at that level that's such a huge me that we have just give somebody a chance\nTo give us a chance to win in fighting the the thing is once you find a way what works for someone\nThen they can they can do things it's just being willing to take the time to figure out okay if we switch this one little thing up\nThen it's going to help them to be able to totally do this job and and it's not going to make a difference I let's do that so that they can be a part of our community we have found that and people just are friends on the autism spectrum bring so much joy\nThe grad adjust them to make it work for them but crews that requires training employers drug\nYeah definitely and\nI don't know how we get to that point just awareness is the main thing just getting awareness to people that artists and is there and there are ways that you can work with it and there are ways to work with our friends with special needs\nAnd I'm just awareness is the number one thing and then\nAgain you read that just because like she said earlier you know one child with special needs you know one child with special needs because they're so different what works for one may not work for the other so even if they make an adjustment for one\nIndividual with special needs if they hire somebody else it might be different little niche they need to do so I think just making more people who are aware of that\nTo where they're they don't hear people tend to fear individuals' with special needs because they don't know what to say or what to do that just getting people aware and understanding and inclusive just understanding that they're just a human being\nJust because there's a little bit of difference doesn't make them any less human\nYeah wait world\nBecky Davidson Chris Peters from rising above ministries thank you both for the work you do in

an early age usually ... if that sounds like you or someone you know she has this advice\nThe most important thing that we can tell women is that we now recognize that it is normal for women to experience a decline in certain cognitive functions and the transition through the mental pause\nSo for example they may experience forget fullness difficulties concentrating and they'll like researchers have documented this\nIn very carefully done studies\nAnd the research suggests that\nLarge majority of women appear to bounce back that these symptoms are temporary and that they're likely due to changing levels of estrogen so the first thing to tell women\nThat all the same risk disease\nAt age fifty to sixty is very rare print get fullness is the norm during the menopausal

experts helping you\nWork with celebrated\nBusiness author ... printer and strategy coach how we are and tendencies leading strategy business specialist Johnny sites\nThen his business work [noise]\nWelcome to business works this is how Alfie are along with Johnny sites and our special guest today who is the owner operator general manager of\nTrademark printing in Cookeville and ... a ... this is Tom short who's going to be with Tommy what to say good morning or good afternoon or good evening or whatever\nAnd Alan how're you Johnny did to see\nGood to have you here Tom ... visiting with you thank you\n... you had to Johnny and I've been talking we had some questions for you and we'll just kind of pick your brain a little because we're interested in your take on a number of things regarding small business and we're also talking a professional practice people as well\nBecause you have the opportunity for your business service really every other kind of business and so you are ... where the printing business and the other\nUh services that you offer mailing services in statement rendering and all that sort of thing you are able to have a better overview than a lot of other businesses\nThat are dealing with one specific type of customer so we're curious really ... when when did you start the business and ... when it let's say where did you do it and how did you do that and I'm now is Mary rife always bend your business partner um you know will\nYou know this the ... you're going pretty far back in um to just start\nQuickly I was in the restaurant business until I was okay uh my early forties\nUh and I came to town to run the country club when it was a country club here and then at some point a fellow came to my door and said he had the sprint pretty business and was going to have to leave town and I was interested in buying in three weeks later he was our students and they're now Twenty years so you better it must be uh\nThis I Would imagine that's in it a big change as much better yeah\nRestaurant business people have always said to me that you have to be married to the restaurant and live there are a hundred percent of the time in order to succeed ah so I Know it's a very demanding kind of or a job but so it was printing because you're working with a lot of deadlines I Would assume\nWell it's the nature of the beast and it becomes more and more but there's been a lot of consolidation so things have changed there as well when I first came there were eight or nine of us here in town and now there's a two or three left\nAnd and you and you did tell me that Mary as the boss is that right\nShe is indeed a forty years you are you learning you move on [laughter] that's how I learned\nHow as a similarity between the restaurant business and the printing business or anything that you can take from wind and years and the other\nAbsolutely um the ah attention to detail John is probably the the biggest factor\nWhen you're buying something and it's three or four dollar item and every person is evaluating what you're doing\nYou become hypercritical it's much different than selling a hundred thousand dollar building\nTo one person and it's a big transaction that takes a long time the restaurant business just the opposite so printing has that same sort of nature of the size of the job is smaller and the criticism of it is equal on each transaction\nWhat are some of the kinds of changes that you've seen Tom in ... in this area or a say in middle Tennessee and the market here that you serve I Know you probably serve other markets as well but this is where your focus so\nAbout we were talking to a couple of weeks back about elevators page mhm now that one thirty second diatribe of what it is you do and paper I ask you that elevator what is yours sad lack\nOf Johnny I haven't been in be an eye for a while [laughter] you know they they make you they make\nYou have that elevator speech but if it were me in ten seconds I Would say that you know where we put your best out there regardless of the type of business as we try to encapsulate it you know we focus on what you're doing on to make you as effective as possible and we do it relatively inexpensively\nSo for from your vantage point assist same issue whether you're talking about a greeting card thanking a customer or a calling card or something you're praying that's a brochure type thing or a political\nCampaign I mean they all they all have\nThe same issues what do we projecting how do we rejected and how do we most effectively get it to the most number of people\nThat's great thank you ... what happens with the politicians [laughter] when they come in [laughter]\nWell I I Am standing of your business I'm I'm an ex county commissioner semi [laughter] uh I think I've seen a little\nToo much but it really has helped me in trying to help others mhm and um oh I I was active in four or five campaigns in the last election and all but one of them was successful\nAnd I don't really understand why the one wasn't but uh he should have been doing a good job and so um we've done a lot through mailing we've done a lot through focusing of messages and that's you know that's not any\nDifferent whether you're campaigning or you're creating a business or you know\n... from my own experience and I have no creative genius is so I've always had ... people like you to provide that creative touch on information that I wanted to transmit papal otherwise you'd just be Plano I plan on copying nobody would ever read it\nRight and you know the the important thing there Johnny to touch on that a little bit is that we have so many different avenues of marketing these days there's everything from mailing to Internet to\nBrochures to printed materials and all of those need to work together to the effect we are only one part of that but but it all works is one when you do it well\nYou're you're spreading out your services though you said something before about some new directions or fixing\nWell we've been I'm printing for a secured printing for banks so we're printing statements and we have a highly secure rum and uh we do everything from soup to nuts for them in terms of printing it inserting it mailing it\nAnd the founding sonic I don't need to worry about the other banks that you're doing work with\nA no you don't okay um we we are very\nYou know all that those who compliance and all those things that we don't even let ... anybody else's information touch or ...\nYou could actually court died all of these desperate a media is er into one message than whether it's on the Internet or whether it's a male out or what\nWe're doing a website now for a governmental candidate yeah\nI Know that ... typical male or the old fashioned way say the post office you you expect their spots right of about ... per se and is it better on the Internet are worse on the Internet will there are there and made him\nA it's much worse on the Internet or Johnny there you can either do it targeted where you're going after a certain demographic and your your king let's say you're a homeowner\nThat owns the house it's over a hundred thousand dollars that's one time\nIs mainly to every homeowner you're going to lower your a response rate but you're going to have more of it so it's a we we tend to do more focused or targeted marketing when we do it\nThat's the best use of their money at it is it is so it's it's\nMore per mailer but it's still less than four and overall costs how's your\nUh involvement ban with 'em over the years with organizations like murder in chamber of commerce I've\nDone my time I was president rotary three years ago or so three or four years has been a while um but um those are really every

I was intrigued by this a secure may like he called it the district I didn't know you all did that so you do you do it to more than just banks\nWell it's a it's a process that we're able to do for just about any large volume mailer it involves says the printing and insertion and mailing of whatever it might be whether it's in envoys\nA statement a recall notice those sorts of things to generally larger volume mailers and we're trying to expand that part of our business as we're the only ones in the upper Cumberland that are that are available to do this process\nSo what kind of security measures do you take with respect to the people that are working in this area\nWell everything is under lock and key there is there's a visual camera system\nUm everybody is scrutinized in terms of working there and signing non disclosures that sort of thing right and we don't allow anybody in the room the actual room itself without tracking them and keeping track of them coming and going\nOkay so it's not like a normal ... said at the front desk or something like that you know it's much more control\nIt is and I understand you can't even bring a ham sandwich with through or something so you can [laughter] it was All right what what's the most important lesson time that you've learned about customer service\nI think it deals with consistency in a with treating people's away you know the golden rule but\nCertainly consistency and so um you know as with any employees and employer you try to train that into folks in other words I Know they're not going to be me but I said I Want them to reflect\nWhat I feel is important and so we we have production meetings twice a week to ensure just that than in\n... so what you're saying it was also nudity so it applies also to motivating employees and hiring and firing and they're absolutely not just customer service was all of that\nDoes fluency is a name for hesitations like I'm at a to get an understanding of why they creep into our speech Iran and soon as you have to know how we talk what's going on when our brain and our mouth work together it might surprise you to learn that we don't speak in sentences\nSentences are something that will be more familiar and writing rather than speaking what we're doing when we're talking is that were assembling groups of words and sometimes those words group as smaller or larger units\nAnd there's a basic architecture to those phrases and to those clauses that we sat in our minds first\nAnd then we go and we select the words to fit in that architecture and then we associate the sounds with those words so it's kind of a linear process say one thing that happened than another happening nothing happens\nSo we plan what we want to say the phrases and clauses than we say they're simple enough but ... says it sometimes things get a little jammed up on the assembly line of our spontaneous conversations\nNow in the process of planning what to say we can't speak at the same time we're most of us find it very difficult to do both of those things simultaneously and so we plan and then we think and then we plan and then we think and very fast cycles fractions of seconds\nBut still they're cycle and we're kind of moving back and forth between planning what to say and then actually saying it\nAnd so the other phenomena are these moments where we are alternating between planning and speaking or maybe where we get stuck in a planning phase\nAnd so we fall silent maybe or we decide to fill the silence with a little sound sometimes it's an a or an um sometimes it's a word like you know or well\nThe problems will buy some time and don't work the listener that we are done talking so please don't interrupt it also gives our audience a little insight into our mind is working speaking of insight there's another verbal mistake that's been touted as an unconscious look into the deepest recesses of our mind the friday and slip\nYou could describe what the flip it and say well these two sounds swaps with each other or you selected the wrong word and you asked for say a condom and set up a condiment\nThe Freudian part of it is where you come in and you say why did the person make that flip with that word when it seemed to produce\nSome kind of meaning that we can interpret as having some sexual innuendo behind it or having something slightly salacious or obscene or having something slightly hostile\nThan there is the ... the news ... offer some examples saying equivocal when you meant to say equivalent or Tim Marines instead of trampolines when we hear people make verbal selects or use a lot of ... and ...\nArt or that they're hiding something from us there ... says the evidence points to something else\nSeemed pretty natural to want to come to a pretty broad sweeping conclusions about somebody based on the way that they're speaking are they lying can I trust them are they smart enough to do the job that I've asked them to do\nAnd things like that and all of the reading that I did which involved a pretty massive search\nThrough the literature in which there is an attempt to try to link this fluency and slipping behavior with certain kinds of personality traits\nWith pie cues with education level with all the things there's no reliable link between them so what I conclude is\nThat the ... the particularly is a pretty good indicator of state\nSo someone state of mind someone's emotional state they're not very reliable indicators of traits intelligence character leadership a tendency to lie for instance\nAnd to use the fluency in that way really starts to border on a kind of linguistic discrimination where you come to conclusions about who someone is essentially based on the way that they speak\nIn our segments on viewpoints we usually score about all the homes are long pauses and some of the tongue our gas to make for the sake of time and to keep their answers flowing\n... suggested that we try an experiment to let our listeners decide for themselves if editing has any effect on what they think of his speech so here use continuing his thoughts on the perception of truthfulness and verbal slips and fluency first the edited version\nThe notion of what is considered truthful is now I think becoming a little more like just natural parking which so we'll have hesitation going to have the norms and it as well now just as there is a stereotype that people who are speaking\nFluently aren't telling the truth or maybe who are educated\nThere's a stereotype on the other side which has just as dangerous I think which is just because someone is hesitating when they're speaking or just because someone was saying oh I Know that they're necessarily more spontaneous and authentic I think that's a dangerous stereotype is well\nNow how he really set\nThe notion of what is considered truthful is now I think becoming a a little more I'm a little more like just natural talking with some of them have\nHesitations in it and will have the norms and it as well now you know just as much as just as there is a stereotype that\nPeople who are speaking fluently aren't telling the truth or maybe who are educated ah there's a stereotype on the other side a which has just as\nDangerous I think which is just because someone has had hesitating when they're

does the edited one making easy to listen to or a little too slick too scripted\nHow about the uncut version using natural unbelievable for his thoughts muddled like he's not really sure what are you

there because the level of wealth is nothing more than a scorecard folks you know that how you get there and what you do to give back and what you do to help others is really what defines your character\nAnd today's guessed and her family have set a great example for decades of what I'm Talking about Evelyn water is the senior corporate vice president of the state Law Order companies and I will tell you right now it's a title that she just wasn't handed out because she was a family member\nAnd in fact everyone Lauder the daughter in law of American icon Estee Lauder has been one of the chief regions for the world wide growth\nOf the Estee Lauder companies here to share some of what she's learned along the way and the wisdom and importance of giving back\nIs Evelyn Lauder ... welcome to legends of success thank\nYou very very much John I'm delighted to be here\nYou know everyone even before we go back to the history I just wanted to point one thing out from everything I've been told from family members or you know and others you really did have a very very special relationship that we are ... that went beyond most mother in law daughter in law relationships am I correct absolutely\nWell first of all she had an amazing mother in law\nAnd laughter with Joe and mom and she tells me when I first got married like she lost her mother in law and my mother in law was and she said I Want to be the same kind of mother in law and she said enhanced my rule\nWell ah my parents and I lived on the west side and I went to the New York public schools my father was in the diamond business\nAnd um he found a beautiful yellow diamond actually on my mother found this yellow diamond that I'm wearing on the street in Nineteen forty seven when I was a little girl and a and those days nobody a value to color stones\nBut at any rate he did well and then they went into retailing\nAnd my mother was a very very fine sales person she taught me how to sell like all my life\nBecause every once in a while they would always be of someone who was ill and I had to come in and give them the hand after school\nAnd um I went to the finest public schools in New York\nA Hunter College high school and then on to college when I was a freshman in college I'm One of my high school friends was dating a real nice fellow by the name of Bob Bob best friend was a boy by the name of Leonard laughter\nAnd so Stephanie invited me to a party that her parents what giving and her parents told her that she couldn't have Bob and Bob could bring Leonard if she can get an update for Leonard\nSo that the four of us could hang around while they were having a party for the grown ups with the you know they were thirty\nPeople there reached so um my um my first date with Leonard was a blind date\nThat within range by my friend Stephanie and I'm Larry came and picked me up and my dad met him and they talked for a couple of minutes and then we went over to Stephanie's house\nThan when I got home my father was sitting in the living room which he never did he was usually waiting up to me and that and and so I thought something bad has happened to my mother\nAnd so I said what are you doing in the living room what's happened to mom and she said nothing nothing's happening to mom I\nJust want you to know that's a nice boy\nWow what am I Am surprised that you know it was terrible it was just getting involved\nThere was only Eighteen or why didn't need\nThat pressure being a done usually does he was being darling I was so I was such a bad thing\nI Would like to tell you a little boy\nNo no just the reverse and when his mother met me she said the same thing to him and he said oh my God and neither one of us were ready for a relationship because he was very young and just about to go into the navy and I was just starting college\nSo it wasn't until\nI graduated and then he got out of the navy that we started to date and then I'm\nI'm about a year later we were married so we knew each other really he was my best friend I'm Still surprised that I married him and he's still surprised that he married at the house and they're really why is because we were such good friends and we really liked each other we enjoyed talking about\nA variety of topics we never kept our mouth shut and we were always talking about something and\nHe let me a book I never returned I sit and you know eventually said well I have to marry you if you\nDon't get me back the book I said okay\nLet me ask you what was it like when you first met us well I\nMet her right in the beginning of when I met Leonard and she really was very very nice to me\nAnd she was um she asked me to to help her ... of it as a hostess I'm with a surprise birthday party she was going to do for him and uh she had it at her home\nAnd uh she said she afterwards you know she loved the way I dressed for the party\nThat um and and she liked the way I really did help her\nA as a host and I introduce people to each other I met people for the first time and um\nYou know um we got along very very well she was really always good to me\nWhen she how successful was the motor company's point how ... was the meter was or not for long in\nYou know very sensitive about that John in fact nobody had ever heard of Estee Lauder when I met them it was a very small company I Believe they had only started in business a few years earlier had just been the launch of the\nPhenomenal fragrance which became subsequently called youth do which has been a a serious seller for well over fifty years which is\nLonger than most fragrances have lives and um you know she\nUh when I stood behind the counter after I was married um\nAnd people would come up to the counter I the first thing I Would say was have you ever heard of that scene laughter and they say well I bet she's related to sir Harry Lauder now I had never heard of this or Harry Lauder\nYeah because we're both to young Sarah Harry Lauder was the I'm a dance hall artist\nScottish who was very very famous\nIn England and I'm In Scotland and many many people knew him here and he was very popular here\nThings kind of changed your own little to the [laughter] now they're they're asking Harry's ... relatives are you related to the U.S they felt\nThat they now when I go in a if I if I you know you charge card and people see mine named they say are you related to se Lauder so I always say oh I Wish I were [laughter] I don't want them all day and now the address off that don't want them to put together\nYou're smart smart you know going back to the beginning I'm going to read you a quote out of a book I heard you reissued this was going to be a success story and and this is what else the lord or had to say\nShe said nothing happens fast many stories have surrounded the growth of big business certainly my big my big business and most of them are miss the most of the city is midst of all is the one the promises magic formula is an instant success that doesn't happen that way I cried more than I ate there was constant work\nConstant attention to detail last hours of sleep worries ... friends and family didn't let a day go by without discouraging must do you remember her telling you any of these stories are experiencing this\nYes and the beginning I'm One of the great stories that Leonard likes to tell us how the lawyer and the account ... and the friends and family discourage them\nFrom going forward and um so what he says is lawyers make good lawyers accountants make good accountant but if you want to be in business what you're doing stick with it\nAnd you persevere and it will happen\nYes and you know that's really great advice folks if you're just tuning in we're visiting with apple in water the senior corporate vice president will be yesterday loner companies and she's she's sharing with us the story really of the beginning of the yesterday Lauder company she was there really from the very first few years\nAnd uh this is truly has been a story from everything I can tell in my research Evelyn\nI'm ... you are a very integral part of the growing it his business so we get back from a break coming up we're going to talk about what you did as a matter of fact uh Estee lifted that you had a number of first you introduced to the company but right before my one question is and we got about a minute here before we take a break Evelyn\nUm how did you finally decided to work for the company because I Believe you're a teacher first correct\nI was a teacher and what happened is that I was married and let it and I wanted to start a family right away and I was very fortunate and I was able to conceive quickly and um so about two months after we were married I discovered that I was pregnant and\nAt that time there were no vaccines for me though and the doctor said there's no way that you're going to go back to school\nSo I'm I was very upset because I had never not gone to school as a student or as a teacher and so um what I said to let it was when I\nUm during this period why don't I developed the first training manual record was for the beauty advisors and teach with people who are

wellness asked\nFor post deliberate you going to talk about exercise and things that we could do mentally and physically after we give birth you're listening to talk radio I'm a shelter them with passport mommy don't forget you can go to the website passport mommy dot com sign up for some free giveaways and hips and follow up on social\nAt passport mommy and when you had to pass poor mommy dot com I have a section about all the trips that I've taken before and after baby a lot of tests on family travel if you're traveling for the first time with little ones just what to expect at the airport\nWhat to know when it comes to me even bringing wrestle with you on the airplane so many pets also some tips on great products if you are prenatal post natal I have my recommendations there and if you've ever met an episode of the radio show you can go to the radio section and they will all be listed\nThere are a pot cats form more coming up in just did you\n\n\nGo crazy quilt ... field is sponsoring the southern charm will show to be held at the Jackson avenue church of Christ in ... bill on friday November nice Saturday November ... from nine AM to afford the mission for bus stations\nSo what would you say if you had to name one exercise now to work on after or even while you're pregnant to try to minimize the ... what would you recommend\nExercise that I I really love the bird dog exercises you know you're on all four on your hands and knees\nOn keeping control signs and keep your core muscles polled anti your backs case straight and extend out your opposite arms and legs you know you get your arm and a leg into a straight line he ah\nHe come back down you repeat on the opposite side um it's safe carrying all three times a day and it's something that after you have to ... you could start feeling almost right away I also love healthy cells um they don't necessarily help to close the gap\nPelvic till I'm you know he rocker hips so running back and do you keep that flexibility of your lower back and you're pelvic for muscle so that's another really good exercise to do during pregnancy and stardom great\nGreat and I love I Can't wait to check out your app and I I Want to talk more about what's including me out but before I forget what is the charge for the I\nAm completely free wow only yeah it's only available on apple right now but it is a hundred percent free and we do have an Android waiting lists so if somebody wanted to go to the website which is matriarch ask\nDot com or they could email us and and get get on that Android waiting list as well so\nThat is terrific because I Know a lot of times with apps like this it's usually they'll give you very basic information for free and then if you want more if you want to see exercises\nOr videos then you have to pay so that's a really nice service that you're doing with this because in addition to exercises you also are working on mom's mental health out there should give birth which I think\nIt's so important because again we focus so much on the labor and on the baby but there isn't a lot of talk of mom\nAbsolutely I found that during pregnancy there was a lot of positivity and a lot of\nUm you know people and information and education and and your mental health and everything for the for the mom for going after the baby ... awkward is over ... we'd really he really wanted to create something that was very bomb centric show the ap has some audio meditations\nUm we have a curated news feed where we feed in articles on wellness fitness and nutrition and exercise\nUm we also have a community forum that we've built out that women can can\nSo in addition to the to the exercises you know like you said we want it to have a well rounded approach to mom I'm overall health and well that that's\nGreat and I think that community is so important because I Know\nAgain after I gave birth to my daughter\nI was just so wrapped up in being a new mom and everything\nGoing on with that that I barely got out I didn't mean new moms for probably I don't know six or seven months and but to have that community on line just to be able to share like oh my gosh my baby's going through this is this normal or had to deal with this had to deal with that it's just such a sad\nLife saving thing to have because\nIf you just don't know these things as the first time parents [noise]\nNo I agree I think a lot of women are really struggling with that loneliness factor right after giving birth and\nUm you know having the new baby and not sleeping and everything that goes along with that\nSo um and I can attest to censor that same thing I'm lucky enough that um I have a lot of family close by and some good friends that I'm getting out of the house and and the people are having an on line to the enemy you know one or who other I think it's very important right\nAbsolutely so you also mentioned you have a breathing ring on the point is that [noise]\nUm breathing ring is something that you can do to keep me up\nAnd and it it's a visual you know the ring expand you inhale it it deflate you exhale um it's really something that is a tool that we used to kind of lower your heart rate that you are needing to having them home and had to wear a feeling really stressed out to\nMeet a second you know you can focus on the ring and we also have some sort of an issue that I have a little bit of sound like there's a waterfall and\nWatch the waterfall and your clock is peaceful fell and I've had a bunch of women tell me that it's something that they like to look at when they're nursing because it has this like relaxing sounds that goes with it and it's called ...\nIt is right there feeling really anxious you know they can go to there were so rude images that just kind of watch that play the sound as well so it can be good for a mom and the south and everything it's kinda good for baby too\nYeah that sounds great and even still when you're prenatal prenatal it's all you want to keep the stress levels down and look maybe your aggravated at your husband or work or whatever the case that's a good thing to do just go right to the up and watch some of those images\nAbsolutely and I think that you know we've kind of got the reputation of being a postcard 'em out but I Do think you know the meditation that community forum the images are news feed and some of the exercises are very relevant while you're pregnant as well right\nExactly and you also have a tracking system for your water intake meditation and exercises which I think is great because it's easy to forget in the day how much water you've had and it's so important to have a lot of water especially if you're nursing\nRight we knew that we weren't going to have the full capability you know to track calories or track suit but if we could at least track water because that is something that a lot of women under ...\nYou know just how much water they need a shit actually if they're nursing I'm Idaho at least having the water tracker ... you know I felt was really important\nI'm In one more thing I just want to touch on a before I forget he you know these exercises and these meditation it doesn't matter if you are six weeks those ... are you had your last kid six years ago um these exercises can still help you I've had a lot of women asked\nMe that you know and say oh I had a baby three years ago is it too late for me and the answer is you know most definitely not as ... if you never did any core impulse\nShark and feeling some of these exercises and you're going to be a benefit from that um so I guess my you know all these you know even if it's in you know a few years since he delivered a right she'll still relative that its tail helpful um I've had women who had kids Twenty years ago and the ads that say\nUm you know I never did these told me I was supposed to do exercises I Do still having issues Twenty years later write a sentence and ah\nSo you know at the exercises are equipment free as well so there's that you can do just you know on the floor with a mat that's it\nAh that show the moms up that basically any mom get benefit from from the ap\nI Love it I Can't wait to download it Lara aren't thank you so much for joining me today I think the matriarch is extremely beneficial to both the prenatal and post natal moms anywhere and she said you don't

Thompson's was as big as any just because you know ... a little bit of momentum\nRice steps in front of the ball and and then you've got to go down score and how the football game how big is it banned the last couple of weeks to win the turnover battle and the loss of Georgia and then yesterday and the wind down at Auburn [noise] well\nWe need we need to get more\nTurnovers and we didn't we give up for sure so I think it helps uh that's probably the bright spot yesterday as we do it three turnovers then we had a kind of a goal and stop down there to hold on to fool go\nHow how impressive was that play by ... Thompson when he built back up his guy and and all that third down and batted the ball the way to help hold Auburn too that people go [noise]\nWell I think a lot yesterday a lot of our turnovers came because Mitt pressure up front hustler guys up front plate really well I'm I'm probably like much better than the guys in the secondary though the sick guys got turnovers was caused by the guy's a from a [noise]\nJumped in Congo obviously was playing really well yesterday before he went down can you update us on him at this point [noise]\nWell he's a unfortunately he's he's tours ACL and he's going to be out remains or the year and he'll have surgery and a couple of days and he'll get better from it and hopefully he'll get a chance to finish up his degree and continuous football career\nWho who quote you they're out there were conversations twenty four rules overall other\nHow excited how easy for you to see what your team can do\nFrom this when going forward and and how much better than what you can do to build on it [noise]\nFor Chris I been expecting to win every game with ... um so\nYou know we finally put sixty minutes together wasn't perfect but we did find a way and so um to me we're going to go back and work tomorrow are just like we have every week and will continue to do that as long as I'm here\nCan you share a little bit what your message was your football team in the locker room yesterday [noise]\n\nVery similar to the first five games there's lots of lessons to learn more we play well and execute we have a lot of success when we don't the other team to us so\nAgain it's about the people in the room that we control of the outcome and if we player best following executed a high level we have a chance to have success\nYou see in Alabama I'm through and through this layer of an assistant coach for a championship teams there this team of course I've seen for a long time to go back a ways and coach said that this team often weighs about is\nAs good an explosive as I've ever seen as you watch him on tape [noise] above the obvious that the guy pulled the trigger talk about all this pretty special what really jumps out to you about these guy [noise]\nWell I hadn't watched a whole lot yet we've been cleaning up their game and started\nNo special teams so I usually start about seven o'clock on the opponent but I Know the person they are they got really good personnel Michael actually does fantastic job spread the ball around their big up front and they have experienced\nI've got good ... good runners\nToo good quarterbacks and I'm enough wide receivers to go around for everybody and if you see\nThe first half of Georgia you your team falls behind\nThey've been struggling they lose the turnover battling Florida bill every reason to to you know smell it in and they didn't after that game obviously a lot was made that you know getting a little bit emotional about the fight they showed\nFrom there into the by week how big were those two weeks I Know you did a lot of recruiting and the staff without doing their you know trying to build for the future but when your team was on the practice field\nHow much did you see that kind of a light bulb continue to you know get bright a little bit for this group [noise]\nWell it's\nMy belief if you\nIf you invest in something and we've made our guys do that from the first day that we got here\nSo they have pride what they're trying to build a when you get vested locked in something you don't quit on it the sun never sets out our guys would quit a job just been waiting on them to continue to to learn to execute um the fights kind of been there we've been proved was that we gained a little bit of confidence\nI'm a little bit of experience we've got a very inexperience football team and we've had injuries and we continue to have and just that's part of football you're just somebody else has got to step up you keep play and that's why we practice the way we do for a player development and [noise]\nYou know we'll we'll have guys a little step up as a season goes and you know guys that started the first game might not start last game and so we just gotta practice each week and try to get better [noise]\nI Know what we talked in late December you've just taken the job and you're kind of doing some due diligence on on the whole ... thing [noise] um [noise]\nJust talk about everything that he's done that you've asked him to do and then now see him you know kind of work is William from just being a you know what a nice down the block or in the run game the catches a couple of passes to the break out kind of gave me had yesterday where he made a couple of fifty fifty balls and made some plays\nWhat's he meant from a just a you know a a mentality standpoint and your first year [noise]\nWell I think Joe on the winner um he loves the University of Tennessee has a lot of passion for this program and and wants to see us be at a fast or\nYou know I've said all along that he's not being healthy you know he\nHad he had knee injury missed spring sub disguise healthy cannon solved camp and it takes a while to get back into play and shape so he's he's finally getting where he's healthy and a hundred percent\nOne more wide receiver question Josh Palmer ... getting talked about yesterday about you know last year he had the drops and it was a rough year for him but he's not played a whole lot of football he's not from this country how have you seen him mature he continues to make plays for your off and so we can we get out\n[noise] well he's a fast guy um you know so that helps plan wide receiver or and and he is learning he's learning the position he's learned that the um how to play special things among them all the time about\nPlanned special teams so um he he's learning a little bit of every day and he's improvement [noise]\nYou talked about challenging your guys and then responding and you know I think that's what to me what separates the great ... says is creating that competition is challenging them every single day\nYou know you weren't hesitant when you hear a challenge every body that touches your program boon to fan the fans will six thousand plus Tennessee fans are yesterday to watch the team\nThey hadn't won an FCC football games in the end of the two thousand sixteen sees\nHow cool is that for you to see them yesterday I saw as you guys are leaving the field and sort of them to be able to vote at\nBut he has for this program um [noise]\nTo see our fans there they've been there they\nAre it's it's been great everywhere you go you can feel the spirit of the and the passion for Tennessee football I'm and I'm Glad that got us can deliver for almost ... brown [noise]\nWhere do you think to this point you obviously we know what kind of challenge awaits his team\nOn Saturday against Alabama June and where do you think this team has grown them most of the first 'cause you're right at right about the halfway point to the ... the most at this point you were by [noise] but again\nI just think we're so inexperienced we're we're we're kind of learning to jail together to offensive line that quarterback somewhat Sievers a guy's bounced around on defense I mean we should get better as a season goes uh that's what all teams do are good teams do and the\nAnd we got to do that we've got a long ways to go we were not even close to play in our best foot fall and we just got to work hard every day and do the little things the details and um\nThen hopefully good things will happen [noise]\nSo have I got to ask you this man ...\nThat first when\nSEC when did you get a few hours sleep last night or is the same old same old about four or five hours [noise]\nYou know my my wife grew up without an hour from all over and so her kids stayed down there so and I got home last not up on the TV and [noise] washed Alabama for a few minutes and once they [noise]\nWould you hear me we really do appreciate to spend some time and I know you know coaches always look ahead there there's no such thing as a review mirror before the tendency fan base that was a a pretty special day to see a your team go down there first I guess first when upset win over renting Tennessee since two thousand six when your\nCurrent boss filled full ... head football coach a tendency but we appreciate the time and they'll look forward to watch the news team grow\nYou say you know what that's that's the way I remember Tennessee receivers competing\nIn their old friend Jason Swain he\nPlayed a pretty mean receiver his day at Tennessee and he always talks about going out being dog and going and getting the football do and make a good place to be competitive and can you solve that allegation top catches ... and you saw that at all not just one or two guys just several guys\nYou know did and to be able to spread the football around like that in ... and become more difficult to seeing you know and just like I asked coach who earlier you know that's certainly something that seemed to be a law firm\nAnd to have any chance a Saturday\nThey're gonna have to make even more plays down the field\nThan they did it gets off because it gets you know they're just not Alabama so explosive they're going to score it's almost like a\nPlay and there was almost like it's funny to say this about an excitement teams but it's almost like football it's like hockey football and I say score so fast and they're so explosive now to talk about all I talked to people in around that program of course he actually to the game it gets to Missouri and the third quarter tweak the need to get hurt or spraying the\nWeek before Arkansas He practiced all last week talking lower did a saving telling the people that you know he could have gone back in the game and and to kill several his teammates afterwards that he was okay\nBut there was no reason to put it back in the game\nI don't think it's something that's going to I think he will he will practice again this week that they may limit him some\nBut my understanding Austin is not something that's really gonna affect their impact them throw the football maybe running a little bit moving around scrambling that kind of thing 'cause remember Alabama's got what we call\nAn open after this tendency game before they have to go to Eli issues so\nYou know he still has yet to take a snap and fourth quarter this year\nSome talk of Iowa so I got something to watch\nThis week and and they do have a guy behind him who's been on a few big states ceiling hurts this has been on the big stage in his career so the fact that so it's not like they don't have any body\nThey can't play it you know what when I when I last time I spent time a coach saving back in September I went down and sat down with him for\nFor some time before they play I think it was public places third game or second game and uh and he told me he said listen he said we need both up last year and will they both of them this year and at that point a lot of people were saying that remember that the it was almost forgotten inclusion or hurts ... there's no way\nThat he was going to play pass for games so he would red shirt go well\nHe's the one you see all these other guys a triple aren't trying to he's at one is still there and\nAnd and certainly when you get a quarterback\nYou know two weeks is the is it sure is nice to have a guy like that that you know you can count on you know who's done it you know he's delivered for yes he is he the kind of dynamic passer\nTo talk of aloe is no not even close but he's certainly going to win with\nOh there's no doubt about it I mean let's face it I mean they went to the national championship game for years two years with him as a starting quarterback and um you know he's been very solid one ear it just changes may change the route trees a little bit I mean and nobody\nJay ... you know not going to be able to do he make heat at St Louis like two and he doesn't spread the ball around the field and stretch the field in a way to talk of I lost by ... by lowest playing at a level\nThis year that I don't know that I've seen the quarterback play out in a long long time and it's not\nLike he don't have great players around to me there\n... there there is just a group or receivers and save it told me this to September he says we he's of course we we had a who live Joan we've had\nCalvin Ridley we've had a more a coup or can we never had this many guy\nAcross the board hate ... these are good to the can make plays and when you got Thirteen pulled the trigger does that kind of personal play makers it's scarier for everybody so uh we'll see it on to say I do anticipate us to talk about or playing I Would say that we have a a\nPretty short leash on him and not not to say that they think they're going to be up and you know I spent our good friend Jean what would your house who by the way is UT graduate treated earlier today so I say this with no disrespect to Tennessee but if you're Alabama to you just sort of set\nTo have to buy after that to this week no one there is a Bob before LSU course I fired back at him saying\nBoy when you come back to see\nOur friends praise and max and chicken hawks there and the equipment room you're going to get a pretty rude welcome to being the

again if we're ever listening we want you to call in one eight hundred seven to three\nEight to eight nine of at some complaints that I give the number a little too fast so we have a lot I mean we could probably do four hours tonight but we are going to start with two and again I'm I Want to pick up on something that the president has to use this past week\nUh we used a briefly last week on the program when he talked about the mob he is running against the mob or on the mob mentality and the Democratic party and this past week many in the media and many of the Democratic party\nTook exception with the use of the word mob they were saying that they were proud of now we have a debate over that but remember his quote last week was a you don't give a matches to arsonist and he is to just sing that by turning the Democrats\nBack in power a in at least in the house and Senate if you do that you're just turning a year you're turning old government over to a mom so that was the first used the term we have Republican operatives democratic operatives or wherever the economist or to talk a lot about the stock market and and some of the economic issues facing the country certainly that came to a head last week\nA genie I've let me start with you uh you're a state representative you ran against Bruce Rauner in the Republican primary you did that when you rent a tremendous race getting over forty percent forty eight percent of the Republican vote my question to you is\nA the president's use of the term mob is it the right word or is it a little over the top\nNo it's not a top at all 'cause that's what you see visualize everyday on TV you have literally\nHundreds of people gathering in some sort of a mob mentality\nAnd scratching at the Supreme Court door and and you know they just today in Chicago I mean they had a huge parade about moved to vote it was a very left leaning liberal parade it wasn't knocked out just voting rights in general and so you've got these mob doing it's there's look look bringing home\nHere in Illinois we've had a Winnebago Republican headquarters\nYou know literally spray painted with the word rape it's the same thing you saw in New York at a Republican headquarters spray painted\nAnd vandalized the repeatedly so you've got this mob throughout the United states in big cities in small city thinking that they can own the conversation and that anything the Republicans are doing is wrong\nPeter I want to get your reaction yeah I see it differently but go ahead I absolutely do I mean I think the thing is when you say mob and we're being attacked let's not forget when your party has the White House and majorities in the house in the Senate and you're still claiming the underdog position\nBut I think civility on on both sides and even a ... you know out outside of political uh I attended the political arena you know\nGene when we were talking before you had your sons football game on friday and you hear those horror stories some times of the crazy parents who are convinced their sophomore is going to the NFL next year I'm and they take it way too far\nAnd so and whether it's you know shoppers on Black Friday or the way the politicians are speaking to each other or trying to fire up their base even if you are speaking with people who are of like\nMind that I don't think it's helpful and and to say well civility has to go out the window of the other side does at first regardless of which side you're on that doesn't that it it's not helpful and that's certainly not going to progress and if and if Secretary Clinton is quote it then I I disagree with that quote\nThe amount of incivility ... on the rights towards the left is minimal compared to the left compared to the right\nSo I think that's what he writes in power and there's no no and even during the\n... think about the Tea Party movement and home it was all a power thing and this meant taxed enough already on it I I eat out\nSaying that that the president's birth certificate was a genuine concern\nNo but what was the where was the out where's the rallies where was the beating on the Supreme Court into doors ever that wherever that you know the the ... you know attacking Democrat headquarters and spray painting that means the stores where it's like that that the whole\nYou know short I mean so that's the thing so shortly after President Trump was elected and you saw a rise in where swastikas who'd been painted in public places\nAnd I never thought okay the are and see is responsible for those I thought that those those though that was fringe behavior from hateful people I never thought that that was sanctioned by any elected officials or any political bodies I thought that that was extreme and just tasteful behavior people on the\nThat that that does that look that than the Democrat senators never shouted down those who are being on several during the cabin out here and they could have arrested it themselves they could have taken control of that\nAnd like going ... and that's the problem\nHere that would have been Senator Grassley position as chairman of the committee to have authority on when the sergeant arms remove someone from the\nGhetto was removing them repeatedly but it just a a note from Feinstein and note from politically together said this is not how we act from ... who would have already we definitely helped seal because she's not in the Senate it doesn't matter she's still kind of set at the constituencies I'm\nA I'm a mentor for ... conservative students at DePaul and if they ever get out of line I tell them I I take them aside so you're not going to behave like this you're not going to be like them you're going to treat people with respect and you're going to make your arguments and they'll intellectual way not in a violent way\nWhy couldn't she'd do exactly the same thing I can use it and say this whoever it I mean at the end of the day go before the the camera anti hadn't really have to stop\nThe snow and they really want to read about Maxine Waters truly mean\nAbout the way that that that justice Kavanaugh's hearings were handled\nI think it was it was a it was a misstep on behalf of the Democrats to go in negative all the way from the very start because then one concerns came up and when the FBI investigation was uh was was initiated by the White House\nThere was nowhere to go so I think politically it was the wrong move\n'em so I I I Do disagree with the way it was handled and that it was no matter what we're going against him um and I I I Am as a Democrat I Am concerned that any momentum they thought they might have earned throughout that process uh is fleeting and it won't last\nBy the time the mid till I take I think it would rain but it have they lost a especially when they talk about Dianne Feinstein is a role in perhaps releasing the information of all she has denied it\nUh the the Democrats lost\nThe fairness issue it looked like they were being unfair to the American people and then you have the demonstrators out there many of whom were engaged in certainly ruckus behavior that doesn't play well to\nJoe and maple average citizen at home on TV so they lost that but then I think when ... led by Jeff Flake when he came back and suggested well we need this FBI investigation I think that was an attempt by you know Jeff Flake to say OK let's at least\nDo something fair or we're going to lose that we're all in it\nAnd if there's anything that that the law that that the Democrats that we come out of the Kavanaugh hearings and and and you know and whether it's the Gorsuch hearings obviously the cabinet ones or you know far fresher and the memory\nGood elections matter so if if the goal is to try and motivate turn out that I Hope that that's what it's used for rather than to try and and and degrade any any Senate hearing process it's going to be I think it's going to win reelection battle site and I hope and\nBirth and Peter I think there is one thing that we're missing here too is that you had this whole mob thing going on but then you also had the politics of personal destruction going on which was completely one hundred percent controlling\nAnd I just went to church and the word now because a large number from mine were not flipping ours or anything like that or I'm moving\nOn from ... the other thing that occurred in the politics of personal destruction that something that I'm following a number of its state races and very closely in that same sort of mentality is happy here in Illinois where you have\nPeople literally ... decent hardworking just Republicans running for office never ran for office before\nThey never ... elected seat before and they're saying that their child predators connecting them or that they support child predators connection as like donations to them cycled around through the United states from one donor folks when it gets\nThat it's personal destruction smear tactic and it's nothing about policy and that can't be where our politics go\nWe risk but we're responsible and get your response to this uh this is from a John listening to us on cable I in\nA Idaho these liberal thugs and tyrants had better be careful this country is already in a civil Cold War and it won't take much to make it turn hot\nIt's going to be interesting to see what happens on November six when there was no blue wave my fear is that we're seeing in Portland, Oregon this weekend will look like a day in the park so one\nOne thing I I Do want to follow up on a ... point and I I agree that the extent and the frequency and the speed at which personal attacks enter the political sphere\nIt it's very disheartening because then you start to look at the people and I suppose present company included because I've run in this atmosphere or even though I ran in the Democratic primary in which I was unsuccessful um\nBut you are exposing yourself to that and you are going into that knowing that that it's a possibility so then you start to look and say so what sort of people are attracted to that environment and are those the kind of people who who should and I think that's where the process I'm so\nJak than have to that and and then honestly I mean how how how do we can put rate times\nOn that while while still you know well I I don't know and that's that's a very difficult to an end to the gentleman Ottawa who said it'll burst Idaho I'm I was just thinking early primary stir or the early ... states there um\nFor for the for the behavior that and for any destruction that took place in Portland I certainly condemn that that that has no place regardless of what side and and whether it's related to any of it or would you would you acknowledge\nThat may be that the Democratic party or its leaders have got to be more\nVociferous in trying to separate the Democratic party members who are let's say the the God fearing I'm Talking to but there's a lot of Democrats out their love their country\nBut they've got to explain to those constituents and to the general public end of the media that you know what's happening in Portland and antifa and black and white lives matter uh you know may not represent all of the Democratic party especially on pizza I mean this is\nThese are ... I don't think either that or I think\nI learned there they they they show up and their direct the way that it's out there and they act\nMasks on I mean these are like a laser like\nThe ... I I I I think it's very important to to condemn the behavior for people who who do want to peacefully protest but to say what they do it but I I agree and and that that's the problem it is it is you know night and like\nYou mentioned destroying property when or or leaving a mass after you after you protesting you exercise your right to to express yourself\nBut to do it peacefully and to do it respectfully and if you are able to crowd and you're the loudest voice well good for you but there is no reason and it doesn't strengthen or a Fort Ord for make your message any more valid to be disrespectful to be hurtful to be destructive\nAnd yes I Would hope that the leaders of the Democratic party say it's in the best interest not only\nIf not Republicans doing that but also\n[noise] but that's the thing for us to take the high road if you only one kind of thing\nBut he didn't want to bring that Ira\nWhen we come back after taking the high road\nWe're going to talk about the high road to the White House last week\nAnd I thought wow this is pretty cool I'll tell you one thing that that bothers me more than anything\nI'm being a white male\nI can be anything I Want and no one will ever say that I'm a traitor to my race or something like I can be a Marxist that can be a free market version but the moment that somebody\nArgues against what is considered the standard view of black Americans you're a what the what was the expression they use them they called him a bony grills humble and they called him a horrible thing time just because he was thinking\nHis own and until that's gone until ... something like ... how the heck he wants to thank you you only can be totally free you said you wanted to be free and be able to to to raise your ideas you can't do that if you're going to be put into identity pop box at night\nAnd that's the thing like I understood why he said it made him feel like a superhero me because of the simple fact when he put on their head and empowered him yeah go against everybody else was San ... you're not supposed to do with us and\nIsrael does he also said that racism was not making black men shoot other black men\nRight um I I think it also it offers a really interesting and and I think you know regardless of where you stand on President Trump I mean the man is certainly fascinating\nI mean we I Can't remember the last time we had a president who either wasn't coming from from the legislative body um or or elected officer or as a or the military\nAnd I think to see how the president can be swayed an issue you mentioned that the president was all in with a attorney general sessions that they were going to try and push stop and frisk here in Chicago and the ... to ...\nCar Daschle and was able to get a woman is Frank and I and I think they'll look at like Sylvester Stallone was the primary voice behind um drought behind ... hijack a Johnson's pardon so I think you see a lot about\nIf you want to influence the president you know if you go in with with with an economics professor and say look Mr President these tariffs are an awful idea please don't do them if you bring Michael Jordan to the White House and he says look\nAs a hall of famer and six times championship winter we don't need these tariffs\nI think you know which one the president's going to listen to so if that then changes how people approach the White House but I think it is very very clear that you know it it's a very different way of being attracted to information that hasn't happened before at\nThat level I I'm I'm ... I'm Out very actors as as a house but go ahead Jenny\nMight like I I think it's fascinating that to try to is supposed to be you know\nNot somebody who's maybe friendly with the African American community are and like I said before that the ... the idea that the Republicans said that's not the party of Republicans have had the party of\nThat that that they would respond to the fact that Trump has actually embrace folks like him and had them come in and listen to him I think that that fabulous\nThis is not new for the president to be around entertain as before he was president you had Jay Z you had Puff Daddy you has Snoop Dogg all them partying with him\nThat the he hasn't changed his stripes always been that\nEverybody out to everybody else does it not that the Republican presidential narratives that they\nWant to take them all was the Republican president\nIsn't that has been aged ... to have it so I got to the point I Want to\nFind out what how little whether this this meeting as as a as some residents mhm is that that that I Know and I heard this shortly after President Trump was elected a and this is part of a strategy\nThe president's goal he got eight percent of the black vote right much time his goal is to get over\nTo double it that's right and he really wants to get to twenty percent if he thinks and and I've heard this from senior strategist right if they get to twenty percent of the black vote for him\nDemocrat will be destroying the Democratic party that's right the Democratic party will be destroyed that that all of our audio levels now first of all do you agree with that number how realistic is that number\nI mean I I agree wholeheartedly um\nThe fact that somebody is Democrats take for granted\nTap say take the black vote for granted that's why I'm nonpartisan\nUm for a person that's going to come in and make a change in my community I Walk for gun violence I Walk for black people first because that's what got me when you see a visual that's
