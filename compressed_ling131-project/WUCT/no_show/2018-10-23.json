David thank you thank fully it's come and go you know coming in everybody expected Alabama to hand it to us and\nUh they did and I think people they were prepared for it but they weren't prepared\nTo see Alabama just\nCome out the first quarter it put it\nTwenty four to nothing at all those didn't look good for your being generated and whatever it what was in the first quarter bother twentieth another twenty eight okay but you know the\nFirst Dr Tennessee had a couple of chances on third down if they could just get a stop in Alabama kept making first downs and then a tongue below it just made a great throw to get at first touchdown and then it seemed like that took a lot of the starch and did\nIt and we got to expose earlier up into glide still not any good I mean that that was pretty early and it it showed through the gang if you cannot\nUh and you can't run the football you're going to get beat to death and that's what happened yet I don't think anybody is\nAnd I think people were hoping that we would compete with them and I think the most disturbing thing you look at the staff I just looked the money running backs that okay we take the the quarterbacks out of the cause of fact I think turned on in my thirties but\nI think we only ran a ball for like sixty yards and it was like two and a half yards of caring for just a running back used this is not you can't win you can't you can't stay in games uh when when you can't run the football like long protect your quarterback\nWell in the ah the Auburn game the running in laws are better but Tennessee was able to convert third long and you can't live on converting third law you\nCan't you know we talked about that last week and it was great\nThat here in town it was a parade on third downs I think and\nWe had we converted a couple of seconds and long and we we converted more third and long since second in law yeah last week than you do and normally three games\nYou know the they took they took Callaway out of the game I mean you know just list did kind of a bill Belcher you take one of the ... you take those guys that are making plays and Kelly made a bunch of place now Jennings it a better job of making some place but yeah it was just it was just it was just not good anyway any way you cut it I mean\nA Alabama's good we know that um but I think pets are we we kind of got exposed\nHide as quarterbacks evaluate to atone Novello of how do you think he was\nPretty good I mean like\nI Would love to play with that off it's a lot of people to run the ball and all those throw those receivers that it would make it out and I said I'd be like to uh but now that can be pretty successful in that\nFade I I'm kinda with Jeff ... it's it's really hard to evaluate him I think he's he's got a quick release and I've watched you not only in this game but other games during the season he does a really good job of just slide and then finding his spots and gets the ball that quick and he's extremely accurate\nEspecially on dollars down the field he he hits the guys in stride he's very when his guys are open yeah I mean they don't even slow down 'cause he puts the ball right on which is extremely impressive\nPart of me being an old quarterback is you know I don't know how good he really is 'cause I don't know that anybody has that type of protection and the guys and there'll be a speedy as of yet and then I got a lot of\nThe quarterback you you need guys around you to play well too ... says I mean you can really screwed up the quarterback you guys are good but you've got to have you got to have protection you gotta have guys who will get it he's got all the pieces that place is pretty darn good himself\nToday a coach proof that his press conference and he talked a little bit and we'll hear that clip and just a few minutes about quarterback protections talking about the fact that ... got hit a lot in the game and the ... kind of say what part of that says fall\nAbout protections and stuff to talk about what a quarter backs responsibility is to get the protection set up and make sure you get them out of a bad play on my opinion on that\nDifferent than I Do think I think a lot of quarterback facts are on the quarterback I really do I think a lot of them are not so much getting hit ... at first I got to be able you got to know where you're protecting wing or not I mean you if the guys running free\nI mean you didn't know that you know we I mean we are protected you know at least a you're counting for guys a lot of time most submit protected you can protect one side you can't do both you got to know where those ... um so I think a lot of it's not a quarter by\nNow the defenses seemed to be pretty sophisticated I agree I mean asking and all that I\nAgree with Jeff in that you you should know which side you're protected on I mean that's a given but I think football\nKen has gotten too complicated a fence ... where they want you switch and play what you look at who's here and you're always trying to switch doesn't run or switch to pass football shouldn't be that complicated it is\nYou have two or three protections\nAnd you go with them or I Am protected on this side\nI'm not protected on this side you make it simple for the guy\nI think they make it way too confusing for him but but the quarterback got a ... he's gotta he's gotta direct that stuff I mean even like back in ... years the eight we would fly protections in your ... you had to know your protect yeah I mean that's that's how you START I mean if you can't play unless you understand protections as a quarterback but\nIt may not forgotten as the block is one thing I also think though I mean there is an innate sense I mean you can't tell like Dan Marino never got sick because he got rid of the ball\nUm so I Know I'm just one of those like every time I was I Can't like whenever I got second I thought it was my fault that held the ball why didn't I promise [laughter]\nAfter watching the bill would attest to that I Am proud of I got\nRid of the bottom quickly to want to treat is either gone awry or whatever they\nTell her Christ comes in though and gets has time seemingly has time to throw what was the difference why to risk it throws off in ...\nHe got rid of it yeah I mean he did say he did a nice job but I'm not saying there's a quarterback controversy here ... starting quarterback but it is good to see that tendency doesn't have a guy that if you're a ton of struggling you know you you may be put them in their first mark\n... do you think he picked up the productions better is of course today and his comments and whenever I get in with him and the second\nHe kind of said both quarterbacks made it a lot of mistakes so even though critics came out through to touchdown passes the kennel edge of believe that maybe he wasn't quite as a I was thinking that he played a perfect game though well when you get the like that nobody play perfect I mean there's enough blame to go around\nYeah and I agree with that but what he did was\nYou know he he got he got the bottom of his hand because he knew\nWhatever protection was he was going to get bombed coming they're coming out of character picked up or not there come and he got it out of\nHis hands if our number ... and the big orange hotline here a dead end barbecue is one eight hundred six eight

Ninety 'cause I was very ... ball where they had a a downpour the Missouri like struggle with the second or third yeah or sent out a lot yeah it was one of those like when you when you kind of what we thought there was one of the way\nIt was a pro along downpour to what you can see what's going to he's endeavor didn't\nWrite it team that we're we've got to go to Columbia and play and they do yeah that's a touchdown favorite going in and so we better you know teams have had their struggles we got we got to have a quick and ah get our minds right because\nWhat what kind of games they need yeah what kind of advantage though is that for South Carolina now to come up this open date catch tendency really in a ...\nKind of like a plane over you know we had that Oprah date kind of really helped us I think you up and focus on the game you just hope that they don't\nBother most coming off its laws and all this I don't\nKnow how you handle it Bob I mean you know we we get you different opinions when we talked about yoga week while it was going on a\nTennessee obviously handled very well uh as South Carolina handles it the same way there will be another long Saturday\nI dunno sale plays out one of the things that the titles you'll have to do is play well in the office to blindly had a chance to talk with some of the center Ryan Johnson that's this\nIt's got to be great and we spoke with the Tennessee center Ryan Johnson\nI I really enjoy the adjustment though it's a it's a fun position it's you get to make a lot of calls and you are a lot of responsibility but I enjoy the position you know I'll play whatever position the coaches need me to play a heck if they want me to take some snaps and er and throw a couple a passes I Will but I don't think that's going to happen anytime soon\nYou get banged on every play though it centered on she got to get used to that you\nDefinitely do it's a physical position um it's also a male position and I like I like the combination of both you know it's a it's it's really a a a a a mental game it's almost like a chess game to me um but you definitely have to be a tough to play that often so opposition\nPeople forget that the center has to set the front you got to pick up blitz is you've got to do a bunch of different things so you really got to be smart and understand and do a lot of film watching I guess [noise] definitely definitely I watched quite a\nBit of film during the week and do a lot of studying of my opponents um and so it's it's it really is it's really almost like being a the quarterback of the office of wine somebody explained it to me one time that the ... coordinator says hey\nWe're gonna we're gonna go eat steak tonight and the quarterback says hey we're going to go ... Chris and I say we're going to have a a rib eye and baked potato butter only\nAnd so you know you you you do have a little bit of responsibility there center and uh so it's it's it's kind of fun but it's also challenging\nYou guys are coming together I mean it really came together and the Auburn game and going forward or the more success you have throwing the ball really is kind of on your back you know what I think dolphins\nHas been doing a great job we've uh we've been working really well as a whole and we've been proven a whole lot the office of line I think had been doing really good job of protecting so we can get some of those long throws 'em and I think the quarterback and receivers have been doing a great job and executing and so I think we got some things that we need to improve on but we uh we really made some big steps\nYou know it just takes time sometimes with the office of special when you've got guys playing different positions and outta positions in a train moving a left tackle and dreary right I mean it just takes time doesn't it really\nDoes you know the office of line has to know how everybody else thinks on off line it's not like any other position you have to know the person next to you what they're thinking before they said because you may not have the chance to say it and so if you\nIf you take a a six inch deaf you need to know that the person next to your brothers taken a six inch step as well and so it takes time to build those bonds but I think we uh we really have\nOn off the field had a ... a bill between are often salon members\nWill say you were living in a dream but she always wanted to play at Tennessee and more the orange shirt and this is really special for it\nDefinitely definitely I remember uh when I was three years old I was a chain of Rocky Top at the top of my lungs I remember I was uh when I was young I actually told coach former that'd be playing for one day and come to find out I guess I Am now if you get my dream came true\nCritic plays quarterback ruin occasionally\nOr let's go next to you have a ... Missouri events you know ... and forty nine yards and three touchdowns\nAnything but the bottom of the money\nDoing the right to make most fan bases you know they they think that's going to translate\nTo the next game and and the Missouri's and one of the worst best defenses in the conferences struggling that area but I I think there's a lot of people calling for him you know one thing about will I don't think he has to take the put him in but he still thinks that the ... is the best chance to win the game\n[noise] tell tell me about your deep and it's a\nPretty good up front but do you say you're struggling in the back in [noise]\nReally are you know I I guess we all did realize when guys lead your football team and tackles for for ... years and Scott more\nHe might miss him [laughter] you know ...\nWhen we realized that this guy was not only covering his gap he was covering one or two other gaffe says well all the way and teach it brought them to find middle linebacker but he's playing with Shariah green and until last week\nAnd not had a multiple tackled game and he did play well and that came out to pick against Missouri that we're not quite as good at linebackers we ban and the secondary players was shocking to me is you know look around the league\nA and it pops into my head just you know we recently played them but the Donovan will get that we just played\nA free safety projects and had a you know it was six foot three and a two hundred and five pounds and you just saw incumbent on every play get right take somebody out and we're we're struggling to save you a lot and we've had some injuries there that's made a tougher and then of course coach most champ coaches that are area particularly\nSo that's made some fun post game shows Bible tested he remembers the ... [noise]\nBut but overall that that's been the area that we've had to cover up I guess the best way to say but good young players in the front for and this week uh to the ball's grand we we get our best pass rows your back a DJ want um it's been out since coastal Carolina a truly\nA SCC and type player a set the edge for you and then rushed the pastor he let our team it's actually a year ago so he's coming back off after a bad ankle injury I remains to be seen how effective he will be but I got the feeling coach was not going to play him until he was really ready to go so we'll see how that goes\nWith John Ellis the play by play voice for the south Carolina game taxing Todd you got debo Samuel back in and of course he was hurt in the tendency game last year what kind of impact as he had in his return from it\nThe special football player we're still trying to find as many ways possible to get into football and he's been explosive but his average plays like eight yards and uh that's not what we need to do he's playing a lot more split\nAnd instead of in the slot because shy Smith is criminal and played really well in that position but the pope believe me it's still all American you\nKnow a lot of his momentum was on some kickoff returns last year and the speed sweets and everybody's watching for him but he still he looks great to me he's running already really is a tale back playing a wide receiver spot\nAnd so you just feel like he needs a breakout game as well he's played well don't get me wrong\nBut but not an explosive in the places we've had\nWhen I was shaking his stance today and career wise he's averaging thirty charged for kickoff return\nThat's amazing and I it's amazing to me that people still want to kick doing\nWell he hadn't gotten many and I'm telling you that right every time he Illinois and history of the\nProgram that said three kickoff returns during his career\nAnd uh I've been able to watch the sayings in their thing of beauty we all know how hard it is to run full out into the best\nPart no matter what the or do we do we know that and I know you don't you agree that we talk to people [laughter]\n\nOh my goodness you are people being a patient with we must champ over there and is there grumbling right now because I think a lot of people thought this team was going to be a little bit better than this\nI I think that's fair I think it's a little bit better and certainly by for a spot in the second tier of the you know maybe the second spot in the SEC east\nFrankly we we we'd play well enough at times even more and more throttle bound eighty percent of Japan that position we should not have lost to conduct ... straight years although that's a strong team and does their identity don't get me wrong\nAnd uh you know Texas a and M. game we we just don't football plays the biggest thing change this year's been turnover margin last year we lead the conference and take away the shock with can pressure the team that we had\nThis year was minus six and SEC games in the summer that's on your quarterback someone that's on some crazy place but uh you know we got to get better in that area but there's you know there's some grumbling they also do how passionate will is they see is recruiting efforts they see it's a hard news team for the most part\nAnd uh yeah they they want to be better listen I'll be honest with you most of his focused around the quarterback like it always\nShy yeah\nGive us six sects and the game and or their point the finger at the quarterback so that's where most of the grumbling is right now is Jay Bentley is he not the guy we thought he could be to take it to the next level and frankly at times he's played unbelievable and and times he's not in his turnovers are up a little bit this year\nAnd you just from the outside looking at how much was a Georgia law some kind of thought that you guys would challenge from the east crown and then all of a sudden you know the early in the season to Georgia game how much to take it out of the the team and I kind of a fan base itself [noise]\nWell I think\nMost of the fan base looking at it realistically what those guys had returning nobody knew completely about the pets or how well they would be but we dumped it in the first quarter so bad and that ball game I think we moved\nGoing pretty good for that but taking it five years in a row from Kentucky yeah it was not good that was not good and that and it's got to do with more students seem to know the odd but\nYeah if you can't lose five years the road to a team that wants to be here to basketball no we the [laughter]\nThat's right that there are questions about it\nState fair going on there around the stadium or\nNo or you will not be able to record your um you ever figure golf cart over in your home [laughter] or or\nAm I ready to go out or oh Ferris wheel and do that all day or something else you are well why is that I was little Colombia's a great sound will or ...

attack\nIn the western province of Iraq the surge such and send it in the past two months the soldier was the fourth checks service member killed as part of the north Atlantic Treaty Organization mission to Afghanistan since the central European countries parliament approved a plan and June to double its force in Afghanistan to three hundred Ninety\nI turned to my colleague Thomas Jocelyn\nThe senior fellow at the foundation for the defense of democracy keeping the long war journal with his colleagues because this report this report of the attack in Iran is part of the larger story of guns being turned on ice staff members and\nThe Afghan national army and the Afghan police the most significant of which was an attack last Thursday conned a hard time\nAgainst the police chief of Kandahar and we've learned subsequently the wounding of three American personnel one of them and brigadier general in Cedar\nTama very good evening to you what do we know about the attack in Kandahar last week and the wounding of the American general good evening to Utah\nEvening John yes this appears to be the most successful Taliban infiltrators attack or in their history this involved the Taliban assassin who was well placed to is\nRight near a general Zeke any Americans during this meeting someone who apparently according to the Afghan officials anyway a at a sort of fake does identity and was able to become part of the security team that was there at the compound where this meeting was being held\nAnd he was right in the vicinity of general ... and of course general Miller who was the top American commander and all of Afghanistan\nAnd so this is a this was a very well planned well coordinated attack now significance of this is the general receipt\nYeah you know for people that don't know who he is he was basically the most important in sort of warlord or or powerbroker in southern Afghanistan for the U.S and its allies somebody who has his own checkered history of courses\nAs is the case often throughout Afghanistan um buddy somebody who was fervently anti Taliban he was somebody who kept the ... at bay and they tried to kill him dozens of times John dozens of times they tried to get this guy they finally got him with a simple trader attack\nAnd I think it's very important to know that the way the U.S responded to this as much about state of the war effort because the U.S and NATO I'm off are just really are just absolutely I think absurd descriptions of what happened here in the in the earliest reports they call this an Afghan on Afghan incident\nNow John just think about that and on the top the front end of that\nIt wasn't just an Afghan this was a Taliban infiltrators tell by quickly claimed credit for it and they subsequently been celebrating this for days now they actually released a video of the assassin being trained to Taliban camps preparing for this operation\nThis is clearly a Taliban hit and on the other side it wasn't just that they they killed ... you also kill not only the number one most important power broker for the U.S in southern Afghanistan on our Afghan ally and also the intel ... the ... national director security

leading marketing technology company powers millions of digital ... around the world leading the wave of retail transformation visit scala dot com today to modernize your digital experience Tom\nYou have a report about two members about tied in the Arabian Peninsula now with a wanted poster ten million dollars or wards of ... and up to five million dollars reward for college I'll buy tower see where they come from John\nJohn this is a good example of what we talk about talk about these are kind of veterans who ... who can just sort of keep operating for many many years and stay in the game despite being relentlessly haunted by the U.S are allies because ... and ... are both all kind of veterans from\nTraining camps pre nine eleven in Afghanistan so these are both these guys attended all through which was all kinds of his primary training facility in pre nine eleven Afghanistan and so their journeys through jihad starts all the way back then and\n... actually it was again a fight very early on ... as a guy who should be groomed for a leadership position he somebody who they they very early on thought you know sort of had that potential and lo and behold today these are two of the most senior guys in Yemen they've now leading okay there may be paid so now you\nKnow a lot of times you hear people talk about a creepy that's OK and re impotence or as if it's an affiliate of al ... well we've said all along has no it's not really in a ... it's just all ... because guys like this are groomed kind of veterans who\nHave been putting these positions Toledo kinda globally so they probably in our segment is they probably play a role in actually al ... global management team making decisions around the globe now\nA Cape he of course came to fame because of the um attacks that they tried to plant against the United states\nAnd going Christmas Day two thousand nine or when you had the this underwear bomber on Detroit bound plane and you've had a series of other mostly failed plots some inspired like dollar sign at Fort Hood\nAh which was sort of has some sort of inspirational connection minimum take a pay for the most ... piece plots against the u._s. have failed however they have taken advantage of the war in Yemen this multi sided conflict and they've expanded their base\nInside Yemen and according to a un report that came out this last summer they now have somewhere between six and seven thousand fighters\nIn Yemen Andre ... command so these two guys who um the u._s. ... releases rewards for increase the reward for one of them and actually released a newer worked for the other one um these are guys who likely have thousands of fighters on under their command\nThe consistent nature of your reporting over the years suggest that out titled looks upon its personnel as\nInterchangeable with other personnel do they move them around in theaters to learn networking Tom do they have a a a chart a personnel chart that says let's training here let's training there or is it hit or miss\nWell you know we don't know exactly what their personnel policies are we can only track these guys in show when they pop up somewhere and say that there's probably some thought behind doing that and what we've seen is not only traffic from Afghanistan Yemen and back through the years of course going only back to Nineteen nineties\nBut then you see guys go from Yemen to other places so we've track them to the Sinai we've tracked him to Syria and Italy province who track in the north Africa and Libya and you see these guys go out of the pie and they serve leadership\nThe U.S like this a creepy serves not only as part of the senior management structure within ... terms of the top leaders but they have guys or the groom to go elsewhere to sort of continue on with that role elsewhere\nAnd the fact that they move them around is that a promotion can we tell do they have levels of trust and command authority a photography would he be a a comparable to a colonel or general can we think of them that way\nSo John it's amazing you're asking this question because\nThere's not been any work that we can detect to actually map out what their human sort of organization looks like in years and there's never at least publicly US government is not try to even explain what the management structure of all kind of looks like it when you go through their primary source\nStatements and literature you go through other pieces here and there you can point out and show that they do have a management structure that's in place despite the relentless post nine eleven war it's been waged on them\nThey still have a management structure in place to this day and its opaque they don't they don't put on or turn on line to explain the everybody but you can pick up details here and there for example you know I mean I was out here of course the miracle ... we know he has at least two deputy ...\nBy the way who according to the UN or in Iran and helping and lead the charge for all kinds of globally from our on\nBut then you have guys like this in Yemen who are fighting the Iranians as wise gets all ... complex\nWho are also probably part of the head of senior management team and you start putting this all together you can see there is a a sort of a human organization they're from top to bottom and yet there's been very little done publicly by the U.S government to explain to since nine eleven remember the name of the ... report gave a summary of sort of a basic summary of the commission structure\nThat have these different entities within all kind of worked or to guide the organization internationally we haven't seen updated version of that I can that I can point to any way since two thousand four so that tells you how ... how out of date or assessments are this\nYou are a measure of al ... is it showing cohesion ... is there some change in its confidence level can you tell them\nWell you know it's interesting last week General Dunford had a very interesting comment this is the type of thing that should be raised ears perk up when they hear this he says that they've got new indications are new evidence intelligence that al ... is\nAble to communicate more readily and manage more readily across the globe it sort of infrastructure in place\nThis is like this is sort of a key tell because there's been a lot of what we call this connect the dots announces through the years to try and explain away all ... to try and say that has\nThere is no cohesion there is no global network and play and here's yet another comment however from U.S officials saying no there actually is social cohesion here and there is there is some coordination across international boundaries we think that that degree of coordination equation is actually a lot more than even what\nSome people have said but it's interesting to hear General Dunford a very senior level expressed that publicly chosen something got them some assessment God to him that said oh look out\nGeneral Dunford as chairman of the joint chiefs of staff of four star a marine general and he leads the effort to defeat the gal ... so when he comments as Tom says look out Tom Johnson\nOf the foundation for the defense of democracy this national security report brought to you by scholars scholars leading marketing technology company

let this go\nBut uh you know within a month or two maybe several months and things will be back to normal\nThe reason is when the United states shows strain the Chinese back off um and so there's going to be a little bit less huffing and puffing than you'd think you know so far China's been quiet about this transit I'm waiting in the next several hours to see what Beijing says\nIt will get a really good ... of where they're going because if we get a relatively mild statement that means things will settle down if they actually are belligerent um you know I trust that the Trump Administration will meet word for word and that's something that we need to do right now to show Beijing that we do have the resolve\nSaturday [laughter] Gordon pending in the morning we communicate as you mentioned but we're all skin the Chinese regime attack the United states has interests you know to protect ... in the in the streets or anywhere else\nThey can do that anywhere on planet earth any place in space\nAnd so you know we're going to see a broad base challenge um and they will do that um see jumping has nowhere to back down he owns this controversy with the United states\nIf he is seen to cave in um he's very well may not be living so um you know this is going to go on for quite some time that is um but seems teaching paying is whether he's an aberration or whether he is the

percent that's the official number of GDP tend to be the slowest in a decade since the great recession two thousand two thousand nine whatever the real number is there's a contraction of the growth China depends upon\nThat means unemployment does Xi Jinping does the standing committee do they have a response to that\nThere are only response John is to do what they've been doing in the last several months which is to stop their dealer averaging campaign pile on the debt\nAnd hope that they can grow their way out of this which of course they can't because even if you believe their official GDP number of six point five percent growth and and you shouldn't but even if you were to believe it they're encouraging one and a half times as much as they're creating nominal gross domestic product\nThat's completely I'm a losing proposition for the June paying it just a question of how long he can hold on you can hold on a long time\nBut he's making the inevitable crisis bigger\nSo they don't have any real solution the real solution of course would be to reform but see jumping doesn't want to do that\nSo he's just going to take the country off the cliff with him\nThat is Gordon how about the capital of slows you talked about before yeah\nUm well there hasn't been very much in the way of capital outflow since September of two thousand sixteen because the capital controls right now or ... even the ones that are announced and the ones that they are effectively enforcing which are unannounced\nBut I think we're going to start to see more money come out because there's a real change in the Senate and China it's gotten quite dark um and you can see that of course with the falls\nIn the stock market and in the currency the only reason why there was a rebound um today was in China which was actually quite a strong rebound in Shanghai composite wasn't because the Chinese authorities were making these statements about how great the stock market was\nAnd they probably were also buying as well so you know and under those circumstances it's no longer a market um but you started to see I think a real pessimism because people are understanding the consequences not only of slow growth but also the challenge ... siege and paying as opposed to the United states\nAnd the American response the thing that's different Thaddeus is the American response\nDoes the renminbi go to seven or did they touched that that that live wire\nYou know I think so John you know if you'd asked me two or three weeks ago I would've said no and I probably would be wrong um because I think that they're starting to believe that they cannot indefinitely defend the currency\nI thought that they were defending six nine um but you know they went through six nine so I think I was wrong on that and you know of course only time will tell but I think that they eventually after all that\nWhat they should do John is a big one time devaluation shock the markets punish all the speculators but they're not smart enough to do that at one time devaluation explain going what would that look like\nYou know going to eight or eight and a half to the U.S dollar um from six point nine three which is where they are now and then that really shocks everybody and it stops the slow erosion when you're in slow erosion\nAnd foreign exchange reserves to no good at and that's what we

where they want things to be a but but the other thing that I give Democrats have going for them in this regard as President Trump\nIs in control of national security and he has that has disposal the

they should\nExcept that there's somebody than the Democrats who earlier earlier said that it's time to abolish ice so if they remain silent\nAnd they don't repudiate their previous position or they

running for president ultimately even though he's barely been in office as governor probably in twenty twenty or the next cycle\nAnd she claims that during the campaign this guy named Alvarez about a hundred and forty thousand dollar job as a housing czar in the Murphy administration after he won drove her home\nOr you know they were at a rally or something for Murphy asked you use the bathroom comes in and then attacked her\nShe gets a rape kit done tells her best friend who joined her she's shaking tells her husband about it reports it to the authorities reports it to the Murphy people\nAnd then when nothing is done and Murphy's elected and this guy comes up for a job interview reports it all over again reports it even according to the wall Street Journal reports to Mrs Murphy the Murphy's tower they'll get back to meet with her at least the governor did and then they never do\nHere's my point the national media is not telling you about this\nComing off cabin on all that we saw wouldn't this be the perfect follow up story if they were really serious about talking about these issues the only national media that's done anything with this is the wall Street Journal they gave her a forum they did investigation they wrote this up\nAnd now the legislature apparently is going to have a special team investigate this and a a former a judge is being brought in to investigate it\nBut why should national media not interested in is even the local media only talk radio twelve ten and somewhat and Jay dot com occasionally they write about it\nYou would think this would be all the rage given what we went through with cabinet here's a woman with resources does it by the book\nNow Dr Ford you can argue arches only Fifteen back in the day she doesn't can't remember and all this and we're told if the woman says all that though it's true you have to believe or Cory Booker in Jersey and these others right well\nThis woman said the same thing and what does this guy gets criminal penalties or not he was applying for a job in the Murphy administer a big job a high paying job and despite all these complaints they gave it to them without any investigation she alleges and that's where the wall Street Journal seems to say\nThe point being the double standard rears its head her name is Katie Brennan\nIn any way that you can spread that around tell people you see the wall Street Journal piece\nAbout it it's just one of the best examples I've seen in years of the double standard of what actually goes on so standard coming out of cabin up people on the left in the media he shouldn't be on the court\nIf a woman makes the allegation without cooperation that's just too bad it's a job interview this is hanging over his head\nHow did this guy then she'll get appointed how is it the Murphy's have not met with her how is it the national media doesn't want you to know out there and gyms audience\nAbout this nobody no follow up\nNow even if they want to say they follow the story and the woman they think is crying wolf here well that's an object lesson I could live with that if that's what they come up with\nA coming through the meat to ear and all that or could it be\nThat when Governor Christie was governor we have bridge gate and there was tremendous national media and I think it was a serious thing what he did there or a staff at least it with the George Washington bridge and the traffic and the whole thing on three days but this is the story rip right\nAnd I've been the biggest story of the year and a lot of ways and they came up with these commandments of what we should do\nComing off this how we view women their testimony you know that I Know that so why in this case are they not following up with a perfect case on a high level with a woman who was textbook as far as I can see\nIn reporting this up and down the line and the only conclusion I can come to is the classic double standard\nNext news in one hour we're on blind

up as high as ... leaving there might be more than one caravan that starts and then people have the attitude they're just going to break into the country President Trump calls up the military and ...\nTo take an unbelievable force to be a human wall to prevent that these people will still try to crash through apparently then you get into the use of force\nAgainst this and you know where that leads that's going to be a very very big moment now I'm not sure if they'll reach the border before the midterms I'm kind of hoping they will so that we see this graphically what's been going on day after day\nBut I Want to play you I got a whole bunch of things is our to catch up on I Want to play you this goes back and I've never been able to get this guy and I've tried mightily I'm a Catholic but guys like this they just sickened me he's the bishop of Tucson\nWhy Zimmer Weisberg\nAnd um this was during that period of time of the migrant children and allegedly their mom somewhere their mom some or not you know that whole thing how emotional it was over the summer\nThis guy was at a con fab of bishops in arch bishops and cardinals with all the pre scandal problems\nHe brings up because he speaks in a roundabout way but it's clear what he's saying as a Catholic the worst thing that can do to you is ex communicate you you are kicked out and the methodology of actually mean occasion is saying you've seen so grievous leaguers so you're very soul is at risk\nOf going to help\nThis guy gets up before the bishops and says these border patrol people any administration not just on the border everybody associated with this that's doing this Trump policy we should consider X. communicating them\nSo that they realize they're risking their soul for this guy and his policies and thinking how dare you\nIs this guy ever speak out about Democrats who masquerade as Catholics on the life issue you hear him on that so I Want to play that for you and a list or a minus ... village and people are\nSent me detailed reports in the Roman Catholic Katty Kay is about immigration and it doesn't match with this guy saying it says that country has a right to protect itself\nHere's an example of how wild it's getting but Democrats\nThey are running the one thing they're running on is Republicans want you and your kids not to have health coverage to die if necessary\nThe preexisting condition argument again\nNow I've had on people that have explained I think fully that's not the Republican position at all so there is a major house race right where I Am in the Philadelphia area it's in a place called Bucks County\nBrian Fitzpatrick is the Republican Scott ... was a very wealthy guy a grandson I guess it is a great great grandson of a um\nA guy who was the vice president of the United states under FDR until he got kicked out because of how far left he was wow is is very far left so he's been prosecuting\nThis campaign saying that Brian Fitzpatrick and this is a key very hotly contested race as far as the house of representatives\nIs a guy who essentially want you to die of have to take away preexisting condition coverage and all that is the Washington Post writes a piece saying that's a lie\nAnd ... should stop saying Brian Fitzpatrick brings it up there were holding a debate on Sunday night in a synagogue now as I understand that this may be a synagogue is very liberal the Scott while I was wanted Scott Wallace is seen as the guy who's anti Israel and that is true\nThe Democrat in the middle of this Wallace\nCan't take it anymore that pitch Patrick is using this to Washington Post story to rebut this why\nAnd he drops the F bomb\nNow this is on the is it pronounced the beam ma if you're Jewish synagogues FEMA and elevated platform used for reading the ... the tour of during services\nAnd then the rabbi and others chastised him for this in other words he blurted out the F bomb towards this stuff from fitzpatrick while in the holiest places I understand it inside the\nTemple and then he\nSort of apologizes but not really and he says he's passionate\nAnd Democrats want people that are passionate about this what have you heard during this particularly in a circumstance like this guy throwing out the F bomb\nNow if I had the sound the sound was on a well this is what ... wanted in place but a TV station may have gotten it but\nJust think about this and this is the classic of what the Democrats are prosecuting which is the healthcare thing when even a Washington Post as a Republican did not do that would not do that it's a lie wow I Can't take it\nRight there and they you know in those secret spot this guy just blurted out I Can't imagine is he just never have run into something like this in a circumstance like this I let me go to the cars let's go to Katie in Redding Pennsylvania hey Katie welcome in\nAnd just sitting here listening\nThat guy in my opinion even lower than trailer trash you know\nWhat it said hey hocking and if I get to stay on next time I Want to play it you got to stand a Katie this guy's worth of the family was worth three hundred million a silver spoon he just came in and trying to buy his way he lives in a luxury golf course really in South Africa this candidate who came to Bucks County and people here are in shock\nIt's one thing to drop the F bomb during debate that's hard to believe\nBut it's another to do it on the home court where you want it to be in the sacred ground of the temple\nExactly I mean in my opinion is just a few things in the world that you just don't mess with\nOne of them yes [laughter] yeah [laughter] exactly right but it's hard to\nBelieve Nike Katie thanks very much that's why I'm bringing it up as an example of when they get frustrated on the Democratic side where this is going it's David in Greenwich New Jersey hello David\nI'm going to decorate my call and you're willing to appoint a real estate friend of mine who does business who was there and not only I mean we're like getting to that too like the altar and the Catholic Church but not only did he drop it there but he's telling me you should've heard him outside when he was leaving their shirt off\nShane thing this ... coming up from Mexico I'm doing the math\nAnd if you have seven thousand people times twelve dollars a day to feed them let's say Mexico stand you're talking about eighty five thousand dollars a day I'm concerned that I'm bothered that depress you seen these folks walk in ... who's got a backpack who's got nothing who's got nothing there's there's nothing\nThat right well what we've seen radio to ride your point we've seen video of people in and out money given out supplies and listen to this I didn't play because it's in Spanish I Univision reporter the translation embedded to your point with the caravan\nSays he's met migrants from known terrorists hot spots like Bangladesh how do people from Bangladesh end up in this sort of a re\nA because you can walk into any part probably of South America anymore but it'd be great if the press would cover these feeding and each beating and fueling stations in these medical stations and then on the third point a non where I live down here is\nI can see across the Delaware Bay and maybe even twenty two mile but I can see the lights at Dover Air force base and it's it's constant a day and night or at least the bombers and these these these monster transport troop trans brothers and equipment transport they fly or you don't hear\nA anytime something's getting ready to happen or go down as we would say if they stop\nAnd we've had nothing now for two days okay nothing would pretty much tells you something is going to be going on in the border pretty much\nSo well right and they're either here is it's going to take an unbelievable number of troops to do this peacefully though but thank you thanks for all the great points you made here's how you get in eight six six fifty Jim bow eight six six fifty Jim I Want to play you a quickly one more guy this is Steve Schmidt\nHe is the former McCain advisor used to be a moderate maybe now is full bore he's on MSNBC he's sticking by all this here's what he says when he hears we might use the military we might be doing this at the border here is ah Steve Schmidt\nAnd the idea that when a mother\nThrough suffering through abuse for rest and sometimes death\nAll around them when they reach the border and they see a uniform with an American flag\nAnd they are no longer safe that baby as ripped away and put into an internment camp because this is a moral outrage that harkens to the worst excesses in the history of the countries that are separation of families at the slave auction blocks\nThey read the Japanese and again this is the failure of the Democratic party to address this is a small issue not as a profound staying on our national water\nAs a profoundly on American policy to frame the question for the country into style age of ... what\nIs it that we are who are we as a people\nThat is a great question thank you for framing it now answer that we are people that are tired and you can tell me who we are as you look in the mirror and sanction is I Do\nWe are people that are tired of the American worker the American citizen in the American population being overrun in this manner by a bunch of people that have gained one way or another by it while inflicting\nDamage on countless communities countless people you know I Wonder what Steve Schmidt would say to the families like the young woman cakes timely killed in San Francisco by a maniac have been deported six or seven times I\nWonder what he would say to that just collateral damage just one person this is a stain on our national honor is it or is it finally seeing someone that's going to step up on this problem that goes on day to day maybe not on not like we're seeing\nNow but it's a similar problem that we all know was out there that's why

we've ever seen\nUpwards of a hundred thousand people may have been there all day long with cookouts and tailgating and packed a basketball arena tonight with Trump been cruise now here is though something a little bit different Fox infringed today\nThey had on independent voters member it's Fox News channel and they were asking these people about the caravan\nAnd here's what the Democrats are believing and I don't believe them and you can tell us at eight six six fifty jumbo\nThere believing there's a lot of people in America we're going to see this as you know mandatory in crisis they're going to see this is evil wrong Trump I'm not proud to be an American if he stopped his caravan at all but threats listening to these independent voters according to Fox News on Fox and friends this morning\nRejecting pushing back against this caravan saying it's fear mongering and the like here's how it sounded\nLike a let's start with you\nHow big a problem is that the United states has plenty even immigration laws\nEither I think an even immigration laws are a problem for any country and I think our immigration laws need to be modernized and updated ah ah but this country is founded on immigration and all of us come from immigrants are\nSo what should the United states do if those seven thousand people by the time it gets there can be ten thousand going to be twenty thousand fortunately the United states do about this ... this is the\n... country on the planet I think we can handle a a a a caravan of people on arms coming to this country so Letterman and well I Am saying too cautious improperly joined real quick on the immigration there is a humanitarian\nCrisis taking place in Central America and yet this issue gets turned into a complete political football there's very little honest discussion about what's actually happening it gets turning the talking points that interests you know treating I'm\nThis as an invasion is is a bad idea and it's going to end hardly if it is treated such as that way so\nIn here and there needs to be a real solution [noise] um ... offers um in in\nDealing with who are but the backdrop is the terms and so it all becomes political let's see what happens\nFor a discussion\nAlright that's from Fox and friends who weren't in my audience was outraged after they heard that in Philadelphia today how about you eight six six fifty Jim what's not all political stop with the political stuff this is a real issue we go back and forth with this we have awkward says he said it could be twenty thousand I'm seeing various caravans various things come together\nJust they they're gonna punch through Mexico it appears they've already broken through and they're headed toward the border and it may happen next week tail end of next week right before the midterms\nWell they see the issue writ large in front of his this goes on every day not not in the staggering numbers on mass but this shortage invasive behavior has gone on every day I've been to the border I've done shows from there\nThis is the type of thing that goes on and I think\nThis plays badly for the Democrats and open borders and these independent guys here saying we'll just let them in is that the solution now you know President Trump is even talked about shutting down the entire border that's commercially and the military\nAnd the only hesitation I have there is you would meet an ass massive number of military to apprehend and stop this church\nAnd the military had to use physical force firing on people that would not be good but short of that I think Americans say no they analogize it I've had all kinds of people tell me this is like someone just saying they're coming into my house because there's enough of them and they're going to come here and that's it\nIs that wrong\nWe do have laws we do have asylum laws we do have the ability to process this it is not just political\nAnd all of this comprehensive reform enforce the laws we already have first how about doing that before we stop at this comprehensive nonsense all the time back and forth with this\nWhat would you do in this situation I've got a lot more sounds on this coming up but I'd love to get you in and if you have a reaction to us the ban and that was really good stuff that you're the man of mystery open up about some things\nEight six six fifty Jim boat that will do it eight

America's totally sympathetic they'll see Trump for the bully and all this stuff it is they won't be as good as Americans if\nTrump stops is I think it's the opposite if he doesn't stop it he

and the like and we often forget about that and you guys have it as bad if not as worse as Texas and the places we normally think about\nYeah um\nIt's been manageable or at least the government was smart enough to uh inundate the border with agents are where we uh we had controlled and better but now with these horns coming as it's getting back out of control\nOf Jews who has a good\nYeah well the here's what it is and I've been thinking about this um you know uh\nHe called the president could send the military down there which is a smart move however listen to these people are coming\nAnd it seems that that's inevitable so my thought was\nTo set up a massive refugee camp or we have the greatest military on if we can set it up in no time set up with cans and with mess halls in the shower facilities and everything that they could possibly need therefore a we would not be splitting up families and so on and so right\nThere for the Democrats can't go crazy over that kind of thing and then what we do oh by the way we set it up next to a place that has a big airport so you can either do it by the even the air stationery over in Sierra Vista to flirt with two cuts and here's the thing is ... and we used to do this a long time ago what what you do is it\nSo these people are all going to claim some refugee status or some asylum status and stuff and and what they do is they they um\nSet them up in front of an immigration judge who eventually make the determination on them okay so what they do what they should do is set up these um um um there's one I could you can and then have them go in there and make sure everything's all co pathetic and everything's good there\nAnd send down immigration John ... judges okay and attorneys and everything they can all legal and stuff so that dentist can't complain\nAnd then literally go through each families claim or each person's claim like they're going to do anyway without releasing them into the United states and if they go through this then we could do what's called a jeep pet flight which is a repatriation flight to their country\nAnd hold on I'm In agreement with that he had a problem though my sense is that so far they're not going to settle for that they're saying they're just coming into the country and that's it because there's well by the numbers whoever's organizing this and it's going to be bigger\nI don't know how you're going to hurt them towards these refugee camps to be hurt I don't think they're going to settle for that\nI'll be honest with you know what ... who's in charge they are are we are\nWell look so your ideas humanitarian aid\nControl here and I tell you right slump we're talking to those countries in saying that we're going to look cut off your ah money that's right well

information\nWeeks have news talk Ninety four point one man\n[noise]\nYou can follow me on whether\nThe address that some of the radio or Kaiser\nSays may tweak a caravan\nIs an invasion and there needs to be stopped we cannot allow them to come here like this if they get in and then there will be more caravans and it will never end which by the way Kaiser uh there's another report of out of water Marla\nThat the group that are already is marching it's already in Mexico there's another thousand that are now gathering and coming north as well behind them\nSo I don't know what the total numbers are but I I Do think this is literally an invasion they're going to storm our country and it comes down to no matter how you feel about immigration\nAnd these people and and uh the president says that mixed in there are Middle Eastern uh terrorists out all these other things that are I I I wouldn't doubt it I mean it's a good place if you are wanting to do something they're listed in the United states\nA drug dealers are terrorists whatever you want this to be a good time to kind of mix in with that crowd\nBut it looks like most of them are\nRun of the meal everyday ordinary people wanting to get to America but I'm going somebody's got to be organizing the somebody has to be feeding them somebody has to have more than ... or something for them going all along the road\nSomebody has to I mean it's it's ... and now they're going to ... it's treacherous enough but they're gonna have to get rides more than just on the back and pick up trucks from Mexican citizens that are out there you know going hey jump on I'll give you a ride so they give them a ride for a mile\n\nThis um I I don't know I think this transcends parties I Hope it does I Know different people have different views about immigration illegal immigrants on and on and on but\nUsually one pushed on it even the most pro immigrant color his one I said well do you want open borders no no America needs all countries need\nBorders we have our sovereignty\nSo what are we ... what do you think's gonna happen what do you think's gonna happen if and when they get closer to our\nSouthern border\nPhone number is eight five five to nine five sixty six hundred how many of them will drop out along the way and go man I made it out um Honduras I'm Glad I'm In Mexico I speak the language this is good I'm stopping right here there's a ... in Missouri hello\nTK welcome Hey Tom old friend Dutch glad to talk to ya likewise say what are\nHearing tigers right on\nA if Trump don't stop this now nip it in the bud right now is forever hold your the shooter swelled throw your hands up and say well what the hell the borders open come on in may not like what they need to do and what Trump needs to do he needs to have the the troops at the border\nAnd a escort the people or if they cross the border escort them right into given food package water put them on the bus get the bus full the bus heads for the nearest a army base airbase\nAnd so on uh have to see one thirties shutting their weight and they get off the bus onto the street one thirties they're full applies out headed for ... yeah and it does real that over and over again\nSo that's what a normal person would think so I I'm putting you in the normal person category ... was that much risk but I Know but but the problem is is you're\nUsing logic and common sense and and never ever ever use either of those when you're talking about the law and the problem with the law is the law says once they step foot in America we have to\nSeparate them and you know a good classify them give them a court date later on if they ask for asylum we have to do forty more things we've got to give the medical we've got to give the boom we got to give them education we got to give them all these things that's but\nThat's the only thing I'm not sure I just disagree with you there on that point we don't have to according the constitutional once they pass\nThe country that they leave from and step into Mexico or wherever it is then we don't have any obligation to take them in a under a a asylum that\nUh they're being harmed in their country or whatever because they have the\nEnergy you're right there's a I've seen some some but the federal judges will jump on this thing and say no no no you can't put them on that plane or you know there's a federal judge just waiting to rule on that that's the problem I'm having I'm right there with you I agree with you a thousand percent\nCommon sense getting in the way of some federal judge but the gate thank you\nFor in a news talk Ninety four point one special event\nAnd I think ... do you think that this was spontaneous or do you think uh the reporter said the organizers were going to have a news conference today there's there's organizers\nWho are they true how much are they in\nA dream world right here people just talking about who is it but I agree with you this obviously can't be spontaneous or in the sense that people just decided hey let's go and every one person walk and then you know ten people gathered and became a hundred ... a couple of thousand\nEight obviously somewhat behind it pushing them feeding them give them places this day\nStill matter people manpower just to move this type of people I mean it's ridiculous I doubt I dealt with the people and moved to a couple of hundred people around that took you know weeks of prepping just to\nMove that many I Can't imagine what this is taking sure and so anyone who's done mass organization knows this this had to have someone behind it and you know anyone can accurately and\nI Would imagine that your average Joe when Jane Hondurans citizen is not going to storm the the gates of of the Mexican border\nUh and tear them down ... I I yeah\nI mean there was a violent violent ripping down of all the security measures at the Mexican border\nAnd um [noise] I don't know if they're hyped up somebody is a leading the pack I this is [noise] it's an invasion is truly an invasion and I don't know how they're going to stop it [noise] it's\nOne for a think about what to talk about but only to be a threat and we as a country I Know this'll be a bad precedent if we just let them all and I think anyone who has a brain you said that you know normal a normal logic can apply to la and that needs to be addressed maybe it\nWas going to otherwise he came was absolutely right just avoid them on buses given them sandwiches drop 'em over to the airport and put 'em on planes ...\nWhy not that sounds perfect it does but it's not going to happen\nAt any one Josh thanks for your call got up a ... meter tweezers they should be met with a female like response food water shelter\nPhotos prince followed by repatriation that's the yeah I agree with your your right there were ... talking about ... send them back home but that's\nWith the way our laws are are written I I don't see how they're going to be federal judges stopping the government from doing anything and how do you stop them from setting foot on American soil so that they don't fall into all the rights and everything else of our country\nYou're going to point guns on them you're gonna gassed them I'm Serious do you want to do that\nDavid ah Walnut Creek California David thanks for wedding welcome\nHigh high I don't think\nI don't think anything's going to happen I think they're going to come across and the results\nApple of being an African American if you're now who is going to be hurt by people a mass\nImmigration into the country of unskilled workers it's always the people at the bottom or you know lower portion of our society yes and yet those people who say they represent the African American community are all for this so you in my logic\nI think to myself okay well then the point is is that they don't really want people to ever be independent and be able to take care of themselves\nSo that those people aren't smart enough to realize that they're being held down by yes\nSocietal issues but also by their own propose supported leaders what do you do for them you don't do anything for them and this is a tide and I think\nAs I look at history I think it's a tie that there's nothing to do I think Donald Trump is a cap on the brakes going Ninety miles an hour and when he leaves I think things will just continue on in the past and what will it take you know I think another forty fifty years\nDavid I Want to hear but I Want to hear more I but I've got a hit my break can you hold on please\nDo matter radio that makes you think Tom Sawyer

to prevent personal fund from being transferred to the United states to Mexico Honduras\nGuatemala and I'm Wondering if that doesn't make sense or the logical or at least a part of a logical answer to the immigration problem we're happy\nTo stop the remittances from here to Mexico\nMexico Honduras Guatemala\nI I Would imagine we do have a technology to do it the question is whether or not or it would be effective are these people are already here are and the question is what do we do to prevent more illegal alien from coming here and that's what the president trying to do\nOr if he were to somehow try to stop remittances a and remittances that his money coming from people in this country to Mexico\nBecause I Believe they're a second largest source of income after oil\nUm I don't know it seems to me that doing that would also exacerbate the problem in in Mexico I hear people say that\nUh if President Trump for example withdraws the aid from Honduras in Guatemala it'll simply make the conditions there even worse uh and uh would create even more so called migrants it seemed to me the argument against a about Mexico is that Mexico's economy under developed\nAnd needs to be developed and you stop the remittances if even if you could do it legally I'm not sure how that\nWould create conditions that would make it better for Mexicans to stay in Mexico as opposed to coming up here illegally but\nThanks for the idea can I'll look into it Thai is in San Antonio Texas tigers malarial to show\n[noise] love your show man he sold it make you um\nGo yeah that that's all you're all that going on and on that as a conservative or for now a long long time one of the things that are so\nBring home on the black community now and the mind that uh for about six years and they had no intention of ... it's going to take the but the gentleman like them to get out of their belts\nAnd coke\nBut but to my point you you had a caller asked you how many legal\nImmigrants are accepted into this country um\nAnd I happen to know living in San Antonio I'm married to a Hispanic woman her family is from Mexico\nWe as a country per year except about one million legal immigrants of which about six hundred thousand\nOr residency changes I don't know maybe they have dual citizenship and they're moving to America I'm not sure what the situation is so that leaves you with about four hundred thousand so that boils down to almost eleven hundred per day okay legal citizens that we are accepting into this country and at this point in our\nHistory we have the most legal immigrants that we have ever had and that's thirty seven thirty seven now\nIf you if you estimate our population\nYou know you and do that math that comes up almost ... percent of our population is legal immigrants mhm so\nYou know to make the argument and this is through not only democratic uh you know presidents do for a Republican and minister Asians and and this has been going on for a long long time\nUm but you know I wanted to ask you you mentioned earlier on your show that Mexico has felony policy for anybody who enters the country illegally that's right my my bigger question here my bigger question is if Mexico is\nAnd from what I hear they have a blockbuster and the willingness to help you you said that they're they're pretty much just escorting them and kind of you know I'm just protecting them or whatever they're doing now is it that these people are not rounded up by the federal rally immediately or at least\nA medium is a ... but can\nPour out of the the the integrity of Mexico's\nAll walls themselves ... we'll talk\nIf they're if they're entering illegally you know that's the first one so why should they why should you know if they're if they're agreeing to help us and we just went in to a new trade\nDeal with them it just seems like the third mainly fostering these people to our border and then they're going to see how we handle\nThat's exactly what's going on why do you think Trump is so upset when you think papa so angry\nBecause the Mexican government allows the so called caravan from central and South America to come on through their country because they know they're coming up to hear [noise]\nWhat do you think Trump is so angry they could stop it [noise]\nIt's been around is to stop it [noise]\nThey don't want 'em on their country illegally\nI'm Larry over Mary

I Lived in Latin America but we were transferred to Saudi Arabia after the U.S manufacturing jobs start drying up in the Nineteen eighties\nAnd uh we lived in multiple countries and we found that there were people within the government is not a monolith but but the people and the government like the king and his son\nAnd get rid of terrorism and they've been working on us turkey doesn't like the state want more of this type of violence so that can move into\nThe Europe but we found something very very interesting I'm a chemical engineer but also supervise lab techs and hospital environment and we found that they were flipping out and our crew\nIn and around that crew from brain infection and they they are called things like ... behavior impulsive behavior vengeful ... anger\nAnd they were diseases that came off the Silk Road\nA ... a career in Congo hemorrhagic fever or a plague polio malaria all kinds of things including Venezuela acquaintance of allied with two causes people act like\nA the people who are running the the movement of ... of of people out of Latin America to our border and the FDA just to prove smoke ... detect these things it's still a lot of money to finally find ... back in the eighties\nBut we can now tests for these things and check people coming out of the country when we help other people outside the country to these things and it would help move people more to calm conservative values\nYeah I ... I just do we would tell me what do you think is a is a doable inappropriate sanction to keep the relationship alive but at the same time given the brush back but you can't treat\nA American or any other journalists like this\nYou might need to be severely prosecuted but a present for the world that we really don't want people killed in embassies et cetera they should've he should have been taken back to Saudi Arabia and tried if if he was really a part of the Muslim Brotherhood and a within in fighting terrorism worldwide\nAnd and so the Saudis have a problem because they have more hobbies there and then they have people want reform and we have a similar type problem over here so Congress and the president and the government of a Saudi Arabian need to work it out\nYeah but you you are for for a guy that lived in Saudi Arabia as crazy as that society is in in comprehensible a as it is in terms of mores uh and the way they structure things you do see the merit in keeping relations with Saudi Arabia\nAbsolutely they're keeping the middle east calm is saving us a huge amount of money and preventing so many people from being murdered 'em by the radicals they are not angels but you have to work with them and and we need to move them more and more to a moderate stance and there are people who want to do that over there\nAll right thanks I appreciate George Mike ... news Ninety six five and a window Hey Mike\nHi Brian\nYeah the governor's race might give me your perspective dissenters birds Gillum why is Gillum in front and almost every poll\nI think is in French because there's always been this perception that most Republicans don't show up until the gate of and I think it really has a good goodbye behind him I think the jumping or spent works I mentioned earlier in speaking in the green room I think that what's really going to help to take this\nElection over Gillum is the fact that we do have a very important Senate race with Bill Nelson versus Rick Scott\nRick Scott's very well liked by the Republican Party I think if it were any other year Gillum would probably have a shot I Know the college towns here in in Florida are very excited they are going to come out in droves\nUm I think the fact that it is a Senate race is going to be the benefit of ...\nThanks so much great perspective markets way down talked ... about that I'm more\nOf a news talk Ninety four point one special events\nAbout what's going to happen in that final calculation I think we're going to have a truly interesting election night\nUh you know the words you think it's going to be extended I think Chris right because you think of so many of these races going to be a compelling out on the west coast I don't want to stay up all night but you do think you're going to end up doing that\nWell we we stay up all night on the decision that's no matter what it is just whether we have company we like it if you guys stay up and watch a show because there is going to be a lot of interesting stuff you know control of house we have a we have a model that lets us predict which party is going to control the house based on the uh our our polling\nBut also the early returns\nA in a you know if it's a democratic wave will be able to tell you at nine o'clock uh yep here they come in there there it goes a but if if this is what it what the current surveys indicate we're going to have to wait for Texas we are going to have to wait for all kinds of stuff to come in before we have real clear\nYou know it's interesting uh I mean as usual Florida I find the most intriguing and the headliners the governors in the senators number one I'm pure performance I Know Scott doesn't have the great or the great charisma we know that but after eight years Florida knows them and knows these productive hardworking\nAnd honest and and the other side Bill Nelson who's been there for a while has not been necessarily productive you think if he's ever going to be vulnerable he'll be over after a two term governor decided to run against him dead heat and the last poll I saw from Quinnipiac\nHas a Scott down I think seven points system like yes says well you have them down consistently seven I had two or three and then this was big\nSo surveys so he actually is an improvement one point in Quinnipiac Quinnipiac as one of our a plus polls that has a good track record that uses the rights\nInstantly trail and this is also what you see there Andrew Gillum in the governor's race in Florida that should not be the Florida hasn't had a democratic governor\nSince Nineteen Ninety eight I Believe when Jeb Bush won\nA now they don't win by a lot Florida tends to have ... narrowly contested elections I think Rick Scott one by one point and one and a half points where his margins victory as governor um but so Florida has been a state that has is a swing state but that has had a consistent narrow Republican advantage\nUm the fact that round to St Louis is struggling as much as he has to try to get some traction and get some advantage there talks about what kind of year it is in Florida what here's basically what we have we have the volume turned up on both sides to the max we're looking at\nA year in so normally in a in a by any election in the mid term election the last midterm election in twenty four team was the lowest turnout any since Nineteen forty two\nWe are on track now to have a mid term election turnout over fifty percent which you have to go back forty or forty years or more to find that kind of turnout you have to go back to basically the the the internal political struggle over Vietnam to find mid term election turnout like that and if that's true so here's the danger for Republicans\nThey are the the intensity is back up on the Republican side to match Democrats but the Democrats aren't a bathing and in swing states like Florida in swing states like Ohio if Democrats are storming the poll if if Democrats are voting like Republicans Republicans are going to lose out on a bunch of seats because there are more Democrats than there are Republicans in America\nIsn't it great for the country is the guy loves politics to get that type of turnout\n[noise] um I Wish we were doing it in a less wretched way yeah um I Wish that it was not so vitriolic an apocalyptic an awful but yes uh speaking selfishly ... ah this is this is this is what I'm here I Am ... as the as the kids would say a here for this\n[noise] uh he's ... he's always here for this pick up his book every man and king and helps makes sense of Donald Trump's rise and let you know this is a not an anomaly there were other similar situations even for men that have a then emerge that didn't when\nChris thanks so much thank you Dr

make more money and be happy\nI can make more money and get benefits but see you got to look at it that way to start with how can live my passion and make more money but it it's amazing that people think that the ... there's some kind of a trade off here that's a\nFalse it's a false it's a false logic which is actually an oxymoron but um\nIt it's just it's bad critical thinking skills channel no no no no it's not okay okay okay just for that reason it's not okay is there a difference between a psycho score and an experience or Equifax score a\nEquifax has been given a score it said we suck weight or least all of our data to the entire world [laughter] that's ... ...\nAnd Experian doesn't have a short now I'm Sorry I don't think either one of these have a separate scoring rather than fight though I don't I'm I'm not aware experience website doesn't show anything except psycho score on it I don't know maybe they have a program and I'm just not aware of it where they started their own score um\nOr maybe Equifax ... says I don't care and nobody cares what I ... a more [noise]\nBut um picks up their former president who made like a hundred and eighty billion dollars for quitting [noise] uh but\nUh no\nI wouldn't worry about it I wouldn't worry about any of the scores by the way because they're all based on you borrowing money\nAnd so\nAgain it's a set of false logic gets its bad critical thinking 'cause the only way you get a high cycle scores to borrow money and why do you get a high score so you can borrow money this whole thing is about playing 'cause he faced with a bang somewhere\nWorshipping at the altar of a false God called fight go psycho is not your provider the only think psycho will provide you with us the ability to borrow money\nWhich provides you with

is the best age to purchase term insurance what exactly does that cover death um I still have school that\nThat doesn't matter\nUh you don't need life insurance unless someone is dependent upon your income for their\nAbility to eat show\n... ... ... if you are a mom\nThe income that you are making you should get term life insurance today and it doesn't matter whether you're thirty to forty two or twenty two if you're a mom and your earning an income and your kids are counting on your income then you would need about ten to twelve times your income on you then yeah it's a life insurance coverage death\nIn statistically the older you are the more likely you are to die\nSo it gets more expensive it's pretty simple math formula\nAnd so yeah twenty thirty two is more than twenty two and less than forty two years old uh the the premiums are less show\nIt's not that expensive to get Fifteen to twenty year level term insurance ten to twelve times your income on you and that is not a baby step that's a start right now\nErnst dot com they'll give you a quick and easy quote and um\nYou know it'll be really easy for you to uh get dialed in on that and Zander insurance dot com thinks about like I think eleven or twelve seconds to get a quote back from ten or twelve companies in English it's the shop of Brazilian companies throw out the best prices for you right now in your situation\nBut you know you don't buy it when you're young because it's cheaper you only buy it when you're young if you need it so if you're thirty two and you're single and you have no dependents\nOr no you don't need life insurance if you're thirty two when you got two kids in you know you're married and you got people depending on your income or you're a the economic value that

[noise] uh thirty two on it and it's worth about twenty six who said it's worth twenty six a Kelley Blue book on a a private fail good okay and what's your income sure\n[noise] my base is about Seventy five but I think this year I'll be cleared about one twenty\nOkay we like the ...\nYear but also what kind of like already sold the Harley some kind of motivated to get out of debt\nSo it and how much of that if he got\n[noise] a total including the truck is about the things that I got about a team and credit cards\nWith a shockwave can you clear fifty if you don't sell the Trump\nOr he'll

your life you know what you're going to make in the next twelve to twenty four months on average you're going to be working your butt off to get out of that show you ought to pay this I got to pay that fifty often Eighteen months or less\nYeah yeah oh yeah I could yeah I'm hoping I could do it you know about fourteen months to live and be able to be there for about ... you know\nWell if you do that you got to turn to move it back up and truck right\n[noise] uh I don't know I I think I could live with a with a five or six hours though a truck for for a few years\nOkay I don't care if you want to that's OK me but you can afford to pay this truck off inside of two years and it's less than half your annual income and you'd be dead free not counting your house inside of two years that meets our guidelines to keep the truck if you want to\nOkay but if you want to do you want to jump out faster you know you're going to be done at fourteen months anyway\nIs it like your call me up and and you know you you make you make thirty six thousand dollars a year and you're thirty two thousand dollars on your truck or something like that which I Do get sometimes you know\nBut I'm doing and that that trucks gone there but uh but but you know eat 'cause you can't get out of it is more than half your annual income so this one if you just want to jump the gun and be done and then you know I Am a drop of five thousand are trucking all been around all move up and with cash move up and drop a little bit and two or three years\nAll right well I appreciate it serves thank you for all that you knew\nYou too sir ...\nOpen phones at triple eight eight to five five two to five the average car payment in America right now is five hundred and three dollars over eighty four much according the

...\nI did yes I decided I needed something to keep keep me going and keep me keep the um momentum going so luckily\nI'm also interested in the other part the part where it didn't work like when you first started you took it and you were like twenty three twenty four years old and it didn't take you didn't go crazy you didn't do this you're worried about what six years before you get mad as it did I got you got to ... what made the difference the causes which ...\nI think coming up that it was close to ten years that I was getting closer to what I've been doing this calendar seemed a little bit on against al at first I was a tortoise for a long time I will just going\nAs it as a teacher didn't make a whole lot of money and I started teaching it and you know two thousand nine and she does that mean if you were twenty six when you were fun\nYeah and I was doing some stuff and then I was using that credit card that I kept for emergency oh all those emergencies and I have a lot of the classes were kind of did so I needed that I took it again and now I teach it because I made that\nRely on your own or you know do I do it shorter mobsters you got the information you didn't apply at all before but then just the the fact that it's just not getting anywhere no traction in the decades coming up and the that got you fired up against this road is that the right answer\nIs and I had to just and I had to learn to budget and had to kind of figure out the cash and telling telling my money\nWhere to go and what like a dozen took a took it took\nMe a little while [laughter] me a little

have to try new things and it's going to take some time\nUm and then I kind of give them suggestions what works for me one of the main ones that worked for me was cash 'em because within bearable income you can always kind of maneuver that budget money around a little bit and and when it straight when there's cash and at the end of the month and there's ... like twenty dollars in your account

Benjamin how are you\nI'm doing well thank you for taking my call they sure what's up\n[noise] well I have a question for you I'm I'm now considered trouble and my term life insurance will expire next year I'm an R. E. F. U. class there are some of us that are considered uninsured herbal so our one of our questions is what should we do instead of term life insurance and in my case\nI already have accidental death insurance in place should I go ahead and canceled or keep it since I'm now can't get term insurance\nHow old are you [noise] forty three and why are you not ...\nHistory of diabetes I'm no longer diabetic but I I just got 'em that diagnosis removed but I have have that in the past five years of my history\nOkay have you checked with Zander insurance and see what they can write to\n[noise] we're in the process of having them do that kind of aid to double check\nOkay on dry out or something yeah because you know every day that goes by you're going to be more and more in trouble in your situation so that's great news ... hopefully is a short lived issue okay because in other words I think I think you're gonna be able get insurance on just don't know exactly when or what it's going to cost that's the other thing you've gotta look at\nIt or it could be unreasonable but I'm\nDiabetes is a real tough\nDiagnosis for life insurance really tough so um anyway\nThe answer your question overall is if someone's uninsured people yes you would keep accidental death at forty something years old you know the probability is accidental\nThere would be your cause a except that you've had the diabetes issue um but otherwise I mean you you statistically that'd be the cause we don't recommend accidentally up as you know but it's better than having no insurance\nRight so yeah I Would keep it and it's not that expensive because it's kinda gimmick insurance is what it is a definitely would keep any term or any whole life or anything that's in place as long as you can keep it don't okay you know to the very last moment and if you're a term ... is expiring see if they have you checked to see if they have a renewal and non medical renewal\nNo I have not I didn't know about those\nSometimes they do ah sometimes it's very very expensive um but again you might be worth it or if you've got a non medical renewal it may just jump way up like triple or something what you're paying now kind of thing I'm somewhat you have like a ten or twenty year term it's run out\nRight twenty or turn when we first got married yeah\nOkay All right yeah that that's um\nYeah you would see you would see it go up you just to buy a twenty year term it forty rather than at twenty obviously\nBut in your case if we did a non medical renewal most of them have that so I Would check that that's the other thing than lastly or not lastly the next thing I Would do is just start looking around for a gimmick type non medical policies policies that don't check medical\nAnd that's like ten thousand dollars issued through your bank or with your checking account\nBut with that pay raise their I'm saying that he also has that they're going to be transitioning him into salary pay she usually works between five and twenty hours of overtime each week so I wanted to make sure that when he they haven't given him an art form I forget that when they do want it to make sure that\nHow would you how would you recommend\nTo calculate whether\nThat the salary rate is comparable with for example the hours she was working before and the pay that he would get what overtime\nWhich would be simple you've been working Fifteen to twenty hours a week last year extra and you've been paid for that in overtime correct correct and so what was his income last year including the overtime\nWithout forty thousand\nAnd how will that compared to the salary\nBut that's the part that we don't know yet\nConservative salary they read it at the salary is fifty that's a raise if the salary is forty five and the same number of hours or expect to be work it's effectively a pay cut\nRight\nYes that that makes sense it's like yeah like as we were I was kind of weird because it was just more of us were in the ... member to ... um I I Know that he has the potential to work more hours so because of that I was kind of rare\nBut but the question the question is not just more hours the question is is this a good deal for him apples to apples not a ... and ... and has he got the chance to move up and the company because he moved to salary\nYes he's going to be moving to management because it shows\nNo but I mean further up later oh okay but let's say OK they offer him fifty five as a salary or sixty is a salary\nWill we be dancing wouldn't we\nYeah okay yeah 'cause that's like that's like getting paid a lot more and I'm working the same number of hours you know it's like it's almost like he picked up more hours but didn't have to work on usually what I'm saying\nBut it but again if they want to give him a salary and act like they did in my favor and it's a ... and he gets paid forty but he's working the same number of hours\nYeah it's just making sense to you that makes sense\nIf it's even if it's forty eight to forty eight we still like the salary because of the upward potential\nOkay\nLong term it's a long term good career movies moving into leadership into management and that's where he wants to head toward its long term\nBut um you know\nYes but but again you just compare it to last year's income so the whole thing comes down to how does it compare to forty eight thousand what's the salary do 'cause that's what he was making working the hours that he's going to continue to be working apparently Chris is with us in Tulsa, Oklahoma Hi Chris how are you\nI'm doing good day thanks taking my call sure what's up [noise] uh well right now I'm a I'm a ... income about thirty one thousand dollars a year I'd be at a fourteen hundred dollars in credit card debt a battle eleven thousand a student loan debt [noise] it\nAh that that about six months ago was about Nineteen thousand I've been working working hard saved my money and paying it off as much as I can good\nOr not uh cooks right now I came up with the idea for an invention ... and I don't know whether to keep you know steam rolling my debt plan and doing all that are just you know kind of jump ship and say hey this is something that could\nYou know be my future and potentially mhm\n[laughter] so [laughter] I'm the kind of want a financial advice from you know what to do with the remaining dead I have and yeah my aspirations because I'm In the process I've been have into a VA home loan and I was just about there so [noise] any advice you can give me I'd be greatly appreciated right\nWell I'm going to avoid buying a home until I got the debt cleared the only question is then how can we start working on the invention idea and make some money now because we don't need to make a bunch of money five years from now we need some money today\nOne twenty thousand dollars touch a show the invention you came up with as a physical product\nYes there is a a odor the odor either slash a mold a real small machine that um people getting on their home\nOkay and you've made one\nI just made a very um rudimentary proud of type ... the next the next phase I've got is like either they're into my rainy day fund or start coming into my regular cash flow\nAnd like buying a computer and get my three D. modeling and get me a couple of silicon prototype so I can go you know take it to a you know take the next level or what I Want to do\nSo again Dr jump off my my debt plan more do I have a case my invention [laughter]\nOkay um well what you're talking about you could spend anywhere from twenty five dollars to a two hundred and fifty thousand dollars on it there's really no in between I mean you could just go anywhere you want to go with this there's a lot of money to be spent on something like this\nAnd if you were a billionaire and you you know what you would do is you would build a couple of them and you get them out there and test them and make sure that they work and that there was a market for it before you went into production\n... because you don't go into production on prototypes that our own tested or from an R and D standpoint or you don't go into production on something that I've got no market for it not been able to sell it\nBecause you can let you make a hundred thousand of them and having them in your basement if you had unlimited sums ever be able to sell them you know nationally that I'd like trying to continue to do with the way you're doing it and that's just piece it together and let's build one and let's find somebody to put one in there in the ...\nAnd let's say let me give me just let's just make up a pretend example okay be like your ideal thing you build one or two and your garage and you convince these guys look this looks rough we're not looking at the the form of it we're looking at the function of it I just want to show you that the idea works\nAnd if the ideal works than what I'm going to want you to his place in order for ten of 'em or thirty of them or a hundred of them for for all of your locations okay and you find somebody like that that's got an upside to test it and then if they place that order they just play so deposit with large enough to build the order\n... and it finds itself\nThat's called organically cash flowing something in other words you you prove it to somebody who's going to be a big customer and they place an order with enough of a deposit to fill the manufacturer your first order out\n[noise] the thing I should dial down my rather than just an all my extra capital towards paying out my credit card debt and my student loan debt\nI don't really have time and much capital on this you've already you already built one in the garage yeah build another one okay maybe a couple of hundred bucks right\nAt the person that but I I did see I'm a ... I wanted to be you know a good good looking kind of\nThat's it's a prominent like there are no protections [laughter] very they're very purpose of a prototype despite all the crap that's broken out\nYou're not going to get it perfect you're going to put it out there in the in the marketplace is going to kick it around and you're going to learn form and function changes informants function changes in the ... which has to be on that side of this which has to be made out of this instead of that and you're only going to learn that if you beat up about a hundred of them but let's get two of them in somebody's restaurant\nIn there to restaurants and they got a hundred they can put them in later are two of them in somebody's industrial application and they've got um you know they've got forty more they will order if it works because it's the best thing since sliced bread I got to have the ... I'm ... and then they give you enough money [noise]\nAnd there are a deposit for the initial order for you to do your manufacturing\nAnd basically you got almost nothing out of pocket except your brain power and you're sweating\nAnd your smile out there selling it\nAnd that's how a lot of these things get off the ground\nThe way a lot of people lose a lot of money on them is they go into mass production before somebody has proven into the marketplace for the actual prototypes\nAnd you're talking to a guy's lost money that way the stupid stuff so [noise] do easy man go easy this is the day Ramsey show\nOne drink\nFor years and one of the most asked questions I get is day one are you going to do a live um in in our city\nWith a radio show and book tours in our growing company and family time I wish I could be more places but it's just physically not possible that is until now on Thursday November the fifteenth Chris Hogan and I will be live streaming our smart money event directly to

we could put our Congress through a free you know they need it\nMan wow\nYou guys are fun this is great so uh what kind of ... was the Ninety eight thousand\nAll dumb that it was a credit cards cars

middle school was twelve years old I had this law now\nShe filmed me when I finally click to pay this off but you know I was just like I I Can't believe that it\nJust gone gone yet yeah wow so when somebody is new to the class and they're like I don't know there's a lot of stuff what kind of like you were kind of feels weird or this budget stuff feels weird or what do you tell them the main thing they have to do if they want to get out of that I got to do these two things are these three things what do you tell them\nUm I Would say the budget budget really set up for success for the rest of it really even just the one thing I think that's the key and everything is being on the same page and married and just knowing that you're on the scene to\nOne person doing it alone it's just it's an awesome broadening I say you have to be on the team and going for the single\nAnd I and and then I Would say the other thing that you know God was great to us throughout the process and\nWhat does it looked like when we're debt free like that go what's that dream what's that thing we want to do small goals ... along the way and then the long term goal you know one of our small goes again we discover you right when we got married so veto would like to remind me throughout the process and should get a little frustrated she's like\nThey ruined our honeymoon we couldn't take a hunting mountain come running I Know I'm just a couple of weeks ago cash flowed our honeymoon too long to do a job that's in there and uh so that will sell oh wait yeah and we enjoyed our time there and it was cast\nAnd we were still you know like say we're ball and on a budget like we we cash flow to even dare when we ate we didn't spend a lot of money and I'm saying and\nYou know just keeping those little short term goals in our long term goal we always talked about is we want to get to that baby step seven where we can just given our goal is to live off the ties and give Ninety so that's our long term goal is to just\nGet from the first time there are ... and just\nLook at you and your generosity that can be awesome well very cool very cool very proud of you all why gun people sharing

start because uh you know this Florida terrain as well as anyone alive I I Know Florida has many big gains but what is this game mean what does this Florida Georgia game mean to graduate of both sides\nBefore it's all part of a bone to pick with you OK I'm just so the by people down here to know the answer why after all these years you have a Nineteen eighty play the one Rocky Mountain Georgia history where\nThey got the greatest moments of joy history that's why we\nDo see see unrest say younger but dead why don't you go back to the last twenty eight years which by the way the record being bought in Georgia last\nTwenty eight and on I I Know it's still pretty heavily towards Florida\nTwenty one seven so you're so you know that and I'm not even that good with numbers like I can be often you know what's various recognize against some\nThat will let alone and wash yeah yeah so so that's just not dying it's too far off right\nOkay well that that's great spoken like a true Florida Man but there was a nice game so important\nWell it's a traditional the border war\nA it's a game that has produced really some surprising results there have been upsets obviously there have been great coaches like bench Julie obviously who owned Florida for a long time\nThough ... you're on the scene in Nineteen Ninety One they all try to talk about a play the game of Jacksonville the one of the home and all that said well [noise] you know we can do better half replay that adds in Gainesville and he said why the stadiums in Florida at that\nTime it has the gator bowl name on the

and I don't know who who's decision was I'm sure it was someone above my head but uh that's why this game resonated with people like me who didn't really know one thing about horse\nYeah of course and that's why I've had people come to I had a young intern work from in Denver and they took in ten years before he got to come and see it and it came down with the ...\nThe cocktail yeah I've heard all about it as part of the social scene of college football it doesn't mean you're in ... as you can go to a cocktail party and drink tonic water I mean you're ... alcohol is just a celebration of football and that's a real reason it's a celebration of football and the south rink to schools\nThat are obviously big\nA big rivals and it has been a spectacular event more times than not\nNo doubt and and now to talk about this year because uh I think we expected Georgia to show up perhaps undefeated\nWe didn't expect Florida to ah show up in the top ten with only one loss to describe to all of us who aren't uh swimming in those Florida shark infested waters every day or how the gators have gotten to this point and and and what what's the future look like under down on\nYou know we asked that question then modeling yesterday\nAnd I have places a press conference as I said\nYou find it a little unusual that you are ranked science in the country and nobody's it all up in a press conference so far you know and he sort of smiled he said well I'll take that you know\nAnd I'd I'd rather be seven at all and the and the sex monitor the so now I'll tell you it means something I'll be feel better for so rank the top ten next week when he wants to be Georgia but\nHe's feeling it and that he was delightful as press coverage let me see or about ... months he's your guy you've

welcome to the program how are you\nEncouraged her doing quite well thank you\nA question was the um [noise] so are you guys are talking about Alabama's a slap on the one of your callers was mentioning damage schedule in a ... you and I spoke about before the one time I ever made it true that many attempts trying to get through what are your you get a very popular show there um but ah when you\nWhen you compare contrast and compare a let's say quick situation with the first one I could think of as a a a Michigan winning out [noise] um and let's say or LSU who I Believe is capable of two at very least give them a game say I'll let you take some ... next game that's even say by seven points\nWhen you can cricket when you're picking the the top for do you think ... it would be in trouble against Michigan winning out a strictly by the strength of schedule any extra gained the championship\nSo you're saying Michigan wins the Big Ten including a win at Ohio State finishes twelve in one versus Alabama with one law is that correct\nPayment with one loss however the last coming to LSU and they won't be able to get to their own championship\nBecause um yeah and I think that would again right now it's hard to calculate all the numbers but it might it might favor Michigan you write\nAbout up so I I Would leave so just because\nThey have a they would have a lot of quality wins in Alabama at\nAt the end of the season uh depending on circumstances would would would would maybe up to hang on to a and M. as its biggest when\nYeah it's a and as far as the law says the losses would be\nA wash cars they'd be pretty much identical or they each lost touch down on the road\nYou know I Know I I already know Notre Dame are ran the table that would be the difference right there\nGetting a schedule that I I don't I think somebody called in earlier today um [noise] I I mean in a car it's the only place I've Sirius Radio so unfortunately I missed the call but I think they're saying something about Notre Dame and the top four and a negative sense I I wasn't I didn't catch it all but uh if they went out with their schedule\nThat way they don't get any of it yeah I mean to me Notre Dame has a really good schedule in a ... maybe that they've had big wins which is what you have to have Alabama the schedule has not been kind Alabama this year and what I mean by that is Louisville's a total Bush to do\nThe weight over Louisville looks like a kindergarten class compared to last year FSU as you had to had to win the on the final week of the of the season to get into a ballgame or Louisville is just terrible this year so don't you think you can't control but you have to live with\nBut um you can control having the cupcakes they have to cupcakes on the schedule they have to do to schools and no offense to them um oh I Know somebody who is a\nBar and you asked me and I'm I'm with you I agree with you on that I don't I don't want to see those games at all and Alabama has them and uh you know listen now they have to do is went out and do they want to deal with them but but it is a fair point and thank you very much for your call Philip in Florida you're on the air go right ahead\nFatal how's it going lifestyle is our first caller glad to hear from you thank you very much\nThey are I saw you a little piece with Andrea earlier and she was talking about you know how the potential for el issue to to climb up in a in a perfect world but let's let's say what is um let's say Florida wins Saturday\nAnd you look at you know Florida an LSU Florida's only losses to a pretty good you know number twelve Kentucky\nLSU has you know a win against a now so so Miami a lackluster ... and you know Georgia so Mississippi State will flow of Florida would have those same wins plus that head to head with LSU or what's what's your thoughts\nOn that yeah I Know yeah I mean you're right are you scheduled can help you or or be your enemy and right now that would not\nHelp at all [noise]\nOf el issues winds are ... are are being diminished now if if Auburn could could have something to say about that with the wind over a and M. and\nAnd they they play Georgia and Alabama but if Auburn loses a out meaning the three conference games that wouldn't means very little to LSU other than in fact it was a fair when on the road that's not the same when in Miami that's not going to help them very much the ah the Georgia when has a chance to really carry them a long way\nBut but again if if Florida can pull out\nThe I Know you're absolutely right a ... that will be a factor\nAnd I ... I see Florida Georgia as a fifty fifty people kind of talking us down I I think we've got a pretty good shot Saturday\n[noise] well I think you do to a Degas certainly favors Georgia but\nWhat does that mean ... that's ... that's ... that's simply a betting line put up there to draw equal number of a point right now I think George is more than a touchdown favorite will take a break Jessie Palmer will join us in a couple of minutes he'll give us a some remembrances of Florida Georgia\nAlso look ahead to the college football playoff next week\nInto my favorite TV show fans ville presented by Dr Pepper airing every Saturday throughout the college football season during the commercials in Fayetteville Dr Pepper delivers a Tour de force performance alongside a legendary college for\nOr just add less miles critics are saying it's\nFantastic and the best thing since died Dr Pepper and Dr Pepper cherry get your local Dollar General today and grab some delicious ice cold Dr Pepper the official drink of fans ville\n\nYou want a beautiful wood floor in your kitchen back or Madrid but you also know eventually there will be water or mugged there which ruins everything right or wrong would would look like ... flooring only available at the Home Depot and\nYou get the wood looks you want while being completely one hundred percent waterproof\nGuarantee so now where there's water there can be with\nLife ...

have now done to\nIts welcome in Jessie Palmer to our program are getting ready for the college football reveal that is a week from tonight the programs are not OK Jesse thanks for the time\nOr let's make believe even though that's impossible maybe in your well it's not a that we are a knocking on doors next Tuesday what's what's the playoff going to look like I'm not knowing what happens this weekend but especially when we're talking about the the two as you see schools that aren't playing\nPlus Michigan Notre Dame and Clemson\nPaul I think the thing I'd be most interested in seeing is just kind of where Alabama Clemson and Notre Dame stack up in that first a\nCollege football ranking course assuming that they they went out and no one has taken a lot setting ended that we can it be interesting to see I think a lot of our minds a lot of people have Alabama number one right now\nSimply because they look just so dominant I'd wander in the committees eyes worst strength of schedule starts to play and if maybe that would tilt in favor of Notre Dame over programs like Alabama and Clemson maybe in that initial pool because of what their resumes look like\nA and I think like a lot of people kind of how do you stack\nThe one lock teams there's a lot of really good ones out there right now obviously in a bunch of the FCC with Alice even Georgia and Florida and Michigan and Ohio State Oklahoma and Texas out in the big twelve so I think that initial ranking while it certainly is going to change over the weeks following\nA I think it would just be interesting to see as a starting point where the committee puts those teams especially the undefeated up top\nLooking at L. issues resume do you do you think there's a possibility they put them as high AS number two\nUm I think it's possible potentially I mean I've finally put you in my top for I just can't ignore\nThe resume after this point having beaten a for top twenty five teams it's been very very impressive to me and I think in this first poll a depending I think if they did I think that would send a very very clear message that they are prioritizing strength of schedule and who you beat and over necessarily or how you look necessarily the I test\nJesse ... with the Ohio State law so it certainly pushes the Big Ten in a position I don't think we're expecting them to be just she adds to frame the big change for us as we still have all five six weeks to go before the Ohio State game hosting Michigan\nYou know I really think that the winner of Michigan and Ohio State it both teams have won last in that game and the winter that game goes on and wins the Big Ten\nI still think that they have a a good likelihood of making it into the playoff Michigan obviously would develop a very very strong resume by the end of the year especially with wins over Penn State and Ohio State and then Big Ten and the Ohio State were to be able to beat a top five teams Michigan is in the top five at that point you'd have to imagine they would be\nI think that'd be very very impressive to in the eyes of the committee and who knows maybe Ohio State that exact revenge over Purdue Purdue can be a team that goes and plays in the big tent title game if they went out uh I think that will be impressive in the eyes of the committee I think the biggest nightmare scenario right now for the Big Ten would be\nFayetteville North Carolina next news in\nOne hour we're online news talk Ninety four one dot com\nNew CBS News on the hour with Jeff blower presented by the\nRecruiter Tuesday Afternoon

Bennett galvanized the city of the way I haven't seen them for a long time but I think it was probably\n\nWas that was a galvanizing the city or when you're talking about the city that that suffered police shootings in New York\nHow was this galvanizing Baton Rouge\nOr you can't pause it be fair I it'd\nBe fair that is ridiculous and then I mean we're talking about at a college football on that level days away\nNot not not on that level don't those were the track tragedy national right or we're so in no way no way we're so it'll be clear as it relates to sports though ... it's ... it's delving as the city in a way\nI bet that the closest we can pick up would be that far back to the the the the Florida issue is related\nTo show where there are communities that is being\nGalvanized because a player a took a questionable shot at another player that two people sitting next to me the other day agreed with said it was the right call our I mean I I\nI Am struggling to understand the outrage here would you explain that to me sir\nI Want to wait until you there is if you're in Baton Rouge if you're a huge fan of you know in the area there is a perception because they never actually used as a very intelligent and most of them are not only watching their bad that scene don't watch it on a team\nThat watching you see in the highlights sports yeah that's right that's all they see other similar plays and they say hey\nThat plane was called ... independent ... hey no fun at all I was told that that's like my dad was thrown out so from that perspective there saying wait a minute if the ruling as this thing\nIs the official haters out of the officials are told to look for the same thing in every game why is it different results in this particular contest and the history going back to where the ... Peterson head is what it all that it's a session I\nBelieve that it didn't make it official about that on Twitter status and he's right but so that's why there's a whole other piece of this I think we're missing and you did a great job drug amusing runs it\nWhat you did the principal use logic to discuss it only took about college sports Paul this is not logical basically most of the players are playing for the guy next to them\nAnd when the guy next to them as they put out if they didn't get to that galvanizes that team and then also galvanized the city that say hey listen I Would have been done wrong is that makes it\nA ... I don't know uh uh I'm not sure what makes sense\nBecause I mean you're right you're using emotion I'm trying not to you I I don't have a an emotional attachment to the ... I'm looking for the right answer and when I hear a people throwing things up against the wall and I hear a political like James Carville probably hung up the phone you're yesterday and just laughed all the way to the bar\nA new believed that I saw and but but what\nTroubles me is intelligent people like you who who start bringing up things that happened in nine years ago is if that has one thing to do with this it doesn't have anything to do with this for a for a\nWhile I'm In the underside a camp I Do not believe that toddlers linear it's a string I Believe in Springfield at all of these things are conducted at one point when you are a fan of a team that doesn't seem like nine years ago when you are now that she's saying\nThomas into that it's been this you're going right through the wormhole that happened yesterday it's like you say and then if you believe that the is the official have not done you know you get that let me get a bomb I met people out there you did something put the two years ago you forgot to pick a Potter stole\nHay for when they let me reason to hold on to say enough of the rhetoric let me let me read your arm that just came out from our gifts from yesterday jokes are good and then he ... I Want you to read this comment under the heading Devin why this is a an AOL dot com and I knew I Know where I Know where that's located so do you\nAre but that but that should have nothing to do with it a Devon White broke the rule and now we're only she was suffering any basically talks\nTrue fans don't have anyone to blame except Devon White uh and he knew the rule he broke it it knows team is suffering and that's why I don't understand\nIt this was not a it's a debatable call but or what but it wasn't like he didn't commit a penalty here that was interpreted he put himself in that position if you ever consider that that maybe uh he he has some\nCulpability and all of this it's not all conspiracy and Oliver Stone and nonsensical stuff you find on some underground far out of the way Internet site were lies are viewed on a daily basis\nDuring the week and it seems very unlikely Paul he was going to be able to bake it to the stadium for this game\nBut we've seen miraculous things happen and we've seen the human spirit rally to the cause it he he was just despite being very very sick as he described it Tom\nI'm his words kicking all over the place the day before the game somehow that day arrives um he he found the strength and the will to get in the car go to the game and was in good spirits and and lo and behold his his wish\nCame true then you've got to see Purdue beat Ohio State and he was he was there I'm being wheeled little brother on the sidelines of data the locker map to the game or where he gave his speech and and the entire tea crate over him and it was extraordinary ... I mean so many levels beyond sports\nIs it the way and the feeling that he had for that team that was sort of carrying him along and allowing them to be there now he's talking about going to the ball game he's he's is a series of picked up but he wants to ... keep going and\nWants to save up for a boat trip so it was just an extraordinary story we're privileged to be able to to help towel and both both she was about his strength and guts and resolve um and it made it very very special night there\nTalking to Chris scholar Chris one one last question on on on what we saw Saturday Night this is the third time I believe you've seen the buckeyes this year what what are what are your thoughts on where they started this season where where are they now and I guess the ultimate question where are they going\nLooking for leadership looking for the alpha is for that program as always had to step in times like this but\nThere was a ... or some of the stuff they had on defense in recent years of his first round picks I don't know where those guys are right now would ask a Desert Shield calm quarterback that's great under pressure east perform well at times Penn State comes to mind but\nI don't think he's a fiery leader I don't think that team has the alpha ... that that were needed and that could case in a tough environment on the road but it just wasn't there\nI'm the one dimensional and often ... as has pounded on that and he was right there is going to be times when it comes home to roost you can't run to the ball struggle in the red zone that matter if you throw for four hundred yards again\nYou're going to run into trouble once in a while and the defense often out a position in the wrong gap giving up these huge plays a pony who had not been a huge big play a running team they found ways to gas the buck guys and run for touchdowns and\nUh that it's a team that certainly capable of regrouping but if you had to put them in a field right now it gets Michigan I don't care if the games in Columbus bran Arbor or\nOr Tuscaloosa or the moon you'd like Michigan chances right now the way they're playing defense and uh we'll see I mean it's not over from your house it's goals are still in front of them but they got a lot of answers to find a short time but Meyer just doesn't seem like he's really enjoying this season at all\nI've got off to a tough start for him personally for various reasons but you know to me and cooked she used the word anguish I hundred percent echo that he doesn't look like there's any enjoyment\nUm almost looks uncomfortable in discomfort on the sidelines during games and um maybe that's just because he's got problems to fix or maybe there's other reasons I don't know\nChris on that point you you've been around urban a long time I'm In I'm not suggesting that he's a joyous warrior most of these guys at that level are but how would you compare and contrast what what you saw last week to\nA year ago two years ago four years ago when he won the title is a dramatic\nUrban urban isn't it sends grinding guy and it would pop up and he would be that way where you sort of like you you knew he was thinking twenty four seven in the mine was I was working and it would be Michigan a week or Michigan State we\nMy my perception is ... every week now these in that mode every week and how could you sustain that for a season I mean you you you know nobody is exactly the same every week there's challenges you know when when you have to get\nYour team to squeeze everything has got into a game and and coaches that are great like he is you rise to that moment but I think you can grind every minute of every day I mean like I said the season that off to a very bad start with the three game suspension and I think he feels like I'm this is just not his kind of team\nIt's just I just kind of team right now some of the intangibles and the way they're playing all sense without the ability to run the ball was in office on it's not physical it's not doing its job with the defense it out a position too often and doesn't have that that started leadership so I mean I think it's he's not comfortable with the way they're playing I think he knew\nThe L places West Lafayette\nChris as we wrap up let's broaden this conversation a little bit or everyone knows the calendar we're weaker away from the first college football playoff and\nThings are starting to to settle in you've seen a lot of these teams already uh certainly it looks like the usual suspects rather than Michigan uh trying to uh joined the party they they were pretty serious read a couple of years ago what are your thoughts I mean we know Alabama uh but but you but you've seen the rest of them them as well including Clemson\nYeah hello they always got to lose to that I'd get in and out of it gets very likely so I think you just put them in as their fantasy expect to be very intrigued watch it in a Baton Rouge just this standpoint it to a versus that defense because he's otherworldly\nTo freakish up on a plan this was done to set up a ... year he's having thoughts about the numbers about the ...\nThe analytics and it it's it's off the charts crazy good\nBut I was I was playing it effects that's an ultimate challenge for for a a posing often go into that environment so I'm looking forward to that they'll play out teams the fresh blood clue\nI tried to call because it anyone rapes we only get into this play out that has been which I think that happens to to maximize the national interest in that bracket whether it's to Notre Dame\nOr Michigan which controls their destiny or you know somebody might laugh we have Texas since we on the road or the upstate but blunt wants that to that that was lost to Maryland early ... and you know now they have a chance that they can just say can wanted out\nPerhaps beat Oklahoma a West Virginia again the big twelve and I think they'd be a playoff or the team they wouldn't be a contender for that fresh blood saying that tax laws but out of business but that that's what's on sale I she's obviously is as strong contender to Boston for the first time so I'm just curious to see\n... to ... let me questions about what's very strong for the state doesn't even as a major challenge you'd ever do\nBut ah Tallahassee about that's the next obstacle I don't I don't think anybody's going to be a\nGreat job as an amazing thing of the Clemson Florida State game has a is not a computer game of a weekend or\nSometimes you yet we had that circle to get a get a year like for

never know let me go back out and say hello to Jeff in Kansas City Geoff what's going on I\n... a good job I like the parity thank you yeah it was good at least you know the other guy hated it yeah well that's his problem [laughter]\n... it's not as good as a one I had stuck in my head all day and what's that one I think the Kavanaugh parity so what I Want to go to sleep I couldn't because that

well\nYeah it really stuck oh cool my brother recent your general Jeff just like the parity Salem keeping people up at the ... take a nap\nSo we do ... ...\nThat's got to be hard for the listeners can

shiny drug possession right now yeah but they typically have a five hundred pound ... of marijuana so you don't have more than five hundred pounds which any individual backpack or only probably has thirty to fifty pounds right in the building\nAnd so they wait till they'll sit right on the edge of the reservation and when they think it's a good time they'll make that last five mile push because if they get caught and put out county they're going to get charged with state charges and that's where the agenda\nBut we'll get we would you bordering right on the news on this uh um Indian reservation I'm guessing you have to cooperate with them do they cooperate with you I I Can't imagine they would want four thousand illegal immigrants on the reservation overnight\nYou know they're good partner um\nPeople don't want to end up on the reservation there's no jobs there's not a lot of job opportunities there so they want to get the Phoenix because from there it's a lot easier for them to get all over the country so their goal is not to stay on the reservation I'm although I'm sure some do\nNow their goal is to get up to the I ... interstate so they can transport the humans and the drugs that's the cartel that's what I tried to tell people all over this country is it's not about this guy coming to wanting to work in this country ... about our tell controlling human trafficking\nAnd literally if I'm if I'm geographically getting it right in my head if they get through the the reservation the first time they step in to the United states would be in your county\nCorrect yeah it's our county now our county goes quite a few miles ended the reservation as well right I ...\nThe big portion of the county of their reservations in our county but where it really starts to affect those bringing the drugs and the human trafficking is that about that five mile mark when they get into to where they can be charged in ... county and then the state of Arizona\nIts share of mark lamb he of course put out County Arizona you may or may not have seen them on a lie pd which I loved it hopefully you guys will be on there are getting sued 'em for me\nWatching the caravan of two to five thousand people none of whom really need political asylum they've actually said we're going there for a better life we want we want jobs you want whatever you know you and I are are are good guys we we want people to have a better life I'm Glad that my my grandfather immigrated here from Italy legally\nAh when you see an influx like this and it's also very close to to the election there's probably a political slant to it being work closely with ice the or close to the chest your closely with the White House who do you work with seeing this mass of people who may be heading into your county soon what do you do to prepare for something like that\nYou know I was actually a on a phone call about three weeks ago with a our eyes director because you know we have done to hear nice a third\nOf them [laughter] and I thought about three weeks ago or ... the director vice here in Arizona and we were talking about this issue about this this large group of people that was coming out and like you shenanigans or going on to those two intellect\nAnd I've been in these foreign countries they did their small villages to rally this many people something something behind um regardless of that we still have to deal with the problem right even\nWhatever regardless of how they got here who's behind it there are still coming on our doorstep and we're having to deal with it um and it's a tough situation\nI'm like you like you said I Want people to come here I Want you to make a better life but then again you have to follow the rule that's all we're asking to follow the rules that are set for they're not coming for political asylum that they were they would have stopped that Mexico right\nThere really coming to get into America and this is a push to the dangerous thing about this court\nIs as they've gone further further there's less and less women and children right this minute Lee Man it's predominantly young man\nIt's very easy for gang members and uh people that are that do not have good intentions to get mixed up into this is and it makes it really easy and for that matter it's really easy for terrorists to get into this group and that is alarming for us as law enforcement here at Arizona\nI talked to a barrage he got real yesterday she is a active uh act for America that or did great national security outlet it and she's just a really smart person she says that they've already found several people who aren't from ... south or or Central America they're certainly not from Mexico they're finding people who speak Spanish\nWho speak um some other language that you might find in the middle east so there are I'm with you there shouldn't shenanigans going on ... somehow to balance the power after the capital hearings and now you've got all the co horrible Trump is on on the um on the border not really getting into that with you\nBut but the real boots on the ground and and that's who you're literally are you guys have to deal with is how prepared are you if you get four thousand people all of a sudden and the next few days what do you do\nWe were there any well with ice and border patrol with the different situation than what we're used to dealing with because what's happening is these people just want to get in the country yeah typically what they do they run from they try to hide for border patrol and from us right now they're actually\nRunning to border patrol and try to because they know that once you're in the country they can do that\nAll those people you know this is a ... this is a problem that should have everybody in this country barriers shouldn't be hurt and they should be wondering what are we going to do yeah agreed Tom\nWe're going to continue to protect our communities are we uh we're concerned about the amount of people that are going to flow into this country and in our communities and so we're watching this very closely\nBut you're from law enforcement guy and I say that yes it's a compliment but it's also your job I ever got people up in Travis County Texas not far from where I Am a where the where the share of just doesn't care about enforcing the law I'm going to ignore those laws on force these laws\nYou seem to be a guy that shows no here's the book this is where the laws are I'm going to follow those I'm going to enforce those going to make sure people abide by them\nWhat reaction do you get from people in our county the residents there last question mark and appreciate the time out what reaction do you get from them when you say\nIf and when they get here and we're going to make sure that we we you know stick to the laws\nAre in or is there a sense of nervousness among the community now with all these people had no way\nWe are very supportive community because we deal with it so much you know in this county anybody understands the majority of people understand the immigration issue we're dealing with\nCars running from some on there almost every night were given the drugs\nComing into our community are you being affected by heroin and buy 'em by ... by these other drugs that they're trying to get our our American public and are you hooked on so\nHere in Arizona and here in our county will get it for the most part you know and uh so we get a lot of support and they they expect to me I was voted into this position on those grounds that I was strong on border security and protecting our community so we had a lot of support from our up from the people that can\nGo good is if they sound like very good people and make sure we have a great sheriff sheriff mark lamb but al ...
