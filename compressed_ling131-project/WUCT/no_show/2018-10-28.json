or heart specialist I share have we talked about pregnancy and heart but what about heart disease is women age especially after medical laws\nWhich leads us to where I'm at their matter of fact more than one in three adult women has some form of cardiovascular disease Dr Hayes is that a matter of fact he would be a fact oh boy at that price for women when you talk about this absolutely yeah\nIn that in that statistic we do include hypertension which is a on the rise and increases with the each year of age particularly in women after menopause that a great\nSegue ha ha and then a pause and just one of those things that again like we said with childbirth or I didn't really consider what heart health white impact that might have on my pregnancy I wouldn't think about it about a menopause relation but of course it is well it isn't probably it's\nBetter known honestly because we have as women age they they have gotten this boost perhaps the protection ... compared to men of about ten years they get about a ten year grace they present with high blood pressure and heart attacks on average about ten years later than men\nWho are are diabetic actually it eliminates all of that advantage but um for instance women's blood pressure tends to be lower than men up until about the age of ... around age fifty and then women's blood pressure starts going up men stays high but it levels off\nSo it is a time in life that is both a change related to changes in hormones but I think pointing out it's not an abrupt change and abrupt uptick but think about other things that happened to women around the uh at age fifty fifty one which is the average age of ... us\nOff and they become empty nesters they have changes in jobs changes in physical activity they get a bomb near ... and they get less active there a lot of things that come around that time that can confound and worsen an increased risk for cardiovascular disease has a special time [laughter]\nAnd uh it says free and I just feel sorry [laughter] does estrogen\nI'll protect the heart [noise] so complicated question [noise]\nUm we believe so um the endogenous or the average and that is in our bodies in during the pre menopausal state we think that that is because they're estrogen receptors on every blood vessels in the body and it keeps women's blood vessels um elastic and healthier\nGets more complicated though in terms of and I don't want any of the listeners to hear that yes oh that means I should add estrogen back to protect my heart after menopause so the women's health initiative showed that at least in older women who are a few years past menopause adding estrogen back\nDidn't help them didn't help their hearts it may be and this is the the the question that continuing it at a low dose if you're gotta already healthy heart I'm early after menopause might be something but the general rule is we don't recommend\nAdding estrogen back after menopause laws to protect the heart at this point\nSo let's talk about the distribute the risk factors again going to do the same for for men and women under the same risk factors essentially for erectile dysfunction Alzheimer's disease interestingly\nBut show diabetes obesity high blood pressure smoking smoking a sedentary lifestyle lack of a activity cholesterol\nYet cholesterol triglycerides and women so lip it's as holes in it um the standard total cholesterol we've kind of moved away from and just saying well over two hundred you have ... high cholesterol because you can have other factors in your uh cholesterol that puts you at higher risk\nUm particularly for women elevated triglycerides um which is another fat in the blood that is more influenced by dietary sugars 'em and carbohydrates as opposed to fats and genetics [noise]\nThe other is where you put on your fat and\nSo this planet [laughter]\nSo you can be normal weight but if you have a ... distribution that is mainly in your middle and your waistline as opposed and your hips and buys for women and for men that conveys an increased risk\nAnd so when you start gaining weight I'm even going from normal weight to higher weight which often happens is we get older I'm puts women it even higher risk how important\nDoes activity especially postman upon\nSo when people ask me what's the most important thing I can do to prevent heart disease if there are smoker that's number one number two is physical activity and the reason I say that is there's such\nUm deep and broad strong evidence that it makes an impact not only for cardiovascular disease but for Alzheimer's and for bones and for us\nSo does go activity is great [noise] the other part is it's never too late to start physical activity we actually have scientific studies that say that women who start out and walking program over the age of sixty five actually reduced their risk of heart disease from the nurses how study so it's free\nIt's not sexy however and it's a hard habit to adopt a view hate exercise as some of my patients do you feel like your patients are getting that message and are trying to become more active in mid life so I think\nWomen are so busy and one of the things so the the answer is yes but okay but I think getting back to why I'm women don't take time to take care of themselves\nWomen are raised in a culture rated to be caregivers their moms they are you know they're the group's leaders there often even if they're in the workforce there the moms at work\nAnd and so often when we ask women even you've had a heart attack why don't you make this change or eat healthy or exercise\nI don't have time 'cause I'm driving my kids um my husband wouldn't eat that healthy food so I'm just going to make it\nAnd so flipping it so that they know that if they can do those things they will accomplish those other goals I eat caregiving and making an altruistic thing which can be very helpful and that's been my biggest success in helping people frame it when I don't have time 'cause none of us have enough time to do this thing's its priorities and\nWe've talked about uh the the major risk factors and how important it is to keep all of those under control and exercise is extremely important let me ask you about a couple of other things with regard to heart disease prevention\nOr there's been some recent controversy a baby aspirin a day what's your feeling about that in women who don't have a history of heart disease\nSo that's an important distinction to make because nothing has changed in terms of our recommendations if you've had a heart attack a stent or have a have had cardiovascular disease you should be on a baby aspirin unless your doctor tells you otherwise [noise]\nFor individuals male and female particularly older individuals who are otherwise healthy don't have diabetes don't have other things\nThe risk of taking aspirin and people don't think about that they just because it's non prescription\nOr actually grader or outweigh or at least are equal to any benefit that one has pretty much stomach bleeding mainly a stomach and other types of bleeding because it it irritates the stomach but also you can get wading into your brain and women and everything we do\nAnd every medication and every intervention and cardiology women bleed more so if it's a risk for men it's a bigger risk for women\n... fish oil\nA fish oil is very popular I'm a five or six years ago until we started actually having data from randomized clinical trials\nSo I I asked if I have somebody come into my office in their own fish will ask why are you taking them 'cause there are other reasons and heart disease you might take fish oil\nBut I tell him to stop it yet because it's really not been shown to have any primary prevention benefit or really even secondary prevention if they don't like fish and they think I don't like fish so I'll just take visual tablets so probably doesn't help because of the recommendations is eat fish a couple of times a week\nIt's not harmful rays but people who are also on blood thinners it ... if you take high dose fish oil it actually can then your blood more than I Am a less is more I go through every patient list I say why are taking it while you're taking it while you're taking it and they say I don't know I said then asked the doctor who prescribed it for why are you buying it and spending your money out of his over the counter\n... we've been talking about heart health and women's votes during the reproductive years and after ... with a specialist cardio cardiologist Dr germ darkness comes from a tree was\nThanks it was great [noise] become a Mayo Clinic radio and learn about gall bladder disease and later on the show how to prevent the all common problem of concerts\nThe gall bladders very inflamed and removing it is I'm less selective in March and\nSo I Want to ask you about the risk factors for developing a gallstones when I was in medical school it was a female that forty and fertile now I don't know whether you can still say that maybe they have changed the words but is that still true\nThat still true women develop gallstones twice as often as men because of their ... estrogen and pro Justin's in the bloodstream\nWe know that a certain ethnic groups developed a gallstones much more often American Indians Native Americans are\nThe probably the highest prevalence of gallstones Hispanic populations fairly high Caucasians below that and and African Americans are less than that even so I'm uh ethnicity is important family history is very important probably a\nTwofold are threefold increase in the likelihood of farming stones\nAre overweight states especially with the BMI over thirty the risk of gallstones is quite a bit higher\nUm and multiple others that are gradually less important fertility either the fertile part or having a pregnancy is a a high risk factor for developing stones or gall bladder sludge a precursor to stones\nA Sledge often resolves after a pregnancy and stones tend to stick around so if someone had multiple pregnancies their likelihood of stones as much higher just mostly to\nSo most gallstones probably go undiagnosed hum but the ... of\nPatients have a variety of symptoms that may or may not be related to stone\nAnd then they're usually fairly easily diagnosed by ultrasound so identification of stone's is generally straightforward except a small proportion of tiny tiny stones um but then the attribution of symptoms to the stone says sometimes a much more difficult issue\nI can tell you that there are outliers in I Am one of them in the mail that forty and fertile and none of them and I had my gallbladder out and is a pain is extreme\nBut in fact I was in the emergency room three times with the same similar pain and since I don't but the bill for having a goal butter diseases took them a while to figure that out\nBut the good thing is you can take it out through the laparoscopic it's relatively simple straightforward surgery or in what overnight and really I didn't have to change my diet at all so that the surgery has absolutely remarkable are there other treatment options decide surgery\n[noise] [laughter] well other options have been developed over many many years but with the advent of laparoscopic approaches to surgery\nOr many of the other options became less realistic less cost effective or less uh they're less effective uh themselves so closest to me is really the only realistic option for the patient who can undergo surgery is a surgical\nCandidate All right Dr

common problem and I think the first question is what is ... how do you an expert ...\nWell ... to patient means different things to different people as as he was already touched upon time punched a patient can mean straining to have a stool and frequent still hard stools it can mean a sense it incomplete evacuation\nSo a lot of times when I'm visiting with the patient I Try to get right to what they're experiencing rather than using the broad term what is the cause of conservation well there are lots of different causes one of the most common causes can be diet\nEither you know eating a very low residue diet are very processed diet how do you mean by the residue some more processed foods ... fast foods\nUm you know that white squishy bread that we all loved his children and wonder where it yeah that's not so good for our digestive system the other thing is skipping meals so people who are skipping meals don't experience a what we call a gastric colic reflex\nWhich is a reflex where when your stomach is distended buy food you're colon contract and that makes the Colin one to empty so people who are frequently skipping meals\nCan have issues with comes to patients well\nAnother real big one is not drinking fluids were not drinking the rights fluids\nAnd sometimes I'm particularly with my older male patients who may not want to be disturbed and have to get up at night they may be really limiting their flu it and take and then that can cause\nIt comes to a patient says laid plans on that one yes and another one is medications so whenever I visit with somebody in the clinic who is experiencing difficulty with comes to patients we go through their medication less and some of the um medications that can be really quite constant painting\nOr anything in the opioid pain medication family\nAnd then certain medications that we use for blood pressure control particularly calcium channel blockers\nCan sometimes causes difficulty with constant patient we're sorry

unique three rooms change your thoughts change your life\nI and I'm excited for him to come up and talk to us here in a bit but before we get started I wanted to talk a little bit about\nHow attitudes affect health just in general\nBut I'm going to use the example of a patient I saw earlier today\nHe Seventy one he looks about sixty he's in great shape he came in and he was talking about all his buddies\nAre a dying or what Ninety five years old because they smoke they drank they never went for physicals they never saw the doctor whereas he was in on a regular basis once a year and he didn't just accept what he was told there would be active discussions\nHe would research things afterwards and do follow up and all the rest of it\nHe's the type of patient with the right attitude he works with his position for his health and he follows the advice and he can see\nMy dad was my dad any like Seventy nine now and he he rides just four wheeler back he takes his chains on he chops down all the trees that have fallen into would he puts them in at Carnegie Hall them back\nAnd that's before breakfast [laughter] that's right the like has a a bike\nAnd in the house just in case he doesn't think he's getting enough exercise\nAnd he really stayed active he still thinks is his own stuff he was a a journeyman pipe fitter so he knows pretty much how to fix anything\nAnd are still very very active and like that and he's also still the go to guy for everybody else no one has ever believe that retirement was in the cards for him so they're all kind of coming back to him but don't you see that when people have the attitude I can do they do\nAcquiescence is the genesis of opposite lesson so\nWe should put that on that for the last supper speak getting my mother to cross stitch that on a pillow forming I think that's great which is like put it on the wall\nSo don't ask were stolen until you can't do anything to shutter to Dr damage point is you know I think people that take a little interest in that you know knowledge of what's going on and managing them and then today that was you know I started a conversation and we quickly elevated conversation up to\nYou know that too much science health people talking he's very well educated but at the end of the\nYou know I didn't know anything is actually a patient Dr games have been a few times when I was\nA ... you wouldn't perhaps be an engineer or would you go see I'm a construction engineer it's like I can tell you know the way he thought well 'cause he's like I got all my numbers I tried my numbers I watch you know he he maintains is it healthy sixteen year old guy you know\nI'm just on the new forty then let things go off the well it depends if you're Seventy it might be fifties in\nMy seventies and for this so let's talk about their reactions you typically typically get from patients now whether that you're just giving them health advisory giving them bad news I think they pretty much fall into particular categories one of those categories\nThe upper Cumberland this morning that seem to have in the morning\nTalk Ninety four point one\nWelcome back to this day and young to visit their young America dot com or call for for well one hundred\nAgain we are super excited about our show today we're talking about how attitude of facts your health and we have a special guest coming up here in a minute Kevin Murphy he's got a new book out that three rooms change your thought change your life\nScientists have been searching for the secrets of immortality probably say first grasp the concept of death time for the immortal right into\nA ... minute we're still dealing with cell biology so new study out of Brown University\nShowed that researchers have been studying the biology of aging cells and demonstrated a new strategy\nFor stimulating what is referred to as ... which means the cells inside the cells all the bad proteins that are missed folded and not working well basically it's a cleansing cycle at a cellular level\nFolds them all up sticks them and a little light a packet and then send it over to what's called the license all that breaks it down\nSo it's a healthy cells clean themselves up and if they don't do this officially all those bad proteins that are dysfunctional accumulate and it is so accelerate the aging process and the cells\nSo we're looking at ways to slow down the aging process at an intra inside the cell level now and so by using pharmacological would sure yet to be developed et cetera we may be able to prevent and improve the cleansing of cells so that they live longer so it's a unique methods\nI'm exciting it was kind of such good things and we've got Kevin Murphy on with us and Afghan Murphy is a former Wall Street managing director city group of high school in collegiate wrestling champion community activists speaker coach and author of a new book called the three rooms\nNow his experiences have given them a unique an eclectic mix and understanding human nature which he's used to put into this book which is\nQuite fascinating a little different than some of the books and authors we've had on\nI Love the he stepped away from his corporate world to really focus on death ... three rooms itself the book and nights you to start the process of better monitoring your thought because we all know that are thought had so much to do with our health our wealth and our relationships welcome to the show Kevin\nThank you very much\nSo that was very easy to write this book the three rooms because this is it's a kind of book that you know someone has put a lot of thought into\nYou know when you're the one on Wall street um a lot of people getting minded to come out of me and consciously think about doing it\nYou know people want to call it short journey but hey for the last Twenty years or so about all different types of books and literature when you start getting a premonition that we've got to write a book and I didn't really know what\nThe doors came to me and one was labeled the past and moments labeled the president won the future and show I kept writing down fog and eventually the three doors became to three rooms because I just kept describing to play behind the doors where our thoughts go\nYou know I I think it's really neat in the front of the book actually has this disease won three doorways in the middle one is lit up so what does that represent ... I Know but I Want to hear from you why is the middle door let on\nWhat the president romantic middle Doris depression room and that's where you access divine consciousness that we all share because the premise of the book is pretty simple back or experience of life is not based on what we do for a living or what we have our possession based on our what we think\nAnd I thought you can only be one of three place they can be in the past or the ... that can be the president or the president wrote\nOr they can be the future for the future room and whichever room your thoughts are in\nDetermines your experience of like in that moment because of course on Fox can go back and forth and in in in a linear time if you will and so it's important to know where your thoughts are and in order to know where you are you going to observe your thought\nAnd it is that active observation that separates your awareness from you thought you know where is that define consciousness that we all showed that the conscious gosh we all share that's why you have to like coming out of the president\nYou know I read something recently and and then I it really kind of opened up my own consciousness\nAnd it was how many hours a day we generally are thinking about the day before and I thought wow that is so true says you're paying attention you know okay how how many times by reflected back to yesterday\nAnd the more I thought about that the more I could be present because I could realize I'm I'm actually thinking about something yesterday or maybe I'm worried about something Morrow um but yeah that you know we met in then taking steps to to be in the presence being that middle room\nI made a really big difference to me\nWhat you hit it right on the head is actively being knowing or being aware that you're thinking of something from yesterday because I've I've heard similar things I mean we we have something like sixty Seventy thousand dollars a day\nAnd they say something along the lines of Ninety percent of of thoughts are taught from yesterday as you were mentioning show we're constantly looking back and then we we keep projecting into the future to worry about the future but\nNot about not going back into the past you know we're not going into the future room it's about being aware that you're there\nAnd then have the same thought every six seconds\nSo that they were six seconds to say the same as the ... yesterday and minimize those laws of war and you can clear out ten percent of those are much more efficient\nAnd that the truth though some of those speaking most\nPeople realize what room there and I mean do you do most people realize or they have to read a book like the three rooms or listen to a show like this to actually say oh wow maybe I'm In the other room\nBut it's actually really Hempel and it's just based on how you feel like I had if we have pictures Seventy thousand today and trying to monitor all of those thought all the time\nEspecially like every ... seconds that same thought that keeps popping up you know we just we wouldn't be able to monitor all those dog so number one it makes it a lot easier to kind of put it into three different buckets or three different rooms\nWhich is based on how you feel because when I talk about the Castro I'm not talking about recalling attack experiences that make you feel good about\nIt can happen in that negative emotion and you're reliving those negative emotion it could be something that I co workers are still mad at him or something you can do and\nYou know and You're Joking about it or something you can feel guilty about it you know negative emotion eating you\nKnow you're constantly going back in those negative emotion or in the room it's looking ahead to the future and thinking about what you don't and worrying about how you got to get something and and worrying about it\nBut we got to negative emotions you know people get up there and they don't realize that the key is what you said you're actively monitor how and not let you know it ...\nThere's been so many studies we were talking about this before he came on so many studies that show that attitude is a direct reflection of your house in your health is a direct reflection of your attitude\nAnd I think it was Henry Ford that said\nYou can think you can or think you can't but either way you're right this is the same concept when it comes to a gene in health you you can if you're thinking you're old you will be if you're signed into the idea that you're young and you still\nHave life and you you will be but we got to go to a break I Want to make sure you follow us on Twitter ... stay on media that they on media we'll be right back and we're going to talk\nTo a little bit more about these

because we we were talking about economic things yesterday and we're talking about uh the uh you know the ah corporate tax mhm and and as we said before I keep forgetting we always get new listeners but but uh I'd made the comment is we made before that corporate taxes hurt the poor the most\nAnd this person just wrote me just completely baffled by what do you mean for those who gets the corporations I had to explain to them\nNo or\nYou pay everything that a corporation is when you see it is financed by the consumer\nYeah everything right or their their their profits are financed by you\nEverything's financed by by prize money to pay their taxes right the the taxes to corporate taxes are paid by the consumer you the consumer pay for their expenses because if you if you if that's not the case they're gone right so a corporate tax is they dealt tax on the consumer you don't see it directly\nAnd therefore who does it hurt the most who has the least expendable income the poor for cobra electronics here's your forecast\nWeather that was located in the south yesterday moving into the mid Atlantic region for the later part of the day is now moving up into the northeast for this Sunday and we'll see that nor'easter provide some more showers hugging along the east coast\nAs well as a system out of Canada providing showers for the northeast and Great Lakes\nAnd that system will sweep as far back as the northern plains to provide showers from North Dakota into Wisconsin Minnesota portions of Michigan and upstate New York the south will be drying out today the deep south as well as the southern plains Texas dry this weekend\nWe've seen heavy amounts of rain and the Lone Star state and lots of flooding there\nAnd will continue to see clear skies into tomorrow and unsettled pattern for the Pacific northwest as we get some on\nDebbie along the coast of Washington and Oregon your national forecast from red on radio a meteorologist John trout thanks so much John eight six six Ninety red eye [noise]\n\n\nNews saw not one of\nWho was a supporter and we were talking about the possibilities of what could harm\nAnd move independence one way or another and the argument was it's not going to change me or anybody that I Know well I Know that's not the point that it's not you're not you're not part of that you're you're already\nIn the restaurant eating you need you need to build a business out this is this is exactly what the president can do and this is unique to this president by the way because the Republicans we'd been screaming for years can't get their message across and if they could get it across if they could go out there and promote that message a very simple message\nThen they could get that out and they could they could gain more seats instead of losing seats and this was back then not right there early now we're talking about getting a message across to people who have not been fully convinced yet if you've been fully convinced\nWe've already made that point you're not the one that we're talking about your not ...\nBut more importantly the president right now or they're capable together of getting real things done and they need to get that message out there that\nThere is this and and we continue to to fight this all the time or we will get people to call well you guys think that you can convince everybody that we don't know\nBut that's never been the goal to convince everybody but there are people that look people [laughter] people a vow of every day it's not maybe not be the majority of the population that people learn every day and\nA teacher's politicians how many look look one of the great one of the greatest things some of the greatest callers we get are people that are called the show and I said you know I used to think this way and then I started ... you know listening to you guys and other people in this politician and this guy and\nYou know you you referenced some people and I gave them a listen to on economics I realize I changed my mind completely ... people change their mind you're not trying to get everybody to change your mind you're trying to get that that person in the middle and we were talking about specifically yesterday\nUndecided it's about it's the political strategy of always growing your base and never being satisfied with what you have always trying to grow it\nAnd we believe if you promote\nFree markets conservative economics conservative principles and you explain it in a simple way\nA nation that largely remains and we're not talking to you who is listening to the show you have sought us out you saw it out shows like this you've sought out information like this to were not referring to you you're already you're already aboard but when there are new people and we get them all the time\nAnd you are able to introduce them\nTo different ideas there is a segment of the population that is willing to listen it might only be five percent but that five percent makes the difference in almost probably ... I Would guess Ninety five percent of elections out there that is the goal the goal is to win\nThat the goal is not to get an immediate satisfaction because our candidate you use a little bit more heated rhetoric than the other candidate we understand that and that's what I Love when people writers you guys don't understand the frustration out there\nYou're kidding me [laughter] ... if you'd like which is which you like to sit in this chair for the last almost Thirty years Mm [laughter] oh no it's always it's always complete peace and quiet here [laughter] yeah right that's what it is being a conservative radio talk show hosts for the last Thirty years yeah\nIt's really an calm [laughter] it's always a very old hide scenario it's like doing constant yoga all the time at a table and oh it's like sitting on a beach\nIt's like they're just sitting there and say I I got friends in St Thomas sending their Virgin Islands St Thomas speech a what a nice day that's what it is\nDay after day here as pure as and and so the goal is is is the goal to get that satisfaction of getting that hangs out every day at the other side that you agree but then you believe is unfair and in some cases evil no that's not\nGoal look after them on the issues go after them with with uh you know with everything you've got on the issues and spell out where their plan is wrong or what they're doing is wrong and and\nBe very clear about it that's part of it but the rhetoric because it doesn't need to be looked at the point is is that you feel like there's this limited window and that the ... the window is closing and it just might here within two weeks and so the point being is that\nYou've seen the do nothing Republicans time after time where they've had I mean mess of doors just wide open for them\nBut you've got to get a consistent message out think about where we are right now in terms of social media and communications we have the ability to communicate twenty four seven any given person can be communicating ... that you can set the messages are\nOf time to automatically go out while you're sleeping and you can you can communicate right now around the clock get the message out while you've got the economic wins or create some more of those economic wins\nAnd you're building again the base you're trying to get more people into the base that aren't on board already what frustrates\nMe is understanding that the left uses the heat of heated rhetoric that they that they use\nThey do that out of desperation ... they can't win on the issues they're angry it's the only thing that they have left because they're they're angry and I understand\nThat on you know the other side on on the the side that I'm most closely relate to that it gets frustrating because they're always just so angry and they were spewing out their hatred towards you and you want to attack back\nWe don't need to because the reason that they're doing it is because they don't have the substance of their ideas behind them and they're frustrated as hell and we don't need to act\nThe way that they do they need that's the only way they've got nothing else they need to be that way we don't need to be that way some of us choose to be that way we don't need to be that way because we have the substance to back up our ideas that they\nWork well well you know here's here's the you know where where they've gone as a party\nThere former leader was in Nevada and the other night and we've gone over the years from that speech at the DNC in two thousand six or two thousand for\nA to him becoming president and two thousand eight on hope and change\nTo just the other night and Nevada ... who vote 'em all out almost big was it because it became if you think about it it's not even a political tactic what would you what I Would have expected to hear from you know the great or greater\nBrock Obama this big speech built on principles and it was basically if you guys don't get out and votes they're going to end the ... ... okay thanks kept an obvious we already know that don't boo vote I'm okay how can you\nCan ... and ... and I and as we said a total lack of substance on actually hitting the the the issues that's the difference look at you know we talked about how we don't like pit political ideology on either side and but I Do understand\nThat because some political ideology on on the left is based purely on personality and on the right it's not\nI still don't like political idea I I just don't like political I dollar free worship a candidate and it's still always bothered me but the fact is I Do understand if you have great admiration for somebody who is promoting certain principles and ideas right\nThat our species that are specific and work and promote freedom and liberty yet then I get it but as you said you saw and I think you you made a great thing Obama was almost begging the other day from what you saw was the shell\nOf the Democrat

Washington Post on there headline had it right there headline habit that the powder that was sent along with the owner was harmless you know a along with the suspicious package was harmless and and so the the point being is that\nThat the narrative is going to grow obviously politically it's going to grow and and build and and still continue up until election day if not pass that\nAnd\nYou don't you don't do any good by you know repeating false information now people are going by their trust of National Review you know based on the headline\nWhich which National Review to me is extremely credible ... at the time but I don't know maybe it's too late by mistake whatever or like I said when I first read it mhm that's what I told you as an earth they're saying the bomb was harmless but this is in our ... not on the air\nAnd then realized oh no that's not what they're saying if you read the sentence again they're separating the sentence and Associated Press separate the two yes\nAnd then says pipe bomb now again we don't know there is that the one thing that we've talked about which again which is when we went through all the different questions that you would ask and the questions that and and that's why it's very important to find out you know whether they were\nYou know ... whether they were active bombs that could have gone off and could have gone off and would have gone on a ... you know and and whether they would have gone off because of the time or or whatever\nOr were they set to go off and what they've gone off or where they just explosive materials that would not have gone off or would we find out that they actually were not explosive materials and actually weren't bombs that they were fake bombs because at that point\nYou would look at it and the questions that you would ask is an investigator would be different\nIf they were all fake bombs than they were meant to just scare mhm or they were meant to be used as a political statement mhm well who would benefit if they were all fake bombs and they were sent for a political statement would be the next question that you would ask right\n\nAnd so again we don't know and that's why we are when we talked about you know CNN and others blaming Trump for all of this incredible divisiveness which caused this and as we said don't even realize the irony\nThat they're saying the divisiveness must stop but yet they create the maximum divisive this by blaming somebody for an incident where they don't have the fact they don't know\nWe have no idea that the motivation behind the the the uh the person or persons\nNobody has any idea and they create this same divisiveness claiming that they're against the advice of this and it's exactly what they're doing how many times a week on\nThe left doing that it's like [laughter] we're accusing us something which is exactly what we're doing\nYeah great well anyway specially without knowing all the facts here\nYou know\nThe trying to put a puzzle together with without all the pieces\nWe've got to it in fact until they find we may never know the motivation if they don't find the person responsible and even if they do sometimes you don't know the motivation you it takes a great deal of a detective work\nAnd I know sources of said they believe it's the same you know right people are ... percent or group of people based on the material which again that that the number of the number of of\nAh devices that you send out is more evidence that the FBI can can use I wouldn't be surprised at the FBI or wouldn't be at all surprised if they solve isn't solved it pretty quickly mhm yeah\nIf you look at the nature of ah how this was said uh the the packaging the if you look at the um the the one packaging for the the device that was sent to CNN\nOr ... you know the multiple stamps it went through us ts bomb each of these by the way\nDepending on who they are even Soros has his own private security go through you know he doesn't open his own meals are usually people at that level don't open you know anything themselves all of that assorted and there's a great deal of security um but\nBut of course with uh the the Clintons that's the case the secret service actually has their own sorting that they do so the male doesn't doesn't it's not delivered\nYou know to the doorstep or or in the mailbox like it would be for you and I of course that's that's that's something that's going and has been for a long time and place but but the point being is that\nThey have a a great deal of resources that the secret service has a great deal of resources into and and finding out you know in in putting together the puzzle\nThere's a there's a pretty good chance right now based on just having cameras everywhere these days that they know it may be where the facility or facilities were at these were sent from\nWhat I find interesting is the fact that the FBI knows right now what did these rely bonds or not they know right they haven't said\nThat we haven't heard anything that said that they were armed and ready to go winds and could have been triggered by a ... a phone or whatever I\nThat would be the next question why not write well because in in in and I know is is there a reason that you'd I'm I'm I'm not throwing out a conspiracy ... I'm saying there is there an investigating reason why you wouldn't do it well\nAnd if they were armed or or or if they were at that at that\nPoint those were those devices were ready to go off\nI'm I'm Wondering about the level of security especially in the middle of New York city\nAh right there in the building the CNN building or the those employees were allowed to go back it was it was after three o'clock sometime that but they were allowed to go back in the building I'm ... and so does that tell us anything about\nThe threat the level of threat based on what they know about these devices will find out in the coming days\nBecause if they were armed and they were ready to go off then and you suspect that there might be more would you allow people to go back in that building\nYou know it's one thing with the Clintons they ... they always have as ex presidents do a secret service detail and they're always going to have that a great level of security\nAh but if it's if you're talking about you know the media you have to assume right that the if the threat is real and if that were at that device word dangerous or we're ready to go off that there you would expect that there might be more or possibly in the system\nI don't know we really don't know it just that's the question that we have we're not going to speculate to the point of of conclusion because we actually there's really not much to go on here we just know that you've got\nA\n... ... you've got these devices you've got a we know who the targets were who they were sent to\nAnd and that's about it we ... we we've seen the pictures on on the on line and in the media as to what the packaging was at least with the CNN device\nBut again where the the the FBI and the and uh everyone that's involved in the ... of course the investigation here they're putting the puzzle together you can't do that this is why I caution and I think it was\n[laughter] we can't you can't watch Fox News I don't care who they are they have the the the so called experts well here's what we're looking at\nEven the experts sitting in a studio can't tell you what they are really looking at it looks suspicious which we already know that's all we know about this entire situation\nSuspicious packages we don't know anything else that's it and when the FBI tells us for authorities tell us more than we can start having that broader discussion eight six six Ninety ...\nSomebody else was gilly my camera and regardless of what our radio [noise]\n\nBe a part of the conversation by calling the shell row tell a hotline at eight six six nine zero seven three three three nine red eye radio and shoveled tell us what matters is inside\nPreserving Petro stopping centers almost half\nOf all drivers spend an hour or more looking for parking it's easy to spend hard earned dollars in time and searching for that elusive spot in the stress a safe place to park his is something you should have to worry about reserve it can help reservists fostered the truck smart adding more in line with servant parking decent money at\n... center now pay for parking with Belgium wants point conditions on the ultimate reward comes\nIn handy for eighty years Detroit Diesel has been the legendary driving force inside many of the best known shut down the road to our latest destroy technologies opponents safety systems even learned the reputation of\nBeing a total does a solution dedicated to all the time and on the bottom line and we'll committed to continuing a legacy for another eight years and beyond when you demand it all the mandatory eighty years of innovation dedication and recognition [noise]\nCBS News on the hour sponsored by their works release [noise]\n...

days\nElections I went out and early voted yesterday and uh uh went to the local community college was one of the early voting sites for me right it was pouring rain and just pouring rain mhm and when\nIt was funny 'cause I've never even though this campus is only five miles from my house I really just\nNever been to never drove through this community college right into drove through what the signs were out front on them you know that that you you could tell me okay this is early voting the political science all over the place\nAnd so I started driving around trying to find the building and saying I have no idea what building that's going to be in but when I but I Will know it when I see it because I had a political science will be all over the place right right yeah and they were\nThe only thing is they\nDidn't have any parking if you came in to vote it was all student parking at a college uh yeah yeah which and I just thought to myself because that was one of the reasons I wasn't going to go there is going to go to a courthouse fright or where you know that was also about the same distance away from me maybe a little farther couple more miles\nAnd I was going to go there and I said nah\nI Want to check out the the the campus because I've never been on it before so I had about a thousand foot walk through pouring rain\nBut when I got in there everybody friendly ... no matter what the ... is ... outside the anger the rage that we see in the media every day\nEvery time I Walk into a polling place hey how ya doing everybody's laugh and joke in what's going on all you're doing and they had the the the new don't didn't have to actually sign\nYou know how you're supposed you sign you know that okay so ... you don't sign any more you sign on a tablet ignoring the tablet around you sign right on the tablet ... you know with the little pencil or I could guess I could have signed with my finger I said this is new they should get makes it real easy um\nProbably because there was nobody behind me in line\nOr just have to just general conversation\nYou know as been busy the reins affecting it they said yeah the reins affecting the today because it's been pretty crowded and then just you know one right up and there were three or four machines that were open and went in and voted and it was done now the interesting thing is I was wondering since I'm a college campus well let's see young people voting\nYeah there were yeah you're right we are voting get that to came in it was right middle of the campus so I mean it was ... ... ... students were walking right by you couldn't miss the fact that this was the place to vote mhm right yeah so but it was a relatively relatively easy\nOur last a national election in our state to vote straight ticket unless the court overturns that\nYes\nYou're right as of September first of twenty twenty uh there will be no the because of the law was passed by a by our state no straight ticket voting after September ... first twenty twenty which includes of course the twenty twenty election\nAnd the only thing I and I think I mean we might have discussed this before the the only thing that I think that you know were needed for is the fact that there are busy doing their jobs\nThey've got their jobs they've got their families\nAnd our job any of the morning right now right and and and and our job is the fact that we have\nWe have time to pay attention to everything so we can articulate what's going on to them so in a in a condensed sense they can get an idea of what's going on every single day and what's going on in the issues in a different form that they get from anything else and and I would say that's about it now and\nI'm so glad that I can do that because I think that's a great thing to be able to do well that makes me feel useful [laughter] yeah exactly I\nMean that's that's what we are I mean the the the uh think of it as a concierge service of information I

line fine then you tell me specifically what kind of deal you would want done issued them the challenge and that's what it was shown a saying here that again they haven't had to answer they haven't had to they don't they some of them don't agree\nWith the open borders but they don't denounce it either and he also talked about the elimination of ice how you had that and there wasn't a massive response from Democrats saying well that's ridiculous you don't get rid of ice\nYou don't get rid of border enforcement in this country that's ridiculous that the American public and even Democrats a significant portion of Democrats won border security they may have compassion for people that are here\n\nAnd want to have compassion when it comes to even legal immigration but as we have brought ... to your attention\nThe demographics that want the least legal immigration into this country are blacks and Hispanics ...\nWhen you look at the polling as to the number of when you go the demographics and you see that the numbers\nOf\nOf\nMinorities in this country who want the lowest level\nOf legal immigration that even from has never talked about mhm it's minorities the vast majority of them the huge vast majority of them who vote Democrat\nMhm no the American people stand with the president on border enforcement they do he's winning that politically but the other side of it is is that\nThe Democrats have not been forced to to say what they want\nAt all you do with the president wants you know what the Republicans won\nAnd and I think that in the entire first off you have to go and you have to be you have to go after the Democrats and say\nAnd you have do you have to force him and backed them into a corner and and as I said uh get in their face yesterday rhetorically is what I said I don't mean physically but rhetorically and make them answer back them against the wall so they have no choice\nTo either you made your point that they're for open borders or they have to respond and give you the specifics that they do not\nThe second thing is sort of what Trump is doing already when he's talking about the care of and saying we'll poll well we're going to pull aid from you ... but look if you improve your country and you become more capitalistic will be the first ones here to help you write\n\nSo we can't take in the entire world but this is where you need to start focusing on those governments in those countries and saying we're here to help you help your own people come\nUp\nBut you need to embrace free markets you need to you need to do something\nBy the way\nEnsure that came out with the hunter and flag\n... and all that and so people start question why do you want to come here right do you want to come here to become citizens or is it just to work and then you know go back and then we have to have that discussion as to well what do we want from people who come over here\nAs citizens but first before you even get to any of those other things that I'm Talking about you have to find out what the other major party actually once when it comes to illegal immigration and border enforcement we're not even to that point no how can you have a discussion when only one side\nHas said it has put forth plans of what they want and the other side\nWon't do after they're part of the party than endorses open borders and just keeps quiet on it well silence is your consent yes silences your consent saying get rid of ice is your consent we're not going to get rid of border enforcement in the United states so why are you preaching that\nNow That's Douglas shown whose looks like to me as the longtime Democrat who are about to use Claire McCaskill's verbiage or isn't a crazy Democrat or\nA says of course the rank and file Democrats the average person votes Democrat and they want border control sure\nIn fact the constituency the votes most Democrat most the time actually to get out of illegal immigration in the legal immigration is a demographic that once the least legal immigration into this country look\nYou have a sanctuary city policies sanctuary state policy sanctuary county policy by Democrats have been promoting it for a long long time and now you have the you know abolish ice\nProtest they they're saying it but they're not forced to say the words open borders\nThey should say they should be forced to say it because that's what they're promoting and if they're not where's the pushback if they're promoting border enforcement at any level tell me who\nAnd I mean the ... from the party that is actually saying that in promoting it is Chuck Schumer promoting that\nNancy Pelosi or they promoting that\nMay be a Joe Manchin we haven't heard him but we have you know there might be one or two maybe Claire McCaskill [laughter] you know she's not one of those crazy Democrats but where's the party saying this is what we want\nBecause that's the official political battle how can we have and how can we have a debate on illegal immigration and border enforcement when the other side won't officially tell us what they would want what they want right\nExcept for those in the party that promote open borders and the elimination advice they won't even have the debate why right\n\nAnd that's what Republicans we Republicans have a Thirteen Years to pound on Democrats for it and they failed miserably in that in that role of

October was Fox News we're ... was a tie a than the Missouri scout that has holy up by one in that and a dead heat yeah it is it is is a dead heat and so the fascinating thing about uh this radio ad\nIs what is said in it where there's you'll hear two men talking\nAnd they're talking about you know a Josh Hawley and the problems with him that\nUh the claim is he gets wind and works out during work hours which we found really interesting for a Senate race to be the main accusation in an ad that clearly is a desperate can add\nYeah they'd be big or just why not that he drinks he purchased wind purchased wind and went to work out right uh and when you're an attorney general which probably your hours you're probably a salaried workers we just did you grow your own state a salaried employee is uh\nYeah uh but [laughter] but I Am thinking that that that's it but uh do we know we'll we'll play coming up on after falling the bottom of the hour yeah gets about admitted that I Want to play the whole thing and it's where they get into the two people talking and this is her campaign at by the way this is not some pack running the ad some other outside group\nThat says her commercial\nAnd they say well you know she's not like those crazy Democrat right so for a Democrat to actually put that in a senator mhm put that in an ad is just unbelievable and we'll have that coming up\nA bomb in the bottom of the hour plus your calls and comments if you'd like to get in lines open eight six six Ninety red eye [noise]\n\nNews saw [noise] Ninety four boys one where really\nAd it was terrorists twice here's the interest interesting question outside of farmers that that was targeted to in Missouri\nIf you went up to the average person on the street and said what do you think about terrorists do you think that have any idea what they were in a nation we're Seventy five percent of the American public cannot tell you what the three branches of government dar\nYeah um you know it's it it really is about the presence I guess in the state of the industry or the particular industry right and and and that is the case in in huge farm states it even if you're not a farmer\nOr ... yeah right now you know but you know to you know the effect on the farmers and they weren't very vocal about it if you're in that said even if you're not a former\nAh you know again depending on the impacts that they they felt it was worth\nUh making that point ah\nWhich you know I Will see if if that point works out or if any of this works er here within two weeks\n[laughter] it's\n... I I think the most notable point is the word crazy yeah because it is it it that positioning was I'm not going the way of of others in my party because keep in mind she she's not trying to position this and this is her\nYou heard her say it she approves this message this is her campaign that\nShe's not saying the people that are protesters\n\nShe's referring to her ... her party and we have to point out that we pointed out you know over the last several weeks these are the mainstream high ranking members\nOf the party that she's referring to here\n\nIn terms of the word crazy that's what that's what they're trying to that's how they're trying to do the positioning hear that word is very important because it likely came back and research\nAnd we made the point earlier that it wasn't she didn't use the word I'm not with the extreme part of my party or she didn't say I don't always agree\nYou know uh you know with my my party in it no saw approach I write it again it wasn't it ... the men having the conversation didn't say look she doesn't always agree with her party and there's some extreme is you know in the she doesn't she's it was\nIt was the term they felt the term crazy Democrat and then she rejects the crazy Democrats you had to be put into that ad right\nWhere the momentum they believe might be moving towards Holly and not her that's a desperate tactic because they're looking at the ... and remember this would be in the undecided voters more independent undecided voters\nWho they're looking to sway one way and it's it's a desperate ... it's a Hail Mary throw Eric has what it is yes I got to let these people know I'm not part of the crazy Democrats right\nYeah I think what they're thinking that's one of the things that's coming back in their polling is the independents that ... they're they're they're looking at holiday because they think you're part of the crazy Democrats might not part of the crazy Democrats right but it's using that term crazy Democrats specifically and not\nA you know not radical not yet a extreme cause extreme of something is a term that Democrats have used a lot\nAnd it's almost right and it's almost a mainstream if you will term word right ah but this is this is also something we pointed out weeks ago during the Kavanaugh thing is that it doesn't matter that\nYou're not a Cory Booker it doesn't matter that you're not a ...\nA lizard with war and or just you know a pick a number of them that are in the Senate\nOr that are Democrats that could be you know I guess people are describing clearly as crazy Democrats I think we have a couple of times\nIt's because of their actions\nAnd and we said this a few weeks ago their actions do outside of their state\nIn terms of the race right they will\nUh taint the races in other states but especially of course those that are neck and neck and and I don't know I mean there's there maybe one or two but this this race is probably one of the closest in the Senate if not the closest according to the polls right now the latest polls we have so\nThat's the effect is that compelling Harris or or or Elizabeth Warren or any of them\nThey whatever they do is going to affect those races those other races and\nThose people in the ... the state of Missouri maybe looking at this going what or may not have anything against Claire McCaskill but I don't want her party having that control because she might vote with at some point a Kamala Harris or you know\nWith as young crazy Democrats she'd as she just did as having a job that [laughter] ... which is the perfect example and that's the thing\nThat endorsement in fact you point out something that is key here that is likely that action yes one action we talked about it before the vote app and\nWhere does she go on this well she made a choice to go because she didn't want to lose those Democrats in her state that did support the no vote but\nIt's not those Democrats and and it's you know it's it's that scale the tips\nYou know the the water balloon you squeeze it on one side he goes to the other if she loses Democrats\nThan that doesn't matter of the people in the middle are going to be with her and if she can't get them right now she acted as one of the crazy Democrats with that no vote she can dome that behavioral Lenny we saw it during the cop Kavanaugh process and and that's why I'm Wondering what the effect would be\nBecause people when we've been talking about you know how you're trying to win an election people think we're talking about how we think and how they should think and we're not we're talking about probably people who don't listen to our show mhm we're talking about the election strategy we're talking about the undecided independents right you're undecided independent\nWho is looked at the Capitol thing and so they're crazy I mean they're they're really crazy and I can't vote for care\nYou know a Claire McCaskill and that's and then that's what the ... coming back ... that ad may be received by these people to say you're just lying to me right you are one of the crazy Democrats but you're willing to call your entire party crazy that you're that you belong with because you just want my vote right\nBut you actually don't believe that they're crazy right you don't believe they're crazy you actually agree with them this just shows you the length of what you will go you will call your own party crazy in order to get the vote and then you'll be trained me when you get into office and you'll vote with the crazy Democrat and with that vote on Kavanaugh\nThat was also condoning their behavior is not you know all of that that's you know that's the evidence to back up their opinion yup coming to that conclusion guess have it all just proved that eight six six Ninety

the FBI said it was possible that additional packages were mailed to other locations law enforcement officials involved\nIn the investigation told Fox News that the similarity between the packages has

audio out of the day coming up following the bottom of your house yeah we do with whether it's ... it's a political ad that if you haven't heard it I Want to hear Claire McCaskill's ad that radio ad that\nShe started running in Missouri the Democrats and the Democrat calling other Democrats crazy Democrat and not one of the crazy Democrats yeah Albert in Texas Albert welcome you're on Radio Welcome to the show high Albert\nHey good morning Eric John Kerry first time caller was college you know that the FBI is doing a very thorough investigation here and so it won't become a boot political issue they'll let us know after the November election\n[laughter] we're real or not [laughter]\nI said good oversight committee and get your message that won't happen so [laughter] yeah I Will have to declassify it uh yeah\nWell I think now you know that the things that are ... and and yeah thanks that's because we we saw what you're going to say we we knew where you were a don't we were going with\nA ... it's a it is fascinating though because it is something look it isn't that the number one question that you would want to ask is a reporter mhm that report them I'm sure they're gonna have a press conference today support is going to ask 'cause the was where are where the bombs\nLeiber not right where they you know word word could they have been a detonated by opening the package because the concern is not just a you know about you know the message being sent or the intent of the person or persons responsible\nBut also about the threat that is still or might still be out there in in the system because let's say that they were going or are going through stages where they're reaching out to these individuals' first and then there are others on their list\nWell the concern would be by you know the the package handlers and people that might even be walking on a ... up to a porch\nAnd and they see something who were these devices ready to go off because they have been detonated a rapidly either remotely or by opening a package\nI think that's information that needs to be made available to the public as soon as possible you know without impeding the investigation itself\nIf possible uh just we got to bring\nNo I haven't I haven't checked but six hundred down down yesterday and the the ... down I think was at Fort Point four percent yesterday\nYeah yeah uh the uh the Dow down over six hundred and and a lot of that had to do with earnings and and we're hearing more and more a company has come out and say that their earnings are suffering as a result of what's going on uh the terrorists from retaliatory tariffs by trade partners is having an impact on on business so out\nOvernight is ... is is up and which I which you might expect uh all the Asian markets are down one percent three the three percent right the Japanese market down three percent a Shanghai up a little bit above ... percent uh Europe a mixture of\nOver in Europe so we'll see whether it's just a correction whether there's really worry\nWe know there is in the housing market and we know for example about you know Ford coming down\nAnd and saying look thanks for all the things for all the help with the tax cuts but the terrorists are killing us\nAnd and it's something like what happened yesterday in the news playing out makes a lot of people nervous and and of course than the markets because one possible do you have to consider is that it was a foreign enemy or that was that was involved are responsible\nFor these suspicious packages and and the the concern that it might not be over or something else might happen we it was all a lot of uncertainty yesterday so some of that is built in to that drop I mean you often see that if there is something that that is happening\nOr as as big of a news story as as you saw yesterday uh that does make the the market's very nervous so uh we'll see where\nIt well and and that's something that we know was was brought up yesterday by you know some of the experts say look you know there's there's three things that could be it could be somebody and they ride it could be somebody and they left it could also be a foreign entity right you know just to disrupt the American\nYou know an electoral above a process or it could be just terrorists yeah who decided to do it and again which that's that's why we find it surprising that are so late into this because it's been three days since this arose\nA bomb initially that nobody has stated whether these were active lie bombs that would have gone off right if ... if somebody would have touched it in a different way right apparently they were handled it didn't go off\nWell because I Would think that if there was a threat of these devices going off whether they could be set off a remotely or by handling the package itself that we would see that warning come out by authorities would we not\nYeah because if we learned that was the case and they didn't warn the public and there was still a possibility of such devices being in the mail system or being out there in in the public and it's still being a threat to the public\nBeyond that the intended recipient recipients over the past few days that they would want to get that message out and and we would be hearing that I Would think that and if we hear that that you know that they were armed and and they didn't say at the most someone's going to have to answer them for on attracts here's your forecast\nWet weather that was located in the south yesterday moving into the mid Atlantic region for the later part of the day is now moving up into the northeast for this Sunday and we'll see that nor'easter provide some more showers hugging along the east coast\nAs well as a system out of Canada providing showers for the northeast and Great Lakes\nAnd that system will sweep as far back as the northern plains to provide showers from North Dakota into Wisconsin Minnesota portions of Michigan and upstate New York the south will be drying out today the deep south as well as the southern plains Texas dry this weekend we've seen heavy\nAnd will continue to see clear skies into tomorrow\nAnd unsettled pattern for the Pacific North West as we get some onshore flow intensifying today rain showers heavy along the coast of Washington and Oregon your national forecast from red eye radio a meteorologist John trout thanks so much John eight six six Ninety red eyes [noise]\n\nIt's going to be the target of a town saw Ninety four point one\nAnd you believe in and you've you've you've mentioned it\nYou know twice okay because you believe it's important you also know or you believe is we ... we in this way back when in springtime\nOr you know we'd sent this when when the way before that we said this one the Republicans passed the health care bill we said don't be surprised if it comes back and it's a negative against you not a positive anymore but as used against you in in the mid term elections and it has been mhm\nSo you've got that and you've got the terrorists that you believe you mentioned at the white in there because you believe that there's a significant number of people who might be attractive to that anti terror of message\nThat Trump has been so loud on mhm\nWhy are you throwing in and wasting any valuable time in a commercial about when he's on the job he went apparently the claim is he went and bought wine and went to the gym anybody knows that when you're an attorney general here ... you don't work hourly you're not you're ... you're you're really you're on your ever\nIf you're sitting there and say oh okay I'm going wrong got to stop by and and get a bottle of wine or something like that or I go to the gym during the day because that's a lot of the day when the best time to go or you know but but that's it they didn't\n... there was no real focus honestly they would have been better to leave that out completely and joke goes straight onto the crazy Democrat well maybe they maybe they should have mentioned the crazy Democrat twice and by the way I was just thinking the law and order\n... uh uh you know didn't didn't ah I Can't think of his name or didn't he ended up running for da jak\nYeah jak ran for Diego he was he became ... now did did the opposition ever used the fact that they they ring ring or are in their office the whole time that we've always talked to weight loss and them on TV I mean I drink all that if they drink all the time after every case win or lose fighter and they're drinking at the end of the day and they're off and not wine\nLike ... it was hard liquor they're always drinking [laughter]\nAnd so when I heard that I went to come on a hey come on their\nTheir prosecutors they all drink I [laughter] but but yet when we and getting back to the ad and you said there certainly are on the show that\nBecause we focused in on using the term crazy Democrat instead of using the term ex dream is Democrat yes ... leadership of the Democratic rights right\nThere's the verbiage is clearly some kind of response that they got verbatim they were hearing that repeatedly that phrase crazy Democrats by people in their cola the ... their internal were showing that this was a that they you know this was a way a hot button\nThat they could connect to some of those undecideds right now those independents who were leaning right at that moment and the concern they had was the\nCrazy Democrats the ... that's that's why that was you you just it was used and directly came from a likely from that that kind of call out research response that you get\nThe because there's there's no other way to do there's no other reason\nTo put that in and that that becomes what the Hail Mary in this really neck and neck dead heat race in Missouri it is I mean it's out of all of them I think it's probably\nA if it's not the closest it's prick pretty close to the closest Senate race right now uh so I think it's it's um\nClear that they wanted to connect with those people that are leaning right that her independence that are winning right might otherwise vote for McCaskill the problem in that as her her actions is specifically with with capital\nBecause in siding with her party Kavanaugh you were condoning that kind of behavior right and you can come out and say no I just wasn't sure and I need to be sure when we see that doesn't sorry perception is reality especially\nIn in in this kind of situation that is that it's going to and could well that issue this side and many of these races the uh the outcome of the the Kavanaugh situation\nAnd when you look at the polling there in in Missouri to begin with a a if you look at the September polling a you know as the CNN uh McCaskill's up by by uh by three ... with a with likely voters and you get to the Fox news poll which was\nUp until I was nine twenty nine to tend to and it was a tie and then you know through that whole time the cabin all thing in ... Missouri scout a huge sample of a over twelve hundred likely voters and holy up one\nBut right uh and still nobody has hit the fifty percent mark so there's still a ton of undecided there the using that term crazy Democrats a Democrat using that in an ad\nBy the way apparently ticked off other Democrats in Missouri I was reading an article on that earlier up but using that term means that the undecideds are talking about it\nThe undecided that's part of their mind set\nYeah you know the Democrats are crazy these are crazy Democrats now that had come directly from cabinet yeah because I have to be to do it for that to go to the level of\n... ah from fringe to extremists\nToo I just read my leadership too crazy Democrats mean that exact term they're not stir crazy that is the mindset that they view when a significant portion\nOf undecided independents in Missouri that she's trying to get aboard I'm not part of the Democrats I'm not part of the crazy Democrats I I I I think for myself I'll go to the middle I Will compromise which means what you'll compromise with Republicans and\nYeah\nYou know it's it's a ... this is why you have this race that you have here it's not because her opponent is is is this big great strong opponent\nIt's because there's weakness across the board and [laughter] it is bipartisan week in nature I mean she's getting she's get of course they're they're Republicans in that state that would never vote for uh the casket let's you know that that that's a given\nBut those people in the middle and this is what we've been talking about for a long long time those are the ones that may vote one way or the other in terms for one party or the other\nAnd they're the ones you have to convince\nThey're the ones that get you over the top and right now she has too many weaknesses that her that really don't serve her well with either side and I think that comes directly or certainly her vote on Kavanaugh was an indication of that weakness if if it didn't help create it\nWell you know there's it's it's one thing you know you you can\nUh the the uh\nInsults the ah the accusations against Donald Trump being crazy being not you know everything that you remember the whole mental health thing that has sort of disappeared hasn't it\nNow that he's mentally ill and all that was you know you can look at the end you say okay that's that's an intact that's always thrown at at one person the president always gets that yeah but we're talking about a political party as a whole\nWe've been talking about the the the Democrats from twenty six team where they said look we've got to go and figure out what the people the heartland is\nAre going and we said back then we said yeah but they're they're talking crazy stuff\nThey're talking you know the whole transgender saying look we have compassion for everybody but\nIf you think you're a ... if you think you're a man and you're a woman doesn't make you a man and it doesn't make a man and shouldn't make you want man legally run you shouldn't as a man be able to compete against a woman ... the vast majority of Americans believe that\nThe trans racial thing that they started adopting President Obama before he left office talking about the fact that he's come to know that race is a social construct though it's not\nRight and and so we talked about that craziness well it's gotten to the point\nIf it's no longer the Democrats in order for Claire McCaskill of put that in the concern is no longer the Democrats aren't relating to the average person it's at the average person has now joined the Democrats as crazy ... and the cabinet thing I Believe is what put them over the top\nYeah and and and that behavior by the way as we pointed out not from protesters from from the high ranking officials and and and members of the party on those committees Claire McCaskill's now as a ...\nEight six six Ninety ... what's the difference between standard number two diesel and premium fuel rods Justin is director of product management for cynics the makers of ... wrote master ... sell premium diesel fuel and he fills us in\nHearing what it can fit or the the toilet operational costs why the price of the oh look at the cost for replacement\nAnd look at the cost of ongoing maintenance unfortunately those costs seven Kwon do they actually continue increase into upbringing in a real results for large operational saving\nFuel economy and reducing the equipment the ... are free to owners if you want to consider triumph fuel in the past year if you have considered it now's the time to take advantage of that with a lower evil fewer places the trial that green and\nThere are more than fourteen hundred and fifty cents locations in Nineteen states across the Midwest and Pacific Northwest visit than X. dot com defined as FedEx location and learn more this report is the surface of shell roads ...\nBucks more readily radio with a record ...

are actually opened the thrill seekers year round\nThat's true and that's what's so crazy about this world and you know obviously we have these things like universal studios horror nights every year

I really really went in it and I'm going to rite of passage for me to watch people go through that but everyone's experience is completely different that something that was really interesting to scare actors\nAnd they can read to see that they're going to be more afraid you know they grab them from the front or grab them from behind I mean\nOne woman had a plastic bag put over her head she was the rash around in the air they threw a cardboard box on top of her raped across it with a rake and then the guy punch through the box grabbed her neck I mean everyone's experience was different but\nI've heard of people being stimulated buried alive waterboarded forced to eat some pretty crazy things they've had to light other actors on fire there's just some very interesting things that happen here and it seems like each one that happens it's just next level next level\nYou know one guy who was visiting extreme haunts forty four times though one recently the events in the strictest boxers and curled into fetal position to merge drawn related body fluids his first words afterwards that was awesome\n[laughter] exactly so that was the one that I was that and you know it was interesting because this took place out in the middle of the desert and they said it was kind of an existential space crisis so people arrived they were blindfolded they were led to this dusty RV\nThey were stripped of their clothes and put in this distress based suit and they were told that they were these criminals that had been on the bottom eyes and that they would be walking around the property collecting\nBlood samples and trying to identify a couple of bodies that were there\nAnd they were given a walkie talkie there was this this embodied voice that was super creepy that was walking them through all the moves that they were supposed to make and they walked through this property and there's fog and smoke everywhere as they walk in there is a man let on fire running around screaming\nAll these different actors encounter them and torture them and scare them in their own unique ways and\nThey ended up in this tent in the back\nIn the pitch black with all this fog\nAnd this man is monster with a mask just pops out of nowhere and strict rationing them around and\nRich the spacesuit off strips them down to their underwear and is just smearing this simulated bodily fluids goo and vomiting on their chest and yeah so the majority of these participants did end up in the fetal position in their underwear and what was so hilarious about it as that you know I'm watching this thinking\nWow that they must be really shaken up and they are but as they make the walk back off the property in kind of transition back into normal life they're so excited they would do it again they're telling me that these memories are going to last them a lifetime\nFor the actors are just there are some ... of these extreme haunts\nHere they're not allowed to actually hurt the people one of the guys was\nKind of funny and he told me that his only rules were basically don't kill them don't permanently scarred them but um you know they actually get physical which is funny I mean you go to places like the universal studios Hans and you know they pop out and I think a lot of them\nHaving no touching rule and these guys can pick them up they can throw them around that can put their hands around their neck\nBut they're not allowed to actually physically hurt them and some of the participants they leave with bruises they leave with surface scratches but they all said that they kind of expected that going in and\nYou know they all wanted to make it known that they're not into just being tortured for the sake of being torture but the beauty is that they're basically living their own horror films and as long as it moves the story forward they're all about it\nThis weekend gym just go with New York times freelance reporter Nicole pager thirty minutes after the hour

Center for health care innovation a group that's been offering health care in the upper Cumberland since twenty twelve Dr Brent state and\nThank you for being with us thank you very much for having me how did the Cumberland sitter for healthcare innovation come about\nWell it's a long process and long story but I'll Try to make it short a group of physicians in the upper Cumberland or decided whenever accountable care organizations reformed and the idea was available\nOr through a grander funding through Medicare to kind of band together as a group and um deliver high quality healthcare at a lower cost of possible\nOr to seniors in this area\n[noise] so how many physicians involved\nWell we started out with thirty seven practices of overly thirty seven physicians and we've grown up since two thousand twelve or we have a total of a hundred and forty six total health care professionals are sixty two physicians in eighty four nurse practitioner family I'm like physicians assistants\nSo for those that aren't familiar what isn't accountable care organization accountable care organization has a what's called a quadruple lame as its goal\nSo you want to reduce cost in healthcare if possible while delivering high quality care\nSo their cost and there's quality and then there's the patient experience and that's the Tripoli and if you add that another component to it as the quadruple layman now is a includes physician experience as well as a lotta burnout that goes on in health care\nWith providers ah that's that's kind of coming into health care is an important thing to watch\nNow how ... who says that you can form an AC uh\nWell actually governments thing or is it you can actually form a private or public eye CEOs as far as payers go\nUm any group can come together their providers I'm a home health agency mixed with a nursing home informed kind of an ACL\nFascinating work going on right here in the upper government an idea [noise]\nThat I can bring staking many physicians have gotten on board with its Cumberland Center for healthcare innovation trying to look to\nWhere can we improve health care [noise]\nDo you sense that the medical community\nIs generally on board with with trying to get better results sit better prices I hate to put it that way it's people that we're dealing with but at the end of the day that really is what we're talking about\nAll of the feedback that I've gotten a from all of the different individuals involved in health care setting a are definitely on board with the ideas of what we're doing a we've gotten very little pushback from anyone\nThere more than happy to work with is um they want to deliver care to patients who need it\nTo patients who don't they want to deliver the care in an appropriate manner at a high quality level\nUm whether it's a home health agency whether it's a hospital here locally or the c._e._o. and the C O o here locally or of friends ... we're friends to the hospital we worked together a lot\nUm they're great they do an awesome job over there they take care of a lot of are a lot of our patients where we have you know ... patients if you will\nUm and we're um you know we get a lot of support from essentially every one of the communities once they kind of figure out who we are and what we're doing um we really gotten very little pushback from anyone\nMedicare is obviously supported are the insurance companies behind the side\nThey are actually cigna or you know as far as private cigna goes um they are they were one of the first contracts we had a outside of see a mess\nThat they've been extremely supportive over this time or they work with some local employers I think here maybe a bridge or the state of Tennessee cetera and uh they've been\nUltra supportive in this uh they've adjusted kind of their quality measures down so they're not as complex and difficult which is one of the things one of the issues that we see with any new program that comes in a place\nUm but we've really been able to focus on quality measures it really matter\nAnd that's in health care what matters I can come up with two hundred and fifty quality measures and you may not be able to meet 'em all but truly Fifteen or the important ones the ones that we need and so that's why we've been able to do is really run down that those crazy numbers\nAre Blue Cross Blue Shield Medicare Advantage the man of Medicare Advantage or we're partners with them\nOr we do well with their patients uh we'd do well with management of those lives quality very high quality with them um you know he managed to seek out because they knew the model that we had here and how effective and efficient was\nCan you see this changing the way health care is delivered at a broader scale\nI can uh one of the problems I guess you know healthcare scale ability issue\nYou know some folksy healthcare is a national issue health care is really a local issue psych politics\nAll politics is local all health care is local you could only carry it so far and abroad scheme and then you start losing um the touch ability you start losing the uh accountability you start losing the\nUm the trust of the patients in a sense um\nYou know folks coming to my office I Know about their kids are grand kids they know about my granddaughter she's turning down and few days um you know that they understand me and I understand them you know if they had a doctor and um I don't I just said Charlotte North Carolina\nAnd um you know they were communicating with than we would just be a different different delivery of care it'd be a different feeling that she would get a from them and uh if you're in Charlotte though it's probably your favorite Dr\nBut you know health care's local it can be scaled to a national level um I Would love to see this kind of model really supported impressed out into rural America you probably picked up I'm not sure that I'm probably from a rural community myself\nA pal Mal's Tennessee which is right up the road ... not fifty miles from here I'm so that's for me rule healthcare is is my focus and\nIf you look at New York city for example you know four square blocks them as rural and really that's where they live it's definitely scalable\nYou look at the opportunities that are there if we could just improve rural health care across the nation that would be a huge part of the health care issue overall\nUm just to get that part fixed absolutely would give people more access yes more preventative which is what we hear all the time that that's where rural healthcare suffers the most agree\nWe focus on that laser focus on preventive health care that that's one of the things that we do ah we call our patients and make sure they get their their free annual wellness visit annually make sure they have their coal and asked me screens make sure that they have access to their mammograms make sure they get what they need\nA you know smoking is one of the big problems in this area\nA it's a um\nYou know we just have a high prevalence of smoking um you know that leads to a lot of health problems\nThey need a lot of screening you know COPD patients um but you know you boil it down to\nWhat we see in a rural community it it's really spread throughout the nation\nTennessee is worse than a lot of parameters than other states we are smoking is one of them obesity is another one uh alcohol use actually has had a spike or in the past year so the state of Tennessee but I'm you know overall um you know we're not that great and healthcare and Tennessee I think we're right number forty four\nA at a fifty so there's not that great um\nI think if we can take this model and spread it more widely or it can help more folks and save a lot more money for our state\nIt's a fascinating issue and one that we all need to be in tune with as a health care remains a very political issue and a very costly issue for a lotta people\nDr

grandparents that are out there was plenty of them that listen and parents every one of you out there will be a grandparent one day so you can do it and start learning now and I\nJeff women graduate I was very first I have a new grandson\nSo wow well I mean and and you're so much older than I Am and\nI have a a granddaughter that's going off to college next year when you started young so out yes something hey do you remember your grandparents I Do yeah uh grapple shepherd die before I was born but I Do remember the other grandparents very very fondly button I didn't have a relationship with my grandparents are in my my grandmother\nNever said a word she smiled a lot and ah and she made great chocolate cake Jane and I even went by and saw her on our honeymoon we got married at Twenty years of age and uh she never said a word to us the whole time my grandfather was in a nursing home\nAnd he didn't even know my name my other grandfather was kind of a racist kind of guy and and just really negative about things and my grandmother didn't care about us and and and what it did it it created in me one of these scary opportunities when my daughter came to me and said you're going to be a grandpa I was going\nI have no idea what that is I said it was wonderful stories Marta oh I Know and then they are ... so it's made me want to change my relationship of being a grandparent and I think God's keeping most of us around so we can influence a generation that needs us desperately\nRight okay well you've written the book grand parenting today's teens and that will have this conversation with mark you're on the program today so you stay with us Abbey will join mark and conversation later here on parenting today's teens found on line and parenting today's teens done we're\nTalking about grand parenting today's teens you want to open with a question hits right what do you want to be known for\nI mean it it it it matters right now\nIt's all your grandparents that are out there what do you want to be known for it you know your legacy will really only be remembered unless you're some famous rock star or or you've committed some crazy crime\nIt your name will not be remembered beyond your grandkids so you have to remember what do you want to be known for and you know your legacy will be written into places it will be written on your tombstone or any will be on someone's heart and so yeah it's interesting to me that that uh there was a guy named Aaron Watson that\nThat as a country artist and he's doing really well and I I saw him at a baseball game of Texas Rangers baseball game\nHe walked up and he wanted to introduce me to his wife\nAnd he said honey this is the guy that sends us pies every year I'm going okay um the pie center I was in Nashville Amy Grant introduces me to her husband been skill\nAnd said oh ... this is the guy that has cabins that are connected by walkways\nPeople on the radio remember me as the guy with the moustache\nAnd seminar people go he's the guy that word but so I can see it now on my tombstone\nHere lies a guy who sends pies has cabins ... joined by walkways has a mustache and wears booths and I have to ask the question is is that what I Want to know ... it's not really and my point is this we're all gonna die matter of fact I'm going to promise you this\nYou will die sometime after listening to this radio program oh okay so none of them they are the second thing is it's not going to happen\nThe way you think it's going to happen the third thing is it's gonna\nIt's gonna happen sooner than you think and my point is don't wait\nDon't wait the inevitable is coming at some point and you've got to say you know ... how do I have no way allow my legacy to be a connection\nUh through family too deep relationships that we have with them because the legacy is found within the hope and wisdom that you passed down to your children and your grandchildren and the truth that can be passed down to the next generation\nIt's helping grandparents especially if there's any grandparents listening to this program that that there is a difference and and don't try to say there's not a difference because their ears and once you recognize that there is a difference\nThen I think that's where some change can happen in the grandparents live to kind of figure out okay how do we do this because it is a different generation isn't it me off yeah so so tell me that you rented\nI actually love groundswell he's like really goofy guy like me and him get along better than me and my grandma because we're like females you know like we like try and like taking on each other and stuff\nBut like me and my grandpa get along really well 'cause like he's more like empathetic grumble I mean how far closer than like anyone else my family\nWell wow okay so if you had to describe their impact that they've had on your life ... where would you be if your grandparents weren't involved in your life\nProbably on the streets\nHonestly because like on the mostly I Know for my mom especially when you're younger and she didn't like\nReally like do college when she had me so like it was kind of struggle and I also like honestly she would have like maybe like given me up because it's not my own parents were around to take care of me than I Would like you know\nIsn't it funny that that people that you love your grandparents that you find that there's a little difference in the way that you guys think about the world and what you're supposed to be but you still\nAbout that and you'd be on the street if they wouldn't be involved wow I mean what a mess that would be and I've met him in and they're just dear people I think they they remind me of\nTypical grandparents and I'm a and I'm a grandparent and I get it\nBut I don't know why your grandparents just remind me of that and and there's just something that I go I you know when I spent time with them when we were up at a barn here at heart light and we were just sitting there talking I thought I just I just really enjoyed them they're just down to earth people\n... what do you think their their words of their impact of made on you\n[noise] well my grandfather always constantly reminds me to stay focused on school because the Florida senior\nI was honestly thinking about dropping out and just like start working and stuff that my grandpa was like keep reminding me like ... finished school didn't do whatever you want to just finish school you know so like he's kind of like in fact in east just like as a reminder till I Do school and you know drop out because\nLike I Want to be able to say like I did it\nYou know yeah yeah I think economic grandpa was kind of a a\nInfluence by sharing wisdom and in grandma's kind of a ... tried to help mold your character a little bit\nAll kind of like my mom but yeah they're always telling your\nWays to make it better which is a great thing because you sure wouldn't a grandmother trying to tell you how to do things worse but I think it's kind of interesting that I think most moms and grandma's or just that way because they want something so good for you so yeah you know I think that's kind of cool [noise]\nWhat do you think you'd be if it wasn't for your grandparents\nI mean when I hear you say out on the street but really what do you think you'd be\nHonestly I don't know like I've never really like ... like that and yeah I think they've had quite a big impact on you probably more than you know maybe you'll\nReally I don't really like no other said though like you know\nThat's cool that's cool what do you think you'd be without hard line [laughter]\nI'd probably be dropped out of school living with like some of my light friends ... I probably would be living like at a trailer house just in right now because my friend are kind of like\nGhetto like they're like they're not like high class or anything they just like they're like they live like they're grown up in like the head and stuff yeah so like I don't think that would have been a good\nLife or whatever yeah well I'm Glad you're here and I'm anxious for you to finish up\nThe program going home and get to the next step in life and see what happens but thank you for being\nResponsible thing as a sign that never more so than when they want to hire to do it alone\nYou have a heart for single moms and their kids and weren't too when you got a donation to this ministry you were investment is channeled directly into providing resources for you to join us in the ministry of compassion do on line to parenting today dot org and click on donate now\nThat I think today he's dot org parenting today dot ORG\nThanks to Abby and all the teams were brave enough to talk with mark you're on the program but we really do learn\nFrom them and we do learn you know somebody made a comment and they said well the kids aren't saying\nWell what they need to say I'm going wait wait wait wait I'm interviewing kid right they're going to say what everybody's on their mind and the kids that we interview are from all different backgrounds all over the world I mean they've been adopted from different countries different places and I and I always tell people that uh\nWe interviewed them you want to hear what they have to say and they may not say everything we want him to say but will never do it that way right because I Want I Want to hear their heart and what they're really sharing\nThat's what a magical about those interviews mark yeah thanks for doing those okay we have some a grandparent questions that have come in can I ask ... if you're a first of all I Want to be involved in my Fifteen year old grandson life but we haven't had a close relationship up till now and he rejects any offer I make to spend time together what do I do\nWell when you know I I think one of the first things because grandparents you know read my book and they go wait a minute I Want to start doing something\nAnd and leave a legacy and it means that you've got to find something that's exciting for your grandson not just\nSit around and watch you play shuffle board you know what I mean I Am not I don't have anything as shoved or write to us but I'm going ... it's it's one of those things find something that he wants to do and partner with him to do it I mean that's that's the intent\nNow health issues may be a problem whatever but if a child loves fishing and we're going on a big fishing trip the one we spend time together I'm going to make sure that I engage in such a way\nThat I'm not ridiculing them there may be a reason why you're grandson doesn't want to spend time with you 'cause you're always correcting them all the time I always talk and tell them what they're doing wrong time what they need to do different well nobody likes to be around that you have all you can talk about his medical issues\nWho wants to be around that can mean a grandson is going I got this other life\nLet me see the importance of having a grandmother or grandfather involved in my life and that's what they've got to see it also speaks to the importance of developing that relationship with their much younger than Fifteen that's right yeah you know and and it's very easy I think to develop a relationship early on because as a grandparent you can do no wrong\nBut when they get into the teen years as they get busy your grandparents are usually one of the first\nCouple of people that get booted out of their relationship circle so you have to work twice as hard so you may have to work hard to have some experiences but remember\nPeople gain wisdom through observation to reflection what they think about an experience and so the fact that you're experiencing something together will transfer something to them that's very important\nHere is a very important question I disagree with how my son and daughter in law are raising our grandchildren how do I pursue a relationship with my grandkids when there's a wall between me and their mom and dad\nYeah you know what you support the mom and dad or it doesn't matter whether you agree or disagree I mean because what happens is then then you become the parents and your grandchildren don't need another set of parents they need you to be the grandparent\nYou know and so I think it's important that regardless because of the position that my children have been put in\nThan I Am going to support them how they handle my grandchildren even when I disagree I can trust them when they're right I can trust them when they're wrong and so that's just it it it can be keeps things from becoming complicated\nHang on to your final thought I'll come back to in a moment mark but uh if you are listening would like to learn from mark in a small group setting\nThinking about joining us for a family is in crisis conference is it open to grandparents oh you bet All right it's held at the heart like campus in east Texas\nThere's a conference just around the corner so get in touch with us today online at parenting today's teens dot O. R. G. to learn about the families in crisis conference mark I know you're part of those the counseling staff at heart later part of those but it's part of the magic of bad as the interaction with their parents and grandparents\nWell yeah and the kids would get to come and the kids a way of living with us at heart light those that are doing well and moving along and have picked up the concepts come in and share with the families and and get to give insight that that may be these parents and grandparents aren't picking up from their own kids\nAre so that so one resource available to use that conference coming up check it out on line to parents\nWe mentioned earlier is marks book called leaving the legacy of hope and do you want to pick up a copy this at the website as well parenting today's teens dot O. R. G. or call eight six six seven hundred family Well Mark thanks for helping us think about our legacies grandparents here today was a final thought they argue grandparents\nYou alone have an amazing opportunity to leave a legacy of hope in your grandkids life like no one else can a legacy is not measured by what you believe in their bank account\nEither the slow but the ring of the foundation or perhaps it had been partially washed away by floods but the result regardless was that the house was slowly sinking in on itself\nThis had to have her idea of ill effects note toy cars would stay put when you set them on the floor and furniture along the outer walls of the house had to be carefully selected so that it wouldn't fall on top of us\nHanging pictures so that the local level which was never my specialty in the first place became nearly impossible\nBut mostly after a while you just got used to it a few extra hooks would align the pictures a few extra boats with secure the furniture\nAnd for the rest of it like the time during one particularly cold winter that the heating ducks just snapped off from the vent underneath the living room for the rest of it we just relied on that most elemental repair tool we just use duct tape thank God for duct tape\nHeat work and without duct tape I don't think that place would have ever felt quite like home of course duct tapes reputation precedes it you don't need me to tell you this these days duct tape has a bit\nOf a magical reputation for household repairs sure but also for construction on a grander scale\nA quick glance on line will honor its dozens upon hundreds of uses I'm sure quite an imagined by the folks who first put duct tape into the world\nWe've got duct tape a fabric with which folks have made everything from everyday wallets to prom dresses\nWe've got something called duct tape a clues in therapy and which duct tape gets applied towards and the left on the skin for an extended period of time though the results of this treatment are somewhat in dispute\nNot to mention of course the many many ways in which duct tape has become a repair tool for projects far beyond its original imagination like as a tarp that covers storm damage or is a patchwork fix holding up a street lights\nAs a cradle for a car bumper cruises down the interstate even as a quick fix wrapped around the ... of an airplane that that strict through the skies\nYou don't need me to preach the gospel it's pretty well uh tested the world breaks all the time in our old house wasn't the only place but the crack\nRunning through the foundation good thing we have duct tape to patch it all back together\nIf we're honest I think that's what this story feels like here at the end up a long hard work of the book of job it feels like a patch job\nThe book of job is a curious thing it starts with two major chapters of exposition God makes a bet that job will stay faithful if God takes everything away and so God takes everything away\nJob's state disappears job's children died job's body fails job is left with nothing\nAnd then we have thirty nine chapters in between thirty nine chapters of poetry thirty nine chapter supplement thirty nine chapters of argument thirty nine chapters of\nJob and job's friends and God going round after round after round over who gets to be angry and who gets to be in charge and who gets to complain and who does God thank God is to make us suffer and this way and\nWho this job I think he is to question or wonder or struggle and why of course why do bad things happen to good people and why does the world have this crack running through it\nAnd then in chapter forty two that's our chapter of that's the last one in chapter forty to the story comes back and it puts a little duct tape over the crack calls it a day\nJob relent and then the needs of the guard who had destroyed his life and the first place I had heard of you by the hearing of the year but now my eyes sees you therefore I despise myself on repent in dust and ashes\nIt's an ending but not a very satisfying one like\nJob it's been on hold with customer support for hours and hours and finally they pick up and tell him that actually the fire that erupted inside his computer and burned down his house really is his fault and eventually he just says well thanks for listening and hang\nUp the phone\nAnd then of course God does restored troops fortunes his wealth comes back it's a state comes back he has a bunch of new children which curiously I think is meant to paper over\nGrow into prosperity and long life at the end\nAnd somehow in these eight versus we're supposed to forget the open wound that it's been carved to the heart of the story\nSomehow in these eight versus we're supposed to just let go of all the needless suffering that preceded it something in these eight versus feels deeply on equal to the task at hand because we know that in job story something in the world has cracked open\nTo all be half at the end is somebody trying to duct tape it\nBack together it's not the ending we want\nNobody wants to look out the plane window and see a line of duct tape running around the wing\nIn some ways the history of interpretation of job is one along wrestling match with the abrupt and this of this ending like even after thirty nine chapters of back and forth somehow we still haven't gotten the answers we were looking for\nIn Nineteen forty five the poet Robert Frost published a short play called a mask of reason which he bills that's nothing less than the forty third chapter of the book of job the additional ending we never quite got to read\n... played jumps to use later at which point and job ... wife and God and state in all reconnect and try to hash out all the unresolved stuff job it gets to finally ask God the questions were all asking\nI tried to think job says the\nReason might have been some other persons but there is nothing you are not behind I did not ask then but it seems as if now after all these years you might indulged me why did you hurt me so\nGod even gives them half an answer I was just showing off to the devil job\nBut even frost camp put all those pieces back together there's something unresolved in this story something fundamentally unresolved something fundamentally unresolved bubble\nIt's not the ending we want but\nMaybe it's the ending we need\nEven in its abrupt and is there something refreshingly\nHonest about these versus something honest about what it is to have faith job doesn't quite get\nThe answers he needs but at some point he decides that he's heard enough\nJob never quite\nGet the conversation he was hoping for but at some point he decides that at least he's\nHad enough after all something has changed God has appeared God has listened God has spoken into big gap\nGod has not answered all the questions God has not repaired the breach God has not done the damage and yet job has face\nHere at the end I think job chooses to have faith\nFaith despite all of that faith\nBorn in this middling mess faith regardless of the outcome faith to move on faith to keep going faith to carry forward it doesn't repair the cracks faith isn't something that repairs the cracks\nIt doesn't end the questions it doesn't provide the answers it doesn't make for happy endings\nFaith doesn't put the world back\nTogether at best it's a patch job\nStill maybe it's just\nThe most famous duct tape hacking history is without a doubt the one that saved the lives of three astronaut aboard the Apollo Thirteen spacecraft in Nineteen Seventy maybe you've seen the movie\nAs the craft was approaching lunar orbit an oxygen tank exploded which aboard the mission and sent the cruise scrambling into the lunar module for the long trip home\nOne of the problems they had to solve with the help of a crew of engineers back on earth was how to attach a square carbon dioxide filter to the round opening of the lunar module filtration system\nOn the solution eventually of course involved the duct tape that the crew already had on board alongside some cardboard and the few plastic bags\nSo perhaps it's surprising that for generations duct tape became standard issue equipment on every space flights\nJust a few weeks ago in fact astronaut discovered a leak and the international space station a whole a mere two millimeters thick caused probably buy a micro media right but big enough to drain the air out of the place over the course of a couple of weeks\nThe upper Cumberland talk to you what you see

twenty\nPaul road I have been crucified with Christ it is no longer I was little but Christ lives at me\nAnd the live which are now live in the flesh I live by faith and the son of God who loved me and gave himself for me\nOf course of Jesus died in vain then we have no savior\nThose who were teaching this doctrine were therefore clearly in opposition to the cross nothing more terrible can be set of a person than to suggest that he is an enemy of the son of God did\nActually there are at least two categories of people who might be denominated as enemies of Jesus Christ\nThe first has to do with those who consciously opposed the savior and his redemptive system\nThe other is represented by those who might be regarded as unconscious enemies of the Christ today I Would like us to consider the subject enemies of Jesus Christ\nIt really is difficult to imagine that the most loving and compassionate person ever was also one of the most despised and hated the man\nBut it is true the son of God had many enemies during his earthly ministry and has even today among the political figures Jesus had in his boss\nSpy ... religious figures hated and many read it to them at the photo of the

sarcasm\nLoading his entire month as their messiah diaper raided him for his claims even while he\nSuffered for their seat in ... in the words of ... by oppression and judgment he was taken away\nAnd

true of Jesus disciples and it certainly was true of Jesus himself\nTo all the Pashtun evidence that demonstrates Jesus is the crisis the son of the living God\n\nThere are some unintended admissions to hit the tea\nFrom several of his adversaries less consider the enemies of Jesus Christ\nYou say there are those who with eyes wide open and Joe said our confessed Christ haters\nSite and certainly

loving care and hands of God and they expect God to protect them\nAnd then a crisis comes maybe it has cancer or divorce for the death\nOf a spouse or even a child maybe it is financial catastrophe or losing a job when they cannot afford to lose a job and they are profoundly disappointed with God [noise]\n\nBut again the problem is not their face\nThe problem is the false expectations they brought to that the Christian faith does not promise that God will protect us from harm that is a mess\n\nSo the question I'm asking today [noise] excuse me\nIs what can we expect from our face especially when the chips are down and the struggles calm does our faith make any real difference in those circumstances\nThe biblical answer is yes our faith does\n\nIn fact today's tax ... forty promises spiritual strength those who wait upon the lord shall renew their strength but then the ... goes on and says that happens in very specific and different unique ways\nThree to be precise\nOf my heroes [noise] a man named John clay pool hey author and minister he died a few years ago\nHe gives unnamed these three different kinds of God strength refining Isaiah forty I Want to borrow I guess still those names that he shares that are listed in your guide he calls\nYeah and endurance and I want us very briefly to look at those\n\nAttacks begins by saying may shall mount up with wings like eagles and clay pool calls this God's Gift of ecstasy moments of exuberance some celebration mountain top times\nCelebration soaring profound moments in our lives such as the birth of a child I still remember even though my son was born yes forty years ago hard to believe\nBeing in that room the birthing room with my wife having one of the most profound emotional moving experiences as he was born into the world\nIt was almost as good as running finally left Tom and went to college [laughter]\n... says sometimes God gives us this extraordinary moments in our lives\nTimes of joy times and we can sort of like an eagle ecstasy but those are fear in our life and rare there are wonderful but not the only form of God's strength the presence in our lives otherwise we would be disillusioned when crisis gums\nOr when we just face the ordinary challenges a day to day life\nAnd so yes God gives us time to sort of like an eagle\nBut that's not the only way\nTo sell the second form of God's strength is found in the next words of the tax it says they will run and not be weary John ... calls this God's Gift of energy for activism\nGod's strength to rise to the challenge out of hand that tackled the task\nTo do our daily work to carry out our responsibilities of everyday life and thank God for that for the strength to run and not be wary most of us spend most of our lives in that realm of the presidents of God\nAnd yet\nEven this sometimes is not enough\nYou see there are times when energy for activism\nIs absolutely an adequate like when we set by the bedside of someone we love dearly and they are near death\nAnd nothing that we can do is going to change that sometimes we cannot tack a problem with active energy because it does not help sometimes there is no solution to the challenge of Han\nSomeone there is no room to fly the milk placed or Ron\nFortunately there is another dimension of God's strength and presidents and we see that again in the text this third form of God's strength are found in those words\n\nThey shall walk and\nNot funny to\nPlay pool calls this the gift of in Durham Scott strength to just keep on to make it another day to take another step to take another breath when there is absolutely no occasion to shore and no place\nRun\nAll we can do is trudging along\nThis is God's Gift of in Durham which is what we need in moments when we feel helpless\n\nWhen the children we love more than our own lives are seriously ill when the spouse\nWe love to live with for decades comes to the end of their lives\nWhen we're on the brink of financial disaster in our business or personal finances when our marriage try as hard ultimately fails when the diagnosis from the doctor is bad and scary news indeed when we feel all alone\n\nIn these times of despair the promises that God is still with us God's struggles with us giving us the ability to walk and not think it is a profound gift\nSimply being able to hold on\nJohn ... who gave these terms were using the day experience that and his own life\n\nDuring the illness and then the death of his daughter she was only eleven years old about six months after\nShe died John had a good friend that came to visit him and I wrote this down there was in one of his books I Want to share it with him\n\n\nJohn's dear friends said John has got really helps you in this time of trouble\nAnd he looked John right in the eye and he said give it to me straight and I'm not asking\nAs my preacher I'm asking as my good friend and Amazon honest human being was anybody or anything down there at the bottom when the chips were really down does this thing we call\nGod\nReally make any difference\n\nJohn looked at as good friend and he says yes God did give me strength in this horrible time\n\nBut then John nuance that a bit any explain this passage from Isaiah forty\nAnd he talked about these three very different ways God's strengthens us in our life those times ecstasy those times of energy but also sometimes just endurance and then John said and I wrote this than a direct quote\n\nI can report honestly that the strength to walk and not say\nWas given no ecstasy to be sure no real energy just the gift of ... that was all that met me in the depth of my darkness I did not\nSoar with wings or Ron one step\nBut\nBy the grace of God somehow I stayed on my feet I did not blow up the

Center for healthcare innovation trying to look at to where we improve health care [noise]\nDo you sense that the medical community\nIs generally on board with with trying to get better results that better prices I hate to put it that way it's people that we're dealing with but at the end of the day that really is what we're talking about\nAll of the feedback that I've gotten a from all of the different individuals involved in the health care setting a are definitely on board with the ideas of what we're doing a we've gotten very little pushback from anyone\nThere more than happy to work with this um they want to deliver care to patients who need it not to patients who don't they want to deliver\nThe care in an appropriate manner at a high quality level\nUm whether it's a home health agency whether it's the hospitals here locally or the c._e._o. and the CEO here locally or of friends ... we're friends to the hospital we worked together a lot\nUm they're great they do an awesome job over there they take care of a lot of are a lot of our patients where we have you know ... patients if you will\nUm and we're um you know we get a lot of support from essentially every one of the communities once they kind of figure out who we are and what we're doing um we've really gotten\nBut obviously supported are the insurance companies behind this idea\nThey are actually cigna or you know as far as private a signal goes um they are they were one of the first contracts we had a outside of see a mess\nThat they've been extremely supportive over this time or they work with some local employers I think here maybe a rich or the state of Tennessee cetera and uh they've been\nUltra supportive in this\nThey've adjusted kind of their quality measures down so they're not as complex and difficult which is one of the things one of the issues that we see with any new program that comes in a place\nUm but we've really been able to focus on quality measures that really matter\nAnd that's in health care what matters I can come up with two hundred and fifty quality measures and you may not be able to meet them all but truly Fifteen or the important ones the ones that we need and so that's why we've been able to do is really run down that are those crazy numbers\nAre Blue Cross Blue Shield Medicare Advantage you man and Medicare Advantage or we're partners with them or\nWe do well with their patients uh we do well with management of those lives quality very high quality with him um you know humanity kind of seek this out or because they knew the model that we had here and how effective and efficient was\nCan you see this\nChanging the way health care is delivered at a broader scale\nI can uh one of the problems I guess you know health care is a scale ability issue um\nIt's not you know some folksy healthcare is a national issue health care is really a local issue psych politics\nAll politics is local all health care is local you can only carry it so far in a broad scheme and then you start losing um the touch ability you start losing the uh accountability you start losing the\nUm the trust of the patients in a sense um\nYou know folks coming in my office I Know about their kids are grand kids they know about my granddaughter she's turning nine and a few days um you know that they understand me and I understand them you know if they had a doctor and um I don't I just say Charlotte North Carolina\nAnd um you know they were communicating with them we would just be a different different delivery of care it'd be a different feeling that she would get a from them and uh if you're in Charlotte though as part of your favorite Dr\nBut you know health care is local it can be scaled to a national level um I Would love to see this kind of model really supported impressed out into rural America you can probably pick up I'm not sure that I'm probably from a rural community myself\nA pal Mal's Tennessee which is right up the road not fifty miles from here I'm so that's for me rule healthcare is is my focus and\nIf you look at New York city for example you know four square blocks them as rural and really that's where they live it's definitely scalable\nOr you look at the opportunities that are there if we could just improve rural health care\nAcross the nation that would be a huge part of the health care issue overall um just to get that part fixed absolutely would give people more access yes more preventative which is what we hear all the time that that's where rural healthcare suffers the most agree we focus\nOn that laser focus on preventive health care that that's one of the things that we do a way color\nThe annual wellness visit annually make sure they have they're calling us be strange to make sure that they have access to their mammograms make sure they get what they need a you know smoking is one of the big problems in this area\nA it's a um you know we just have a high prevalence of spoke to a ... you know that leads to a lot of health problems they need a lot of screening you know COPD patients um but you know you boil it down to\nWhat we see it in a rural community it it's really spread throughout the nation\nTennessee is worse than a lot of parameters that other states we are smoking is one of them obesity is another one uh alcohol use actually just had a spike in the past year so the state of Tennessee but uh you know overall you know we're not that great health here in Tennessee I think we're right number forty four\nOut of fifty so there's not that great um\nI think if we can take this model and spread it more widely or you can help more folks and save a lot more money for state\n[noise] it's a fascinating issue and one that we all need to be in tune with as a health care remains a very political issue and a very costly issue for a lot of people\nDr Brent state in the ...

circulating we know the vaccine is perfect\nIt's not the best back saying we have but it's a pretty good vaccine it will prevent completely\nA great deal of influenza and then what we don't give it enough credit for is that even if you get the vaccine and then get genuine flew\nYour illness is very likely to be milder less severe you're less likely to get the complication of pneumonia have to be hospitalized and die\nThe ability of the flu virus to mutate is what makes fighting it so difficult each year months in advance experts need to decide what to include in the next flu season's vaccine so that enough can be made it so difficult process according to Dr Michael deem professor of bioengineering physics and astronomy at Rice University\nWe look to the last year's season to see\nWe also looked to the southern hemisphere to see what strains are dominating in their winter which is six months out of face from our northern hemisphere winter\nTypically the strains that will appear in the population have been around for two or three years\nSo we can identify these strange a few years before they tend to dominate the population and then it might take a year or so to redesign the vaccine so that's another aspect we work on it was done to find those strains as early as possible and then helping to predict the effectiveness of the vaccine against the new stream\nThat's how the flu vaccine protects us but it also benefits and other people as well because we're a lot less likely to give the flu to somebody else\nThere are people who are frail who are older we're immuno compromised the neighbor down the street who has cancer for example you were friend at work who's got diabetes and Suzy who Seventy eighth and has some lung disease and some heart disease you know she smoked a long time\nWe don't want to give the influenza virus to those people because if they get sick they are likely to get really sick\nLittle babies little newborn babies there's one vaccine they can get when they're born but\nThe other vaccines that will protect them against illnesses that can kill and they can't get those first set of vaccines until\nTwo month old specifically for the flu vaccine babies have to be over six months old so those babies that are under six months old are really depending on people like us to get vaccinated to vaccinate our older children because they can't get protected\nThat brings up one other meal that Schaffner wants to explode that pregnant women should avoid getting any vaccines at all\nThat's certainly not true for flu shots in fact a new study from the Centers for Disease Control and prevention shows that flu shots reduce or pregnant woman's risk of being hospitalized by the flu by an average of forty percent\nWe have this thesis I learned to medical school don't give anything to a pregnant woman because you don't want to adversely affect the fetus influenza vaccine is safe [laughter]\nIt has to benefits for pregnant women will protect the woman herself and women who get infected with influenza virus have a high rate of complications just because of their state their immune system [noise]\nBut then there's a bonus the protection the woman makes goes with cross the placenta and into the newborn\nAnd when the baby is born goes into the fetus and then when the baby is born for the first six months of his life is benefits from that protection that come from the mother that's too early for us to vaccinate the baby but if we vaccinate mom she passed some of the protection\nInto her infant and give that infant protection\nBut none of that will work unless people get a flu shot and more Johnny admit it's a constant battle against all the myths and misinformation lined up against vaccines\nIs frustrating and I I think that definitely has a pediatrician and someone who takes care of babies and children and we want to see how the babies and children\nAnd then we also see that you know it's part of our job it's part of our

State Farm had been taking care of people in businesses all across the upper comfortable\nTo shop in the ... one blocks out the springs during ... produced visit John ... and like a good\nBoys collect something\nWorth celebrating\nBusiness author ... burner and strategy coach how we are and tendencies leading strategy business specialist Johnny sites\nThen his business work [noise]\nWelcome to business works this is how we are along with Johnny sites and we're talking today about pulling the product planning and about leadership and teamwork and all those good things I'm\nJust going to start out Johnny by mentioning that we've covered this before and we will probably covered again because it's kind of a mainstay of business for everyone doesn't matter what your businesses doesn't matter if you're a heart surgeon or you are a retail store\n... there are five steps that you must take\nTo have a plan if you don't take off five and do all five all the time you only have a wish list and there's a big difference so what are the five months to get your pan out here it has to be specific\nIt has to be flexible and it has to be realistic it has to be do dated and it has to be\nIn writing because when you take it out of your brain down your arm into depend on to the paper there is a physiological connection that's different than punching it into a computer or your\nCell phone so uh those five things specific flexible realistic do dated and in writing let's start with that because that's what it takes to have a plan set of a wish and now a ... give me some papers here that looked pretty interesting about how to um\nThe process first of all we're talking about leadership and management I think you had those down\nHow that relates and then ... or maybe backwards I don't know the three step process uh\nIdea well I teach the people that I work with and if you're going to have a process there's three ... three steps to it and it's different little bit different than what you just\nSame is step one indentified\nYou have to know what it is you ... you're a handful of core process is that it takes for your company be successful that equates with specific that are specifically the second one which you had thank handed the last was document\nOne at a time record the major steps in each of the court process is\nSo you have to write them down and the reason for that is you want it to be down on paper so that everybody on the leadership team can read it and ... yes that is correct\nAnd wants to everybody believes that this is the correct way to document how to handle this process\nAnd everybody must agree to follow it followed by all\nShe loves the do they did and then writing and part\nOf ... and then vowing part\nYou package it up which I don't think you covered in years you package it\nSo that anybody that is and the company can go back and open it up find it easily it's got to Todd alone it flexible flexible and then they can refer back to it so that they don't deviate from the court process okay because Everytime you deviate you create an issue in the company\nSo again realistic to the ... so ... when you come down to this right it's not that this is in concrete it's that you have to start thinking in these directions to have anything come out that makes sense and that actually ends up working for you\nAnd lower violence thing too I might add hears yeah we don't do it in the package you actually give the process that name\nAnd I heard that you cannot improve what you don't measure 'cause you don't know if you're improving or not so you measure performance on a score card and you come from that everybody is complying with the steps in each process your measurements ... process checkpoint\nOr it could be at the end it I think you'd need them at ease checkpoint\nBut not for the management team but for the people actually doing the work so they had no way for instance we had a good day report that told our men if whether you're hanging sheet rock or put in for towel down or carpet or ... but not a steel\nHere all the measurements and here's how much you need to get done in that amount of time so they knew if they were making the budget or if they were doing being successful for the company\nSo we confirmed that that all the activities that are required for ... says are being done properly and was enough frequency to achieve the goals\nSo you train them you measure what they're doing and then you need and manage and hold everyone accountable so they follow the process you make sure your score card numbers the measurements keep on track and you call out any issues that are a problem\nSo if you find a problem where you're just not meeting to go you're not meeting the measurement there's been set up\nMaybe got the wrong measurement maybe get the measurement to hide it but you need it makes you look at it and you need to look at it very intently and deliberately and then finally you to your point earlier you were talking about being flexible there may come a time when you Deb date the core process\nBut everybody does it collectively and as a team so that everybody's still understand it the same way and perhaps as the hardest thing because you've been doing it this way for a year now you've got to stop rethink it started different way that I think those are important ways to\nKeep your team on board and when she's a ... a rise sometimes a process is the reason she got to know that and work hard to clean it up can you sample if I\nCan you give me an example of what you mean by that and so sometimes the process was ... as a\nWell sometimes when you have issues that for instance if you are in the construction business and you are out here setting up\nStill buildings right it could be that the process you have set up the methodologies they use our costs you more money than it should so you change the price is maybe instead of using this kind of a crane I use a different kind of a crime of and I have smaller teams instead of one big\n... this is really a very much like a sports team you know there's a sense are coming up on a World Series time of course we're we're looking at a lot of that but so the how do you get people to make adjustments on a on the spot\nUm let's say you're halfway through construct during something\nAnd um you uncover an area that uh is very costly because of the amount of time it takes or something like that how do you get people to step back and and rethink what they're doing and and maybe have to restructure the whole approach here\nWell they could be as simple as making the process not so specific\nUm we had at one time we had a project where we had a a one of our managers\nPlayed out a building and it was four feet too long that we had to pay for the ... that it took to make it four feet longer but the thing that really caused this was all the ... in order for this building or four feet too short on one\nOf the base what is the ... that is a structural member\nThat structure member just put it in our pocket his two hundred and fifty thousand dollar mistake\nWe change that process so that one man no longer went out and laid it building out and we built on that\nHe laid it out and then somebody else came behind him and double starting at a different point laid it out a different way so that the likelihood of him repeating the same mistake was the last so he might start on a different corner and measures of buildings lay it all out and make sure it did match\nSo it worked out great we didn't have that mistake anymore well\nSo that's a that's pretty important measurements part or we're going to take a quick break right now I Hope you'll come back and stay with us\n[noise] business works news talk

Ninety four point one team covering the news every hour and on it [noise]\nWelcome back to business works\nOf the number one rule we came up with during the break which applies to all of this is for employees to think like\nThe owner and when they can do that um you know that's that's probably all downhill but that may involve some major consumption of time and effort and energy I'm and perhaps money to make that happen and it was going to ask drowning in his experiences\nUm especially with the examples that he'd just go for a for us\nHow do you get people to think like the owner what is it that you do there are no I Would run some training sessions on that but I had I'm not sure on the front lines what the how that translates\nWell my experience was that they're good ideas come from many different\nI was only one I ever had a good idea out of the hundred and twenty five people we had\nI was really stupid I shouldn't think that way I shouldn't think that the whole world revolved around me is the owner\nSo we found ways to incentivize the people who are working with us by saying to them\nYou are important you are professionals the things you're doing can't be done by professors or heart surgeons are lawyers or doctors the thing that is important is that you understand the knowledge you have is valuable and you need to use it wisely\nAnd we expect you to come up with\nGood ideas that makes sense for the owners were working for and if you do that and the owners delighted then you get a bonus\nHow do you instill a sense of responsibility that you're talking about\nWell in my personal experience it to five years of say into people that worked with us in the field you are professionals you are professionals you are professionals and finally\nAfter five years one of the leaders said were professionals and that's why we do it this way [laughter]\nAnd you think they have little versions [laughter] yes [laughter] and it it to us it involved a helping them to understand when you are professional then you treat your wife differently you treat your kids differently\nYou treat the community differently you're more responsible for everything that you're doing and so we tried very much to\nBuild a environment for all the people in our company felt like\nThe things that they were doing were helpful and that they were\nSignificant to the success of the company\nI'm Me gave me a couple of examples out here working for a\nCompany ... a big big company and they were making in addition in our we had a subcontractor job from them of taking down some metal panels and putting up new mental panels on a cyst in concrete walls they came up about six feet\nThe six feet was to keep the metal panels from being damaged by four trucks so they built a concrete wall up and years ago and then they put these metal panels innate ... sealed him with some kind of a sealer they literally I'm an ... to ... to the wall\nAnd if it's about the right side they'll get the right amount of vibrations in those hairs and that will take them to come out of there are hiding area and to to grab their prey\nSo it's a human walks by that's way too many vibrations on their little hairs and typically they're going to stay put\nHow did the spider ever end up as a symbol of Halloween\nDrawing Antos says that like most of the holidays favorite figures it's a mixture of folklore fear and fall first she says that didn't medieval times spiders were thought of as the companions of which is like the black cat\nSecond fear of spiders is common in our country and finally the fall season is when spiders make their most dramatic entrances into our habitats\nIn many parts of the country that in temperate zones you've got to fall weather\nAnd spiders happened to be very big and a parent in the fall time because a lot of spiders will emerge from their execs in the spring and so they've been feeding for many months now and by the time October comes around so they're larger inside\nThey're sending large when they're out looking for mates they have to mate\nAnd lay eggs a lot of times the first frost will kill the spiders so they're out and they're more visible to you and also the foliage is now coming off of all of the vegetation outside so things are a lot more visible spiders and are ... are a lot more visible to people in the fall\nFighters or just that there are a hot topic in the fall people all hell wow you know the spiders are so big this time of year and it's true a lotta times they are\nSpiders are not just here to scare us try on those says there are very important part of the ecosystem than to actually do much more good for humans than they do harm\nThe spiders main niche in the ecosystem is to be an important part of the food chain we already mentioned that spiders are ... and many spiders will feed on insects and in fact they're really the ones that help to keep a lot of insect species in check they'll feed on a lot of insect pest species so they really keep\nPopulation in check they feed on insects and they also are an important food source for other organisms so reptiles amphibians birds a lot of them depend on spiders largely for their diet\nIf you have spiders in your basement what you do you do about them\nJoy you know so she just leave them alone as they are not intruding on her living space otherwise you can step on them take down their webs or carefully moved them outside or if they're a real problem call a pest control company to take care of them\nShe does caution listeners to

ID gee\nI'm as it exists today and and then we'll go back and check it out\nYeah we're we're a company whose mission has been the focus on providing people the most time will youthful and and actionable information about computers communications and chronic\nAnd we do that through about three hundred and newspapers and magazines around the world with titles like computer world peace in the world Mac world if that trend\nOr we have out for him to the Web sites that are made in support those magazine brands and about twelve hundred different expeditions and conferences\nAround the world and we've also build a family of venture capital companies to help a young entrepreneurs get started in the developing countries to be able to bring a lot of new products and services and about their choices to their local market\nAnd and the number of employees you have is in the thousands\nOr we have Thirteen thousand a current and poise dry\nThirteen thousand current employees and read the news I Believe approaching three billion with a beef three billion dollars\nA we're about to point eight billion you know after a month\nBut that's incredible now last time I think we spoke around two and a half so I wasn't for all sorts of creating another\nDose of it right in the fact that our growth curve pretty well well\nThat's correct yeah and and that really gave me a chance to get around during the summers and meet the heads of the computer companies and meet their top engineers and their product fighters so\nI learned a tremendous amount about the companies and then when I came to start my own business um now that with a big help or because they knew my name and and the my writings and analysis and therefore they were willing to pay attention to\nA proposal that I made up um to set up a sense of where the computers were and what the customers\nWho are using them wanted for future products and services\nAbsolutely ... and that was a job you got while you're at MIT but he stayed with it when you graduated correct\nThat's right yeah the when as an editor I was out talking to\nThe heads of the computer companies and helping them or you know told me that they had a need for this Fisher um and when I Am opposed the price he said that was\nToo low I should charge more ah that would be taken seriously I Love that business idea and uh so I put put out the proposal and wound up having a nine companies send me check for twenty five thousand dollars each perhaps payment so that is actually all the capital that I used to get started so\nI've to anyone asked me about how to start a business I'd say just talk to people who can be customers find out through unfulfilled needs and proposed to fill those needs and in many cases they'll you know go on to you they'll buy a subscription to your proposed service and otherwise advance money to help you get it going so you don't need to raise a lot of money\nIf you are in close touch with their customers they'll they'll be happy to support you\nWell absolutely and and you know there's there's a real important antidote lesson here while you're working for that magazine and folks again it was it was called computers none of the nation back you know many years a number of years ago or sixties\nYeah with a ... there and the about\nSixty three three sixty three and ... was there his job is to go all over the country as he said and gather information a world of computers were number this is back in the sixties he'd build up a tremendous knowledge\nAnd a resource of where they were all located now into the less than I wanted to go back to that that they would love to hear from you pat you brought this idea back for a brand new publication and you brought it back to the publisher what did they tell you\nNot something we're interested in and you know you can do it on your own\nUh so I said fine I'll I'll Try it and then that was what started the business and\nNow that we've had a number of cases like that um after doing this or talking to 'em a lot of the managers of computer centers they said they needed um a weekly newspaper to help them get real information about what other people like them were experiencing with computers what were their problems and difficulties and we launched the weekly newspaper and everyone\nTold us it couldn't be done we are only putting fifty thousand dollars into the project all the money we had available and they told us how it's going to cost you a million dollars to a friend a weekly newspaper\nAnd you'll be out of business in two months and you know we'll\nSee if you did well will pick up the pieces and carried on ourselves or if you win slowly will know it was a bad market where you'll save some money by showing us that you had a dead end project\nAnd fortunately we got very little advertising because we were a new but we've got about Seventy thousand people who gave us a check for twelve dollars to subscribe to our publication so\nThat was in fact a million dollars came out of the subscription\nAdvances we're getting from readers enthusiastic about our content\nThat's that's pretty amazing when you go back to the original original um when when that publisher told you originally pat nah you could do that we're not interested or telescopes hum how much money was raised in how you raise it to launch that new magazine and that new venture\nAdventure well uh I'm I've I've I put in like sold my car and put in a five thousand dollars that was all my proceeds available and\nThen I went to my sister and I went to the\nFirst person

twenty dollars by selling your car and getting a ten dollar bill from your wife and a manager you my sister and a manager\nSo I'm Sorry your yeah your sister manager right so so that was in Nineteen sixty three basic only sixty four ... and and those to investors I got to recapture says to investors gave you the ten dollars what what's the ten dollars worth today\nAbout three and a half million dollars for the today [laughter]\n... unbelievable absolutely amazed and they told you couldn't be done\nA ride which always encouraged me because uh uh you know if it was easily able to be done a lot of people would have already done it so when they say can be done that means I'm going to have very much reduced competition and to to buy energetically you know keeping in touch with the customers and prospects you often find ways\nThat they would like to see the service provider that no one else has suggested and then you can charge in and you know put but but give them something they really want and they'll enthusiastically support it\nIs that is ... I was going to ask is eager to success but when ... when you're growing business no matter what stage it is ... isn't that one of the uh the one of the critical element that you use and success is always staying customer focused and listening to them and listening to what they need it sounds simple but so many people don't do it\nYou're right that when people ask me what does it take to be an entrepreneur I say when you have to find something you want to do you're passionate about do you have to give a lot of physical energy cuts that you have to put Seventeen Eighteen hour days and in the early days\nYou know you have to keep your optimism high so you feel you're good positive spirit but don't spend too much time sitting now making a paper plans\nBecause uh uh but you said that there was work your plan but you should do is work the market going out and finding out what people want their changing needs\nAnd you'll be winning all the time if you try to you know go ahead and roll out a plan that you made up at some time you're almost sure to be way off the market within a year or two\nThat that's incredible I'm Glad you said then is very very intriguing because I find that a lot of the greatest entrepreneurs in America the wealthiest most successful never really had a formal written business plan and if they did they usually throw it out\nI found that to be very helpful because you within better if you don't have a lot of preconceived ideas in your mind\n... I Love it I Love it now now when you're growing from ... from a regional business you know started up you mentioned some of the critical element what about growing from regional national what are those next critical step to grow a business even further\nSo of course you had to make sure that your communication network has spread throughout the country it's the people in all parts of the country are aware of your projects and then of course the next step is to begin to move into other countries and are there the the key step is to go over and you know and and actually make discussions with the proposed customers to make sure they\nSee the same needs and then go out and find someone in that country who\nUh shares your passion for the fulfillment of those needs and you know has the enthusiasm that charisma to be able to hire and motivate good people and then you know give them the resources they want or give them an ... encourage them in and support get out of their way let them know\nAdjust to their local market and to provide them help and assistance but don't try to tell them how to do it because you're never going to fully understand a foreign market where the local person who lives in the culture every day is going to be much more able to move quickly adjust to changes within that market\nOn another point you came up with an you shared with me in the past is that on the decentralization was important to you and and you you you all get in on the numbers are around a hundred and fifty was very key to the globe your business on your business units can you share with the number one safety is so important okay\nYeah that's our average business ties and how I ... I found early on that I was going to I was like a typical entrepreneur I wanted to control everything and make sure everything was happening in a way I expected and um then I realized that my attempt to control was actually slowing the growth of the business and that's why I really have the epiphany to say\nYou know I'm a what is really necessary is not my control but finding fertile markets and then go there and getting an enthusiastic leader and then I found that morale is I visited uh companies and even observing our own companies that\nAre the morale was sort of ... about a hundred and fifty people are the people at that stage they knew each other they knew each other families they had a clear vision of why they're role with how important in the company and they were all you know work together as a unified team a ... and it's interesting because that sort of\nA you know we have people grow up in the ah families and usually like twelve family has made a tribe who migrated from place to place\nA so typically like twelve people in the family and so you had a hundred and forty four hundred and fifty people in this group of a human beings who would move around a and conduct all their activities and\nI think the mind is really sort of set up to deal with groups of that size very comfortably and those organizations get larger than that then you know people feel alienated its\nIts them over there rather than us you want everyone to have a who are winning a sort of doing things together\n... that's why I have a hundred businesses and each one headed up by its own team and the average size is about a hundred and fifty people each\nFolks hope you're taking shorthand this was a lot of wisdom from old man who's done it from scratch I'm John Resnick losing was the

so much for joining me today\nThinking myself for having me short so tell me a little bit about what made you start the booby box\n[noise] yeah so my second daughter when she was about four months old\nI started having crying\nIn the evenings every single night and it was very stressful and we found out she had colic a and unfortunately we couldn't formula feed her because the formula made it worse and so there was a lot of pressure to sort of lean into breastfeeding and and make that work for her say\nAnd that's difficult so this is that month three did you had already started nursing her\n[noise] we had yes I'm a nurse my first daughter as well but we only lasted about six weeks once we returned to work it was very difficult for me to continue nursing with the ... thing mhm\nYeah and that is really tough I think for a lot of moms they struggle with that because I Know that with my daughter I work part time and even going back to work part time having to keep up with pumping all day to have enough of the supply is very challenging\nMhm yeah and not a lot of moms respond well to pumps ah sometimes work schedules aren't conducive to ... every two to three hours and so it does it can be very stressful\nYeah I remember thinking you know what I felt like a human cow for [laughter] it was like I Do as a nurse and palm ... was among those and Bob and I kept saying okay this great my daughter I deserve to keep doing it but it can be really challenging and it can cause a lot of women to just say you know what\nNo big deal going to go with the formula but you are trying to encourage women to nurse and to make it a little easier for them\nSo tell me how you're doing this through your lactation counseling and the booby box\nYeah so what is that the biggest key says ah that make women successful with nursing support support and knowledge at breastfeeding is actually a learned behavior and most women don't have a real life breastfeeding experience until they have their own child\nAnd that makes support really really important uh with our boxes\nWe send products that give moms an opportunity\nTo test out different lactation items like teaching items can be very expensive and so instead of having to buy a whole box of certain are cookie or tea or we give them the opportunity to test them out\nFirst additionally we have products in there that can help them with things like returning to work a manual breast pumps were breastfeeding covers a as well as things that if\nTheir baby a we've got heaters and Keating necklaces and pump a pump wipes and that sort of thing additionally what we'd like to do is encourage our moms to join our private support group I mean at the end it it all comes down to that support and having access\nTo it twenty four seven I'm most of us haven't have those moments where we're worried we're not making enough our baby as the eating enough and so that support system is crucial to getting through that\nAsking those questions and being able to get a professional trustworthy answer\nYeah absolutely and what you said with the twenty four seven support because when you're up in the middle of the night and I know my baby used to just fall asleep\nI'm so hard and you're just falling asleep and you know it was like what what caused the keeper awaken anything possible and I think it is so nerve wracking and people do worry about a low supply and is there such a thing as a low supply and some women\nThat can be um however in most cases when among comes to me and ask\n'em what to do to increase my supply a week back it up and say what makes you think you have a supply and then he has eighties cry\nFor a lot more than just melt and what they want their moms breast for heart regulation breathing temperature ... bird I so it's not always that your abs hungry and that's why they're crying for you I'm also some of them think they have all those supply\nBecause they're pump in and let's say there are only pumping two to three ounces and they start thinking oh my gosh that's\nGoing to be enough to feed my baby while they're at day care what can I Do to increase my supply and sometimes it's just troubles shooting that hunting experience first says there's nothing wrong with your supply it's just not everybody responds the same way she pressed bumped\nRight and I have found two trying a few different pumps that some might be more powerful\nSome might be easier to use which makes it easier to maybe keep on you for a longer period of time\nSo I Do think mom to experiment and you know I don't know if it really helps with a few things that I did when I Want it to make more milk with I ate a lot of oatmeal and I bet that oh these are an ingredient and some of the bar that you supply and your kid\nAnd you give foods and tease that may help\nWith that we do we do and and\nSome research suggests that that doesn't help and then some suggest that it does\nI so we just want to make sure we know that women are using them in utilizing them because they're so concerned about supply and how to increase it and so we want to give them trusted brands and the opportunity to try those safely and we do have a lot of moms now now that have\nAllergies or their babies have allergies as well I so we cater that you that right it's really common\nTo have a sensitivity to panic record ferrier or

also get a lot of inspiration from traditional ... from all over the world it has good with the background to fall the instructors the coldest had them comics from Germany and Russia India and in

evolves well my way of thinking and watching it like you did [noise]\nJust ran out of gas plenty for points in three quarters\nZero and the fourth or when what we had the ball for ten minutes ten minutes or of the Fifteen minutes so two thirds of the fourth quarter Tennessee had the boss simply could not get it in the end zone\nI don't want to do today is a maneuver kinda we've what happened yesterday in yesterday's ballgame because there are some great examples yesterday of\nThe good and the bad of this football team a and the good the bad to this football program\nRight now uh but uh I'll do it as always with this one of the things that I strive to do personally not up on all [laughter] not just on the show but personally\nTry to keep in mind the big picture when I talked to a bowl friends involve fans are some I Know some I don't know I I continually try to do that it's difficult it is difficult for me to do it was difficult for me to do when I was ... but to keep the eye on the big picture to keep the eye on the bulls eye\nAnd to see if we're moving towards that goal Tennessee made some big strides yesterday\nA it was a fun game to watch uh [noise] and again I'm On a hop around just a little bit here but I Want to weave in what happened yesterday with what's going on on the practice field and where this team is getting better um it's pretty obvious\nOf where the deficient Suzie deficiencies are on this team that's not going to change this year but there are some really good things happening\nUh and it it kinda depends on how you look at things you know\nI'd normally watch games by myself either myself or my wife are rarely do I'll watch games with people I don't go to a lot of games anymore and as I watch games uh I Try to do from two perspectives you know that old or a ...\nNot at age but ah they went to think about you know when you have a devil on one shoulder and you have a a angel on the other\nWell when I watch a ballgame on one shoulder I got the fan part of me on it and then on the other show her I got the the coach part of me and the coach just looking at this particular game and and and trying to understand what tendency is trying to do all in the context of knowing where this\nProgram is is heading and and I'll say right now unabashedly about this I got to ask about this I'm a I think most of you who listen to the show over twenty five years I'm not a cheerleader for Tennessee I Am very pro Tennessee\nI'm and I normally I'm kind of bullish I normally look on the bright side I normally have the glass half full but also a\nIt with a a a coaching perspective on whether this was where the students had just let me say this before we get into this this team's headed this program is headed in the right direction in so many ways that are so hard to see some times someone tried to weave\nWe played well on the fence but\nWe met we had some coverage best to just turn people why ... wide open the long pass was one of those we had one down and they ran down to one yard line or we had two guys blitz seeing off the corner only one was supposed to come the other was supposed to cover the man\nYou learn as you go this is a young defensive team one of the struggles I Know that Jeremy Pruitt has with this defense coaching his defense call and plays with this deep and says\nHe can't run his whole package because of the talent level and we have mistakes by simply young guys that just have not played football\nOne of the basic tenants of defensive football in the passing game that happen twice yesterday as if you are a cover person linebacker safety corner whether you're zone or ma'am\nAnd yesterday we were primarily man\nThe reason why we were primarily man was because of what South Carolina was doing very smartly to us on on on off ants they're all fence they gave us a good bit of to tie ins they made our safety is get involved or not very big up front were not very physical up front were not very deep up front\nSo we can't play with seven guys that front we got to get eight involved and that means one of those safety has to come up\nWhen you get once one of the safety or at times both of them involved in in the running game that means you're playing man coverage or with your cover guys and we had some bus\nThis one of the first things you you coach on defense if you're a cover guy zone or man and the quarterback gets outside the pockets and looks like he's gonna rent you do not ever leave your man or come up from your own entail he definitely crosses the line of scrimmage\nThat is a discipline it takes many hours of practice one of the things is a secondary coach when I was a secondary coach coordinator in one of the things that every\nDefensive coordinator works on is stay back don't give them a cheap or don't give them a cheap completion or worse by coming up to make a tackle on a running quarterback\nBefore he breaks the last craves that happen twice yesterday and it and it bit is twice and it hurt us that's\nWhat it's really not coaching ... is an experience it happened to a freshman quarterback and it happened to a a a junior safety who had a really good physical game yesterday but didn't play very disciplined so what what's hurting this team right now is is inexperience\nUseless in some areas are and in some areas and discipline and and the problem is the only way to get better at is through coaching over and over and over and over again and through playing games and and that's where coach for it has this team right now but\nAgain kind of weaving all this we made a lot of improvement as South Carolina is a good Southeastern Conference said they're not a great team there are a little bit above five hundred\nYou know they're probably gonna be five in three uh tabloids that that's the type of personnel they have right now five and three SEC team were probably a two and six a three and five team but we made a lot of really good strides on that now kind of looking at some of that\n... offensive like let's take a look at off instantly what what we try to do yesterday\nThe game plan was very apparent from the start and and all centered on what part of what have you heard me say many times you can only do on off ants watcher often see blind and your quarterback allows you to do\nIf you're going to have the greatest wide receivers in the world you can have the greatest running back in the world if you can't block papal\nWhere you can get a pass off or if can knock them off line or get get a stalemate where you can run that you've got some problems so I thought from the creative sample we did a good job of getting the ball out to some guys that are are are play makers\n\nI thought we did a good job of being created even in some of the plays a we ran the the the the play where it feels to me [laughter]\nA score was a beautifully a ... a ... a drawn up play and it was executed ... brilliantly\nWe've got the ball ... around some space um we so we did about all we could do from the standpoint now a couple of things happened though number one South Carolina didn't give say long runs they tackled well we didn't have any long runs didn't have any big place\nThe and the critical the only thing that I Would A M M critical bad and I still do not understand and I and I I thought from the Auburn game from an off into perspective I'm Talking about now I thought from the Auburn game and from the Alabama game that we had figured out and learned\nAnd this this the the don't let this slip by here here's what I can tell you about this particular conference if you cannot throw the ball down the field on quarterbacks\nIf you can't get completion thirty forty ... yards down the field I'm not talking about filling the catcher and you don't throw of five\nOr screen very often in this league and pick up a big yard is defenses are too good\nThey run two will they play too well\nEvery good team in this league offensively throws the ball down the field as good as Alabama is they throw the ball down the field we did not do that yesterday and one of the puzzling things to me is as we got one guy we got a couple of guys three as being thought to\nPalmer he's pretty good\n... a little bit better Jennings is real good we didn't we didn't attempt to single date passed\nYesterday this would be the only criticism I have the game plan I I don't understand this from the standpoint this staff has to know by now and they're they're they're often see staff is not guys that have been in the play collar hadn't been an coordinator hadn't been in this league I don't think it all\nBut that being as it may it that that's fine we had a lot of guys come in and hadn't been asleep for\nBut we we didn't throw the ball down the field and we're not going to beat defenses in this league without throwing the ball down the field and here's the puzzling thing like we through more deep passes yesterday to Eli wolf\nDeep passes I'm a combat touchdown was by the way was a nice nice call nice play than we did John Jennings we didn't we didn't attempt one single\nFifty fifty balls thirty ... yards plus down the field to John Jennings and I don't understand I just don't understand how you can go through a game and I do that and I know what I Know what they're going to say the coverage coverage coverage I don't care\nFor their zone or man whether there's three deeper too deep whatever it is there's gonna be one guy back there that you're gonna have to go up and battle and I'll take John Jennings are battling one on one whether zone man I don't care what it is or a combination of both\nOn dates was we didn't do that you should that that's the only thing I'm critical of on this offensive game plan I enter don't understand because I Know this head football coach shows is because he's a defensive guy\nAnd you watch any southeastern calms me watch almost any game if a team does not and and and this think of how we beat all burn and how we move the ball against\nA Alabama\nBy throwing those balls on the outside got to keep it in bands guarantee ... had a nice game yesterday but ... when you throw that fifty fifty ball again you is you can't throw the ball out of bounds you got to keep it in balance\nSo that will be about the only critical thing I'll say and I and I just simply don't understand from the game plan perspective\nWhen you have your game plan down and you say we're going to take X amount of throws to the corners quarterbacks thirty or so years down the field and then you don't ever get to it and why did we rent Seventy plus place\nSo big difference in the game when you get right down to it was a three point when for South Carolina we had some undisciplined man coverage they gave them some big place not many\nBut enough to beat is an on off fence\nVersus their defense their defense did not give us those place and they didn't make many mistakes we earned almost everything we got and we had a good day from that standpoint did you know there was a lot of good in yesterday's ballgame for this\nTeam up forget about that particular game this team got\nBetter in a lot of areas yesterday and we gave ourselves a chance to win and we were in\nA position to win the south Carolina was in a position to to to win also and and they won All right we're going to\nOn first but I like to call the church segment and uh\nWe'll go through some moral but as we as we do some some some of the some of the pluses that came out of this thing and then kind of looking down the road where we are improving really got to talk a little bit about some of the things that coach Pruitt said this week and not after the ball game but this week uh about the ...\nOne of the things that you've heard me say this that I really liked about this guy\nHe pretty much tells you what he's thinking and he answers questions and if you listen to him\nWe're not gonna be in motion and what we have six or seven to low Jesse unless I'm going to give a ... that that wouldn't have them on a big mess me for this week we're some guys playing in the offing Steve line left tackle you know that young man's been around here or not he he's he's not a left tackle\nAnd we have some guys trying to get an advantage and they you know the the the ... if there's one area on the football team\nThat has to play as a unit is the often see blind you could make that statement forever but it it is that is the most paramount area that ... paramount area that has to play together\nAnd we had so many young guys in there I thought overall we we fought him and we did we did a good job yesterday of a plane to what we were able to play to our ability\nAnd you know the them I'm not going to mention his name because he's he's he just he left tackle just not a real good football player and the SEC fights he fought yesterday so\nAnd then a little bit of that because you got basically two or three guys that are being in there but the fact of the matter is you can't you can't make\n... penalties and you can't make post whistle penalties and how many of those that we have what ... what a post whistle ... plays over don't put your hands on anyone don't talk to anyone just go back\nAnd get lined up and ready to play again and we had too many of those yesterday and we've had too many of those this year and I know I Know that is one of the areas where this head coach is really coaching and pressing hard and\nThere are players who haven't played because they haven't got that figure it out yet\nWe had some defenders yesterday who did not play because they haven't figured out that if you don't play hard every play if you don't run to the football if you are a selfish quote selfish person you're not going to play now the problem is is you got to put let him out there\nAnd some of them may be selfish but they don't let you play I guess you could play with eight or nine so that's that's the uh that's\nThe challenge for this head football coach this year this is a team that was not very disciplined over the past few years especially on the fence just think about the I think about this is a driving into de\nSac on on a pretty good running team and as I said they had a really good game plan for us they put us in some difficult positions\nThey had to tie ins in there some time to hit them as an age back sometimes they had him on both sides they they got a good strong running game not a great running game ... hours but they better up front\nAnd they they made defensively they they made the coach or Davis coordinator make some adjustments that he probably didn't want to make simply to be able to contain the running game\nOr they did a good job on that but but uh the the the the fact is is that we're ... if you if you if you don't play discipline football over there you got you got a bunch of problems so anyway the point I'm trying to make his he says guys on the bench\nHe just smiled there on the bench this is where we are going to play I'm going to give up a little bit uh in one area to uh to maybe get my point across and I think he's getting across 'cause we play and harder we're playing better\nWe're playing tougher we're hitting more we're doing a lot of good things ah that we're just not we're just not\nWhere we need to be and maybe we'll get where we need to be until we get a little bit more talented in here now that sounds a little bit lacking excuse I guess but you can only play with what you play with the you know what\nYou gotta learn to win but those things and we were in a position yesterday to to win with those effect one to another break and then come back on TALK a little bit more I get into some things that goes

east as they say the SEC now Columbia South Carolina where tendency last night dropping a bitter twenty seven twenty four loss\nTo the game tax or a game that\nHad some controversy certainly if you look at it from the tendency perspective a and a game I think tendency Austin will look back on this year if they do not get to a ball game which losing that game now will make it even proper I think that's one that they'll look back on and say boy that that was right they're harboring\nDislike you back in your prime when you hit the left side of the play some might hang your big oh Hi hanging curve ball and you worked on it [noise] Tennessee had\nA big time chance to get one on the road last night that would have proved how they really really big\nUh in their quest to get to postseason games\nYeah it was you know one that got away and tendency lead for three and a half quarter a\nLate in the first half obviously a John Jennings had scored a touchdown\nTendency you want to fourteen to three and [noise]\nHe put the ball in the receivers are on the defensive backs just that he just me\nAnd got the Fifteen your personal found penalty and [noise]\nAllowed South Carolina to you know get Fifteen extra yards short field or\nA short amount of time go down in the score before the half a you know another which is sort of changed the game a little bit but it also kind of like [noise]\nAllowed South Carolina's ... look up and go okay tempo that that's how you know that they hadn't been Tampa and then all of a sudden four straight possessions after that\nA South Carolina you know puts points on the board and and when is it twenty seven twenty four\nIs one of those games where you look back and you know what it should have could have\nBut you know you talk about the twenty four hour rule out you'd be ... this is the ultimate twenty four hour old game Chris you got to just put it behind you move on from Charlotte and really those three big games to close the conference season because you have to win two of those three\nTo get to a bowl\nBut I guess if you're looking for a silver lining or two teams\nThat were picked to when they're all picked to be top twenty five teams this year to to make some noise all been in South Carolina Tennessee beach one of them on the road and takes the other one right to the wire so they're competing and that's and that's promising but still that make\nThe diminished the the disappointment for for the football team for German food tendency fans that you had chances\nAnd having Jeremy said this at halftime and he's right it just it just the times could get out of their own way\nAnd you just listen you you love the way you want to play ball already goes and gets football and he's not scared he plays the went on every position\nBut you can't do stupid things like put the ball to my chance after you saw a touchdown he scored big touchdowns before act like you've been there before had been there before but I just want to just beat up on him but it's those kind of penalties\nThat are keeping you they're not just him you know there was some bad ... there were some penalties now lots of folks are those the penalties that are because tendencies margin for error right now is so is social and it's so narrow thin that you just can't have those kinds of things and you're not going to win if you did\nWhat I look at the to the soup you know unfortunately unfortunately not conduct penalties called against Tennessee or the one with Jennings\nSouth Carolina score to the minute left on the clock 'cause they want an extra Fifteen yards and one minute the way they removed yeah too many of these you know I'm you know I thought the Fifteen yards which is more of a ticket tax\nCall on where you know mark was Callaway push the defender right um I Do not think that was a very good call but it was called I thought that was debilitating because all of a sudden you went to third down and twenty seven and says about Thirteen twelve [noise]\nIt really took out of trying to go for a touchdown and or you had to settle for a field goal that potentially took four points off the board for Tennessee and then you know late in the game the often said why didn't hold up ... held on the mall too long\nAnd uh you know there were some key drops in the football game and you know you have those little things you just goes back to what ... said post game it's not necessarily South Carolina beating Tennessee and more so than a C meeting them sit there and you've got to learn how to windows games and that's something

I I Love the coaching it's hard coaching but you can tell a joke and nothing against the previous regimes\nBut but you can tell a difference\nYou know it's obvious to Tennessee doesn't have the talent it's obvious that this schedule\nWas stretch has just been brutal between Florida Georgia even with the ... and ... and going down the road at South Carolina that's a brutal stretch but even though maybe the record doesn't reflect it\nI think you can tell that this coaching staff\nKnows what it's doing and you can see the baby step in and the smallest ways but important way and they're playing hard\nAnd and as silly as that sounds when when you've only won\nThree games playing hard matter\nSo yeah that was really chop last last night a lot of different reasons mostly it would have given them some wiggle room\nUh as far as ... abilities concerned now they after when what three other last for Sheila yes so try a you know talk to you must do banned the um [noise] you know no Jimmy's in the bunch so um [noise]\nYou know but it's been it's been fun in a in a bizarre way to see a Tennessee teams really play hard\nAnd and knowing that that obviously that they don't have the personnel to match up with a lot of the teams and the SEC right now but teams play hard when they believe in the direction of a program and when they're listening to their coaches and so\nUh that's that's what I see a Tennessee right now like a team that quite figured it out but I Believe for his beginning to believe\nRight we're talking with ... the SPN and I can't confirm that gene was not in the Alabama law room two weeks ago smoking cigars let's get out there they get out their front and center\n[laughter] you know you\nSaw it I read that is that right somebody was somebody wants to get rid of that now\nYear or something like that comes up on on course it's been on the equal tendencies lost so many narrowed Alabama but every year there's some shattered talk about that ... ...\nSince Bryant was there but that's the story for another day I or\nI Want to ask you for your coverage starts blowing the longer than me which makes you a lot older than me Jeremy Jeremy has it been afraid\nTo push the challenge and he's been a little bit of a bull in a China shop and I mean that's a good way [noise] how do you what do you look for when you when you could tell the team is really responding to its coach and\nParticularly in the transition year what are some of the things that you look for what are some of the things that are obvious to you when you think that's going on and you think that's happening\nWell yeah I I think even Germany Pruitt would agree that the you know he's rough around the edges I mean there hasn't been a lot of sand paper applied to his personality I mean he's been in for this program that's good you don't you don't get\nReally polish guy you need a guy who's going to coach football who's going to recruit really hard and who's going to set a standard\nAnd who is going to say this is what this program needs and then he's going to work has bought off to make that possible\nI look at stores I mean that's one indication of the most obvious one the man in I think just about every game this season you could say Tennessee played hard\nAnd and they're being years past where you couldn't say that where I don't want to say they gave off but there was a lack of interest\nIn this season in a season when it's again it's so obvious that uh if you go down that roster is it's not the most talented rupture Nasci says there's no way of sugar coating that\nThey're still playing hard so to me that is a great indication of of a staff that has gotten through to a team and that team even with this limitation is doing the best they can [noise]\nGene is Austin obviously you know you're in a ... you don't get to come to that many games 'cause you're out you know what game day and doing so many other things and let's face it game they then come round here\nToo often any more we'll see if that changes going forward with coach proven but as the Loma how much do you kind of get to have a chance when tendencies on just to sit down for twenty minutes and watch a quarter and and I mean like does it allows you to kind of be a you know us than again when you're not covering the team so to speak on a weekly basis\nBoston if you saw me watching the Tennessee game you would you would have very strict jacket for\nWhy why leave the room\nNobody will come near me I I'm On the ground on I'm I'm counting the cable I'm\nIt's like my one guilty pleasure\nTo to get home you know the road and if I can watch a ballgame like last night watch it and you know live and die with with every moment that's fun to be a fan and you know with our schedules [noise]\nYou know we don't get a tailgate we don't we don't get a you know watch our alma mater play in person almost never we never really get a Saturday off just a you know take it easy to just watch football but if I get home in time off the road\nThat's what I Do and and I'm absolutely sure to file a bitch if you\nTook a a video of new you'd you'd you'd have made um you know confined to a show padded room but I Love it I Love watching them play win or lose\nYou talked about coach paper coach for being like a you know the the same paper analogy and when you go to the beach and that was really saying find sand everywhere for a long time to come\nYou did the feature on the popcorn guy Washington state two weeks ago are you still find than girls the popcorn at every turn [laughter] after him was dumped all over you\nWe're going to the dry cleaner that Monday and handed it to her and she and she took it for me like she needed to be wearing a hazmat suit\n\nI mean she couldn't believe what you know like she turned it upside down and salt and popcorn kernels salt in the in the ... of the of the sleeves and\nI I mean but that was really fun to do and um that was a like a gas of a story to us to report and try to track down popcorn guy yeah that that that was fun but yes it is going to need some extra chairs get past that sport go back to er physician hey\nWell when Willie tiger gets Florida State and turn around at some point in the future we'll make sure you're definitely on top of the professor them sending shirtless reading a book there and the milk and I found him beat him gutless\nYeah there there there was some hospital involved with with that report ... we were going to try to surprise you we had but ... Research Center for two or three days now to find game tape of you absolutely torching rolling James back in your day is a walk on receivers Tennessee but we didn't happen well it sounds good though right\nCraig proof she can rolling James hit me so hard um during the practice one day I literally I got up and I I was crying like involuntarily trying so hard\nMan those guys are so good God when they were good and I was not so that that's the that's the equation or\nWay the question I can give you\nThe neat thing to do with new gene is you are right there on it at the outset of coach major ... when he came back and see how you were part of that you know in that\n... Seventy Seventy eight Seventy nine right in that range um [noise] well yeah I think he going back in Seventy seven [noise]\nYeah I was there a major first year and it was not a very good team but there were there were some players and the team that ended up playing in the pro for very long\nWhy we're back on the nation and our thanks to\nJean what would your house give game day fame at UT along\nGreat interview there on the second segment we'll remind Tennessee fans that fight ... fight is the theme for the official two thousand Eighteenth tendency football fans T shirt and it's on sale now you're ready for kick off and pick up a fight votes fight shirt and lost jobs on campus\nAnother participating in retail like alumni whole hound dog food city or Cracker Barrel or countries stores get geared up for game day with fight ... fight [noise] already pay um [noise]\nWe talked about this in the last segment about the way this teams competed in ... and speaking of fight has fault they need to do to get better I mean you hear about the lightning rod is always a quarterback has to\nContend guaranteed into now he's got to be a little bit better you have little bit better field presence in the pocket that still think he's played pretty efficient football for the most part and I like the way Tennessee has changed things up got the ball\nTo some of their ... their a airplane makers are they still got to get the fall down the field that was the difference when they ... they beat over\nThere will do that self conscious wasn't going all the way they played their defense of coverage they always said listen you can beat the ... things that are nice we're not going to let you get it down the field ... any big place I think that's important ... clearly they can't you know the turnover there at the end and and as I said earlier cleaning it up and be [noise]\nYou know being more disciplined and not giving away some of the hidden yard that they'd give it away to this\nNot non penalties eight of them on on them I think five of those were on third or fourth down you're talking about taking you know thirty one making the third and six or you know thirty five and making certain ten you know ... those are the things that are really right now just\nSit in this thing back a little bit and [noise]\nKnock on the floor to game the to the other big games on their schedule Tennessee has is you know the other one the turnover battle or really limited their turnovers to a minimum and [noise]\nFor whatever reason a ... member to come up short but it's just a team of not very much talent and you know when you look at things coach fruit said you know at the half time of the Alabama game that you need a recording cycle I think he needs more than ... two maybe three\nTo to to really make a big big ... big of a difference because you know you look across the slow\nThough they are or at least on the horror personnel as well as well south no you don't you think there are no no I I if I was going on just looking at ... I think they have the advantage over tendency with two receivers because they have speed up fans don't want to hear that they love Jennings and they love Calloway\nWho's got the same dude guy can get down the field and stuff they don't have a they don't have a burger Tennessee had one guy that could consistently stretch the field\nHe makes Halloween Jennings that much more effective\nBecause they don't have that then what Jennings in Callaway are getting done is quite impressive because you know they don't have to prepare for getting you know somebody getting over the top on them you\nWell and I think losing the kind of players they haven't been back to back weeks and a lot of scrimmage ... defense betray Smith all up and so on though is a is a huge void in ...\nYou know they they needed they needed to be able to land a couple of these five star tackles there after moved trade back to guard which is where he's much more comfortable\nAnd even then you're asking a lot you know of your freshman go to Alabama right now and I understand Alabama's Alabama\nTo play in like two true freshmen consistent snaps jailing model and Patrick's retain\nEverybody else is you know red shirt and you're just playing special teams why because they have them in because they can't [noise]\nTendencies can't is not afford that luxury in a perfect world on the table right now is either playing for special teams and helping you a little bit nickel coverage down coverage\nOr he's registering but no these thrust into playing every day on the corner [noise]\nSame thing with Bryce Tom's you know and and what happens to those guys are are functioning are fine but you know it it puts them you know in a tough spot where they are really having to learn on the fly so yeah I don't think Tennessee is in the same ... you know\nUntil the fans don't want to hear this they they saw that all up and gain that wouldn't beat her would be to open on the road\nAnd so like it sets them up for oil on average better than I can promise you all offered it offensively to South Carolina couldn't agree more the ... go back to that game I mean ... the ... does he had to hold onto the when it it'd be in and they and they made a big place down the feeling of a big place down the field\nAnd made in the high point the ball and and and one of those those jump ball which was good it was about your your time you know I mean there are ... throws every will say fifty fifty but no because the defense of asking the gossip is also a fifty fifty they were just ... throws that\nTends to be able to complete and he was able to keep it in the field of play so I mean I look at Kentucky Kentucky as you pointed out or during the show\nHas not allow the teams were more than twenty points all year\nCan tendency won the game like that surely camp but Tennessee defense is going to be able to have to be able to show that they can stop\nA ground game Brian Terry Wilson an athletic quarterback and then you got many snail soon ... those guys are capable do in ... Kentucky up front you know really really good that can be bad for tendency because tendency even when they're in the right position [noise]\nThere are certain players on his defense that just are not athletic enough to make a play\nOn that subject I'll get you out of this segment with this marathon questioned the weak stop by your friendly neighborhood marathon station today you'll discover\nHow

that could could be\nHuge momentum for them to end this football teams we go into your number too hot you're outgoing\nGuy I've I've seen enough up but not seen anything from him because he has not played all they can be finch it and is Germany banks I mean I I think the staff at every intention of playing him last night I think South Carolina did some things that they weren't expecting and in an effort to not you know shredded kids confidence it's you know\nDon't put him out there in that situation where he has a huge impact on the game negatively you know so I Would expect to see him a lot this week 'cause I mean let's face it you look at says he's back or not they were not very good court they sat struggled daring Kirkland struggle\nI mean there are multiple times where they were they were right there you know\n... and ... either couldn't get off a block or couldn't make a key tax or or was it\nOr they weren't fast enough to keep up with demand to look at the point that you know kind of ended the thing\nAnd Rick Russo getting ran over and you know prayer is that with him you know so you recover them a ... because the video it's brutal yeah he took it wicked shy and Urdu as thanks for bringing up or thoughts and prayers go out there Rick\nBecause he recovered but the point is is like on that play Tennessee just couldn't get off the that can get off the edge and then curriculums too slow to make a play\nSo you know I'll go Germany banks there on the fence [noise]\nYou know I think they are they are I don't know if there's anybody that you can go man I you know a young kid that you know you feel like you know can make that big of a difference you know Cedric Jones not played into this point\nSomebody's you're playing down the stretch um you know Jordan

half\nHas been the crime scene in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania it was the synagogue who's the tree of life synagogue in Pittsburgh which shocked America yesterday when eleven people were killed their shot dead or it brought out all the the police swat teams are in the city of Pittsburgh\nAnd what followed next was a constant investigation by the FBI they became involved very quickly as they were looking for clues on on the shooter and his background\nImmediately people began to gather to pay tribute to the loss or in this a very a poor neighborhood or one of the most recognized a Jewish communities in the United states a hallmark of life in Pittsburgh\nA memorial services we're ... we're stepped up I'm almost propped up almost immediately\nAnd people from all over the city Jewish and non Jews gathered including children and grandchildren\nOr to pay tribute to those who lost their lives a little bit later on the broadcast we will reveal the names of the eleventh victims of the shooter and we will refer to him as the shooter were not mentioning any picture no names tonight\nAt the policy of this program not only for the tragedy in Pittsburgh but also for what happened ah with the bomb or from South Florida again vigils tonight in Pittsburgh and I understand there vigils in the United states and there's a vigil going on in the federal building just a few blocks from where we do this program so\nPeople are gathering juice gentile alike are gathering to pay tribute to what happen\nTonight or one of the things that comes out of this is uh you hear a media people and you hear political leaders including the president crying for a return to civility\nUm we try to do that every Sunday night on this program we will try to do it tonight and for as long as I'm here to conduct this broadcast and so I Want to begin with Michael power who's been a frequent guest on this program for a long time\nEverybody knows Michael you had relatives who were lost in the Holocaust you're on the Holocaust commission for the state of Illinois my condolences to you on the terms of the Kosovo chair\nBut but but your reaction to what happened I I read your Facebook page I was moved to tears because of what you said your Facebook friends but to share it with the radio audience and to the audience this evening with this incident in Pittsburgh means to you personally\nI think there's also some under our um undercurrents here we have people like Linda ... who is on the left um we have several people Keith Ellison a Louis Farrakhan other people that are in the left who are\n... on his left it is a well but the last ... because there are many politicians including ... who shared dates with him but be that as it may on anti Semitism or the perception of anti Semitism the idea that this is somehow the province of the right\nUm to me is is really inflammatory because um I categorically project that that doesn't mean there is not anti Semite on the right but they're also anti Semite on the left so\nI don't ... I think overall bigotry is rising and I think that's what I mean think about what we've seen in the last few months we get them begging Kelly blow up this week we're with are are worth of her in Spain stupor revolt and comments about black face\n... bar talking about Valerie Jarrett were Roseanne Barr even come up with these comments are ugly comments I mean people who was the effect of bigotry in terms of anti Semitism in terms of racism in terms of being a phobia um\nAnd and that's going on worldwide as they're just in the United states not just in the United states or that's what I mean I'm you know the the the guard rails down and people feel emboldened and you'll see you didn't you seen in Brazil for example\nThere's also a very ... I don't want to interrupt I think there's a heightened sensitivity to that so if we can just touch on that I didn't tell us the tuition for a second when she was talking about um when she was younger um people from time to wear black face like a Halloween costume I got to tell you that when I grow up in the eighties\nMichael Jackson was a really big back then I had friends that used to wear black face if Michael Jackson for Halloween nobody\nSaid anything about it I'm not saying it's right or wrong I'm saying it happen so this is what the context of the of what she said she also said gee I learned something I Apologize\nThat wasn't good enough she had to be kicked off the shows that you can take you out with bigotry or is it in that case and in some cases a heightened sensitivity to where it's a political correctness that's coming out to play in certain situations which it lets people\nOver politicization of everything I pull out a record yet I have I have final records at home and I was going through a lot of the old ones and I can listen to Bob Newhart it's great and then I put on Don Rickles and I start to feel bad about what I'm laughing and this is in the sixties and seventies it's actually brilliantly done everybody in the crowd can laugh at their own thing\nBut you know even those things today just become over politicized now you've got people getting in trouble for a tweet that the decade old yeah I think\nQuite frankly I think may making Kelly's are firing which was an overreaction I think it was a teachable moment as as a you know as ... points out\nUm a lot of people are still unclear on how how exactly do you offend black people or what is a what's considered offensive and I think and that that's confusing to a lot of people I think we need to be candid about that and then and take the opportunity to make that explanation wondering why these things\nOr or um you know I'm I'm ... I Want to go back to something that that we've touched on earlier because he had we've done\nYou and I have been doing\nShows for twenty five years now are more and more and and we've done a lot of shows when when the issue of black anti Semitism was was top of mind around the you know the ... the election of a brac Obama and a rebel or by it and before that Harold Washington ... ... a long long time\nWhy does I assume you will acknowledge that that issue black anti Semitism exists no doubt\nWhy does it exist tell us why some\nBlacks do not like Jews\nWell you know it it it's it's a complicated issue go much of it is is uh the the the the um the presidents of Jews in in urban communities and in the old days when Jews are the primary merchants they were seen as as being exploit native\nAnd it was that that relationship was a part of the the the equation\nAnd then from then on Jews were also very very important in much of this early civil rights movement many of the communist that the Communist Party was very um a aggressive in the in the African American communities in New York and in Chicago\nAnd other urban areas and so they had a very strong relationship with the black community so\nUm there was that sense of intimacy with the Jewish community and then there are a lot of black people who felt that the Jews were exploiting and black people or a misery by by um merchandising Denver mid misery essentially and uh also Jews were important in in um\nUh the music industry you know where we're black people were becoming artist and whatnot uh Jews with their agents and and that kind of thing so that on on the other side of that there's a lot of criticism that Jews were exploiting these\nBlack artists they were um you know are taking their earnings without compensating them adequately\nAnd so all of these kinds of undercurrents grew in in in the black\nCommunity in in your view in your view\nAnd then I Want to I Want to hear Michael ashore in your view has has that has leadership of the Jewish community\nEver spent the time and effort\nTo address each and every one of those perceived\nThe ... and what has been the reaction from the black community\nAll depends on what part of the black community you're talking about in a in some segments of the black community there's been a wide acceptance and acknowledgement of of Jewish attempts to\nYou know to to get more interested in in more I'm involved in in the dynamics of of black leadership but on the other hand has been um a a rejection of there and like actress\nSomeone who asked the question okay if anti Semitism is on the rise and there's a horrible thing\nWhy is it on the rise\nWhy do you what is happening now in this country and by the way in Europe and France or what what's happening in those countries that are making some people\nBelieve the Jews are responsible for\nUm [noise]\nYou were asking actually the proverbial sixty four thousand dollar ... um\nI I I'm I'm Sorry to tell you I'm not sure I'm able to come up with any sort of response to you because they'd be Wilders may um we're living in an era\nWe're we can feel this in this country or across plus or your across Europe in England and France um we're we're we're we're increasingly as I said I'm\nA I I I Wish I understood I have no idea is something I mean you know there there's there's been as I said anti Semitism has been a product of many industrial societies for a long time a lot of people say that it's basically a struggle between cosmopolitan and national as well\nAnd there's another piece of that especially in Europe you have a clash of cultures going on when he mentioned England and France we'd had in those countries a huge influx of Muslim immigrants it's just a fact\nAnd when you look at a lot not all a lot of the attacks in Paris for example against members of the Jewish community many many many attached to them perpetrated by members of the Muslim community\nI'm Sorry that politically incorrect but that's just that's the fault and say you have to look at that as a specially in your eye out her mind and not so much a case in this country because we we seem to have a better way of handling that are keeping that from getting out of control that far but in Europe\nThey claim about it right you know what I ... I Know some\nJewish people who who actually believe in the theory that every sixty to eighty years anti Semitism rose it's like we had like the cicadas and uh and and and the theory is that here we are in twenty eight team and it's been some ... some odd years there would've been separated from the end of the Holocaust that so\nMany people's knowledge\nOf the Holocaust as quickly diminishing and with that knowledge is as as a result arise and in fact I'm a jazz them as as Holocaust survivors are increasingly fewer and fewer\nHe's interesting harmony though many of the national news and the rising nationals group and Europe are very pro Israel now very very pro Israel so there's a there's a strange dichotomy then in in a lot of people trying to figure that out\nI like to point out that Donald Trump is very pro Israel so a Bebe Netanyahu and other Jewish leaders would be the first to say that not all Jewish leaders that many of them\nBecause I knew them as is Israeli nationalism I remember going to say that\nI remember when my mother would act but Dina shot at the time in Iran was invited to speak at the un and people were shocked and angered at the fact that he was a Holocaust denial and he was being given such a platform in America are to talk and I remember that kind of shocked me at the time when I heard that cause it to me it's\nOne of those conspiracy theories and yet here's a world leader given a stage and he was just you know discussing it you know ... about it actually if I remember the way he was his\nTone [noise] but should he have not been given an opportunity to share his beliefs\nEven they are not libertarian about freedom of speech and putting it that's why I'm surprised that you were shocked by that when I was shocked that she is going to do that that that that he felt comfortable enough to bring this out it in America in New York City\nKnow in a large part of a world of that argument is is to become the most commonly accepted\nAll all of them people who were murdered yesterday\nEach one of them is a tragedy\nBut there's one I'd like to spend one minute talking about and that is as you mentioned those melons or\nWho is reporter by ... uh news outlets to avert a Holocaust survivor\nAnd I think hurt killing\nHas particularly resonated deeply\nWith many people the Jewish community and the Holocaust communities the concept that she would survive\nThe unimaginable horrors of the Holocaust\nAnd come to America\nAnd be killed\nOn the Sabbath\nIs almost unfathomable\nYou and please share with the audience because uh those of us around the table if or do you tell this story off the air uh you you grew up with the stories of the Holocaust just told you you know is a very young boy a share of that because you because you were that\nThat your mother was a hundred and two hundred and three hundred and two she's a hundred and two years old hosted two hundred and three by the way it looks on their dollars his cousin and she voted last week voted voted last week so she could tell us about how I mean obviously anyone that's been on this program where you are listening on radio or television\nKnows that you're speaking about the subject from from a from a depth that may be other guests\nTake us back to your childhood when did you hear that story because this is this is deep in your soul this issue and and what happened in Pittsburgh is very close to you is very close to\nMe I'm I'm I don't remember a time of my life\nNot knowing that my parents\nAre caused survivors both my dad was the sole survivor was family immediate family of eight my mother was the sole survivor of her immediate family of thirty eight\nUm\nI Do I don't remember a time not knowing my mom\nWas on a Holocaust survivor always knew because my mom and the second slave labor camp she was done was badly injured when it was bombed by the allies and her right arm has to be protected if the elbow\nNo ... no antibiotics\nAnd and she was lucky are hard to believe lucky in this context but she was lucky that she did not a developing infection and it happened late in the war in February Nineteen forty five so instead of being shipped to\nA extermination camp she was just left in the ... barracks and the camp was liquidated in April and the women but a death march for a number of days and many women died of death march\nFrom a exhaustion from starvation et cetera and my mother who was an amazingly strong resilient human beings survived\nA and a\nAnd a and we just celebrated\nHer a hundred at second birthday earlier this year and she is the uh\nA mother of two sons\nAre were three grandchildren and southern great grandchildren\nI Want to go back and ask for the rest of our guests are many people within your sphere of influence my main your immediate sphere of influence not your radio audience or even in my radio audience how many people really know the story of the Holocaust\nFrom a personal thing I mean you're the you're the youngest gentle under the table mid mid thirties I'm On a ... percent forty next year ... and we lost adorable but you're still you're still thirty yeah I mean how many how many of your friends really know what that story is all about\nI not many from what we haven't read or seen in movies or or done you know research on on our own and I I Want to say something really

learned to do much before as to being invited over on the Sabbath having a child at lunch\nAlthough the hollow bread so many things I've learned and\nI have so much more to ask him when I leave this table tonight uh but that's about the close ... close to coming to that community outside of just you know friends in school or whatever\nThat's really opened my eyes\nThat would be a good question for everybody to ask a a amongst your friends and neighbors tomorrow how many people really know that story\nAnd is that it is that part of what we as a nation can do to heal and and and to combat anti Semitism is just basically the smarter about the subject\nAre you headed the Los Angeles looking for the ideal place for you and your family to relax and enjoy yourselves plays that combines a
