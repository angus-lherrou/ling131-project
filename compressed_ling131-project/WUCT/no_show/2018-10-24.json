there's\nA story on the blaze that also I think comes from the Daily Caller\nAnd it's about who's in this caravan\n\nThere have been allegations that there are other than Central Americans in their other than Mexicans in there so who's in there a\nSpanish language network reporter reveals who was infiltrating Mike Ring caravan heading to the U.S that's the headline from the blaze written by Carlos Garcia a reporter with the Spanish language network Univision revealed but he had met people from a Muslim majority country who are infiltrating the migrant Caribbean from on doors headed towards the U.S border\nQuote they infiltrated themselves in this caravan Univision corresponding Francisco Santa Ana was reporting from a bridge in Guatemala where the migrant caravan was attempting to cross into Mexico other way to the United states Santa Anna said he had himself met people from Bangladesh\nIt's interesting the Daily Caller reported a translation\nOf Santa Anna's claims as reported from Mexico the borders and Central American\nI guess that means Central America or not as strong as the U.S which makes it possible for people from Panama and Ecuador to cross easily Santa Ana explained across from Costa Rica ventilator go through Guatemala and eventually make it into our country\nYesterday when we're traveling for what he said we noticed people from El Salvador and even people from Bangladesh she continued can you imagine what the imagine what they had to do to get here he said they infiltrated themselves in this caravan and tried to cross with the crowd that would have benefited them greatly Santa Ana continued to say that they were identified detained by immigration officials\nMexican officials appeared to listen to president Donald Trump demands to stop the caravan from arriving at the U.S border region reports indicate that some visuals are aiding the migrants on their truck\nAnd Mexican ambassador to the U.S admitted Thursday on Fox News or they believe the caravan to be at least partly politically motivated we have evidence that this government is also a very much politically motivated ... good years said we're obviously sensitive to the ...\nThey actually said but we've also made it clear that there is no legal ground on which Mexico can issue a permit by which people can just go through Mexico towards the United states he concluded why are they still come and then if that's the case why the hell are they still underway here\nWhen we come on\nAnd the reason is is because either in Mexico does it love its own country and it does you see the soccer matches where people are all screaming and yelling Mexico and waving Mexican flags does not have been all of their own country they just don't think they they should have to worry about it\nThey think that we have more so we should have to worry about it for some reason we're on the hook and I just don't understand that it eight nine for one pack Joe packs dot com Senator John Cornyn at the bottom of the er make sure you keep it here for that let me go to the phone line and say how to line one is Jeff in uh in Texas Hi Geoff what's going on\nHey Joe you know I got to tell you man I have a hard job every day and when I come home and I listen to your show by the time is over I'm well\nThank you man I appreciate that that's why I like to do well\nI yeah I I Know and you should go ahead and put this on CDs or whatever the marketing thing is put it all together from the beginning and then I'll be buying the tower out [laughter]\nI briefly on an airplane like crazy I read it personally thank you\nAnyway I got an just tell you okay just starting here I think this is a perfect storm and I think that the sheriff earlier ... a little bit but I think he's in the dark on what I Believe this worry okay\nWhat is these are are in mixed up with military eight eighty percent better I'm saying okay I've been watching the road and eighty percent better as military aged okay Fifteen to thirty\nThirty five okay that's happening now they're picking them up and pick up some trucks OK and load 'em up they're coming quicker now I Believe this is a plan and I think\nThe laughter they now gone so far they are with ... there'll be an\nAid and the money's coming from the ... and Russia and everything communist in South of this I Believe this is a red dawn happening that guy's boss he says in it the other guy called before him that said it was an invasion he's more right than he no\nWell I I agree that there was an attempt now to see how far they can get in and it's going to cause the president\nNow there'll be added on there's hundreds of training camps they're going to be coming out\nOf ... it's if it's not ... if it keeps on growing that's going to make this point even more salient the president now when you use ... hold on hold on a on a family that I didn't respond back [laughter] anyway or the president now has the opportunity\nTo do something as the executive in chief as the commander in chief he now sees that this is not just some gaggle of migraines hoping for a better life right this is actually now like fighting age men\nBetter predominant in this caravan and this hordes of people and he's gonna have to do more than just put physical presence there without arms you're gonna have to put people they're looking at it physically fight people if they have to we have to make it clear that the border means something\n... let me just say this place it's going to not the enemy is here fifty percent of this country okay they're here the child comes in here by thousands and soldiers okay they already\nSet everything up all the the ... the east coast west they're going to come from everywhere every communist country everything because the laugh now knows they don't have anything to on this so that they know that they'd been found out they don't have anything going on and ... have a civil war\nAnd that is happening the ... the veterans\nAnd it clearly this is the red dog we've all been buried and we're looking right at it but we're going to come up with everything else but what really is happening so everybody\nBetter get on the left by say that the writers and saying that the majority of a middle America ... we're\nNot going to do we're not we're not going to sit back and watch your Jeff were not no you that's why we're having conversations like this or not I raised my friend who's in office but I Know you've that's military is getting stronger and I like to\nGo jumping knows ... and I loved Joe Joe like crazy it was very complimentary Lovett Jeff love it I Can't just let you go four minutes and not say anything they actually pay you to do the show but I Do love it it's uh eighty nine for one pack Joe ... dot com line three or four is gonna be Fe in Kansas right what's going on about a minute\nAgo just a few words about this cat and come in and sure I hate that like it used to or to you know I don't care where at it is and it that I gather that life any real and all the least thing is getting a little tired rubber bullets\nWell I think there has to be there has to be some sort of a force waiting on the border so that people coming here kid you know like phone back and say they didn't stop us at all\nDid you come on up because then you'll have millions of people\nHeading from you know from lower income uh countries from ... from South and Central American countries in from Mexico itself to come into our borders we we have to make sure we dissuade them as they get closer and that's that's really important but it really is it's vitally important that we actually\nDissuade them we can't just say hey welcome\nMurray New Jersey I've got about a minute Murray make it up and\nYes a chow also I watch the blaze a blend back and I agree with him a lot he says that these are mocks his\nCommunist that are coming to our country and they want to get rid of the western civilization completely now I also heard someone say mentioned like a solution for the president that it's still on the books and I think it's the Congress alien act\nGranting oppressing you know the full power to control something like this and and John Adams our president did it back then and it's still on the books I don't know if you can get in touch with that Ted Cruz or someone regarding that but our president cannot let these people end\nUp with you Maria with you I don't know about the alien actor you're talking about I don't have it in front of me but certainly as we continue this I talk to every member of Congress I can I'll talk to the president if I can we've got to find out what exactly is going to happen with this because people listen you're the last few phone calls people are scared to death\nAbout what this actually means going forward eighty nine for one pack Joe ...\nI I'm I'm sure this is what he's doing but I Wonder if you agree but he's trying to tell moderate those people lean to the right a little bit moderate down the middle moderate to the left a little bit don't worry I'm not the radical they say I Am John Cornyn Scott ... got my back but I\nI I'm ... as you know and I do believe that they do is a radical when it comes to the policies that he is espousing he is a is a\nQuintessential national Democrat yeah\nWhich means he's profoundly out of step with the Texas values in Texas voters on everything from immigration to impeach the president from from a base abolishing eyes um all of these radical positions that are being a spouse that national level ... says he's four\nAnd I guess I have to give him some credit for his candor is he uh is he a pleasant guy a yes is he a charismatic yes is he somebody that I ever will be willing to work with where we find common cause on improving our ports of entry and trade 'em but but I certainly\nThink he's the wrong choice for a protects us and we certainly don't need another vote for Chuck Schumer to be the potentially next majority leader in the United States Senate\nAnd that's exactly what he would be he's made it clear that he would be bad he's also made it clear that\nThat he's sort of be a bit new you know Obama two point oh he's the guy that's on Ellen ... the guy that some of the late night shows he's the guy that\nAs you said is bringing charisma but not really talking about not outlawed any way what he would really do as he very far left wing senator from the great state of Texas when you see this much money flowing in from outside of our state does that give you concern absolutely\nAbsolutely and this this this is a new phenomenon y'all have never seen this before where you have an incumbent\nSenator and a red state like Ted Cruz who's done a good job who um and seeing unprecedented amounts of money coming from all over the country in the small donations that are raised over over the Internet\nAnd it's it's a it's a sobering thing because ah to have an incumbent red state senator being out raised and outspent by his opponent is a is something we've never seen before\nThirty million dollars he's raised it's more than any senatorial campaign ever John should we take a look at a at the availability of people from outside it'd be the given state\nTo send money in I mean I'm not a big regulation guy I'm a low tax guy but I mean if California orange ... wherever you lives can inject this much money into races in our states or in our counties in our cities I mean who's running the joint\n[laughter] it's a good question um and a good point I actually had\nGo after a rally with Ted Cruz in a in a Williamson county I'm just north of Austin right and you know we don't allow people from foreign countries foreign nationals to contribute to our national elections Ron I think that some legitimate question why should people from other states be able to inject\nTheir money into a race that for ... whoever will represent the state of Texas such a good good point good question we ought to pursue\nIts a Senator John Cornyn senator you been a great supporter of the military or even a great supporter of lower taxes lower regulations we're seeing more exports of oil from Texas than the importance I mean we're we're things are looking really good the idea that we would ever handed to the other party is one that makes me crazy\nUm how do you feel going in I I feel like maybe the Senate gains two or three seats but we've got to get people out to vote and the house really is up for grabs if the house goes the other way\nThe tax cuts to point oh go away tax cuts for middle class families goes away and the economy probably start slowing down how are you feeling going in\nWell you're right because Nancy Pelosi ... your driver's seat and we know that she's Noah\nHere alive or the or find common cause with President Trump on write anything so I think basically\nCongress will shut down by and large for the next two years\nExcept for we maintain the majority of the Senate which I'm optimistic we will do will continue to be able to confirm judges like judge Kavanaugh Judge Gorsuch and the other uh eighty two federal judges that we can farm so far right but I I'm\nI'm traveling to ah ah to Dallas a on Thursday or Pete Sessions waste there is on the on the line on the bubble and then that John Culberson in Houston John quarter in uh in Williamson county where I just left right I'm all of these are very close\nRaces and so that's why it's so important that your ... get out and vote in each of these congressional races because it's not as Ted Cruz is not just Greg Abbott it's these down ballot races that could determine\nWho is the next speaker of the house or in the house representatives in two thousand Nineteen\nAnd Senator John Cornyn couple of quick question senator of first of all walking Castro who is a I think district twenty ... a Democrat from\nI'm from the great city of San Antonio you know him you know his brother I mean this guy is a far left wing radical guy who just a few days ago I actually alleged\nThat that Jared Kushner gave a hit list to the crown prince of Saudi Arabia and then the crown prince took action that's Micah show used dead when the U.S representative says something so stupid he's trying to back away from it now\nBut when he says something so stupid I mean is there anything that can be done legislatively in the house can be censured came I mean you don't say something like that that the president's son in Law Order the death of somebody\nI don't think it was an accident and I think it was probably premeditated unintentional but I Can't think of anything more reckless for a member of Congress to say than to accuse somebody or something like that without any evidence whatsoever I'm it it it's a I think a disgrace\nWell I mean all seen the video and then he said he didn't say it but we've all seen the video he definitely Senate\nNow while it's it's I unfortunately this is one of those political issues that I think is going to be decided at the at the ballot box you know\nIt's probably not a whole lot that anybody could do I'm beyond that but I certainly would encourage people to remember this and I'm and vote 'em the way they think is appropriate you know uh in his ways that's just not something that ought to be rewarded with the support\nI couldn't agree more now the last thing has to be the thing that everybody's keeping an eye on his this caravan of two thousand to five thousand people\nYou either are looking for or need political asylum when their question these are people that say we just want to get a different job a better job maybe a better life and I get that I mean everybody wants a better job in her life but that's not somebody who gets political asylum generally speaking our friends in my ... aren't doing as much as I think they possibly can do\nAnd this also you're not going to like send out a Twitter message to everybody in Honduras hail its head north this is obviously something that was that that was put together by somebody on the left there's video out there that I've seen where people are handing money to those who were getting ready to jump onto this caravan of this hordes of people\nDo what can be done I mean we can't have four thousand five thousand people break through our border illegally and all claim asylum at the same time what can we actually do\nWell I I think the president is right that this is socially it would be tantamount to an invasion of the United states when the president has authorities as commander in chief to whip repel any invasion of the country\nYou know this this is what I think again that you mentioned or the left over playing their hand or cap and all this is another example of that I Believe\nWe're all sympathetic to people who who would like to immigrate to the United states for a better life right but we don't believe that they should jump ahead of line the line of people who are doing it awfully and and waiting in line\nAnd so this is another example of kind of a mob\nControlling our orders in our policies and we we cannot let that limb uh there is a legal way for people to get their case heard before an immigration judge and it ought to be handled that way I like the way Senator Cruz mentioned that it I think there was that the first the debate he had with ... or ... you said\nThey said the difference between they do work in me is I Believe in legal immigration not illegal immigration exactly and this seems to be encouraging illegal immigration\nCenter I thought that you did an amazing job of the Jewish new Judiciary Committee when it came to cabin on a thank you so much value were you represent our state and really do it it was

Xiong from food energy to my knowledge economy the Republican votes version and the Caspian Sea but see ... base in the region well worth exploring list the of foreign affairs matter that's on the television right now constantly is the caravan coming from Central America\nIf Donald Trump didn't invent this I'm beginning to think that the that heaven has gone Republican that there's that that that does the reds running for out across the whole holy ...\nBecause it is everything he talked about in the twenties sixteen campaign that took the Republican Party by storm and overwhelmed his rivals\nHis response was a strong border and the wall the caravan\nIs a puzzle to me why it's there where it's coming the men look very healthy very well dressed dominant male of working age and they're marching through Mexico not seeking refuge in Mexico which offers do them asylum if they're\nFearful of conditions in their own countries Honduras Guatemala or El Salvador and they're marching toward the border Donald Trump doesn't have any have to do anything more than stand there and they witness I Will stop this\nYeah honestly I think that's true because I think every American should be offended by the goal of these people who are marching towards the United states who know filled well ah that they are breaking all kinds of laws that they try to come into the United states but just assuming that we are\nIn effect and able to stop the flow we have no policies in place to really prevent them from coming into the country and I have to say if there is one issue where Congress has utterly failed the American people this is it and for Donald Trump to his latched onto this in two thousand sixteen was a master\nStroke not because\nHe wants it to be a problem but because it is a problem and it needs to be fixed and by the way this is a very good time for Republicans to remind people that Trump made a proposal as you remember he had several steps\nProposal on the table or to take care of the dreamers to redo our diversity of lottery program\nVarious other things increasing border security et cetera which most Americans agreed with almost every segment of it in a in terms of polling response showed that people\nYes I think that people should be allowed to come into the country if they can provide for themselves so that we shouldn't be a ... you know careless if you will with opening our borders so this is something where he really is on the high ground up the Democrats\nIf you recall wouldn't even talk about it in fact they just didn't show with a meeting that was supposed to address immigration reform they don't want immigration reform and I think\nHispanics are beginning to get the picture that this is something where they are being used as a political football or it has nothing to do with the morality of the situation Democrats simply like having this issue because they think\nRepublicans get hung out to dry on it but guess what this caravan as you will point out has really thrown that calculation overboard or it has been stirred up an organized by left wing agitator Z in Central America it's being funded by those politicians and activists and it is it has\nThe United states uh you know what it is embarrassing to the United states but not in the way they had hoped it's really embarrassing to Congress and a lack of laws and the Democrats who basically blinked and pretend nothing bad is happening\nThis should not be allowed and by the way it's not the first time when an American president\nWas busted\nBy one of these assaults on our border we all remember a ... in a two thousand twelve I think it was when you had that surge across the border during Obama's presidency and Americans were horrified and all of us on all the polling on immigration reform went very hard nosed and sort of\nBack fired for President Obama because people held him accountable for not fixing it uh I think this is as as you say a godsend for Republicans although it really is not a godsend to anyone 'cause it's a shameful\nUh it it sort of you know evidence of the fact that we pretend to be a rule of law nation but in this one instance we are not\nTaken the breath out of the Democratic tactic locally to talk healthcare health care or health care the metal grown polls for the sixty six districts I'm told this is Wall Street journal NBC is now even if not favoring the Republicans as\nOpposed to the national generic where the over vote ways in and that gives the advantage to the Democrats but we're only talking about the districts that are read for now but went from Mrs Clinton those the sixty six battleground the Senate Liz that caravan definitely is going to influence the Texas Senate race the Arizona Senate race in Nevada Senate race\nBe Montana's Senate race and the Missouri Senate race in the Tennessee Senate race all of those states struggle with illegal immigrants and the lack of ... immigration reform and all of those states were at issue for the Democrats while they're hold or pick up and they're now moving away from the Democrats [noise]\nYeah I think that's an ...

was recorded as a podcast and made available on the nation dot com as well as my website and globally I mean for heaven sakes they're all eventually everywhere in the ether forever\nUh I tuned is of course and all the other aggregators for five years but Steve is taken his right off of each week's conversation and arrange them in a book style we've gone quickly through ... too and Syria because we now we come to win it grew into NATO conflict and that was in twenty sixteen\nBecause of the concerns the fears of Eastern Europe\nThat Russia having gobbled up half of Ukraine was going to turn its attention to the Russian frontier and the NATO troops and the NATO commanders cooperated in this fear Steve because they injected in the idea\nThat Russia was an aggressor and the little green men could be in Lafayette just as easily as as they could be in Poland and since then there's been nothing but escalation in Europe so we started in Ukraine\nWe spread to Syria than we spread to Eastern Europe and now Steve because of the exercise that Russia just ran with China in the in the far east of Siberia we have a true global ... global conflict with Russia and China on one side and the United states and NATO and the other in these five years\nYes and it's amazing to me John not amazing but it's striking that as I finished the book how many of the subjects we discussed four or five years ago you would say it's history and it is history\nBut it's still front page news today a in Ukraine for example it's still sad what set off the fall of the government there and brought the pro American government\nThe power in a country that's part of Russia's common Ukrainian civilization right on the border of Russia\nWere one of those famous snipers remember that John in February\nTwenty one on solved fame and said well actually not I mean newspapers still say that the president of Ukraine at the time ... would soon be deposed in fleet of Russia has sent snipers to kill as a point on this on my ... square but all the evidence now in is that\nIt wasn't on the cold which but his very right wing even neo Nazi enemies who are the snipers now the reason that's important is that those people\nWho sent the snipers neo Nazis have grown into a major force in Ukraine Today and yet we backed government of Ukraine so this is another theme of the book I mean are we comfortable we Americans backing a government that has a bad\nA really large fascist movement in Europe today and our that our battalion ... with thirty thousand fighters\nSee if we just rent a NATO exercise in\nUkraine military so yeah of clear we're comfortable we're networking\n[noise] you know I I just want to get myself one further piece of a permanent promotion the late writer Gore Vidal's uh many years ago when I was writing a column about Russia for the nation magazine said that I was part of an early journalistic alert system\nThat is I call attention to things that people weren't paying attention to I think that that's one that that's been one important for me I'm doing this broadcast with your weekly is that you and I have been able to talk about things were working behind the news that are very\nThat are going to shake\nAnd when I read what we've discussed what I've written up now in the book\nI'm pleased and a kind of negative way 'cause I Wish a lot of these things hadn't happened the way what we began to trace in late to Thirteen when Ukrainian crisis ruptured all the way through almost last week has been the right things to focus\nStop their professor prep for the

happened to your garage that storm that came through with the sirens went off days yeah that's what happened I'm just lucky my car was an in their wow that's just a big power males in particle board what can you say they don't build them like they used to\nActually they do get a hold of those local guys mountain bond builders what's the difference big there for his mountain bomb builders use locally sourced quality materials and solid Mennonite craftsmanship did my garage Twenty years ago last year when the tree fell on it it was being treated broke Segre ours is solid river or\nAny country in specifically the United states the Soviet Union and Russia from deploying missile defense installations\nWhich meant walked let's go back to what was called mad what kept the nuclear peace ever since the beginning of the atomic age was this doctrine of mutual assured destruction\nThat if one side attack the other in an attempt to destroy it ... itself would be attacked and destroyed\nAnd that really ... madness could lead to this or an accident kept either side from protecting its off from a retaliatory strike so when Bush left it he opened the door\nTo a profound revision isn't that eventually underline this intermediate range tree\nAnd the Russians began when they saw what was going on to develop a counter or they began violating the treaty I whether they deploy these missiles are not open question but they certainly developed them and they tested or they haven't deployed them show the United states by doing that now\nRemember something else happened\nWhen the United states violated another agreement the one it made with Gorbachev that it would not move NATO eastward toward Russia when NATO began to expand Russia's borders and today John we all know we're right on Russia's borders NATO is\nThe missile defense installations which we are now being implemented because Bush had left the treaty prohibiting then became a NATO project where NATO went missile defense with so the result is\nAnd I'll get to the end of this point but I think it's very important Arizonans today as we talk Russia is ran by American NATO missile defense installations so you say so what how does that relate to what Trump\nAnd it's because the Russians have clay and American nuclear scientists who are independent such as professor Theodore postal at MIT have agreed that these missile defense installations can fire\nIntermediate range missiles that is there not only defensive installations they are often ... so we've been building their capacity to fire cruise missiles as I recall which have been banned for almost a decade now and the Russians have complained bitterly\nAnd we have not responded so we have a situation so when the Russians began to respond they probably violated the treaty but they were reacting to us\nAnd the age of system that we moved on the show is just yes actually right exactly\nEven though the the INS band land base missiles the age is complicated\nA lot of them are on ships but they are in fact the land based developed missiles put on ships they it's blurred the distinction between see inland oh I think it's fair to say\nAnd you might get on somebody and get somebody on like an ally of John ... who says my narratives not correct but I leave it to be\nWe have mine mostly or\nYou know with intent in mind done profoundly unwise things in regard to Russia to wish Russia has reacted\nAnd we see what it leads to because of this treaty this act of nuclear abolition isn't was symbolically and historically of enormous importance now maybe it'll be say\nThere are six months yet to give notice six months in advance maybe that's a blow off by Trump to get the Russians to do something a trumpet ... you're gonna meet where John and I remember\nEleven in Paris for the for the commemoration of one hundred years since the armistice end of the gun fell silent and November eleventh Nineteen\nAnd maybe they're going to and I think we're supposed to meet again in Argentina November from the sidelines of the G ... if they do meet maybe there's a secret diplomacy underway stare Dave ... eye doesn't look that now I have a quote here from the Institute of us and Canadian studies\nAh Sergei Rogoff a home with a Russian has links to Russia or\nIs he is there a guy on America I Know she ...\nLeaves that could uphold here is that leaving the INS could bring the whole structure of arms control crashing down now that that ... that said speculative plea but it's been my experience these five years that escalation works this way if something can happen and go wrong it does happen and goes wrong that's escalation\nSo what happens after the ins and is that the start doesn't get extended and that's all that's left there is nothing else after dark [noise]\nWell I ... I mean not to tell my book again but the thesis of the book is that this new Cold War is more dangerous than the proceeding one so during the proceeding Cold War we and the Soviet Union inactive all sorts of measures to keep us safe\nIncluding these nuclear weapons\nOr restrain regulation agreements now they're being dismantled uh so if we have a new nuclear war without the safeguards that protected is\nDuring the Cold War I didn't mean to say nuclear war we have a new Cold War without the safeguards that protected us from nuclear war we're in the greatest danger John\nBut now what is going to happen now I there is a politics too so it's going to come into play uh there's going to be political forces in the United states\n... just a moment we're going to add to politics hold it ... you switch from military to ... ... oh you did a very smoothly there so you got me out of our ...

efficient industry or you know with the current price which is much lower than it was just a few years ago they're able to make a profit\nUm I I Would say we've already reached peak oil and gas industry it just simply takes fewer people to extract oil and gas on the ground it's more technology driven and they get more oil and gas out of a single well used to ... um and so the result of that as a more efficient is model\nOr one that ... ... fewer people are but that has really helped the United states determine its own energy future we need to be less reliance on foreign oil\nAnd uh I

I think South Korea I Know we have in the other nations to I don't know they're in Britain or not but yeah we have a lot of other places\nOr you know the systems work they're not a hundred percent sure what I'm saying is let's put the money and and and invest in the science and engineering and get a systems to the point where they're going to be a lot closer to a hundred percent effective\nDo a call from Zach in western Nebraska good evening Zach\nGentleman I'm calling in about the uh the boat and meeting today with ... and um and uh Santa a little clip a quote of putting the saying um about the American\nEagle eating all of the ... and all we have left as the arrows\nAnd uh I Wanna back up and and just tell everybody I did vote for Donald Trump\nUm and the reason I did that was because of the non intervention all uh aspect that he was portraying during the campaign or and I heard the term Neal con being thrown around\n[noise] and ah you know I think that's exactly what's happening here and you know I I don't understand why we the American people continue to let these banker wars dictate our politics\nWhy don't know that we are allowing any quote banker wars to dictate any politics nor do I see anything in tonight's discussion a jet that wouldn't be in reality a pulling back from war anytime you allow someone to aggregated treaty in this way you're almost inviting trouble aren't you\n... I mean even the Romans had his phrase sports used from power bill of if you want peace broker war\nAnd that's really what we're doing here we're not allowing someone to violate the treaty and get away with it and whether or not we\nUpped the ante as you know a very different question and how we do it is a much better question so I don't know exactly by bankers sponsored wars or you know that sounds

Hi I'm I'm In ah I don't know if any if\nThis has been brought up before but the uh in my opinion the un shots at the you know ... child that was written for exactly this crisis right it's not a crisis or they think is a crisis for the U.S [noise] uh right now it's a crisis for ...\nAnd I think that um\nYou Nikki Haley should be calling a an emergency\nMeeting of the ...\nOr ... carrier to you know it's a dispatch UN peacekeeping forces [noise] um [noise] or a mission to to Mexico and set up camp squared away from the Mexican border\nAnd are you\nUh get these people into the camp skip the food et cetera et cetera that are from ... from the coffers and just happen to us as a as a ... in any nation so well take a listen to err on the planet\nA look at a Syria so you've got people running from from war they're they're running for their lives in Syria\nAnd uh where did they go ... ... to them there's a couple of million of them that have landed right across the border in Jordan so Jordan is going hey we need some help so the un\nAnd ... and others are putting money up for this massive tent city in Jordan and Jordan's saying okay okay okay ah ah we gotta we can't go on like this forever but that has been going on for a couple of years\nAnd the year when the the report I saw this morning about the un those is\nOr the un said well nobody's asked is uh we haven't been invited and I'm thinking right it's they're they're they're also a terrible organization my opinion but they should they should be the center point of doing exactly this helping these people out\nSomewhere now is Mexico going to say you can't do it here I don't know\nAnd if all these people were to make it to the border then we have a terrible situation because it's going to escalate into violence there's no way around that yeah oh yeah all of this\nThese people all die on the way here trying to get to America the cost has got to be jumping up and down with the way that our government and I who seem so bad\nBecause we walk taking all these people well I got to say oh they're open border and they are\nTaking the refugee saying I mean they just uh uh I got to be a rubbing their ass to get\nThere was um an interview last night I should have grabbed at a Jorge what's his name the Mexican broadcaster for a ... Ramos Jorge Ramos you see 'em a lot of these kind of a a little prematurely white haired guy he's he um\nHe was being interviewed last night about this and said well the similar what you're talking about you know the sympathy for these people and makes America look bad and the Trump look bad and all that look bad and so uh he was asked will argue for open borders and he went\nAh I'm ... I'm ... uh\nNo no I'm not for that well then what are you for\nAnd so that's really the essence of the question is you can be a sympathetic as you want and and and help these people on their journey but push comes to shove do you want an open border or not and I think\nThis is going to play politically because people are going to\nA lot of people will go down the emotional route sympathetic route and go these poor people they're hurting their sick their families they don't seem to be um you know some smugglers behind all of this somebody's helping them a little bit\nSo I feel so bad for them and you and if you look at most poli in the past people always talk about the sympathy factor\nBut will that will that factor vote for\nThe basically allowing them to come into the country because another excuse given Kirby is well it's only seven thousand\nAnd yet it's a it's five hundred thousand have already eagle illegally ended our country this year alone and if this seven thousand come in then you can bet there's another seven thousand and another seven and another seven that are going to go where they can make it we can do it too\nAnd so it's going to come down to ... to a political thing and and there's going to the question is are people going to support the Republican Party who stands up and says well they're not doing much Donald Trump stands up and says I Want to stop this from happening I don't know how this is going to play out but it won't play out before election\nDay but it's already getting the attention of people that are going to be voting here in in um two weeks from today\nAt stuff and that's a no win situation if you look at it that way because I I don't really come out looking a good on this if if we do all that the people that if I die away here\nIf we get into a college education generally at the border there is another thing to do that that looks like the right answer\nI um had a I don't know\nWhat what how people are going to receive this there are people that are pro am pro illegal immigrant Letterman come on um\nBut but I think I I this is anecdotal but I Do think that more and more people are going wait a minute you can't just demand to come into our country or you give gotta follow some of the rules come on you\nOh buddy but we are this is this is just one small group there's going to be many many more behind them if they get in that's why this group has to be stopped has to be yes\nBut it will get ugly I been predicted that all the way along alright Kirby thanks a Bruce shape the goal\nState five five to nine five sixty six hundred what do you think do you want to let them in these a lot of Bob impoverished families what do you want to do yes or no\nTrainer if this person I've ever heard in my life [noise] you know probably the best screener and radio waves Thomas olive [noise]\n\nIf you're a baby boomer with one hundred thousand or more of an vegetable assets this may be the most important in sixty seconds for your retirement we're sound income strategies and we transform typical portfolios that depend on speculative growth into portfolios that generates sustained retirement income for life and right now we're offering the latest book from\nOur founder David ...

east for a long time she says this entire situation is just simply another battle between turkey and Saudi Arabia\nWell it's very much a reflection of the traditional pension between Saudi Arabia and turkey the two great rival for preeminence in the Sunni Muslim world they've always resented each other they've always had a rivalry and we now the\nPresident ... have his moment to be able to kind of heavily stick it to the Saudis very heavily because he could have done much more damage than his remarks well look at what he didn't say to never mentions the tape that he supposedly has\nThat hit the ... people have been ... to every Turkish reporter who's pro government he didn't mention NBS Mr Boehner size we now have to cut out the crown prince\nTo he had a this way planets and brutal murder but he didn't lay it on the royal family tell this may be a negotiation for some serious cash from the Saudis to the ... uh\nYeah so it's a long time\nThat uh everyone was able to stick it to the crown prince Dan manager who writes for the wall Street Journal says that we are going to get to the bottom of all of this\nWell I think the other key events this happening here Harris is that ah the director of our CIA and Gina Haspel is now in Istanbul and talking to their intelligence services she is not a reporter for any newspaper she is talking directly to them I think we've reached the point\nWhere Gina Haspel has to say to the Turks show me the habit of either you had something or you do not this cannot go on forever like the panic saying don't take it back I think we're we've moved on to another plateau altogether\nThere as they are withholding they cannot withhold this evidence from the United states or from Gina Haspel\nAnd I'm not sure what Dan men about we'll move on in other words either show is the evidence or or you know fish or cut bait otherwise we're we're going to go back to normal relationship with the crown prince but he also said that Irwin is a obvious that he's trying to undermine the Saudis power\n... look or heard on is playing some sort of game on multiple levels here he is always trying to\nElevate himself inside the middle east and inside this country and he does that at the expense of others clearly he is trying to de legitimize MS be in Saudi Arabia he sees him as a direct rival so far he's having a lot of success and the Saudis indeed have been helping him\nYeah but as we told you yesterday cording to a best reports the Turks Irwin has in jail I don't know if he's killed anybody's got in jail a hundred\nPlus journalist so\nYeah what I mean it's more than just journalists the uh you've said something bad about him you'll wind up in jail\nThey had their own set of rules on how to live over in that part of the world and um do Irwin is is certainly you know calling the the the\n... basically calling out the prince when he does the same thing himself as short of killing somebody and I'm sure that that is probably happened he just as we know for sure that he's got a hundred plus a hundred and forty some I think journalists that they have locked up in Turkish jails\nYou just don't say anything bad about the leaders\nHard

fact that we don't know why cancer is what causes it but I think every one of us is built just a little bit differently or DNA and some people are more prone to cancer than others\nI Know Dr but I I just I just look at people that there's lots of people\nThat have used round up and don't have cancer there are lots of people that smoke like crazy and don't have cancer do I believe smoking uh is is unhealthy and may very well lead to people getting cancer yep\nBut I don't know that about rounded up it seemed like such a popular product and it's been used by millions upon millions of people\nBut there's nine thousand lawsuits out there that are basically wedding in the wings to come in next and go after Monsanto so that's the kind of news that you get some of these big data stocks and and they get bad news and uh down in the market goes\nBy let's throw the politics and do all of this because ah there's a big stink today as well about the economy and now\nEverybody seems to be jumping on the bandwagon about boy this economy sure is doing great [noise] than one of them happens to be a former president Brock Obama was at a rally that was not that well attended\nBut he claimed during this rally last night that the current good economy started when he was president\nWhen you talk about economic merit goes right now [noise] remember who started it and that's how people kind of notice that every time there's a pattern where they kinda they run things into the ground and we have to come back and saying\n[noise] um okay so he says that the economy recovery started with him Larry Kudlow\nPresident I think he's right with all respect to President Obama look at 'em\nOn his stewardship\nThe so called recovery was by about two percent average per year\nAh which is really the worst since the I Believe sense and depression and already we have beaten are critics including Obama staff people were on the economy it's three to four percent economic growth he's a tax cut her that's a big difference from his predecessor who was a tax hike or\nYeah one more uh art Laffer a chimed in on this too is that the recovery under President Obama was a shall we say underwhelming\nThey said that yet every single year he for cats and gross over three percent in every area revise it down to something horrible number you know they always had these hopes and dreams and they never came true for the for forty eight years but Obama is a silver tongue person he's\nEight looks like a delightful person I don't know him personally but I Would love to get to know what I mean that's a wonderful guy and you want to believe him but it's just not true what Larry Kudlow says is correct that the single worst recovery in the post war period by any president\nAnd you know he's claiming credit for that you know I should think he's hiding from that but no\nHe runs right into it every time it's a it's the worst recovery ever\nWell because most people don't pay attention and and they go yeah that's right the bottom hit right when he became president and and uh and and so there was a he's responsible that's when the economy started recovering\nWell he took it out of that dive yes the ... with the big stimulus plan and everything else but when push came to shove we got stuck we were in the ditch to use their old term or wheels were spending we could not get going for eight years could not produce a three percent growth\nFor eight years\nAnd I think it was because of his policies he's out of office and before he's out of office very far all of a sudden we got this economy are going on all cylinders so uh he did have the worst economic growth since World War two and now\nWe're moving again so it is rather brazen to say it started with him\nAnd engage with Tom Sawyer [noise]\n\nHey I'm Brandt so there's this guy didn't Jordan he's a healthy guy he's a dad of six and he works as a guide in Alaska and he goes to the doctor a true story goes to the doctor

why why does a Medicare for all seem to test all well among Democrats [noise]\nWell I think you know Bernie started this back in twenty sixteen I'm Single payer has been around Medicare for all for a long time but only in twenty sixteen when he was running against Hillary for the Democratic presidential nomination he brought out his first single payer plan you know telling the American people that would be free and they would have the best healthcare and all\nAnd so you know the mainstream media picks up on this and plays it over and over again that you know who wouldn't want something that's

about DACA but I Want to get rid of chain migration and I want to build the wall and that was a big deal to Democrats he didn't want to give in on chain migration but what happened here Senator Harry Reid in Nineteen Ninety three cut twenty two\nBecause of relative based immigration system is inherently unfair\nCongress has been forest or ... even more of a certain majors to deal with the demands of people\nWho don't have relatives here\nCan't be any wonder that the American people think our immigration policies are and Joe\nWhen we used to like forty thousand new am I going to say here\nBy lottery yet that's the lottery a went on to hit on chain why I don't understand why they why they did the political calculus and think that's something to back off off\nYou know President Trump has been right all law and he's been fair with trying to put up an immigration plan that would be fair to all secure our borders have an immigration system it actually works and would not be in this problem that we are today in the future what changed here is the Democrats\nJust want to do everything we remember not one of them voted for that\nTax bill not in the house or the Senate and now we're the most competitive country in the world we haven't been here more than a decade you had to go past anytime of the Obama because he could never get us to this point but they just want to resist everything we do so even though that President Trump went even further\nAbout DACA than others have gone in the past to try to bring everybody together\nWhen we put those two immigration bills on the floor\nAnd it takes two hundred and Eighteen votes to pass one\nWell there's two hundred and twenty three Republicans who voted for one or the other just not on one not one Democrat would\nVote for those bills and that you would not have this caravan you'd have a secure border but you'd have an immigration system that actually work\nYou might remember this but evidently Dianne Feinstein of two thousand eight passed in two thousand nine there really told the Mexicans are you are the problem and sent a message to Central Americans in South Americans will favor you\nThat is why we're having these surges at the border what was that bill what is the effect when and how do you think we can we can undo it\nWill this is a problem we have what it's called ... other than Mexican so if somebody from Mexico comes across the border illegally we catch them we send them back\nBut if there are other than from Mexico City kid a catch and release in our country that's why that care of and\nOne moment if you had a group of people that inside your own country was American but decided I just want to live in your house\nWe are a rule of land land that believes in the rule of law you will break society down if you break the rule of law and they're just going to come up here and then they're just going to scurry and try to come across the border and all different places that's why the president has a right of why we need the wall and that's why I have to build\nBuild the wall enforce the law\nAnd the other elements of just building that wall sanctuary cities to in that because that's an incentive to come the ability to remove gang members capes law what we found numerous times that people have been deported three four times it's still coming back around but also supports ice and it condemns any\nIdea of allowing illegals to vote I think that's a common sense bill that we can vote impact\nKnown getting down to how hard the president's been working in you've been working to try to save the house would you realistic you said there there's too many retirements to be optimistic even though you're not giving up and you also say there's a lot of rich people throwing money around especially former New York mayor\nMichael Bloomberg I Know he's been giving out money I did not know to what extent what does he done\nMichael Bloomberg if you if you watch just about a week and a half ago he re registered Democrat and he put he put it out on the press he has now given a hundred million dollars eighty million to the Democrats in the house and twenty million to human than it he's trying to buy the nomination 'cause\nWe want to run against Donald Trump he kind of by Congress but it's not just him come dire\nMore than a hundred and twenty million and rubber whole goal is to impeach the president he brags that his impeachment list is bigger than the list of the n._r._a. and then we know what sort of that for those three men alone has been\nUnbelievable amount of millions of dollars trying to win the house and that's what's creating some of the difficulties look I'm On the road tried to help conservatives everywhere we can't [noise] yesterday I was with ... in Florida that I was with Brian Mast remember remember who Brian masses congressmen today\nServed on military served in Afghanistan\nAnd you lose both his legs lost both his life\nBut you know when the biggest challenges in Florida is this algae he's been the leader on that\nHe's the one that that got it didn't lead\nThe fight this today I'll be up in Jacksonville for Michael Waltz he could become\nThe first green ... to ... to Congress this is Ron defenses his old seat where in a fight there and then I'll be in the Atlanta\nHandle remember she won the special election for Tom Price the seat\nMichael Bloomberg just put two million dollars into her race against her she's one of the most effective members we have then Rob Woodall and then at lunch I'm going to be with Maria Elvira Salazar this is a Florida is twenty seven she's running against Donna Shalala remember Donna Shalala in the Clinton Administration\nWho also ran the Clinton Foundation destroyed or the college down here as well\nWe're up in that race because Murray Elvira she's been a part of this community she's she's been she was in the news with Telemundo Univision and others she's been a part of this community here it's just a fundamental difference we have great candidates resources are against it\nBut at the end of the day I Believe we keep the house\nUh and then of course you would run for speaker\n[laughter] well my number one goal is make sure we have a Republican who could be speaker that's the battle between now and November fix we can decide what happens after\nTwenty seconds what happened you a Boulder went through the window and one of your headquarters\n[laughter] well it's my congressional ... the older I don't know that\nWell the glass ran in there and the whole thing and

seven six six million\nTell a friend a news talk Ninety four point one special events\nBrown I Am a Democrat I Love your show I Love Trump but this year has been really hard for me I had to swallow a lot\nYou know it started with Maria thrown paper towels at my people um and then you know like you know the senators saying you know don't monkey there is a now yesterday or the ... president comes out is that he's a nationalist as if\nWe don't know what that means you guys are pushing us away led to this weekend where history shows that we're really says\nSo tell me if tell me if this level and let me tell me a for example there are things that you could say to me that might insult me as an Irish Italian New Yorker you might not know it\nUh there are things that I can say to you or they might insult you depending on your nationality race or religion and I might not know it so Donald Trump saw that there was some problems with them using the word nationalist and expanded on it here cut thirty seven\nAll I Want our country is to be treated well to be treated with respect for many years other countries that are allies of ours\nA fairly [noise] so in that sense I Am absolutely a nationalist I'm proud of it\nDo you understand that this president is a lot of things but he's not a dog whistle guy there's nothing subtle about it which is why I Know we didn't have a metal the Russian didn't work with the Russians to win an election does that further explained it to you\n[laughter] Brian I'm definitely you know I totally get what he's trying to see why not come out of say I'm a ... this is my country were to put this country first national is your what was going to happen with these guys before they talk\nNobody who say my country first America First that's why I voted for him\nWhen you come out and you say something like that Brian I may not take it like that but my people are not stupid and we know that that was the same word Nazis used so why use it\nUm you know the definition a person who advocates Political Independence for a country\nA person who's drunk patriotic feelings especially one who believes in superiority of their country over others that's how Donald Trump is using the word here's the care about the history he knows what he's using it for now\nThe media's twisting it though this is what I'm trying to save I mean you understand I think Donald Trump or races I really don't understand that but my people the people that I Want to come out and vote to get us to cross the finish what you guys are pushing them away\n[noise] yeah I Do see you guys are nobody and don't think the president has a consultant on that he doesn't I\nDon't think that he bounce it off Kellyanne Conway or bill shine he didn't never does you don't you know he doesn't they don't deserve credit for the success he's had a and maybe on the platform and they don't take credit or discredit for some of those sayings\nHe's challenging again he's like I don't care about the past I'm telling you how I mean it but I hear you Jerry you know that's a good point ah both for the most part they got to listen to him and just said he said what does he mean by that and also even if if he is nothing else he knows how to when\nThere's no way that the president's successful nor his party is winning if they just have one sect they need a lot\nOf Hispanics blacks women

Saudi Arabia there are no winners here joining us now is congressman and Kinzinger who who fights are wars also a Adam is a retired air force pilot flew in Iraq and he's on the foreign affairs committee a congressman\nThe president's remarks yesterday I I think he was waiting for the investigation of player but as he waited he IEDs are directly do you want to counter it\nListen I first off your book was awesome I just have to say it I I finished in a couple of weeks\nAgo and lake is fantastic but let me just say on the ... the president's correct you're saying you know look we that's just terrible what was done this is absolutely wrong this violates all kinds of things\nRight on the path theories you was also a correct to be cautious at the beginning we need to make sure I mean there's there's people that want to jump to these foreign policy conclusions all the time and just assume that whatever is reported on some news thing or from some\nFor an agency is the truth when when it comes to international politics you have to be cautious and judicious but you know what really does kind of get under my skin and all this is as you mentioned earlier one now who is the is that is holier than thou defender of\nAnd uh and then you see even people in our own party and then the other party\nWho are calling for this like excommunication of Saudi Arabia you Rand Paul for instance of said\nLet's just cut off everything with Saudi Arabia and at the same time yesterday\nHe called for a story in relationships and lifting sanctions against Russia who killed two people in the u._k. and killed journalist all the time so there's gotta be some consistency here and foreign policy and the fact is we oppose the killing of journalists but we're not going to realign are interested in the middle east because of it\n[noise] so uh this now we have the CIA director over there trying to get some answers because we basically given up on the Saudis but how rich you said sarcastically is it for her to want to act outraged about the Saudis what do you think he's playing he's looking to get maximum leverage from Saudi Arabia\nHis economy's terrible he sees jealous of the relationship that we've got rekindled with Saudi Arabia who do you think about his comments [noise]\nWell I think you you never know where are the wind comes down I mean it's kind of had an unholy alliance with Russia and an oil alliance with Iran and then he says he's against Russia and Iran issue down a Russian airplane this guy's allegiances change every day for whatever's going to give him a moment of power and\nLook Saudi Arabia and Iran are the two polar is right now in the Muslim world in the middle east and that bothers or the one he wants to lead the middle east and and uh and so I think he sees this as an opportunity in my estimation take Saudi Arabia down a peg to probably get some concessions from um including\nSome economic concessions and reassert himself is kind of the dominant power in the middle east the reality is though he has no moral ground to stand on sure he doesn't murder journalists in the fashion of\nSaudi Arabia dead and again we need to be very clear and condemning this evil back but he's not he's not you know some you know St Mary himself either I mean you know a couple of hundred journalists in jail and we had a pastor in jail for goodness sakes off a sham trial\nA congressman ... you know with a lot of times Congress takes the lead you guys did neuron during the Obama years what is going what is going to be the the backlash from this apparent killing a brutal killing of cars Yogi what do you what do you guys talking about proposing\nWell this is where you get into the internal politics and I think it's important to\nTalk about this you know some of these people\nThat are calling for cutting off arms sales to Saudi Arabia\nYou know basically the strategic realignment away from Saudi Arabia or the same people that were doing it the ... before this even happened this has been their foreign policy goal like I mentioned Rand Paul he's always wanted to excommunicated Saudi Arabia and frankly get the U.S out of the world it's fine he believed that but I think it's important to know so\nYeah you're going to have these groups in Congress that have always been this kind of anti Saudi more pro rainy and they you know they love the Iran deal\nThat are going to try to take advantage of the situation I think it's important for us to say things like travel bans on anybody associated with this certain sanctions against you know the regime but at the same time we can't completely re align ourselves in the middle east away from Saudi Arabia because of this\nI Know I was just struck by Lindsey Graham and Bob Corker to defenders of a re killing their relationship feel personally taken a personal front because this happened and you just wonder as brutal is his citizen it's nonsensical and you don't want to think about it why the Saudi Arabia I think they can get away with it that's what I find it following\nYeah yeah and that's where that's where I'm blown away is is you know this idea and this is why he don't\nSuppress journalism right it's because ultimately if you try it's\nGoing to backfire on you know the idea that the Saudis thought they could murder you know their own citizen but a resident of the United states in in Turkey is ridiculous and it's going to backfire on them and I hope and this is why I'm for pretty and\nIt's kind of behavior in the future but again I think before you know everybody sits back and says gee we need to just you know cut Saudi Arabia off the map and become best friends with Russia and Iran and everything in Turkey but look at what some of these countries did them before we you know bill sanctimonious\nYour reaction to the suspicious device as it were a route to Obama or Obama camp to Clinton house and now CNN\nYeah we don't you know we don't know who send them off or if it no matter what the situation as a I Wish we could just get back to having good spirited debate instead of confronting Mitch McConnell and had to cruise in a restaurant you\nSaying you need to confront um at gas stations and fight people and push back to their face because ultimately are going to have you're just going to have a huge mess that is not good for our institution democracy\nCongressman or how concerned are you what changes if you're in the minority\n[laughter] oh man everything I'm you know sometimes you sit back and yet you imagine how Nancy Pelosi the speaker I mean imagine every Trump official in front of every committee every day\nUh being attacked and asked for everything and and ... and they were three is the Trump Administration and Maxine Waters and the chairman and Jerry Adler is a chairman I mean I really just it gives me chills\nOr because you know and I think you know what is it due to the confidence of the economy people where is the economy has grown up because people feel free to take a deep breath and invest or if you got this Nancy Pelosi regime on the horizon a I think people are going to hold back some guys get out and

Adam thanks when we come back we're going to be joined by Jason ... spent years is border patrol years in the army and now he's a whistle blower he knows the reality on the border and knows what we can and can't do to stop the seven thousand [noise] care of any this way\nMake off your Saturday here coast to coast nothing but football all day long for\n[noise] no it's not and you know that but that's the thing is the message the messages if\nYou come here and you can claim I'm a refugee or asylum status because of that um then you should come now everybody I mean if you're\nSaying eighty percent of the people are are male military age males coming up\nI mean how many of them have ill intent how many of them have a background I'm In that same violence that they're fleeing\nMean that's where the the problem with the borders going to happen is we're gonna have to bet out close to ten thousand people\nYou know you mentioned I was a whistle blower my biggest thing was about the whole vetting of these adults with children how are we going to are we going to potentially have um two to three thousand DNA kids ready to go when we were down there I mean it's just it's just going to be a complete mess\nAbsolutely use our quarter she's actually in Guatemala and this is what she saw cut Eighteen\nWe ran into people that were part of that and a Thirteen it appeared shy it there were\nOther people as well as a very different group there would be enormous amount of now we were there to greet the way people crossing from Honduras to walk them all that is right on the border I can tell you what I saw\nWere very few women and children and any normal but now that now and\nThat's what you see and that's what's going to be at our doorstep how hard is it going to be to get that next dead next nine hundred miles with a with a you know basically with sandals on\nIt they they can do it I mean I Believe me they can do it and I'm sure they're going to um there's trains that they're going to be running into soon ...\nUm there's other transit court orders I mean are they going to be linking up smugglers there's ways to make it to the border it just depends on how much time do we have to repair I mean if they're a thousand miles away\nWe need the four deploy assets down to them account area that we have Fort Sam Houston is right there which is great big military base um oh we need to really start moving assets in place the border patrol will get overrun by ten thousand people\nAnd they're helpless I mean they were almost victims in this because ... politicians can't get out of the way and also I saw you know we have Tom Homan who used to run I said the for the most part twenty percent of everybody that crosses has a criminal record\nSo you got to deal with some form of the people who are trying to mix in the Washington Post talked to two people that have been through five or six times and they're using the caravan is cover to try to get back again here\nWhy wouldn't they Brian I mean when I was in a border patrol um and when I was with ice you know one thing is like when I was let's say it was an border patrol and I caught a group of ten\n... ten you could say at least you had a criminal history that was verifiable now what about people that do not mean vetting is great people left talking about vetting but if you've never if you're a criminal you've never been encountered by law enforcement then you're not going to have a criminal history so we don't know if you're in the area so I mean this is just it's mind boggling\nYeah here's a Mollie Hemingway I think she reflects the sentiment in this country Katrina and\nI think there's a lot of room for disagreement on the immigration debate and you have people who you know covered the spectrum there but the idea that there aren't national security concerns with immigration policy or economic concerns with immigration policy it's actually just something that a lot of Americans agree on\nFacial for Donald Trump's argument that we need to have secure borders and orderly immigration policy it's an understanding of national sovereignty that that does not allow just literally the flooding of people over the borders\nAnd it used to be unanimous I mean we have Harry Reid we're Brock Obama Chuck Schumer all saying we have that border security jeez in this you must have seen this what happened why it was only one party convicted on this\nI don't understand I mean I'm ... I Believe both parties can agree\nThat there are legitimate or refugees and a legitimate asylum claims within that group it's the other part of the group that we need to be concerned about and it's not a it's a calling out I'm like hey you know calling fire this there's actually legitimate bad people within that group I guarantee it\nUm but I you know Ninety six when it's all really started fluctuating fry and think about the border of San Diego you still get inundated with hundreds and hundreds of Alan just running up the highway and Clinton passed a law back then and that's when the ... of the border patrol began that's when the uh mass hiring started\nSales so you guys got a wall at a huge fence\nAnd that yeah that was fourteen miles long but what happens when you get to him a gallon we're that fence only goes a certain point and I've been to the I was deployed to a ho Arizona were all there was was a strand of\nUm a strain of barbed wire that's not going to stop anybody so let's say they meant let's say they are going to count at this point we don't know exactly where they go and that's just the closest water but what happens if they get to that other areas and then you also have the crisis of what happens if they start crossing a river how many of them are going to die\nI mean there's so much to do with this and you got to remember one thing I brought this up the other day was\nThat a communicable diseases we have to not just only vet for criminal history we need to deploy a Center for Disease Control people down there a and FEMA tend to ensure that uh we're not bringing everybody across it has like a high fluctuation of tuberculosis or any other disease\nAnd Leslie Jason if you talk to anybody used to work with at the border is there any color you could

I I Would think that would be a good idea for a President Trump to dispatch someone not and his government\nSomeone the Saudis trust I mean ideally would have been George W. Bush someone like that but he's too old maybe Bush senior maybe a former ambassador someone they trust but to give them the no nonsense message you guys got to clean up your act and um and and and come clean Leslie a cut thirty six President Trump\nBecame a nationalist and we're not supposed to work you know what I'm a nationalist sub [noise]\nHis critics say that's code white dad drives he says no it's America first I Want to put my country first right\nIt's a does anyone think that President Trump speaks so subtly in code you sleep they they are attacking flipping bluntly right on the book\nI I think patriot as a better word a it is parallel to the America First debate I mean I think the President Trump uses the word America First and the literal sense that most Americans hearing it means we're putting America's interests first\nOf course it as bad pedigree with Lindbergh and so forth I don't think he meant that I think nationalism\nSort of at the same as any clue and when he

Brian kill me Joe we're also following\nThe packages three explosive package is heading for up for a president of the United states\n\nNews sauce [noise] Ninety four point one where the legal issues that will decide on election twice\nWell Andrew Gillum the Democratic candidate who don't want it very difficult primary and he has a showed himself now that will lead in almost every poll that's come out and today a new revelation\nYeah yeah I I think that I think it's gonna be closer than it is I mean the Santa's as an Iraq veteran it's got to really like well I'm good looking family I my understanding is that I'm the president likes him on and and you know the president\nWe had a very ingrained politician in our state and that and putting them\nAdam did not come out for the president during two thousand sixteen early Enron did and present remembers that stuff so back right or wrong worst presidents loyalist I think that's what's going on here I Do think that scientists was going to win and again Gillum can't get out of his own way this this ticket thing is something that seems small\nBut voters again and I for a quarter three I think about it\nText message emerge that show what he said on Sunday in a debate did he got him from his brother is just not true when an FBI agent posing as an influence or a text message Andrew Gillum and says I have you I've got new uh Hamilton tickets and he says great\nSo those are the tickets worth hundreds of dollars you can't get that as a politician you can't get favors like that as a politician he seemed to have not told the truth about it and accepted it and it shows that the FBI agent is beating him to do this what does it say about the investigation that might be taking place on the Tallahassee mayor\nYet um well let me say this hundreds of dollars I had says and Tampa Hamilton's coming for the first time in a spring and it's over a thousand dollars for tickets\nYou know it's a Broadway musical it's common so I'm\nElizabeth ... he's going to end\nThe orange show I my understanding was it was a tornado but the long and short of it is is that the for somebody like Gillum and Tallahassee having the reputation is I mean take it out of politics we talk football at\nFlorida State said its own problems with with a bunch of stuff there Tallahassee has become one part of Florida is looked at as our swamp our microcosm of swap what I'd like to see and other people who support Republicans in the state\nWould be to Santa's coming out stronger against the state swamp than the D.C swamp I think he's flying too high ... rather than the ground game which is important in Florida\nWell I don't think he's really outlined what he would do more he just points out that a Gilman reality once Medicare for all Gilman reality once upstate taxes give 'em reality is not that a good job as mayor of Tallahassee what he has his great charisma great presidents\nAnd African American candidate who ran a crowded poll because he was backed by Thomas dire and he was backed by George Soros so now you have a charismatic guy and you have another guy a veteran who's made a difference in Congress and he's been unable to separate himself because he can't believe he's running against somebody who seems so anti Florida\nYeah ... and Brian look at going because when you say Medicare for all the state of Florida I mean I Know we we have the economy I'm folks over age sixty five in the country we still do\nYou start talking about Medicare for people that are under sixty five that scares a lot of voters and to your point the Santos has not explaining that piece to health care if you gave Medicare to all the folks that are living over sixty five in Florida right now they're Medicare their Medicare Advantage plans I work with health care businesses all the time are going to get diluted\nThat should be a major major talking point and you're right it's not being discussed in part of it is nobody really has gotten understands healthcare\nRight and it is remains the number one issue of concern caravan aside a scandal aside the healthcare number one we were in between the Obamacare plan which is a disaster that Democrats are running from and it being taken apart by Republicans who don't have a plan\nYeah and and look I mean it's in the news today with what the president's doing with the Recovery Act that is a major band aid on the biggest piece of legislative malpractice and presidential member malpractice I'll probably ever seen in my lifetime and that was Obamacare why\nReally simple Obamacare for people that I didn't understand it expanded Medicaid that was three quarters of Obamacare was expanding Medicaid Medicaid what's supposed to be for folks that were disabled had Down syndrome like my sister in law passed a couple of years ago [noise]\nSupposed to be for the elderly poor Obamacare opened it up to single able bodied mostly not working men\nUnder the age of thirty five\nWhat did they start taking if you go to a clinic that takes Medicaid in Florida and it's a pain management clinic in the last ten years tons of opiates so now they're hooked on opioids they're addicted on opiates and what's the president been left with and thank God it was a byproduct person piece of legislation\nThe opioid Recovery Act where you try to now get Medicaid coverage that's what this does to help these folks on Medicaid get off the opiates we got him out right\nOr if you what are the numbers like if we had Medicaid for all for a country\nBecause that's what Bernie Sanders is asking for free education and Medicaid for all I mean do you have any idea how costly impractical that would be or impractical\nOur country right now it's almost twenty percent of our gross domestic product everybody knows this is the first is health care\nIf you were to shift healthcare to medicate for all anyone in the audience who is a Medicaid patient would be able to tell you the experience they get into the doctor it would be completely different than the experience that all of our listeners who do not have medicate today have\nIs a different type of medicine that's practiced and it's scary and nobody talks about the actual care compared to the numbers\nIt was a primer hotel it they're not going to do anything that's going to sustain itself unless they work across party lines I suspect\nThought there might be of sense in this country right away for them to try to get a health care program on a bipartisan way because if you don't have bipartisan as soon as you lose power that other for the other party's gonna take it apart\nFestival in and look on one thing that I can tell you that a lot of people really like right now are two things one direct Madison used to having an Amazon Prime subscription there's inability to get that now in the country and get it a low rates and going to see a doctor and when you want to it's a free market private enterprise\nThe other thing that people really really like they like when their employers are doing wellness programs and giving them back money for staying healthy and staying in the workforce you'll hear about those things should be bipartisan\nYet a health clubs are eating right things like that a lot of times a day revolutionize the workplace to make sure if you want to stay we want you stick around and we're going to give you

[noise] so I guess the question is what do I do with this money to city\nWhere do you do have the option of just leaving it and were those big companies small we're in between that you were with before\nOkay so the one with Eighteen thousand is on I'm most concerned with the the smaller company and I'm worried that they go out of business what happens to that money\nThe money would be okay and the four oh one K. but if it's a small businesses a different issue\nAnd that small businesses tend to have very high cost for one case right so I was scared that all that money out quickly\nAnd move it to one of the low cost providers and have an IRA with one of them the three big low cost providers for having IRAs\nAre vanguard Charles Schwab and fidelity investments okay than we have them let me tell you something do not call the administrator of the four oh one K. and say\nHey I Want to um move this money out and do an iron they'll say great what address you want to send you a check never take a check because what they do\nIs they would subtract thirty six hundred dollars from the check they send you and send it to the IRS as withholding and you have to make up that thirty six hundred in the next sixty days\nFor you end up paying massive tax for not being able to make that up so what you do with whoever you would go with his vale do paperwork that will move the money directly from the old employer's plan\nStraight into wherever you're going to have the IRA\nOkay and then you recommend an IRA or the Roth IRA\n... I just\nI hear you talk about that it's\nAll right so the story is you can't take money that was in a traditional four one K. and put it into a Roth without having a big tax bill\nBecause all that money they don't want him was pre tax correct so you go into a traditional i._r._a. without money not a Roth IRA okay and you can over time migrate the money\nFrom the traditional to a Roth as she could afford to pay tax on money each year or you just know you got money that they are that's going to grow over the years that you're gonna have to pay tax on Sunday so let's talk about the other one the seven thousand is down in a big employers plan or small\nIt's a very large employer or their trail the stock exchange\nSo it was a big employer the odds favor that that will be posing extremely low cost plan probably lower than you could find in an IRA okay\nSo are the only exception that would be if they have that money administered by an insurance company for them the four one K. or buy a bank\nIt's it's it's it's just through one of the three that you mentioned\nDollar and you could just leave that seven behind him move the Eighteen\nOkay and then as far as contributing to that ... then you're able to contribute straight to the IRA versus trying to go through back\nIn the last year ... great question so let's say let's keep this simple I in fact\nCompany that administers the plan for the big publicly traded company used to work for\nIts vanguard so if you wanted to keep it simple\nUm move both of 'em to vanguard in an IRA\nAnd just be done with the old employers for one case 'cause if it's with vanguard the costs will be low enough as an individual anyway and then you've got the simplification of just having an IRA there and then at vanguard open a raw for any future contributions\nTo you all have the twenty five to grow in the vanguard IRA\nAnd then you open a new account with vanguard for Roth in any current or future contributions he may go into the raw\nOkay and then those can be so just so I'm Sorry I I'm not a hundred percent up to date on all these things that Iraq is post tax correct\nExactly yeah and you're are you going to have twenty five grand that center pre tax account you want to have money in a post tax accountant or raw truly great to have a mix of both but tilted more towards the Ross\nThis will be a way for you to do it you simplify your life you just have an IRA a band guard a Roth IRA vanguard old money and the IRA new money and the Roth IRA and that would be a good way for you to build up money going forward\nChris is with us on the Clark Howard show Hi Chris\nHey Clark thanks for taking my call\nSure you've got a puzzle you want to see if I can find the pieces for\nHis or a wife and I were looking at twenty Nineteen health plans\nAre currently we're we're all on a family plan and under my health insurance however the like how many starts search hurting a surcharge for a spouse that's able to get health insurance through their employer\n'em and using round numbers it's roughly fourteen hundred dollars a year so if I cut my dependence and myself you know the premiums would be nine hundred\nVersus including her which would be Eighteen hundred\nOn top of that fourteen hundred dollar surcharge annually\nSo she's nine hundred extra month plus an additional fourteen hundred dollar surcharge a year correct so she's ten eight a lemonade twelve twelve thousand something a year\nFor health coverage through your existing employer ... how much is it for her if she goes on her employer's plan\nThe eleven hundred a year\nEleven hundred a year versus twelve thousand a year\nOr a versus about twelve hundred additional on top of that for the family plan\nI'm ... and then I say too is if we both take\nOur company sponsored clans that they're both high deductible plans for lines three thousand dollars but the company in San of either the employees are two thousand that's leading roughly a thousand dollar to cover for that you ...\nOh or or hers is five thousand but it would cover one hundred per cent lunch that's met so it was the main course she'll still keep the whole family under one bucket or should we each take our own plan and then just try to max out the annual age essay echoing Nineteen\nCBS News on the hour sponsored by their works really\nMind ...

so a little bit of back story I'm sixteen and I worked all summer to you know to try to buy a car but I've always wanted to be paying in a you know all cash\nAnd I wanted to ask if I should be slapped for having such a dumb idea to spend every penny or any of God or I should say that for something else or uh put it may be in a raw\nI just want to know you know where we're where should go with this\nHow much money are we talking about um about Fifteen or sixteen thousand\nGood for you very well done it's a very nice car for sixteen years old\nYeah um I've I've worked a lot you know I don't think should be on like a day ... she's a year and I don't think I've got like a day and like three or four years about just thinking about it and how great it would be but\nSo what's the dream car\n[noise] I'd say a BMW and three forty six one so\nThen how you're going to maintain the puppy because your maintenance on that's pretty serious\nBut yeah a continuing to work you know what I hear from other owners is that costs about on average Fifteen hundred to two thousand I'm a year to just keep it in good shape and maintain it\n... ... and the you know I'm an army thankful that my job right now\nI'm can pay me enough to to you know continue to fund mhm Mm\n[noise] um well you picked out a very cool car no question about on way career for sixteen years old no question to be a lot of automobile it really is a it typically is going to be a car though by someone who has a um a really really good income and the Fifteen hundred dollars\nTo keep it running every year is a minor part of their world instead of like a hundred percent of your income you know it's a Fifteen ... is a big part of your world a year it's not a hundred percent of your income but I mean it's a big part of your world is sixteen years old and a you know I'm more concerned about that owned going maintenance cost of this thing that I Am an actual purchase\n[noise] um well I I I did the math and I make about [noise] uh you know Eighteen thousand a year and now that really doesn't change it they say\nDoesn't change and I mean a Fifteen hundred dollar maintenance fee for you know to keep a car running and that's if everything goes pretty good you can drop five grand and it pretty quick I'm a beamer and again the car you're talking about so I used to a car it's I Wonder from Laura in my car guy again\nFifteen dollars on car and you worked and saved up Fifteen thousand dollars and you do it I you know I might say well might spend ten and keep vibe in the bank that kind of runs through my head but uh but aside from that that doesn't bother me near as much as you're signing up\nFor a problem child\nAs far as making a Scottish I mean that's what you're signing up for that bothers me so as long as you know what you're getting into and you're willing to take it on a but you may look up one day and go I Wish I had known this car and which time you sell the car\nLast year remain thirty five of them are dead breaks down to twenty five and car ten in student loan and Fifteen and credit card and I'm just not sure where to go [laughter]\nOkay and um [noise] show or what do you make\n[noise] right now I Am not working I recently moved back with family\nSo you're separated [noise] okay\nAnd family is in Los Angeles yeah okay [noise] and um do you have children now\nSo I'm I'm guessing based on that separation that the divorce rate is going ahead or not\nSay it will be okay right well\nWhether you agree on filing for bankruptcy or not is irrelevant um he decides what he's going to do when you decide what you're going to do if you're not married\nAnd even if you are married technically because you don't file bankruptcy as a married couple um in other words when I filed I could have filed and Sharon not filed accepted shoot sons from the papers or she got the file to [noise] but um and we had to follow them all the different corporations now also use that we had at the time\nSo on in this case he could file and you not file\nThat's possible whose whose name is the student loan and nine okay so that doesn't affect him anymore that's your during one either way whose name of the credit cards and\nWelcome back evenly are all our you're both on all of them were both on okay were he to file and you not to file you would be left last man standing and get to pay them\nOkay okay that's how that would work whose name was the car in there who's got the car\nThey're two different cars and we're both on him and he has one and I gather\nOh it's so twenty five is cars and waste the breakdown of the twenty five break it out for me\nAh sixteen and can you know ... OK\nOkay the rule on I an asset that has\nUm\nThat has a lien against it is this you cannot get rid of the debt and keep the asset\nOkay so you could you could or he could file bankruptcy and you can clear off the credit card debt student loan debt is not bankrupt double it's not going away you've got your student loan back that's done okay the cars then you cannot keep the car unless you keep the debt\nYou can ... from the debt okay you've found on me but that's the only way you keep the car and so sometimes people don't understand bankruptcy and they think oh I can just get rid of the debt in ... in the ... the debt off and they give me the car free and clear no that's not how it works is why they would lean on the car\nOkay so they either get the car and wipe off whatever difference there is or is a um\nA ... or in the event of a bankruptcy you resign for the whole debt and you keep the guard show which of the cars is yours the Fifteen of the ten\nFifteen okay and what does that car worse do you have an idea [noise] I'd say about Penn okay All right\nAnd so you've got the ten thousand dollars in student loan debt you're going to get that either way no matter what happens here the Fifteen thousand dollars in credit card debt you understand if he files and you don't you've got that\nAnd then you got the other car now in the event of a divorce what I Would demand is that if he's going to keep a car that he refinancing and get your name off of it\n[noise] or if he's filing bankruptcy um I guess he turns it in in the bankruptcy or gives it to you to sell or whatever the car the he's driving is it worth at least watch out on it\nAnd say about that okay so you could just sell that car and break even but I'm a you know if you can work that out in this deal so this is a mess is what it is and you already knew that okay so the scenarios are\nThat um you know what will you be making what kind of an income do you think you'll land into\nUm I'm a veterinarian and so I Would say about Thirteen an hour and working fulltime\nAre you a D. V. M no oh no I'm a ...\nYear attack okay\nAll right and so I'm In that's in the Los Angeles area or you're going to ask them where else okay All right so you're going to land on that and then you're going to clean up your student loan debt and the credit card debt and the card that if he walks on all of it\nOkay now if he chooses not to file and fight through it than the two of you got to work through this together and you're going to be [noise] what does he make\nMade about ah twenty five\nOkay be coming out of the military\nScale and he's here in the military\nYeah you'll have no security clearance you understand that he understands and I'm sure you file bankruptcy or security clearance has gone\nSo I mean his chances are moving up in the\nMilitary are are are harmed pretty dramatically if he falls or bankruptcy but he didn't make any money should be and and you just came home all of a deployment and he's lost his mind and I was like oh my goodness yeah\n[laughter] I'm so sorry and care\nAnd I just trying to start over and it's not going to be as easy for him as he wants it to be how old is he\nGoing to heaven yeah yeah\nOkay well um I I think you sit down with your pastor and if you need to talk to a bankruptcy attorney to understand the things I'm Talking about that's fine um\nI I think if he files and you don't you've got to force him\nA to sell the car that is in his name and probably we're going to say oh yours too okay I'm In and get you get you a five thousand dollar loan for the difference and then you work your way out of the credit card debt the little bit of a car loan driving a beat her and the student loan debt is going to take you a little while with your income\nBut you can do that it doesn't mean you have to file just because he files mathematically or legally\nOkay this is just making sense to you here\nSo I'm Sorry your face and all this what a mess listen if you get in the middle of and you're going to the question you call me back I'll help you okay\nThank you\nThank you Chris is with us in Minneapolis Hi Chris how are you\nThere Dave how are you better than I deserve what's up with a question about life insurance\nOr I'm

I'd run into oh I Know it's an ... in one one of the things I just I just want to\nI kind of one of them and throw it away and\nI'm One of the things we've been looking to be a Christian health share ministries and I think for a while you guys might have been here in the door and one for a while I Can't remember but we have any ways we're we've got some other families in our class there you know single income just paying thousand dollars a month for\nFor health insurance but yeah and you know we can do a family on the health care mysteries for like for your mind about ...\nI just I wanted to get your cake and the you know something actually in baby steps to you know where\nMy wife and I talked about it were a little more comfortable you know when we have a fully funded emergency fired by now I don't know we're just trying to navigate that and I want to get your take\nOn the uh we do indoors a Christian healthcare ministries is one of our ah sponsors for the live events and for some of the things over the years I'm full disclosure I have a group health care plan at our company here\nThis Blue Cross Blue Shield that is my personal healthcare\nSo on and I'm real careful on the show is you know or even through financial ... not recommend to people to do something I don't do\nThat kind of a thing but I'm In a little different situation I've got a decent program a available to me um and show a Christian healthcare ministries um the the\nYou know the bottom line was the thing is it's technically not insurance as you know it it all sharing and it is based on the book of acts we're Christians band together and share each other's burdens or innocence becomes cooperatives then there's what it's doing\n'em and uh the the\nYou know I Would never suggest going into something like that that did not have a long or even the possibility of going into something like that that did not have a long track record and these guys have thirty forty years of having never missed a single claim\nYou have to read and you should read very carefully to what it covers and what it does not cover\nAnd know that and they've got a couple of plans you can buy the upgrade plan that covers different things and that kind of a thing\nFamily plan their singles plan all that they've got a normal you know an array of products so to speak to learn what's covered in what is not covered learn how it works because it is technically not insurance you're technically if someone else in the program chose not to share\nThen war would you be you know technically but they've never failed to make a claim show it's worked for forty years you know I mean whatever number of years but decades rise so uncomfortable with its credibility in that regard it is different than insurance and we get our brains get dolled into how health insurance works and this has got some nuances\nA number one number to know that I don't personally do it even though I Do believe in it\nNumber three in the only way I Do it as if they had a long long long track record which these guys do and it is a Christian healthcare ministries and so a ... and the ... their definition of that is is that if you use tobacco or ... or alcohol then you don't qualify\nAnd so there are a hardcore in that regard um and so you need to you know be aware that that's there and that's a limiting factor as well and they you know they want you to affirm your face as part of the process you're Christian faith\nAs a part of the process and so that's what it was four and a house laid out but all of that and once you know all those nuances and you know those differences and you can see them um we would not have endorsed that if we didn't think it had credibility\nRight and that ... and and I guess if I could ask one follow up question we were to go through that doing in baby steps to and all that kind of stuff one of the things that my wife with a little concerned about\nOne of the ones we're looking to the as the long term track record and and we're OK with all the requirement for you know we're we're evangelical Christians and all that kind of stuff and we're and we're normally pretty healthy it seems like it'd be good for our family\nBut like one of 'em you know you pay out of pocket kind of like when he could have ... and stuff so if you're a baby that you would you recommend it when you go that route\nTo set aside that they had a dollar to insulate you against our\nAre now you've got to remember to you've already got a thousand and baby sit around and so you're close enough and if you run up over just budget your other five hundred into your budget slow\nOr you might have to slow down your debt snowball a little bit in baby steps who covers some bills if you add an event right or it's just like carrying largest adoptable as you said in a nature or something I'm but I'm going to take that part of the risk gone for sure\nAnd I'm so forth but but you know Christian healthcare ministries is the one that we endorse hey man thanks for the call April's weather's April's in New York City Hi April how are you\nHaving a hard day thanks for taking my call sure what's up\n[noise] so I didn't know whether or not um my husband and I should move 'em in order to get out of that [noise] um we don't like our house okay um\nSo and we were out of debt you might be moving anyway\nRight okay absolutely um the balance on their mortgage a two hundred and fifty five thousand dollars I'm now you what's the value [noise] about four hundred and eighty thousand okay All right and\nYou know our debt other than the market is about eighty thousand dollars\nMhm mhm [noise] um but I mean they can trust K. K. to move and in order to get out of that\nWell I mean if you do it and put a hundred and twenty thousand dollars down at the next place could you afford to make that happen\nYes okay 'cause that would make you dead free and put then you're not you should I have about a hundred and twenty leftover expenses and everything\nAnd eighty ... eighty of data paid off right right so um [noise] um yeah that that seems to make sense if you want to move anyway I Do want to move to Atlanta now you're going to move up and house equal house just different area or down and had\nTo have a little bit up in the house mhm so the um the mortgage would be even looking mortgage it'd be higher ... but\nOn a fifty next drag on a Fifteen year figure right yeah and your payment to be no more than a fourth of your take home pay to have you can do all of that and you get out of a house you don't like into a house you do like there's no downside to this move\nThe ... house and everything long term so we've

like athletes do\nWe we we work out during the summer we have to go to a certain amount of camps we have to go to a certain amount of clinics we have to do certain amount of film study if you want to move up in the officiating\nYou have to get things right and you know when you get to that level when you come on and LSU Mississippi State game you want to move up you want to call and if you've seen championship game you want to call a bowl\nIt seems like we missed the call or are you like you're trying to be one Saturday or another you're not moving up\nAs a movement out right as a matter of fact ah\nThey take games from you if you don't do your job and when the games are over ... you are correct key on every single play\nDuring that game and then as an official yourself because you have pride in yourself you should you go back and you watched that game yourself to see where you could have been better at show to sit there and just take a\nWhat these officials go to in the study they go through in the work they go through any symptoms of them personally so I just like to stand up for the officials and let everybody know what they really go through and they're not thrown out there on the field to make a call that might affect the gang two weeks from now thank you Paul\nThank you very much Brian in Miami on the air go right ahead\nMr Bond bumped thank you for taking my call thank you grew up and\nI just wanted to so it's only a targeting the you know from the LSU game I Know you've had a couple of calls about this week but uh yeah me thinking about the game at the next level you know the NFL that body weight rule they've got and\nSeems like guys really don't know how to proceed with the the sec or whatever ... days and so would that being said do you say that trickling down into college football maybe a and also if you're a college coach Mike how do you develop your players if what you're teaching them if you have to go the next level was wrong apparently\nWell listen it if you're a college coach Brian you you know exactly what the rules are you bring officials and you bring people into a help you understand and then you disseminate that to

year old and for some time talking my call and all all\n... all national clashed in Ghana you may hey how good is one of the day I ain't got lost and this year wall to wall or\nAre they Missouri is a very difficult team\nA and I uh\nI respect them or that they had a punishing law that South Carolina which I think really hurt them they've also played Florida or they played Georgia and Alabama which will or rearrange your rearrange your face and he takes a week or thanks for the call will come back to that question in a minute ah right now\n... express it already is David Pollock always great to catch up with him David good afternoon thanks so much for being with us you are you know you always see headlines on shorter and you go what what's what's the guy really talking about and I think you may know where I'm going there was a pick up a something you said yesterday\nThat Clemson as a better chance of getting to the playoff than Alabama and before anyone reacts to that like you to at least explain\n[laughter] you know it's not like to be taken in that context ... we never met before um yeah we had to pick between the two of those that we felt like at the best chance and listen I had with her you know being now having surgery and to have an an e like you ... have a problem\nThe level and you got to look at Clinton's rest of the schedule and Alabama's rest of the schedule Alabama's obviously is a a lot harder they got to play in LSU obviously it's a tough place to play the anti these champion which is going to be pretty good this year again so I'm you know their road to the to being undefeated to me as a as a heck of a lot harder than Clinton\nBack Alabama though and you raised some really salient points a quarterback play has been brilliant but there are some reasons to be a an easy especially was hurt so what you've seen so far versus what do you think we'll see especially good sellers shoo how does it change moving forward\nWell here's the thing with ... when you have it off and now this is this isn't the old school often that you're used to say this isn't Arpaio often just as the maximizing what do you know to work and do he's obviously sensational and I think\nYou're too is the best pocket passer and college football he can sit in the pocket and picking apart\nThe reason to is the best player in college football and definitely the best quarterback is because to also take those off scripted place when everything's covered and now the scrambles and to his right and then comes back to his lesson throws in the end zone to Judy and you're like how the heck did he just do that if you start taking those plays\nOut of the mix obviously you know that's a huge deal for for Alabama that'd be a huge deal for anybody in the country so I\nI'm more concerned with to his injuries in jail jail and had surgery Jay Lynn is the backup quarterback that it's going to get some time but\nBut not much Jay Leno I I I don't think Jay Lynn is um you know he's not replaceable he's irreplaceable excuse me ... obviously to or you can't replace that guy with anybody in college football so you definitely have at least\n... guy Paul at least we got something to talk about with Alabama shooting there just\nCurbed style but everybody that they play so it's actually something worth debating that might actually make them look somewhat human\nKnow a great point let's talk about a game that ah I don't think we'll see a curb stopping we have in the past but that's the Florida Georgia game uh we've talked to various people about the importance of this game and and I know to you or in any person who played in like you did a it's extremely special what makes it so different\n... we went to the state fair a couple of weeks ago for game day and it's just so you need to go into a stadium and so strange to see\nHalf one team half the other and as a player it was strange because you're there in Florida at this site and half red and black half orange and blue and you know the officers on the field for both sides and there cheering for both sides it's just\nIt's so strange but I mean I'll just tell you this when I grew up and when I was getting recruit us getting recruited by states for her to go to the University of Florida and\nCeasefire hated Georgia and he made it known he took jabs and shop in random score up every chance he had an opportunity to do it in the south Carolina and try to do the same thing obviously\nUm to this rivalry is definitely always meant something or to bull fan bases to players I can just tell you when I played at the University of Georgia this was number one not number two not number three not counted debatable between so and so this was the game every year all the fans pointing to I pointed to that I got to get this when because it means a little bit more\nYeah we uh apparently have some video of the your greatest hits a highlight film from back then and you could pick out any game for David Pollock but uh I think we're showing where are where are you on the field you mean you're just pushing the guy around on\n... [laughter] I got ... got a good one then 'cause Florida has some good officer lungs are we a\nWith Paul Paul does it have the worst play in college football history the worst officiated place ... gross and\nDrops back in the past fall they felt like ten screen passes on this on this drive there on the five yard line going in and I knew was another screen I can feel it I literally backup from defensive and I'd jump off I catch it one handed left handed\nSnack the ball pulled into my body make mention of this place on the defensive lineman made three\nIt's what's doesn't happen very often literally ran out of oxygen positive out the die on the field I was so tired I turn hand the ball off to Shawn Jones at the fifty yard line he runs it for a touchdown all the way back\nThe rats called a forward lateral oh like\nThe worst call in and see that history that I've ever seen it in a million years no doubt about it\nCouldn't stand that it was a call 'em but they know is that replay back then so it really didn't matter cutting overturned it we lost the game Thirteen to fix the only last of the season for us was that game otherwise we could apply for a national title but I'm not bitter Paul at all I'm not at least ... better\nI detected a speaking of the LSU fans may claim that the recall on Devon Whitey other day was was of equal let me get your thoughts on that as a defensive player what did you see when the ref so targeting them\nHorrible ... it's it's a bad call I Wish we had some kind of protocol that we can put in place to take some take take a step back and where you can say literally look at that playing go is that really suspension worthy I mean we got to find the difference between\nTargeting with players safety and intent to hurt somebody and somebody that literally has contacted the face or to the face of the upper ahead with ... with hands and that I thought the hands hit first I didn't think it was violent at all I Am not alone I think everybody thought that was a horrible call and now you just took took away LSU best chance to stop\nYou know Alabama so now it could be\nTwenty one and nothing it's a half before Devon why do you think it's in the game next week and that's just a huge blow\nSo if your if your game planning on the other side and I think you've you've alluded to your answer already uh do you do you are you more aggressive and the first half knowing he's not out there and it's so it's pretty easy to answer\n... here's the thing was Alabama when you watch Alabama's opponents they're scared to death on them and they're scared to death of the speed on the outside because there is so many guys that can beat you here's the thing\nLSU won't be scared greedy Williams will be up and press coverage he will be up on press coverage on duty and those easy throw those plants that are going eighty right now those are going to have to be over the top throws down the field which to me so I think LSU great game plan is already to be um exceptionally aggressive\nThis sounds really crazy but we're at the point now talking about Alabama\nWhere I'm content with him running the football if I'm doing Arpaio's I'm staying back they're gonna run our feels like they continue to I'm going to play back I'm going to make them hand the ball I Know that sounds crazy because they've been a team that painted all four years and years and years and really didn't want to throw\nThe Alabama from yesteryear this is Alabama was too and it's a different animal and you've got to kind of pick your poison\nTalking to David taller and before you go with me and we talk about the national playoffs we started talking about there was Clemson and obviously this weekend with Florida Georgia will help frame that conversation as you as you look at this game uh where do you see the edge you know\nFifteen Percent chance those are the exact four teams I in any order\nBut really a lot can happen I think the interesting thing now I'm going to be looking for next week is is how the committee handles ranking does one last teams because you could go a lot of different ways they are and I think it's very close between some of those teams\nTalking to sell the ... and ... certainly\nOne of the narratives before the season because of away last season ended was SEC getting to schools after Georgia last we started saying well maybe not because they had lost ... lost Florida last well what now it seems like ah maybe Ohio State getting beaten has improved the SEC chances\nAbsolutely no question about it the SEC now is back over one in three chance to put two teams in the playoff Ohio State losing was a big part of that I think the thing that the as he has as he has going for is that there's multiple ways you can make this happen probably the best chance would be if\nAlabama is undefeated entering yet to see championship game and loses to one last Georgia we would put that in a round of reinforced shot that both those teams would get in if that's the situation but there are other ways that could happen you could replace Florida\nWith your vices order with Florida in that situation you can also look at what if you beat the Alabama\nAnd then the Crimson Tide end up uh Lebanon one and then it's either Georgia and Alabama or LSU in Alabama\nBoth getting in those are a little bit less likely you need other things to happen but those are all different ways that it could happen I'll say this though the one thing the FCC definitely need each and every week it's a root against Notre Dame every time Notre Dame wins makes it less and less likely the SEC can put two teams and\nBy the way that will not be difficult for us he says [laughter] I wouldn't think so\nUh you mentioned Alabama in LA shoes that will be next week story but it's kind of hard to to to miss the opportunity to talk a little bit about that after which you just got through saying give us the scenario that game and in the obvious impacted as on the playoff\nHere's the thing that I think it's just really speaks volumes about Alabama is the situation and saying if we say today that Alabama is going to lose to LSU Crimson Tide would have a sixteen percent chance to make the playoffs still\nIt's just a matter of being far and away the best team and so you come away you know thinking about the committee's charter even though they don't always following looking for the for best teams\nAlabama basically always have that going for them there's not really a lot you can imagine where people would think well this isn't the best team in the country and so Alabama's got a great chance to get in even if it's eleven and wanted to twelve\nReally good spot [laughter]\nHi I'm sure the rest of the country should know this cannot be true or even without an FCC title again that would be the third time as seeming all this happens that Alabama love played for a title without an FCC championship under its bill\nI I Know it sounds crazy but just think about what they've done this cheese and what they've shown the way that they not only one you think blown teams out you know we're waiting on to it I have to play a full game and\nBut you know what people are saying they haven't bitten anyone really good [noise]\nYeah that's it's true that their strength of schedule is something that's going to be a topic of conversation if they don't go on to feed it but I don't think that we are talking about uh some ... ... it's just the way that they have beaten teams is going to be the thing\nThat is going to help them it's true I I I I understand that but it's not like the other the middling teams in the FCC are packed twelve teams and also\nThat the the quality of the team the quality of the the the actual team we would the FBI with most people would say I test that unquestionable for Alabama that they are the best team in the country\nDoes Notre Dame have a path was a loss\nI yeah I think they do I think they do but it's not it's not a guarantee they can get into Lebanon one because I\nThink I think that the committee will say that a team that didn't win it's conference is going to be a little bit worse than a team like Notre Dame who doesn't have the opportunity to win a conference\nIt's not a lock you you have to avoid situations where there's for one last power five champions if you're Notre Dame in that situation but I Do think that there's a pretty good shot that they would get in over a let's say you know a two loss Oklahoma or Texas team I think one last Notre Dame team will have the edge on that\nShow let's say we get into a lot of one losses big twelve versus Big Ten ... how do you how do you measure that\nI think if it's the Big Ten they probably had the edge here we give them a better chance to put a team in the playoffs and I think especially if you're looking at Michigan the thing with Michigan is that they just had such a tough schedule that they will be able to point to that and say hey\nOnly won last with that schedule you gotta put us in and I think that the committee would really consider\nMichigan schedule or how you doing that I Do think that Oklahoma just because of the ice has probably being a little bit better than the other big twelve teams that if you're in the big twelve you're probably best bet is to have Oklahoma be the champion but I Do think that the Big Ten is probably a little bit ahead in the pecking order right now\nBut as she was pretty much every week but we just had my ... who lives in Orlando who carries the baton and the and the and the the banner for you see if they don't have any chance to they\nThey do not Paul I mean I wouldn't plan for their opinion on this has not changed I really don't think it's going to change\nUCF thinks it's extraordinarily unlikely that they can in the playoff here's the key thing about UCF they didn't get in last year undefeated and they have an easier schedule this year I mean if you if it wasn't going to happen then\nHow can you do it now when they were actually would have had an easier road to went to a twelve and they'll record\nCan you give me a favor can you can you figure out a way to program the computer to tell you see a fence to\nShut up [laughter] ah that's a tricky one I hear from them all the time [laughter]\nGood luck to you thanks of traits computer talks and some do will take a break more to come\nBy five to

is up next to good afternoon Brendan [noise]\nYeah I'm here can you hear me better yeah go right ahead\nI was from a few things I Want to talk about you had a caller a it's been about an hour or so back but I've been trying to get in and he made some comments about Alabama in their quadrupled penalties versus other teams and things of that nature and then you had\nCarve along yesterday and I just thought that was the spies some of the things that he said and now if it's All right with you I Want to clear my throat or some other go right ahead All right so he could go back over the last four years with the induction let's say in him and Missouri\nAlabama does not fall in the least penalize teams in the Southeastern Conference there's actually for five more from what I read on Saturdays down south\nWhere there are actually put a lot less than Alabama and then when you go into this year's element was already been alive for fifty times for almost five hundred yards\nSo it's not penalties it's not the gets elected nod that's garbage and then if you go into work horrible said\nComparing that to the assassination thing I don't care if it makes for good radio or not he was a complete and get my ass he's an ass hat and that was very disrespectful and it was maybe professional any shape or form or fashion when it comes down to football you gotta have talent and you've gotta have coaching\nAnd if you're not getting recruits you're not going to be winning games even saving those at why do you think he cleans some house she brought in some bit of Rick where's the paradigm of college football and all that currently based off their number one recruiting classes that date back this is a narrow football that no one's ever but it's not based off collusion\nI'm based off of all is still a lot of them are give Alabama the nod\nFor everybody out there if you want to win games you've got to recruit and you've got to have a great coach and you've got to be just one just because they want not play\nNext man up but there's a problem LSU doesn't have as many recruits is Alabama so there's not an extent of fans who great match up but at the end of the day\nThere often is also terrible that's going to cost him in the long run why do you think Jeremy Pruitt said in an interview I promise you I'm going to recruit twenty five more players that will get the job done it's not about Alabama's privilege it's about Alabama's dominant so cut the crap everyone out\n... without band better have a good that Paul\nRecall really was a an interesting point you made thank you very very much Richard in Baton Rouge or on the air go right ahead\nDoing all we're doing well thanks a lot\nOf uh amazingly am I a call is about a Carville\nAnd uh basically the same line of the talk of the previous caller but I'm not a I'm not all in for Alabama like so many you know in the U.S is the network and beyond so I think that it's uh\nI think you know that and that could be the thing that you literally believe that they asked for the office\nIs is tantamount says uh comparing it to the Saudi Government is is a bit of a threat even you admit that part of the market for that I think that it is there is a very obvious\nUm will listen I don't think it it doesn't help that they went last year because I ... and look I don't know that at twelve people in the room with a Thirteen people in the room actually a are swayed by desk but I mean they're definitely see sort of the\n[noise] they can't help but hear some of the noise it probably doesn't help that they just went last year first of all let me let me walk them through this fall I don't think there's going to be a deal I don't think Alabama is losing in the regular season\nBut if it were to happen and if they were to lose their last year which gives ... she's a ... she was to run the table and and us Alabama didn't get to the SEC title game similar last year [noise]\nUm the the the real complicating factor would be\nWho are the other topics champions the reason that got in last year and they were clearly obviously good enough to get in and when it but the reason they got in the cars the conference champions they were being compared to or to last champions and so if it was a one last champion\nRegardless of what we would all maybe still think of Alabama although if you lose to LSU maybe that you know\nYou down a notch regardless of what we're all still think it's still going to come down to who are you comparing them too\nIt was pretty much a in Alabama Penn State beauty contests excuse me Ohio yeah you know not that I was reading a lot of state the committee never could get over that thirty one point loss to Iowa\nRight and and listen and they and they had to losses obviously they had the fifth point on last Oklahoma which was you know as it turned out not a bad line us but but I'm ... and and I'm short about the opinion that even with two law says\nPossible they get in over Alabama I'm not saying that would have been the right move but it's possible they would have gotten it over Alabama if it had been a six point second law said Iowa\nAnd then I I I I think the other part of that was that uh if Ohio State had blown out Wisconsin I still think they would have gotten into it was just a momentum went against him\nI don't disagree and listen after the fact after Alabama won yet another national title is hard to argue with the uh Rodney inclusion so but but look if it's you know let's say it's Alabama is a one last team last only to LSU dust didn't get to the SEC title game again this year\nAnd let's say it's twelve I'm Wondering how safe is to now they only have one loss but it was a twenty nine point loss at Purdue Ruben ...\nRight I mean it would be it would be an interesting deal because now it's only one last but it's still a big blow out so you still have part of the factors from last year\nBut they're not there to help your argument but I Will um they they would perhaps ever win over Michigan which would be one of the ... maybe one of the top four teams in the country\nYeah that's true I I mean I think in that case as much as we're sort of all down or to stay right now if they run the table and\nThey you know in in by doing that they're going to be to Michigan team that you're right might be a top four or five team at the time uh and and then potentially you might end up eating or do I mean I I look at Purdue and I think you might played them again\nThey might end up winning the west that 'cause they're playing really well despite the record but I think if they got that point we would we would look at that as a blip that twenty nine Fort law so I think the thing that worries me about Ohio State is I'm not sure it's a blip and I'm not sure that what they're capable of the rest of the way\nTo think that they can end up as the Big Ten champion might be of stretching a room education uh I I Do want to ask you about the big twelve because you live out there and it's not that matters but you'd probably see and hear more than we do a A R we ... we for getting this conference\nYeah well listen I Do think that um if Oklahoma roles and their defense looks a little bit better um then you'll start to hear more about them\nI think that'll be good at that point we'll be overlooked in Texas um\nBut it's possible that those two teams are headed for a collision course if they can both went out um and he might get to see them play again at which point the taxes that beats in Oklahoma twice a ... an Oklahoma team that we all agree is pretty strong that'd be a really strong contender\nFor in Oklahoma team that has overcome its one last buyer kind of a racing it you know canceling it out by beating taxes the second time around that'd be a pretty strong contender too\nUm so yeah I Do think we you know this is the deal and whether it's this week or whether it's next week and we're talking about the first committee rankings\nIt doesn't really matter there's they're still you know four or five games for each these contenders play I Do think both of those teams are contenders I'm not a big\nI'm not a I don't really think West Virginia even though they have the record right now is one but I think Texas and Oklahoma are both teams that you have to look at right now I think down the stretch they could be teams that would factor into this\nLet me let me close with the SEC showdown this week because we we we we just can't stop talking about Alabama in LA issue but Florida in ... in Georgia is the most intriguing game of the weekend and certainly the most intriguing Florida Georgia game and in most of our ... recent memory\nFirst of all it's it's an interesting game because on the one hand and all that has Florida play better than we thought they would in a better position than we thought he would have them this early and on the other hand the last time we saw George do they they kinda got smoked off the field in Baton Rouge and so\nWe sort of had to reassess at least for the moment what we think of the old dogs and so you know one one seems a little higher than we thought that seems a little lower than we thought and\nIt's clearly a physical physical game obviously just looking at the numbers in the SEC I don't really know what I think about either team frankly I'm\n... I I mean I guess if you press yeah say I think Georgia wins and probably use the team that winds up when the east just like we were going in but you know I was at that game of bad route and\nYou know as you look good but Georgia's just didn't look like kind of what I expected out of them but I think maybe we over rated them through the first part of she's a little bit based on last year and and they actually had a lot more to sort of um replace than maybe we get credit for\nYour shorter always ready to catch up with him from USA Today George we will see you soon thanks for coming by thanks\nFor having me great stuff as always a bartender ivy at the top of the next hour and more of your safety and calls when we can\nPay off credit card debt with a person alone from Marcus by Goldman Sachs life can add up quickly like when your youngest into braces the same week as your oldest tuition was\nAnd then he got hit with a vet bill for the real maybe on the family that happens it's how you get out and count the personal loan from Marcus by Goldman Sachs fixed interest rates monthly payment options you know these\nBurned more Marcus dot com boom here for the southeast leader for brains and equipment rental crane ones\nAre steaming national Framingham immobile is ready to make your next construction or maintenance project have big success frameworks at all for your next lift machinery moving more reading project and don't forget rental works as a whole line of rental equipment jobs most big and small and now offering qualified operators for all equipment including aerial in earth moving equipment\nTo eight seven seven to eight to left for a visit them on the Web at ... dot com\nYou have on this Thanksgiving and Christmas celebrations to your team can spend some quality time together for more than a lot of power lacking the conference room I think get anyone out in the op ed in SCAD re more in your team with the holiday outing somewhere they can really enjoy themselves the retreat at center he'll make\nAre still available for Thanksgiving and Christmas Holiday events they're charming and spacious indoor banquet facilities are big enough\nFor most any size function nestled in the beautiful scenery on the shores of center hill lake gate during his will be a little for larger groups as you plan your company holiday party leisure to check on her ... retreated center Hewlett give nearby and convenient\nAnd three fifty a relaxed drive in ten minutes east Smithfield to six miles from my forte call today and ask about holiday party rates more make reservations now six one five\nBy nine seven forty two Ninety eight six one five five nine seven forty two Ninety eight do\nSee retreated center hill leg Don\nDown get me started on how great file as he said in a warm days Danny reasons and what leads on the ground and about a million things to make me sneeze\nFrankly you know some thing on her by the garage that sounds like what animal that about ... if he remains aggravate\nMy allergies sometimes the over the counter somehow but never in my eyes you can read science is wrong tap running and I'll wind up with a third Salah ad that turned into a car before you know and I'd be sidelined if it weren't for highlands house care\nThis time of year to fall allergies are a problem for you you can depend on islands healthcare and physician's assistant Kimberly Logan to help you keep them under control [noise] three Fifteen north Washington avenue sweet one Seventy five\nViolence healthcare is a primary care provider was pediatric care urgent care BA services and they can even help with your seasonal allergies the highlands healthcare T.

phone lines your thoughts on what I just said it's going to be Scott Minnesota Scott what's going on\nThere Joe thanks for having a word low on you're betting do a defeat Ellison here I agree with what people need to understand about Minnesota's tale of two cities are born and raised here almost sixty years then I come from a long family of union Democrats\nAnd they still think the Democratic party represents them so there's ... in state or a what I call out stayed in Minneapolis faction\nThen they still have the old state section I'm voting like they would have voted Nineteen fifty six so that that that's how you get an El Al is on the tickets\nYeah but that's weird I mean it has been very open about his hatred for Israelis relationship with federal gun and now these accusations from these women we will give you a Democrat or Republican you can't you can't be somebody unless you're a far left looters well you can't want somebody to be your top law enforcement officer who has beliefs like this\nThey don't even pay attention to that Joe it's hunting and fishing season that and that's what they're after that they live in ... and they live and dilute to live than than the four corners of the state and and you know corn prices are more important than what's happening in Minneapolis\nBut what do you think it's going to happen on election day because of the early voting starts now some people are already voting for more low but what's gonna happen election day\nThat it it uh [laughter] well I'm a hold on hold for the more I talked to people um you know in my family and friends that live don't live in the in the twin cities area um or they'll just say this I'm hopeful um but we you know we need to wake up\nBecause the state looks nothing like it did is in Twenty years ago\nI got your brother appreciative you insight open line now at eight eight nine four one passage editing nine for one Seventy two four seven or by the way I'm just wondering if listeners reviewers agree with me that I'm being a nationalist or believing nationalism is a good thing in fact\nRonald Reagan after the the big four years of Jimmy Carter what a horrible for years that was Ronald Reagan restored nationalism and that was widely seen as a great thing you see nationalism today just thirty some odd years later and suddenly it's a horrible thing that's weird to me\nVery

bringing them are on thin [laughter] that'd be a bit of work for all our we miss All right what's going on man I appreciate that day and talk to me\nScott so a little bit of light founder but I I just got to say that a lot of people in Minnesota they just they don't care it's Democrat or Republican I on my team or not\nAnd I as I told the screener my my biggest thing is and Keith Ellison and sell it says how Amy call but char\nGets away with voting against cabinet or has less treatment of women and same with peanuts and neither one of 'em are asked a single thing about Ellis and or anybody else for that matter\nIs global shore openly backing Ellison it 'cause I don't live in Minnesota so I don't see it is she openly backing his candidacy 'cause that would be ridiculous you\nKnow since since getting away with just not making any comment whatsoever\nAnd nobody knew they were asking ...\n... no ... nobody and the meaning that will bring it up and bring it up with Alice and yeah they they'll ask a question that Allison ... and and that's okay that's settled we've heard from Keith Ellison now it's called and they just don't\nAsk or approach it ever again\nFor NASA was I don't know nationalism is a good thing of course it is I mean do you love your country\nAlways been a good thing and you know when you watch the banks appreciate it then when you watch the soccer competition I Know we keep going back to that but\nPretty much on message I think they were really hitting these that horn this morning and I'm trying to sell a book they figured that could kill me with the base but that's fine people that know me they know what I'm super loyal to the president to say listen I get fired Fifteen months ago if I wasn't loyal to the president's Joe you would have figured it out by now or I wrote a very colorful very funny book [noise]\nAbout my relationship with him do what do you like it like it as a guy what he's like behind the scenes and by the way that a lot of research on him and his father when they were a lot younger you know his father's deceased but I'm going to get back into the seventies when his dad was working with him and mentoring in\nWhat they were like so this is a real fun book to write a book called me yesterday or she said that she she went through the book she read it a hundred percent but Bush said\nIt was great each couldn't wait to show it to her father occurred what at one of his best friend said the same thing you know 'cause I I I Love the president I said that from the press box you know I got criticized for saying that I Love the president two or three times when I was given my press briefing\nLast too bad I'm a New Yorker I have to be an Italian I like to use the word love Joe and Joe ... guy we want me to do\nIt and again I'm from New York I'm an Italian ... record short for pat and we will so why are we we we we enjoy I get more you where you're coming from just like Anthony I gotta tell ya my mother's from Jamaica, Queens so as the president of these people are fighters who come from Jamaica, Queens and I don't know that that the rest of American certainly not the elite\nMedia in America they don't understand that do they\nKnow they don't understand it they get sent it there's micro aggressions Reagan president is that your doubt that the left wants your brain disconnected from your mouth you know you get up and emotion feeling you could ever politic\nTotally sanitizing edited and God Forbid you should say something that they are offended by right there is a tiny bit of a micro aggressions they started sending bottle rockets off the president place than like a Stradivarius that he does\nA ... and that's how people from queens or from my area in your area talk and I don't mean anything by it I'm sure that's my personality\nI agree it's embodies their and moved to the blue collar President Bill blue color president it's out now going up his great book let's go back to the media stuff because again you were there when he did The Apprentice he made tens of millions of dollars for NBC now NBC turned itself on him him almost immediately when he says he's running for president more surprised I've talked to him seven different times he he was actually\nNot surprised they turned on him but he was surprised by how dirty and how nasty they got were you\nYeah I think he's been blown away I mean I I there was a scene in my book where I'm Talking about us in the oval office and he looks at me so she you know I had a forty five you're great relationship with the media will do and what happened I said there was a combination of things they don't they don't like your some of your policies\nAnd you know we we let Steve Bannon declare war on the media you know that they're trying to take it out on you\nThat I and and it took them a second but he realized what was going on so he kept on going out and I think you're right\nHe purposely like looks for a cost to now and tries to tell me your fake news but I don't understand it and then he turned and Acosta eats it up he does it every time you make a fool of themselves when you were dealing with the media and again give him a job for eleven days but again I thought that it was really really good pick up a time I understand what happened but um when you were in the job did you think that the media would work with you\nDid you think that they wanted to actually get good information from the White House when the\nUh I thought I thought we were going to have a ... month I thought that would be some kind of a peace offering be gender what Adam ...\nAnd the press I turn the lights and cameras back on that first day Joe we announced era as a press secretary I did the first press conference and I told her that would be my last one I was going to focus on strategy and building the communications team and also wanted to put us in a service position if you go you can find it on the net my comments plan\nBut listen you know I'm

begging me effectively to do a profile story with him yeah trail me around and I'm like well I'm not the bad and I'm not their self promoting myself and run I use of expletives which I obviously regret\nShe loved that guy changed ran over to CNN with it right he waited he wrote this ridiculously ... you know exaggerated article and then he released tape you know four or five days later people and I'm like jeeze the taste sounds like to normal guys from queens talking to each other right why would you do that to the guy\nAnd the answer is well we want to the ambush in to see if we can get him out of the White House or a you know some people thought I Would have been very effective in helping the president so puts\nIt little I thought it looked if you went back and if I\nIf you went and checked up a pod cast after you were named I thought it was a good pick\nBecause I felt like you were a guy who wasn't gonna pull and he ... he's going to be very direct you to be very strict with the information and and you would say look if you want a relationship with the ministry Asian here's a way it's going to work but you're right I think that\nYou got suckered into a little bit and it doesn't feel good I've had that happened to me but you got you got pulled in because you're actually trust somebody something that guys like you wouldn't even want to do we want to trust people\nThe age Joe I made a mistake it uses vibrant place down there I didn't anticipate how bad it was a I told my Wall Street present Thirty years on Wall street now let me tell you something do worst person on Wall street is literally the best person down there so while\nI Know how bad it is down there and it is what it is and so for me uh a lot of my book is also about that ... that you know where I got it\nI'm from the all stay commercial coming through the car crash right and I told my kids watch what I Do with this thing now because you never want to do is be on your back for too long ago you don't want that left wing media to build a shame box for you to stand inside of\nYou want to be you and so I'm I'm fully expressing myself a lot of fun writing this book I Hope that people who go out

similarly\nI'm and I'm not sure damn I Hope not to hurt me for what happened\nHe seems to be a that kind of guy I right at the end of the guys like ... date bossy myself a date was environment Korea was fired I was fire I call this S P else were fired but loyal and so you know I I feel very good about the president\nOr is that the one of the toughest jobs in the world you I certainly didn't want to make it harder for them I was there to try and make it easier and by the way I'm here to help do I do a lot of media surrogacy for the campaign and I'm writing a lot of a bench warmer state by

months later and you're still world with the president ... was for Fifteen seconds and had a new book\nSo I really think that that you showed your loyalty and the fact that the fact that you could look at me look at my listeners and they look at look at my viewers and say I made a mistake\nI should have thought through that better and I really think I could have been an effective guy I agree with everything that you just said I think that's also\nGot on the mistakes you make in life you're going to tell my kids to be accountable I'm not blaming anybody I'm not playing the victim and one
