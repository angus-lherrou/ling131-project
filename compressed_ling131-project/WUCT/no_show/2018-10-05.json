movement\nHow is it there for me I don't think that it is are we going to need a break here we come back it's going to be that reproduce though he is of course from campus reform dot org it's a great website great young reporters were getting the job done with a legacy media kid to be more\nAnd are they really exposes Christine ... professor give it to [noise]\nAnd that's a that's a a practice known as dogs to many people watching don't understand what that means so she publicly on the street thousand word blog instead of responding to you directly as a journalist 'cause that's who you are\nI'm and she also she let people know who you are where you are her to get a hold of you at basically we're sticking to the left on you\nAbsolutely and I I think Eric Trump had a perfect response to it as a ... and a power player in this town he\nSaid look this isn't so much about you know a person issued isn't Democrats or Republicans is is a lady that inciting violence\nAmong sitting members of our Congress I think no matter if you're a liberal no matter if you're a socialist what have you I think you know condemn violence is something that we should all doing stand together and doing air Trump said it that he said look you know I'm a big Georgetown supporter but this clearly cross the line um many people are speaking out many people are frustrated and I do hope that Georgetown takes the correct actions\n... he's a great correspondent over from a ... or ... um this Christine ... professor of fair thing is is not so we're going to do with Twitter did in the second but I'm One would expect to Georgetown would say look\nShe's somebody who is in our employees were going to reassess because there is obviously something going on we don't support what you said we do it but they didn't say anything about what they actually said was and of course we were wrong they said well that was your private thoughts on her personal Twitter has nothing to do with us\nAbsolutely yeah that's exactly what she said and then also today a you know fresh off the news press if you will in to the newsroom campus reform you know we got wind of a student that basically came out and said look I was in her class and had to drop is due to the rapid political bias and her spouting off\nUm and yet Georgetown has yet to respond or you know to those specific allegations you know I I Believe this to be a complete abuse of power um you know we have a professor that is you know\nAnd be using her power and and saying you know you have to believe what I Believe I Believe is extremely uncalled for and we would think that at a top tier research style institutions like Georgetown\nWe wouldn't see some type of you know curtailing of this or or some type of you know making what is right here because they do pay so much in tuition right uh so so I find that to be extremely unfortunate for the students I Do attend university I Do what I did have a friend that attended Georgetown University and they were telling me\nThat they just want to stay away they just want to stay away and I I Do I Do I Do a you know myself after being attacked I'm you know and Abigail quite viciously or you know I I see it firsthand\n... it says that group or true so we're talking about Christine fair she's a professor at Georgetown University and I use the word professor loosely um of course exactly what Rick corresponded from campus reform Cuba's reform dot org go there every morning um\nYeah when recently Jack Dorsey went recently to Congress any claim that yes we lean left but we purposely or unbiased on the actual platform that isn't true I'm I'm shuttle banned all the time I I can tell when I Am because one person sees us you know tweet that I put out where I Know fifty nine thousand people would love to read it\nSo that's ... that's not true they have immunity from liability um does Facebooking does Twitter because they promised to be unbiased\nAnd they're not when it came to Christine fair she was verified I'm ... and nothing happened to her for the first twenty four forty eight hours than people like you and me and Eric Trump and others are started re tweeting and asking jak directly what are you doing\nAbout this this person who is actually saying I'm inciting violence kill these people feed their genitals to swine what are you doing about it so then they suspended her account but they let her back on very soon thereafter without diversification badge the mix has been good it again and now from what I can tell she's back up\nIs that really is that the long and short of a Twitter ... now you know on a short\nOf a Twitter a cancer and formed a stuff into Twitter actually told campus art form that they made an initial mistake on first suspending her on Twitter we haven't yet figured out why she was always a mistake\nOr we haven't exactly figured out why she was suspended the second time\nUm but in my opinion look this is clear incitement to violence I think it's quite hypocritical and it's almost a double standard that Twitter has found that to to unfortunate look\nA you know ideas you know if we're all about free speech let's make it their free speech let's not make it you know the type of pick and choose what what what we politically you know identify with I Twitter I think Twitter has a long road ahead of them out to correct these mistakes and I hope that they do\nI'm with you it's that reproduce or greater a correspondent over from campus reformed up or let's go to University of Texas at Austin just up the road from where I'm sitting right now where I guess the the young Republicans dared say support Kavanaugh confirmed Kavanaugh well how did the left students respond about\nWell they were simply having a peaceful protest a you know supporting that a judge Brett Kavanaugh I think\nYou know this would be a mere gathering of people and changing ideas but no the Latin yet again turns to violence which we think too often as a correspondent here in Washington DC you know I see people marching you know and and and protesting which is important but yet it turns out that violence the left is always trying to violent or attacking people an airport and I think\nI Know actually that a majority of the uh I'm Mitch McConnell said it perfectly said it perfectly on the world I think he said we are not going to stand down to this left this idea of you know violence and all cause that attacking people in restaurant runs at attacking people airport this\nEye on college campuses isn't exactly where this type of idea of attacking people of a violent protests as coming from\nAn anti ... and they weren't physically assaulting these these students I was watching the they were taking their science ripping them their work in front of them are sheltering them getting their faces screaming at them point to get them\nBack to not okay that's not the first amendment was made for the whole right do you know to protest and bring redress to the government doesn't have to do what you going to somebody on campus who was a a varying opinion from yours and shutting 'em down ... what it's about these campuses should be out front teaching that\nWas absolutely horrible you saw these left wing agitator is really really really good in the space of those ... supporters and and rip up their sized quake viciously and uh you know I I was just shocked as I watch the video to be quite honest because here we had these groups of students that were threatening or ideas and these ideas that\nAre commonplace the United states believe it or not you know people support Brett Kavanaugh people support the concerns or ideas that he believes and um you know it may not think that you know some some of these allegations but when it doesn't mean is that sexual assault isn't important but I think that there is this this misconstrued ID on college campuses\nFurther more college campuses due process what MS\nAnd college campuses in light of this back how long thing to profit what is that now that doesn't matter right and I think we see that not only on college campuses but\nWe didn't our country Russia and then throw it out the window\nOr or

in fact Arctic withdrawing from the Nineteen ... review amity anti meaning friendship where the regime would with regret hostile relationship since Nineteen Seventy nine\nUm if if you look John at a walk the icy day the international court of justice or the world court it's sometimes called I ordered the United states to do to actually company United States is perfectly willing to do and that's make exemptions to allow humanitarian trade with Iran I think what the administration really objects to do\nIs the very idea the ice sheet Jay has asserted jurisdiction in this issue because for the United states there's about national security and it's not really subject to the world courts jurisdiction\nAnd it's a matter of national sovereignty also are having them into the er and as you said America does give humanitarian exemptions and has always provided for it\nBut you know when they talk about the aircraft parts being coming on to disguise of of being humanitarian need when we know that the Iranians civilian aircraft are being employed in Syria\nAnd deployed carrying troops and doing other things so it is not a non military issue when they talk about the um ... certainly in the military equipment and we know the mullahs sell a lot of that medicine so so in fact the United states cases\nIs a lot stronger this this Nineteen fifty five treaty which nobody seemed to remember was there [noise] um ... ending it seems to be a justified moods\nWhere I think it is a justified smoke you know the the fact is and the irony here is that again the United states actually could interpret the world court's decision as a wind because what Iran had asked\nA world court to do is basically to declare all us sanctions to be somehow illegal\nUm into declared that the U.S had to comply with the Jaycee pie away but the court didn't do that it just takes you to provisional ruling\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt's a hundred dollars again

they're they're tricky position where they I think there are plenty for around fifty five dollars for their budgets fake don't can't domestically deal with\nPrices that are hundred or more because they're you know they had their own domestic prices for oil gas good commodities whatever start going up and the Russian economy is not doing very well uh inflation's up in an all those things so that you see some kind of\nSome small protest some some kind of\nSome some issues domestically for so I think there's a sweet spot for them or I Know it's kind of maybe ... it was like oh you know where it

sustainable\nUh is is a serious problem and I do think greater a greater sense that the United states is they're actively consulting with him behind the scenes rather than the sense I have\nThat the Trump Administration as is his kind of got their policy right now on auto pilot a in a way that I I think has a has given him too much running room to make the kinds of rookie mistakes that he's making\nIn certain both on the foreign policy front and the domestic front and I I just think he needs more active American helped uh to to get him\nOut of some of the situation before the Iranians can really exploited\nThe failure he was judged harshly for it does he have a plan to repair\n[noise] so he does have a plan he's now a rather than uh going uh onto the stock exchanges he wants to

there talking about it could be as much as five hundred\nThousand barrels a day which as we all know because of these looming Iranian sanctions markets are clearly quite quite nervous about whether the Saudis can can really cover the Iranian barrels that may be\nLost and if they were able to get this field with Kuwait back up and running it it would it would obviously be a major plot so clearly under a lot of pressure from President Trump anybody who reads that section of his speech at a young guy and the way he came down on OPEC like a ton of bricks\nI understand that the I think the Saudis are really feeling the pressure that they've got to meet the president demand on on on this issue in light of the Iranian sanctions question\nAnd oil at a hundred dollars does that affect anybody's

believe or to know that it was connected to the project itself but it does get one looking over the shoulder I mean what's interesting is Robert ...\nWho's this a PHD was don't always peer reviewed studies I'm actually did research um which demonstrated how Google could swing an election uh well you know one direction or the other\nUh by shifting millions of vote spy controlling the information they got the Washington Post ran a story on this and the next day he was blocked from Google\nYou actually could not access Google products at all I'm a similar thing happened to a doctor Jordan Peterson who we highlight in the film you say a\nPsychology professor at the University of Toronto uh\nHe was actually a blocked by Google or from accessing his Gmail accounts and his Google Calendar and his YouTube channel which you know has a millions of people that have downloaded his content so it does happen to people or more often than you think and it just demonstrates the power\nThat this company has to decide if their whim\nOr how they're going to control what you see and what you have access to\nBut they don't play favorites\nThe example you just gave our our particularly noteworthy I mean there's sort of thing I I understand happens all the time and and and what the point being that that I I I just don't see how they can with a straight face claimed that they don't do this\nYou know that well that's exactly right and and one of the research studies that up Stein did that is particularly interesting we'd go through this in the in the film\nA is during the twenty sixteen election uh you they actually enlisted volunteers around the country this was a a you know John a a blind way um but they basically enlisted volunteers and had them conduct searches um on both\nGoogle and bang as it related to the twenty sixteen election this was over five six month period and then they captured all the search results that people\nGot now some of these volunteers were in red states where some were blue states some of the Republicans were Democrats independents all kinds of genders you know all kinds of social economic status and what they found when they reviewed the result was that you know\nThings seem to be pretty balanced but Google and every single search position of the\nTop ten search results\nThis that results favored Hillary Clinton\nWhat they essentially did was they suppressed negative stories about Hillary Clinton and the feed and they pushed negative stories by Donald Trump in the same search results um and you know by his estimate this had a somewhat dramatic effect on the election now it didn't\nKill to results at the end of the day\nUm but ... contention is that Google was essentially\nSettling with the books and what's interesting about this is that science essentially political but he actually was a Hillary Clinton supporter in twenty sixteen oh and what he is concerned about of course it's not the political implications of this in terms of who wins and who loses\nBut his real concern is do we really want to have a company\nHaving so much control over the flow of information that ran undecided voters and you know there are a lot of undecided voters every election\nThat when they start sort of going to the Google Search and saying which candidate should I vote for a and looking at the search results do we really want to have a company with the power to influence the outcome potentially of elections and that's what the real concern is here\nI think that's a pretty fair concern will take some calls for our guest Peter Schweitzer at the one eight six six five oh Jim boat one eight six six five oh five or six to six on the jumbo had a job when we come back in just a moment\nNews talk Ninety four point one they are

quick comment a lot of us to believe that the party has been building the Nazi techno state with going on Facebook and all these people but what I really call let's say ask and I want to thank our guests for what he's been doing\nAnd about search engines and they're used to be I could click which had\nA they they have another one called start page the same company but they got rid of ex click and that was if you didn't want to use Google result he wanted other resolved and I don't understand that Google suppress did they make them suppress I click or what happened to it and I use that that go\nNo that's a great question I mean this is this is fascinating when you look at at at how Google operates in this space so look at apple for example apple has this search engine called safari\nBut safari is actually run by Google Search algorithm and you know why because Google have apple nine billion dollars a year for the opportunity to run safari searches to think about that\nIt's an apple product and Google is actually theoretically doing apple a favor by doing their searches\nWhy is that because they want the information and the data that comes from search results because that can monetize it and sell it to other people and this is what Google is doing\nEverywhere and you're exactly right start page a is a a search engine you get great results they actually use the Google algorithm they have an agreement with Google that allows them to allow the search is to go without\nData being president I think that is that is going to change eventually biggest star page is becoming more popular it was a deal struck awhile ago Dr go is good\nIt it's not as good as Google and that's part of the challenge part of the challenges that best search engine out there in terms of results ineffectiveness is Google but the price that you pay is they collect all this information on you and they are prepared to use that information against you\nTo either steer you are manipulate you in a way for commercial gain or other parts of their agenda and there really are not many great options out there um there was even you know discussions about the fact that\nBank which is the Microsoft products which is sort of the great rival\nTo Google a centrally in twenty sixteen struck a commercial agreements a Microsoft and Google struck a commercial agreement we don't know exactly what that agreement is but um they essentially have stopped being so hostile to Google with a lot of people believe\nThat there is some kind of arrangement where they're doing a search they're cooperating and search so that's part of a challenge there really aren't that many great alternatives\nWe'll be back in the moment but do you think about customers nation presented by liberty mutual

glad you brought up this capital thing out of these people are getting in there and you're spot on with a with Feinstein too\nAre trying to uh to do this but I'm saying to myself how are these people are getting in and and ah I just wanted to make a point on the testimony\nOf uh\nWhat's your name a doctor in record\nRight right Dr Ford you know for her to be a saying that the anxiety in a post traumatic stress and all that the first thing she asked for when she sat down was it the cup of coffee\nI mean and then she strength sixteen ounce bottle with coke\nI mean for somebody it's so nervous and stuff like that and in front of a committee like that on Capitol Hill she was taking that caffeine pretty pretty well it just struck me\nAnd then the laughter was the one thing that she remembers a traumatized your in laws and the sweat Nick woman that at the interview on NBC she said the same thing\nThough after the laughing at stuff and that just you know I as a credibility is just ridiculous I think you have to have this vote in my opinion because if it if it drags on any longer I think he's going to get it\nAnd or if he doesn't it'll end this stuff for uh but I really do believe he's going to get it\nIn this country in a period so I I think that that that that I as I say it's safer to lead the way that the not so yeah I'm I'm with you day but I think that you're correct uh absolutely again or if someone is genuinely sexually assaulted I'm sure it must be a terrible trauma that most of us can only imagine\nFine I accept that our sympathies go to you and I will assume that that you in fact were sexually assaulted you have the benefit of the doubt but when you go making charges against somebody else you've got to come across with the appropriate information if you expect us to take you seriously\nAnd this I don't remember where and when when and all who was there but that doesn't cut it\nWe may still have sympathy for you but we cannot take seriously charges against another human being based on basically nothing no information whatsoever uh Archie and cameras amason Indiana good evening RG\nFinding Nemo I I yeah\nBut after that but a mild heart and the newspaper business\nOn the election results up air figured maybe a couple of bucks out of the election and it turns out nobody is giving any uh whatsoever on Mr down late reelect\nNow that's Joe Donnelly for those who don't know he is the Democratic senator from Indiana and uh again that of course the state carried by heavily by by President Trump uh that's that's interesting that that you couldn't even a even get a any takers on that I I find that remarkable\nUsually usually somebody will take it at least as a joke that Trump was out here about two weeks ago mhm and I was supporting of course the Republican candidates so it looks like he's right on the edge and if he was you know I'd say he's gone\n[noise] well it'll be very interesting to see how are the votes of these senators from uh from questionable states in fact a a a will affect their their election outcome as I say I I think Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota\nHas filled in a way almost liberated because she's trailing so badly that I think that all she wants is a cabinet position in a democratic administration I knew I Would suspect that uh that she probably cannot rescue that seat in North Dakota\nDown down thirty for an down thirty points since the clock made us tonight I understand\nIt vice it to say that ah that does not look good the Donnelly again not out of the question or a

the voters come up this way we can move the wedding to Sunday but if we lose this vote it will affect the entire country I've heard people say just what you just said and and my answer would be no\nNo that that's more important I mean it's not like your your daughter is not going to get married let her get married tomorrow or I'm In this case if you're talking about senator able to get married Sunday\nUh he does say that he will attend the his daughter's wedding in Montana and uh uh\nThis is interesting thing right here though there's been an unusual late night phone call in which a senator Danes of Montana Heidi Heitkamp colleague called cabinet and personally a short and that he has made arrangements to be there to get him across the finish line as needed [noise]\nSo uh [noise] for whatever that's worth a I I guess he's found a way around this so that that's the short answer on that one that he has a he has promised cabin Aviv needed he will be there so again a law that\nMakes me feel better and asked me feel better too I got to tell you Steve a I had been the bothered about that and I just rechecked\nUh uh the wires here and ah the GOP could hold the session opened by the overnight and allow Danes to vote on Sunday if needed to be a a whether or not the the cabin uh\nUh\nUh whether or not ... promised to cabinet means he would appear for hypothetical Sunday's vote is not clear but the GOP could hold the session open overnight\nAnd that could happen a so technically are in the in the Senate parlance that would mean that a Saturday would be a Sunday will be redefined the Saturday or they could do that and and I'll guarantee you if it came down to the point where let's say it is a\nIt is fifty to forty nine against Kavanaugh okay\nAh I'll guarantee that's

I Am so thrilled and delighted to be able to reconnect with you you may not remember may at that she made so many thousands of people but six years ago I asked permission to give you a hug which you granted when you add a fund raiser\nFor our now lieutenant governor Dan Forest\nOr I I Do recall it because it's very rare that somebody wants to make usually that want to slight may happen next year I understood correctly and it's like to talk to you\nAgain well we had our picture made together and I was just like a child I was just so thrilled because I have so much\nA respect for you and I'm just thrilled to pieces that you've got this show and doing so well and your daughter is doing a\nAn incredibly wonderful job for the president and for the country\nWell thank you very much I'm very proud of her ah I tell people that Donald Trump is not my first choice for president because I was my first choice and president a buddy was my second choice and I also say wait at least we got a Huckabee and the White House just wasn't the one I thought what ended up being there\nYou know it's got to be tough or as a dad to watch people beat up on your little girl every day and let's face it doesn't matter how growing up she gets she's always going to be your little girl\nWell she is but you know it doesn't make me nervous as people think and I'll tell you why because I Know are well enough to know how tough years and I see some guy like Jim Acosta smarter than trying to you know put the squeeze on her\nI I'm more afraid for what's about to happen to him I realized he's about to get his head handed to him just know it yet and sure enough she turns and really Texan down a notch and I I watch or with guys like that and I'm thinking you know I've seen that same approach that she makes to her five year old ...\nRight I Love semi is the fact that you have supported President Trump and everybody would try to do that you know ... in our president\nThat is true is the fact that a lot of people seem to ignore pressured your call Charlotte let's go to Calvin in St Louis hello Calvin\nHey how are you where well they are you\nTalking to the governor of the world there I mean I I I I grew up in Arkansas and when he said about girls is absolutely true because I have five girls\nAnd every one of them could take down just about anybody after fighting in something they believe at it and you should just be so proud of your daughter I I agree with that lady earlier but I just wanted to ask you what I wanted to say something to\nYou know you were one of the most truthful people I have ever heard on the radio or TV or as a governor or as a politician or concerning abortion and I think you're about the only person I hear\nA hundred percent of the time talking the truth about what that's about it and I think cabinet or I Would ask you I mean do you think that this has more to do about abortion but it does anything else where cabinet are facing this opposition\nI think it does a talented and in large measure because the locals are scared to death that there might be an honest look and or a revisit grow the weight which was a ridiculous decision\nThat was a reaching out into thin air and creating a law that did not have any basis in the constitution\nBut what most people don't understand either to grow the weight or reversed it doesn't end abortion all it does is it gives it back to the states and each and every state would make its own decision how it would approach it my own view is that the best way for us to deal with the abortion question\nIs to deal with it through the issue of person who could\nBecause if we would accept the biological fact this is the science of of the unborn that every person\nIs a person from the point of conception then\nThe Fifth Amendment would actually be far stronger than any Robie wait a ruling ever could be in protecting life liberty and the pursuit of happiness\nAnd would provide due process and would make it impossible for anyone to deprive a person of their life and liberty and I I really hope that that's where we end up moving with this because there shouldn't be about protecting innocent people not just about stopping abortion\nCome about ten seconds here am I then I went to stay on the line we'll speak off air but I was doing a little checking your calendar on inauguration day twenty twenty five you'll be sixty nine same ages Reagan was when he was elected president a year younger than Trump and and we've never had a president named Mike uh what do you think [laughter]\nA gym I can tell you that

fast as they are on parent ...\nThat's true uh and I've been reading some accounts and people on line they say that it hasn't been too much of an issue for them they're still able to watch Youtube videos without suffering and still able to get around the Internet pretty quickly\nBut there is that is a a compromise with this plan and also with some of the other ones you might be slowed down a little bit so you want to read through the fine print to know that you are paying less but you may be getting a little bit slower service\nAnd the biggest difference between the horizon visible and cricket and um metro buy T Mobile and the booze is how many stores is the invisible\nMan was all they really are invisible there is no stores it's all done through an app\nThat's right you download the app you sign up for the service there you pay through that everything and that's really much more how cell phone service has done elsewhere in the world without a relying on a big network or stores or cricket\nIs suddenly a ... second tier brand has now been exposed that they weren't up to the standards of the others so they made some changes\nYeah uh what cricket did cricket has to unlimited plans and there really hasn't been much of a change to the cheaper one\nIt does restrict your speeds and that's a compromise that I think a lot of people might not be comfortable with but it's a really great pie price point a fifty dollars a month for one line but for for lines it's a hundred dollars a month so that's still a really good deal and it was you know junk food so no it's all included\nA now they're\nMore expensive plan they used to have a limitation on speed as well but that's now been removed so four fifty five dollars a month with auto pay you're getting really fast unlimited plan on Eighteen T's network\nAnd the reason it's fifty five is bears are grudge match of hate\nBetween eighty and see and John ledger the guy from T Mobile bay hate each other teams he tried to have him arrested in Las Vegas a few years ago at CBS they I mean it is like a blood feud like Hatfield McCoys so\nThe mobile came out with the metro buy T Mobile at sixty so then cricket said well we're going to go fifty five exactly so the competition is great and you've got all this explain were charts and all that\nWe've got it all laid out so all the all these plans you can read side by side and then you can go\nFor its plans to see is saving that extra twenty dollars a month or so is going to be worth it for you and you can deal with some of the the gotcha has that come with all of these unlimited plants\nAnd now we moved to a marketplace where there are now three tiers of service\nThere's the second tier companies we've talked about and now there's a third tier of ultra cheap companies that come with a lot of things you've got to be willing to work with and we have those laid out for you at Clark dot com as well with those plans starting at as little as ten dollars a month\nFor bona fide real cell phone service with\nI'm not a huge amount of data but\nSome data yeah well thank you and I appreciate how you stay on top of this because is there ever a week that goes by that cell phone right plans don't change no they're changing multiple times a week and we're staying on top of it all its own car dot com thank you very much\nJohn joins us on the Clark Howard show Hi John\nThat color [laughter] ...\nHow are you do talk to you it's great to have you\nHere I'm doing well I'm an avid listener and glad to be on um had a question for you though which is it seems like you're favoring one of your children are vanguard you continue to call them the the lowest cost provider the low cost provider\nUm well actually I have a favorite children\nAnd so it's hard to pick you know it's like a parent's arrest you know you got you got these these four kids which is really your favorite why don't have any favors [laughter] now you're you're doing that to me with investing so\nTell me who it is you feel like I'm dissing\nFidelity you've mentioned on your show\nThey have to you know widely diversified funds mutual funds that have come out they have a ton of really low cost no transaction fee ATS\nI'm no minimum to account minimum to start um they've really kind of blazed the trail of lowest cost in my opinion\nYeah zero's that has such a brilliant marketing campaign around the ... zeroes which have no commission and no ongoing fees that they\nAbsorb all the fees I think this is absolutely great what fidelity is done finality ah let me tell you why this came about ... had found itself steadily losing market share\nTo a nachos vanguard but also to the bigger player out there that most of us in the United states don't pay a lot of attention to black rock\nAnd so the two of them were taking all the market share and there was out there\nSo fidelity coming up with the new product development zero has set down a marker that no one can say they're not the cheapest because obviously fidelity at no cost is offering a better deal than anybody else\nAnd so they have the total stock market index which is thousands of U.S companies\nAll in one investment at no fees at all and then the international index fund which just thousands of international stocks oh free so\nA fidelity is in the game salad you know what else they've done\nWith that\nFidelity used to have relatively high cost target retirement funds and now they have two flavors up them they are an extremely low cost series\nAnd then they have their old one that still has very high cost well not high costs but a higher than a low cost companies should be offering so they have become much more aggressive on the front and so do you invest with fidelity and you wonder why always talking about\nVanguard or were you trying to figure between the two\nSo I've invested with fidelity and just kind of comparing costs and I also kind of was invested in their ecosystems thirty two percent cash back card\nGood for you\nExplain that a lot of people don't know that fidelity offers one of the two best credit cards in America\nAre they two percent cash back on every every purchase you run through them I think it's underwritten by a separate bank but you get two percent cash back deposited into any of your ability account\nSo that he has managed bastion an account or they're going to be an IRA or write or or college savings plans exactly yeah\nSo so you want to know why do I always talk vanguard vanguard vanguard when Fidel what he's doing all this good stuff\nExactly on a number of calls it seemed like people were you know asking which way to go and you kind of lean towards telling them vanguard and I was just struck by that\nYeah and so uh I should not be offending\nFidelity because they do a great job a Schwab does a great job I mean these companies are huge companies and they've all become lower cost but vanguard really set\nThe pattern and set the tone and took the market share and that's why they are the ones that created the pressure in the marketplace for lower costs\nAnd maybe that's a sentimental thing\nBut I ... you're probably right I should be talking about that fidelity is well now offers a series of ultra cheap choices for\nInvesting thanks for bringing it to my attention you're listening to the Clark Howard show\nSag

publishing guy to court dot com okay have you seen my guide to it\nAnd that's where we'll hear shortly\nRight so go look at it and the first thing to do is the book yours that'll be free by and what's

and the thing is if you set up a custodial account\nHow old is she now for team oh okay so if you open an account for a fourteen year old and you open a custodial account generally the money becomes hers depending on the state of Eighteen or Twenty one but\nWhat you can do and I'm going to give you the car cancer not the book or legal answer OK\nWhere you can do is who gets the mail every day I mean she never even has to know that this money is there and even when it comes in adult the male is still coming to the address of record which has yours and she never even has to know that\nLike that's my problem like I thought about a lot but he needs to be made money do that but if we can show the ... and I just keep putting taxable money there will be okay\nYeah but see even with the custodial wrong\nYou know let's say she starts working in the next couple of years and then she becomes raw eligible you start putting money into it she still gained control of that or what your state considers to be aging majority Eighteen or Twenty one she has control\nSo you have to do something that is this is a case where which for the child's good because you don't let her know there is any money there even when she is a young adult and you don't even bring it up\nTil she's old enough to respond to William and with maturity handled the money\nSo me and my wife could we both beyond the custodial count and I'm sure that they would just like all three of us and this\nWoman generally you know it depends on the the investment house used but generally you have one parent as the custodian for the benefit of your child's name but\nDepending on where you set up an account they may allow you to set up both of us custodians now there is what's the minimum minimum to one count you can start an account like if you go to Charles Schwab you can do it with a hundred dollars\nPer year like this if we open do you how much money do I put in their ...\nYou don't have to put an economy that I mean once you've held abolition account with the account minimum you can let it sit or add to it as you wish\nOkay so that I work at dinner off like a date I sorry so that when I say you're going so that you know like a raw savings account\nI Know you can't do or raw till she has a job so that's got to wait a year or two to she starts working and then you can put up to fifty five hundred into a raw now by the way the legal answer if you want to keep\nThe money away from her until you feel she's mature enough is much more expensive process where a trust can be established using a lawyer who specializes in wills estates and trust\nAnd you can fully legally keep the money away from her tail is set time much later in adulthood but I think when you're starting with a smaller account just keep it simple keep the account a secret from your fourteen year old Mary's with us on the\nClark Howard show Hi merry heart how I'm doing great how are you good thank you you want to talk about

I'm Sorry what are you doing with the rest of the money\nOh I'm paying all and I'm paying all his the sale has about um ten K. left on the equity loan ... two thousand on a credit card mhm\nEight thousand on a car and eight thousand on the house\nAnd how much are you able to put on the debts\n[noise] time putting everything\nWas a turning out to do everything on on that much money does that amount to\nWhat is it a month [noise] mhm\nI think it amounts to about a thousand a month\nAnd that's pretty good okay so he's got Fifteen and eight and two did I get that right\nOn the car eight on a

come a moment and it will come suddenly that he just can't do that\nAnd I'm afraid of you know my prayer is at least that he gets through this year and that way you that free and if he's a hundred percent debt free house and everything you can probably make it on his Social Security if you had to write okay not yeah not ideal\nNot what we want but we can probably get there\nAnd uh then the next step is if we get past that that'd be wonderful let's get debt free then let's build an emergency from under three to six months of expenses of all we get past that then let's start building some nest egg for retirement but the fastest way to build a nest egg for retirement is to clear that dead and to have that emergency fund and blood\nAnd he is still the baby steps in other words\n[noise] okay that sounds good I'm asking is why a bank [laughter] now and I'm someone at his age the K animal you know four and a and it\nCan be paid off in twenty forty three now and that\nHe went and lived that long\nWell two reasons one is they're stupid\nAnd the second reason is counting on the house I've got to lean against the house right now that you\nDidn't show the house will be sold upon his death and they would get their money or they can foreclose on it upon his death and they'll get their money they've got the collateral is part of it and so that's part of the equation the other part of the equation is is\nYou know asking a bank or if you should borrow money is like asking a dog if it's hungry I mean they'll they'll loan anybody this were either not breathing money you know what I'm saying\nThe lending has gotten completely out of control and stupid so there's nothing you know just because someone offers you alone does not mean that you are capable of paying the loan it just means you might be breathing\nAnd ... and so the industry is just stupid is what it amounts to but uh so we have to protect ourselves from them offering us things because sometimes people go oh they wouldn't have offered me this credit card if I couldn't afford it and it was like no they would have offered a dog that credit card shop\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt's going

E. they've got football they got cheerleaders cheerleaders guy lockers man\nIf I could get over to middle school I'd be happy then you remember that and then I was in middle school I got to be about the ninth grade and I was fourteen Fifteen Years old and one of my buddies got his driver's license\nAnd oh man if I could just get my driver's license that'd be free I could drive myself to McDonald's and we go through McDonald's I'll tell you how long ago it was we would go through the McDonald's drive through and we can get a Big Mac and a small coke for a buck\nSixteen and we were scratching together the ... the sixteen always you can scratch the buck but the sixteen sense that you know math Dominic on a penny right there I got to be ready\nEighty six hundred dollars on how much do you own your car we have a ten thousand and what do you own your credit cards all five thousand okay and um are you guys on a budget in reducing debt already\nWe just started at ... and that's and I realized we did that baby steps out of order with having that couldn't say pan ... played pan and then I don't know what to do at this point\nGotcha okay I'm In your household income as well\n[noise] um it has been forty five and I have a small business that brings in about twelve thousand a year\nOkay so about sixty thousand give or take All right um no I Would not cash would stop adding to it\nUm and um\nYou do need to get on a budget and follow through with what you're learning and financial ... and just work your baby steps if you stop adding to its you'll be fine\nThe other thing I probably wouldn't do a new emergency or no rush but sometime in the next year or two I Would probably take that money out of their enroll it into a five twenty nine plan in good mutual funds and here's why\nYou're much better off to save for college and a five twenty nine or an ESL and mutual funds than you are with prepaid college plants here is the reason anytime you ... pay something your rate of return is what it increases in\nPrice and so if I\nPrepay a an item I pay a thousand dollars and increases in price\nTo twelve hundred dollars my rate of return if it did that in one year would be twenty percent so that'd be a nice rate of return right so how much of the increase in price 'cause that's the only return when you ... pay anything they're not giving you an increased rate they're not giving your growth rate you simply or saving the increases in tuition\nBy paying it ahead of time that's all you're doing now tuition for the last Seventy odd years as average about seven point two percent inflation rate so that means you're making about seven point two percent on your money when you do\nOn you ought to be ten to fourteen percent average annual return over that same period of time minded and so on you make more by putting it in and you actually get some headway towards college the other problem with prepaid college is\nA ... and it's a blanket statement but ... and it would vary from state to state many many many of the state's\nBusiness government\nAre very poorly run\nAnd they screw up some of the prepaid college plans and the process\nI mean they're just horrible administrators\nNow some states are well run my state happens to be well run show in the state of Tennessee I wouldn't be concerned today under the current administration\nWith a with the stability of the fun of still wouldn't do prepaid college even in Tennessee because of the other reason I was talking about I Want a better rate of return on my money than simply the inflation rate of tuition\nSo all of that to say I would roll your eighty six hundred bucks into a five twenty nine and a good mutual fund\nAt some point right now I just stop adding get yourself on a budget cranky lifestyle down stop going out to eat canceled the trip that you had planned called a vacation because you're broken you've been spending more than you make and you have to stop that and that's how you got a car loan and credit card debt\nSo you're right on track you're doing the right kind of things and that's what I Would do if I were in your shoes Matthew is with us in Fort Worth Texas hey Matthew how are ya\nI'm excellent or want to thank you for for a a ...

that Florida often centered in mowing sort of make a living out on the perimeter last week I mean it was turning throat turning throat turning throw\nFor ... francs and then obviously you get a little bit of a trick play result in a touchdown pass I don't know if they can make a living against the LSU defense because grant dealt with the company from that secondary come up and play aggressive in tackle extremely well\nAnd with the way the port offensive line has played not great football LSU should be able to when it gets to run game with fewer numbers that gives them an advantage on the back in so\nDan ... companies have to find a way to generate a little bit more of a run game be more balanced on all things we at Florida earlier this year against Charleston southern they got away from the run game in that contest so they're going to have to be more balanced against a very very good LSU deep into has elite players at every level\nFor LSU I think it's continue to do what you do try to play physical brand to football offensively protect your borough go six seven eight men protections run the football tried to go north and south the way the Florida deeply\nPlenty of their defensive lineman they blitz they move those guys around the Mississippi State offensive line could not keep up with that movement if they try that again with some of the gap scheme runs blocking back and pulling around that she likes to do\nThat could turn into two explosive plays for the tigers they'll run Joe borough they'll protect him with six seven even eight players at times they're going to try to make his life easy and then you see a very similar playing for LSU in this game against forward [noise]\nA lot of games or tomorrow we talked a lot last week co as we were in stark feel about Mississippi State and uh what is going on there it's pretty obvious there are problems they host Auburn another team that\nHigh ... high record good good writing good ranking but not a lot of enthusiasm what's going on has to start start for Martin I [laughter]\nI think yeah I think your guest as good as mine Paul I don't know what to expect from that football game or Mississippi states it home\nAuthor and has a quarterback this played a little bit better than Mississippi states quarterback Auburn has a deep and sets out perform Mississippi ... inspired by a slim margin but all of that is one of the best defenses in college football they've all got one rushing touchdown this season five total scores this season five total touch downs\nAnd they're ... they're the best in the nation at points per drive so I think the better defense and the more capable quarterback\nHelps Auburn find a way to win but I don't really know how either team is going to generate a ton of office Auburn has to go back to the drawing board Paul they have to find a way to sort of reinvent who they're going to be initially on all fence and how they're going to build around that because they can't be a downhill team\nThey don't have the dominant back to be able to do with the offensive line has not performed well enough for them to be able to do it\nAnd now I think that has to get them a little bit off the ghost of the times missing some read and not playing up to his capabilities the talent on all things for Auburn is that receiver and quarterback utilize that first and then try to develop maybe a little bit of a run getting behind that\nAnd they might be able to find some success from Mississippi State\nHave to find some consistency through the passing gave they have not been able to do with the past few weeks therefore the run game has disappeared in Auburn is to get up front especially out why now that Florida group has the best group of edge defenders I Believe in college football was due to go see she ... percent polite\nCalls [noise]\nYou\nFrom a country and we lack in that way [noise]\nBack to the program we're live in Gainesville more gas to come if you're just joining us [noise]\nWe had a\nTemp T. Bo and Dan mall and to start the show and we're going to continue or with more guest later on your phone calls right now a day five five to four to seven to eight five and Rodney is up next a good afternoon ...\nSays he's worried about the stimulus not common why is he still wearing Nike gear or you're talking about saving yes they\nWill say been wearing Nike gear because the school has a a big contract with Nike or do you have a problem with that\nYeah he needs that they need to drop that contract that call went out last night and that guy wouldn't stand for the flag\nOf like\nYou're talking about Catherine around that and if you don't stand for black it [noise]\n\nHow 'bout that well let's listen to I certainly respect your service to the country and and I happen to agree with you about standing for the flag however uh Alabama has a has a long term deal with with Nike and um [noise]\nWhen you have to deal with a contract you either break it if you can argue abide by it which they are\nOkay thank you thank you\nFirst time I've heard that but I'm sure it's not that he's not the only person out there ah suggesting that Dominic is up next to hell Dominic\nHow you doing borrowed time or be Alabama fan but over the last comment for that that young men and said that\nIs I agree with him to a certain extent but there must stand up there in the day how schools sponsored by Nike Nike's locking called I'm On the rules I'm coming towards gays stuck in traffic band or\nSome down to see you made up I'll get a chance to see a hope I get to see in the morning but I wanted to talk about um what people said that they\nAre on a first date and I agree with him a hundred and ten percent about Alabama students whom stores are they just go on about the past the championship we shouldn't have these students should have their own I didn't I didn't even try to come to the game is support to support the school like Paul what'd you think about their buddy\n[noise] well I I think I think anytime you paint a broad brush a you run a risk and you know for those who don't know T. Bo was on earlier we had a mere but it just wasn't the right setting to\nTo get into it but he he was very uh uh he blasted Alabama students or talk to talk of privilege and it's certainly a comment that has been ah in Toronto to many many\nAnd because the kids that come to school most people like me and some people will look we'll go to the games I Know the sooner than they probably have an obligation like you say it again was eleven o'clock Alabama time you know you know kids stay out late at night that could have been self esteem but\nFor the coast saving name has to say what they said no no it really kind of a at home I'm Out in part on my way to see you buddy will roll\nYeah for those who are for those who didn't hear the the TiVo comments I read one or two comments from him\nHe said I I think the fans are getting so in title there at Alabama specifically to students listen as a student you've done you've done nothing to win all these games okay you spend a little bit of your daddy's money to show up at a game you go to school you say you're the best friends in college football where you need to show up\nSo again that same thing goes opinion there are a lot of opinions out there on that subject criticism of North Carolina Chris welcome to the program good afternoon\nThat they don't ... I don't know how we're doing great Chris thank you I call it talked about she saw the gang do you okay so it could be a pretty good chain and do you think that could win it says I'm a\nYeah I Do uh I I disagree\nWith were Desmond Howard I think I think she has been very impressive they won two games of 'em there weren't a lot of games they won five games but they want to be very significant games however\nI I saw something in Florida\nLast week that really impress me I saw some some character and desire that I hadn't seen also saw where I knew they would eventually get and that's one of the best play cars and college football damned on I was talking to my good friend buddy Martin\nThis morning and uh he covers the gators and and and and he said he thought it was one of 'em Mullen's best called games in a long time and I think what what you saw then and really what you saw here today we're mowing dropped by ... is a different level of intensity\nAnd energy that this program or has not had a in some time\nSo uh it was a pretty pretty amazing to see Jake is up next in Georgia Jay go right ahead\nPaid laws Jason I'm a diehard state than um than if you're getting beat after getting beat by mediocre Florida team with a bunch of Jim ... recruits by a baseball score that is\nAnd we know certainly made that Kentucky team look a lot better than they probably are\nI've got two questions and I are wrong to kind of concluded that more hit is running our team in the ground I kind of agree with what you said previously that it was still coach and we'd probably be five in no end to is the wheels really come off this year we lose tomorrow we lose the LSU than my old man is\nHow much rope is Jon Cohen in the Mississippi State administration going to give\nHim and he's he got two years as he got three years I mean he's going to lose the student body if you lose a smaller\nJason uh I I think I think a lot of people in my business would give you a a name be paying the answer here I'm not going to give you one but uh because I was there last week\nAnd I was around a lot of people who are already concerned about the situation and this was before the game [noise] so I think if tomorrow goes badly\nYou're going to get a pretty desperate situation and I say desperate for this season there is no way to analyze what it's going to look like in December right now but\nShould they lose them are should they lose a ... and and to al and to LSU and and I think you know the goal may not really matter one way or the other because both teams at that point could be pretty average then I think he's the only thing\nThat it may be the only thing left that matters because there's not going to you know but but but ... Jackson tell me this I mean if\nOr six wins in in that win against ah what looks like a very average on this team\nIs better than losing but it's probably not going to give you the energy you need I mean this season already looks like a lost opportunity\nThat is why tomorrow is so critical I mean I I I Will say that that is a must win game as most of the winners I've ever seen I said at last weekend but that was more personal but if you lose this game them are as as a Mississippi State player and as a team you don't have anywhere to go there is no reason to\nThink now we don't sing and let me just say this I was a proponent of this guy I was all they're having a new coach after last year after the way Mel manage some games but I feel like he is not ... a lot of streams and he has not managing I think the guys in over his head he's ... he's the head man\nYeah I tell you I uh we had a Ken Smith Meyer on last night he's a judgment expert and I'm not saying that just because he he studies this stuff in in business and sports that his ... he's going to affect the outcome\nBut he said a joke more had looked like a deer in headlights he was very awkward in a very uh in the interview with us she looked insecure are\nTalking about Dan mall it's not easy less than a year or pay someone like that it's tough but you but you better take it head on\nA you better not run away from it and quite frankly uh I haven't seen much from Joe more this year that would make me believe that if you if you can't win with his team what are you going to win with\nHow long can they keep him how long can you stay\nA little different and that's so difficult to answer and the fact that I Can't answer you\nIs it is an indicator that if things go the way you you you you may think they're going it's a problem because fans are so smart now you can't just come out as Jonathan Cohn would like to and say oh we're hey this this is a turnaround that you know this is not what you have a Arkansas or Tennessee\nHe inherited a team that I thought had a chance to win ... games let's see what happens some are nightly\nBy a breeze right now [noise] well\nI can tell you every few phrases a head coach also has proven a whole lot more than ... than Joe Morehead has\nA he may be dirty but the guy can coaching going against a genius thanks for taking the\nCall Paul this is all about where they gripe thank you for the call a large ... will join us in a moment she'll be here with us in Gainesville and we're coming right back [noise] individuals\nAnd businesses with tax problems listen

now by calling the experts at us tax shield and take advantage\nYou say this or that it's a long it's been about eight or nine years but uh my last trip to Yankee Stadium\nIt was it was ... it was the last I think it was ... was the last year the old stadium that's been ten years yeah it's been ten years the exactly ten year I was up there ah speaking at Columbia University yeah\nYeah yeah ... yeah I was actually being given the show was the recipient of an award wow from Columbia University the wrong ... program of of of communication and journalism we were honored for some program we're done and\nA friend of mine used to be the president of the Yankees actually former commissioner of the SEC heart rate so he he called me knew I was coming up he said what do you what would you like to do you want to go show I said I haven't been to Yankee Stadium in years he has done I I'd forgotten he had been the president the Yankees yeah when he got that too is that in ...\nOh my goodness that was that was one of the most that wasn't even a humble bragging ... so that was just a brand\nAnd I was on their idol I was on the phone I called my wife as it were and all of a sudden a doctor show or who do you have to know him as a retired air force general house and he just walked up to\nHang up or sorry to say to myself as you don't want to go to the commission or you can't tell me and tell me what to do All right\nAnd I hung up and he introduced me to Reggie Jackson I spent the next two hours talking to Mr October\nI tell you what if I when I come to a point to the story and it's amazing when I come back and my next life I'm coming back as you [noise] okay\nAnd there was a it was a Thursday night they were playing the tigers it was raining it was like nobody was at the game nobody cared about her and read yet no one else to talk to and I literally sat for two hours\nAnd you you know you're obviously a lot more major league baseball but I've never been more riveted by saying well back and told me when he played in Birmingham in the minor leagues in the late sixties about the struggles yeah talking about uh getting to know bear Bryant it was fascinating then he went through all the players that he\nLoved and hated okay that's probably even more\n... pointed down to Derek Jeter and so the the captain is one of the the most ah high class people I've ever been around and then he pointed to Alex Rodriguez and said\nThe exact opposite [laughter] out J. lo doesn't think so [laughter]\nI Know next week on ethics and we'll be talking about baseball and J. lo and ... and whatever else but we will be at Auburn for the ... the games I Can't be ... I was wondering when we we get to offer and this year\nAnd it it it could be a very interesting game tendencies off this week yet ... Mississippi State so the tigers will either\nBe coming into the game on a big high\nOr yeah well you know and and at this point from Mississippi State desperation level in a way um I think in a big way I mean I had such high expectations from is that he said high expectations for Auburn too but all over and you know it certainly\nHas looked better recently than Mississippi State had I I don't ... to me\nI Wonder if they need to make a quarterback change I'm sure people have talked about that on your show this week but um I feel for Nick Fitzgerald because\nHe obviously you think you'd see Andrew you were there the her I I I think it could factor in and and it's sad because I Can't tell if it's a matter of these not fully healthy I I think he's healthy they wouldn't have cleared him to play you know he wouldn't be back if he was and I wonder if it's a mental a little bit you know I I don't know\nAnd I would hate to speculate because I haven't heard that from him but\nThat injury was the most devastating thing I've ever seen happen on a football field before and um to see him not having success this year has been shocking to me\nRecently so I I I'll be interested in what they do I almost wonder too if if it leads to playing ... could light a little fire under Fitzgerald and put him in a better physician sometimes that can help things we've seen that before\nSo that ... I mean next week's going to be a big deal that game this week between Auburn, Mississippi state between that one in Kentucky and in and obviously the one here between four dollars you we've got some really good games as if\nWe're going to go to a break but don't go anywhere I've got some more names on a\n... you know I talked to is winning the league and name dropping today I Love it Greg Mac or I saw him yesterday he was he was making fun of me for dropping named him and tell them ... you you you have your ... name dropped Greg McIlroy actually well\nI've got a really good when I was talking to Kevin Hart the other day and we were [laughter]\nSomebody I'm mad entire my he's hilarious laugh yeah I mean I was just like sitting for our problems are you going to leave\nIf you're given a piggyback rides [noise] I I was afraid to get nearby might step on them like a little guy I mean seriously Kevin Hart is like three feet tall [laughter]\nI'm not kidding you I don't know why is that small but it's great I Love he wasn't hair\nFor at least in law works up there to any ... you know these are at least three hour did he grow like a few inches all I mean I finally said listen I got to

Scott Strickland has the same alignment and of course are we're all about giving these guys opportunities to get better day in and day out and and our fans\nUh and we've got a number of top twenty five preseason teams are scheduled both in the non conference and of course when he gets the se\nSo who are in the in the pre season it's not a pre season or else they are who you say\nAre we play in the battle of Atlanta in the Bahamas and will play three major games over there and I hate to leave somebody out but we open at Florida State should be very difficult of course we got her a we've got butler and Michigan State at home\nWe've got West Virginia in Madison Square garden we play a at TCU dot our schedule will be as tough as anyone in college basketball\nAnd then you get to play the SEC schedule [laughter] that's right that's right which in my opinion will be the best leading a country that you're really yeah absolutely\nI mean we saw eight and a tournament last year it was it was a record and the other end so much attention on a ... a [noise]\nA has as emphasize that we had the commissioner on yesterday and and the attention to detail is there but ah before we talk about the gators um talk a little bit about the rest of the league because her [noise] um [noise] I've I've heard that from others yeah eight may not be enough next\nYear ... I I think that will have a potential to to to get nine ten maybe who knows how the numbers will fall or who the computers were like a little bit better than than than so and so uh but\nI think you've got to start with with the two lead champions from last year the champions in in Tennessee in Auburn for both return a ton of players are both teams are excellent um and I think he you've always got to have Kentucky in a\nConversation I'm ... I also saw John and are you usually this time of year you get to know we're we're we're young or not a choice if you look the reason we're going to be really good [noise] how about that yeah\nAnd and I believe it and and they always are and and the other teams are and and I probably should stop there but there's another eight or ten that have a chance to be a net or whatever force to twelve than the league you know that there's just um there there's a lot of\nParity you played in this league and you know the leagues so well and and obviously you're you've been associated through families with some of the best surround college basketball but uh [noise] just from when you were a player Janelle I'm yeah I'm curious as you watch this week what what what what's what's what's happened and why why's has gotten so good\nI think there's probably it starts with the administration of of the south east eastern conference in that um I I just think basketball's been prioritized at a higher level the last few years I think that scheduling has a lot to do with of course recruiting has a lot to do with it I think that you've got more talented roster\nYou've always had great coaches and in this league um and that obviously is is the same now a great Ross truth of head coaches\nAre some really good staff um I think our our fan bases have rallied at a different level around a college basketball and it's so it's as good as it's ever been\nHave always been impressed coming here and and I don't I don't want to diminish any any any any any program because every every program and just the FCC has a premium but I've never felt\nOn campus see the intensity and the desire for every sport just to not only be successful but to be successful at the highest level then then I felt on this particular campus ... what's that like the big\nPart of that a big part how it's it's incredible it's um it's a big cell to\nOur recruiting base every day it was why obviously we jumped at the opportunity to be here it's a destination place\nUm you know ... the place has beautiful look at it around us and they knew facilities top ten public academic great people great administration in every sports winning national championships that doesn't happen everywhere is a special place it's great to be here in in in terms of\nWhat you what you recruit too\nAt that the vanguard of college basketball and uh we're we'll talk much more about that in the coming days more and more gas here we started with T. Bo and a gambling and we're going to continue now with your phone calls it eight five five to four to seven to eight ... next in Texas Fred how are you doing my friend\nI Know well how you doing to think of a taking my call into law\nIt has been glad to hear from you\nWill not take the first of all I Want to end up where we'll talk to the stadiums family down the road I was at LSU with ... we got we finished together to say here\nSo I just wanted to get out of their lungs and all the all the other shoe to thinking about him and his family after I got out you know that\nAnd I know that we have a lot of love nesting on this so that when\nWe asked him\nBut somebody needs to call OSHA\nAnd get him out of that small boat because that's what we're getting a whole lot to say that she was just okay and all those kind of don't want to go check on me because when you want to three at the end of the cut by\nWitness you get away but the thing I don't think it's fair for him to pick a Saturday I should say they just okay that's where the big day and the law without big bowl show out of that [noise] I just think he's got the ...\nWhen you look at LA she and it's been a while since we chatter they broke a grant on it I Want one thing that is keeping you from saying basically the team that's done a lot of Alabama off the phone this year that's all I was [noise]\nFred I Know that it would it would be great if I said that I just don't believe in a ... and maybe tomorrow maybe next week I'll I'll be convinced but uh I think these next two weeks are going to be ... are going to be very very tricky\nTomorrow spout I'm not looking past them you know the blood faulted Alice and Alice she and I know [noise]\nNobody's looking past Georgia in the face daughter but that that's a bad let's say they put a pause on it it will come back on it but I could send a shout out all the damage than that are out there\nI guess so so many that have reached out to me and say hey even a couple of Auburn fan [noise]\nBut parliament close it did\nI Want you to remember next on when we talk about this like how\nYou are looking at the rebuilding of LSU as a national program you're in a year out for one reason why do we know that goes coach Joe is finally got his daily lots of on a program like that you know the head man or if you\nGot to do that again and limos but by and let me tell you but I Know you have to have a great\nWeekend [laughter] that you've ... bread great the great to have your what did they ... you don't have to agree with him he's still he's still respect choose not unlike some callers on this program [noise] we've had a\nReally fun show I I tell you I I I I Hope you are here for the beginning of the program when we had ... and Dan Mullen together it was so special especially are talking about the first of all Dan when he went through last week going back home going going back to start throwing them reflecting in reminiscing about the days with with Tim\nAs his office of coordinator quarterbacks coach here\nReminder Tim will be a inducted into the ring of honor\nHere tomorrow and there's been a lot of fun and we will continue with more phone calls number of gas or still to come\nAnd Matt is up next time at\nAnd it's only them a friend a mat we're doing great how about you know good just kicking back and relax and\nI wanted to call and talk about in ...\nI'm not color guard or health insurance I said it's one of the conference out is serious about that game tomorrow and then the whole life without Kentucky they've earned it they play in pretty good team and they've ended that thirty one with one or thirty ... Florida\n\nI Can't remember which you know I I think he just maybe a underestimating Kentucky a\nHurry I understand there and we even had at that in the dark and the um hot when he played out we played that but I think a lot of people on a plane and him as well and they had the better it is here in Kansas stopping Iran and the taxpayer pretty terrible at it\nI mean ever since the ... this year he's done a lot of this broke into turning around stuff on the first year and\nI'm not taking the the way ...\nYou know they really are ... I'm just trying to tell you is as a friend here I'm Matt do not do not sleep on Kentucky a Florida made that mistake South Carolina made that mistake and Mississippi State made that mistake and they all paid for it in ... beats\nToday all okay Matt\nHow do you think it should quarterback quarter back in ... in that that are gaining in that game for ... [noise]\nUh you know I'm Out I'm not sure that that's going to be the determining factor I Do think here and I think mine has done really well you know\nVery well so it is good uh but he has he has he has a great line or that that's backing him and I think that's helped open the door and a million ... thank you for the call enjoy the game to Mars are really big one tomorrow night from Kyle Field talk to you soon\n\nDwayne is up next Wayne good go right ahead you're on the air\nYou'd afternoon ball good afternoon how are you doing we're doing great thank you good\nGood man I think everybody needs to pump the brakes a little bit on the students actually not showing up I Hope that's the biggest problem Alabama has this year's the do not show up to the games I think will be just fine if it is [laughter]\n[noise] yeah you know what I mean let me say one more word on that um I uh\nI I think ... was saving no matter what saving says is magnified and [noise] it goes it goes to DEF CON one um I think he had a point\nBut I I never like I mean I never like criticizing people who uh I mean when you criticize those who don't come to the game\nYou're ... you're almost criticizing those who do and he was criticizing those who do because he said that they're not cheering enough they're not a state and and I I Would say I lived in Alabama for Thirty years and\nI and and I'll speak about the fan base which I have great knowledge of they are the most passionate knowledgeable\nAnd devoted fans that that I've ever run into that they win or lose and Alabama fans care about their football team and I think when you paint a broad brush like that you give the impression that the tide fans are sitting on their hands or not I mean they're they're the circumstances are you're playing a lousy team\nAnd you're winning fifty six to nothing and then you give up too late scores I mean don't blame them for your scheduling if you if I if I Want fans more interested schedule Ohio State\n[laughter] ... ah they get a lot of hope that the biggest problem this year I think\nWe're going to dwell on it it it is a by by the way I I'm not sure Alabama has any problems this year I think that's the problem for saving\n[laughter] really quick to take down but um what do you think that hurts his chance to play next level [noise]\nTheir quarterback not very good not very good\nNo I I just I mean he is improving and um you know with more good coaching and frankly he's getting great coaching this year\nA he has a chance but right now I I'm not sure what his upside would be but the but I you know let me also say Dwayne I'm not in NFL scout evaluate or a but the ones I talked to aren't all that crazy about him will join thanks for the call appreciate it [noise]\nWe're up against

gave up on them and I would believe in them or I mean what what's your what's your the average Joe think about the\nI I still don't know what's a truly expect from this team but I Will say when when talking with coaches around here\nThis is a team that it's starting to buy and and it's not always going to be pretty the Mississippi State game you know I talked to the talk rapid defensive coordinator here and he said yeah\nWe might have been able to score a couple of more touchdowns but the guys did what they're supposed to do the defense wasn't putting a lot of bad situations a lot of the time it's state had to drive an eighty maybe Ninety yards and try and do something and they couldn't do it now wants\nTheir backs were against the wall they started to really buck up and you know I talked to try to garner Johnston this week and I said what was the turning point and why are you guys playing better it might not look like you know you're the national championship contenders which are certainly a better team now than he worked two weeks ago and they said\nLosing a Kentucky was the best thing that could have happened when I was like whoa hold on I went to school at Florida you're not supposed to lose to hockey thirty plus years it's not supposed to happen and he was like you know coach told us after the game\nDoes that make us a better team and everyone kind of looked around and they didn't know what to say and they were on a grand snow yet undefeated but\nWho knows how this team takes that when they took the lost a lot better and he used to charge he told me you know I looked around the locker room and I just stopped I wanted to see what the younger guys are doing and they were fired up and Josh ... told me the practices since then had been intense and it was a blessing in disguise that they lost that game they could they quote lost some of the ... when losing in Kentucky\nThat's really interesting I'm speaking of the Kentucky team [noise] pretty good test tomorrow I Know and I\nI think if this were a game in Lexington I really think the Kentucky is a really really good shot I still think they do in Texas and I'm certainly a flawed team and so we need to see what that defense can do against a guy named Vinnie now who's probably the best running back we're not talking about enough um\nBut this is a high quality is better than Herschel Walker and while you set it not me I'm I won't go that I I Will\nNot go that uh we're we actually put out a tree last night some of it was tongue in cheek I'm I'm a about his his ... his numbers in the number of people who took it seriously\nWell welcome to social media I my first experience but this is a team you know in talking with us for the coaches their tougher than they thought when they saw and they looked at the film they said this was a really fundamentally sound team and this is a team\nThat could come in and when they were not shocked to see their team loses now seeing what they've done we can and week out since they've been more and more impressed I think any snow has certainly been the guy to everybody rallies around but Josh out the first round the linebacker capsule and they've done a fantastic job finding ways to win with their best players\nDistance different types of saying them to me has more overall talent and the jumbo Fisher is certainly got them going in the right direction faster than a lot of thought and the twelve man's going to be wrong\nIf they have a though and [noise]\nYeah I I Know they've come close or they played Alabama respectfully there were no about a in a ... in Columbus and\nBut you know they they they look\nEither they looked in disarray at times in the Arkansas game or maybe Arkansas is a sneaky is bad team I've ever\nOr maybe they're thinking ahead to Kentucky yeah could be who would have thought that would be saying that not be talking about basketball\nI mean it's it's still certainly a team that that's got to figure out more consistency consistency on defence\nAh I think telling Monnett certainly played really really well but there's still some spots where you know we're not sure what he's doing maybe he's not even sure you got to find a consistent running game so I think Jim official has done a really good job of changing the culture with the team and certainly we saw it against Clemson because a year ago I don't think they're coming back down to you know ...\nThere's a there's a lot of competition but this next answer but I think I I Know where you're going to go but the most disappointing team in the SEC uh it seems like Mississippi State would would be wrestling a town on the flag right\nNow I I think Mississippi State fans would totally agree with that too and this was this was a school that I saw the beginning of the year\nWasn't going to beat Alabama but could compete against out there could be a team that you see is two or three in the west\nNow they're battling for fifth yeah I mean they they go through a strong feeling of games and if they lose to Auburn now you're talking three straight and that over in defense is going to be solved and this is an Auburn team now they're talking about that it's trying to get this ...\nThis game might as well just to have a good\nCry [laughter] except for guests when I was on if he loses because he's got all that new money you a way to bed whose man there will be a good [laughter] but I I Do think when you talked to a couple of coaches that I talked to some of this week in the FCC about Joe Morehead\nThe fit with the players the fit with the game at the beginning of the year you know that always an officer mastermind what the talent that Dan mall and left and he's going to be fine in the next ... Fitzgerald is certain\nBut who better than Joe more I mean when I talk to Nick over the summer he said the one thing I Love about this often as I Am more chances to take shots down field\nHe has not worked out as a pastor so far and figure it out a way to stop that run and put all the pressure on his arm and that's exactly what Florida at the end if your author and that's the same thing that you need to do\nBut yeah it was a home last tomorrow South Carolina is going to be vying for that honor to\nYes and it and I think with South Carolina that's still a team when you talk to people over there and they're still trying to figure out a way around the block consistently and stop the wrong and that was an issue certainly against Kentucky and that's going to be an issue that keeps going the season now we'll see what they're doing it the quarterback position this week but\nI still kind of saw South Carolina as maybe below Florida jealousy with Kentucky you know I still thought Tennessee was going to be down there and Vanderbilt this year but to me it's it's not necessarily a disappointment with the record but how they play a South Carolina has not been as can\nSit here on an statements Thursday we're we're the we're the we're the trendy teams of media does yes\nWe know trendy teams are trying to get an extra trend in big trouble the wrong direction and thank you very much great city of ... one of the best route ESPN we're up against a bright much more to come as a we still have an hour and change left to live in Gainesville, Florida\nIndividuals and businesses with tax problem exclusion carefully do you feel like you're losing control of your finances if you will over ten thousand dollars in back taxes or have\nAn file tax returns we can help you take back control the IRS is the largest and most aggressive collection agency in the world and they can seize your bank account Scott as your paycheck close your business and file criminal charges take control of your tax problem now by calling the experts at us tax shield and take advantage\nOf the fresh start program and new laws that may allow us to negotiate a settlement for the lowest amount possible\nOur team of tax attorneys and enrolled agents can stop collections and get you protected so you can take control of your financial future us jak shield offers a price protection guarantee quote to get you protected today us ... plus rated with the better Business Bureau so called now eight hundred six eight seven\nFifty one I Do that's eight hundred six eight seven fifty one Ninety two U.S tax shield eight hundred six eight seven fifty one Ninety two\nAn hour you're worn for sale person of him you wanted to join\nThe certificate why I put this company on the map and all like it as a piece of paper did you find yourself\nYeah well I uh you know a plaque or a little acrylic award or a trophy wouldn't have killed you you could have just gone to express marketing they make awards they do now custom blacks awards trophies lots of great ways to show recognition and appreciation or should have gone to express marketing da\nDa da da na ... set expressed marketing plan interstate driving cook\nYou'll want to check this out for everything from ... to custom engraved crystal in acrylics as always expressed marketing creates customs signs for indoors hand them\nIf you have a special gift you'd like to have personalized\nSum to express marketing and ... before you\nCome see us set expressed marketing on interstate ...\nAlways making you look good messaging data rate applied welcome to Coursera beyond my gateway to thousands of career advancing courses for many of the world's best universities so what can we do for you\nChris hair and the perfect way to my and my own pay ... amazing nights to help me mass production all the\n... almost doubled while I was learning course there is the reason I'm now a full stacked developer ... skills the I Know are in demand whether\nYou want to own your skills to your qualifications or switch careers of course there are provides access interactive learning experiences from schools like the universe\nLondon and you can join Coursera for free just tax trend to to to to side zero two sides zero\nOf course there is liberating because they let me take control of my education learn what I Want to learn and changed my whole life\nJoined course air for free text trend to to to to get around to zero Coursera your course to success ...

left for dead I mean and he should\nLearn first of all learn that it's a learning process that I have learned to be content a valuable lesson in desert times\nAs learning to ... and back in the past run we don't mean that okay I'm content I don't have any ... anything else a perfectly shows by the treatments that should not by ...\nYou know I didn't know that it took place and more we're not so easy for them or we're not talking about being complacent more tolerant of that being content you know and then ... I think last week or the week before do I we talked a little bit in this point about patients\nAll suffering and and and you know long suffering as a ... is a fruit of the spirit patience is a fruit the spirit and and I'm\nA and then we saw over there and he bruise I Believe it was a he Bruce twelve six it talks about for face impatience six twelve a Hebrew six twelve through faith and patients we inherit the promises and and part of it is contentment\nHas to be based on an inward spiritual force of patients that is working right along with face\nFace impatience rock power twins you'd have faith and a lot of people have faith a lot of people ... that you could have faces or grind mustard seed\nBut that force the patience working with them and said you know it's like plant and said you don't plant the seeds and go out and dig it up as safe as you grow it and yeah you're white and let let things happen so\nThat pay that force of patience is not just pulling your times is having a

and know that he is God\nAnd work the weeds out as you go in and be really the most important thing about that situation there to be content is\nLearn how to work that out of your own heart the frustration agitation the anxiety with other people to the hurt from other people the the the rejection that you feel from other people how to you process Saturday in your own heart\nThat you know like you said Paul was sitting in a prison cell when he wrote the U.S yeah and so learning to be content\nIs uh we we did quite a bit with that I think last week of the week before but that is one less than ... when you're going through the desert and we've got to remind folks\nThis isn't Libyans were Paul was actually in jail in the low it wasn't like the jails today a he was in the lower part of the jail where the sewer from the city ran through the middle of it I mean it was just a\nDreary dingy place at this point when he was in jail he's in jail a couple of more tired I think that they're in the last chapter vaccine was in jail maybe a little bit better but anyway he was in jail\nBut yet he wrote this later and said I have learned in one area that I'm I'm In there with the beacon and he said I've learned how to be a based on how to be exalted I've learned how to receive\nAnd and later on in that chapter ... there is that he wrote something that just sticks with me even
