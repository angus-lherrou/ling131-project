should be people that they're [laughter] okay sure everybody\nCan use of yes ...\nYear old when we come back we'll get serious example to drop out of shows they're listening to show off [noise]\nBut what I found really funny about this campaign was when I spoke to students on campus and said here's what the progressive student union is proposing how do you feel about that\nMany students didn't even think these concerns were relevant I talked to a student who works in our university library at George Washington and she said that her manager was a former ah employees student employees who had worked his way up and she also said that she gets it rains every single year and makes a high paying wage so\nIt made me wonder if these reforms were really necessary or if they're progressive student union it was just trying to tell the liberal party line of promoting this idea of social as\nA dress or understand what they're saying you have a I'll go to work and I'll do a job if you transport me there if you pay me worry and if you promote people from only where are you so you can promote them even if there is a better community outside you have to know that person\nThat is correct that is what they are advocating for 'em in the list of demands also includes unionization of all student employees I never idea of other radical I'm a campaign that they're promoting\nHold your ears for a second because I think this is so\nOkay so I just had to get better it's every marine do follow her at ... over on Twitter also go readers storage is a great reporter at a can of worms that\nOld but that's what his old English professor so senators do deserve your civility really so so what does that mean go beat them up but when my phone that's what this on\nA senator accuse me that's what the teacher is saying I'm and\nEssentially this professor university professor at onus tweeted that senators don't deserve your ability at restaurants on and that in addition to harassing them and heckling them and yelling at them you should get\nUp in their faces and stick your hand in their food and take their feet away from that this is what this professor is advocating for and history\nAnd in between uh actually is advocating for breaking the law that's what he's saying do is against the law disease you know it's more nothing although\nYou know it's not that I don't think he's smart enough to know that I'm sure he does know that but the question really is does he care and clearly he he does not have a problem with harassment of elected officials who he disagrees with\nBy the way that's all we happen to Republican senators would he be okay with that if I Do that to um to Dianne Feinstein would it be okay with you that the Cory Booker me busy\nI'm ... I'm sure it's just because people you disagree with and you know I've had this conversation with college students on campus who are totally fine with the harassment a GOP senator as well but it's been happening in recent weeks and I've asked them why is this okay\nAnd their response is that the Republican Party is trying to take away uh American civil liberties and then when I ask them what they mean by that they never have a good response they say something about Brett Kavanaugh on the Supreme Court and when you follow up with any logic out well can you point out an example of how civil liberties are being taken away or how your rights are\nBeing taken away they don't know what to say because the only train of logic that you don't you if the liberal talking points out immediately feeding them\nIt's a you're a great journalist so I'm not going to even pretend that I can give you a question to ask but if you run out of questions one day you're talking to one of these new fusses maybe actually pose this question can you tell me what a civil liberty is and then shut up and let the means to you because they don't know\nThey're just sitting on a key word that Bill Clinton and\nFor so many students you I speak to on a daily basis civil liberties are things like ah they consider abortion to beat her absolute right and they don't even want to entertain the idea that there could be um a different perspective on that that's a big concern on college campuses right now especially in the wake of the cabinet confirmations\nWell here's a great follow up to that asked them to show you abortion in the constitution and kill him that your weight or is that they show me where it is in the constitution [laughter] I'm I'm happy to see it\nOh I I Would be happy about that but the problem in many of them don't care about the constitution ...\nWhy are they talking about civil liberties have been a little even get that they're connected ... [laughter]\nRight you know I Know because the media doesn't connected for them and that's all they care and that's all they repeat\nIt's a ...

security adviser John Bolton\nA longtime friend of the show and John Kelly the chief of staff a and a former marine general strong words and the subject was\nThe question of the onslaught that's the president's words of migrants headed to the border you've seen the photographs or you've seen the video we have this report from the wall Street Journal late in the day after all of this anecdote about both ... and Kelly exchanging strong words\nPresident Trump is elevating the issue of immigration rights Alex leery of the journal which drove is twenty sixteen campaign with the aim of animating Republican voters in a midterm election that threatens to derail his agenda if Democrats are we take the house\nMr Trump's latest comments came Thursday as he warned about an onslaught in quotes of migrants reaching the southern us border with Mexico\nAnd threatened to deploy the military did Mr Trump if the caravan isn't stopped set this is certainly national security and John Bolton is the national security adviser John Kelly was homeland security secretary before the president asked him to be chief of staff\nI can I can imagine the real story here is much more fun than just strong words but we'll leave it at that\nThe demonstration on the border right now looks like a provocation\nThese people marching from well a hundred and sixty of them started out in Central America and they picked up or they picked up fellow travelers along the way it looks like a provocation and if I were to guess who this benefits it's some version of the Democratic party's idea of open

where it all began people always gravitate to the moment when he came down the escalator at Trump Tower but substantively when it comes to policy is immigration reform and securing our borders which\nBegan the whole Trump effects of course this this comes at a\nVery good time for the Republican Party you know the videos that are now going viral on social media over so called refugees all members of the town of being paid in cash\nIt certainly was it clear that they were eager to get whatever they were handing out\nRight so this this you know that this will be used by some Packwood superPAC as we get as the days count down from what is it the Nineteen or Eighteen rehab left so again this is you are absolutely correct a national security issue and it should be couch this stops

some vulnerable Democrats in using the issue is well Senator Joe Donnelly who's running for reelection in Indiana has run advertisements promoting his support for Mr Trump on immigration\nIncluding building a border wall while taking a shot at quote radical left over calls to abolish ice so\nIf a vulnerable Democrat in Indiana is worried about the as I can imagine the vulnerable Democrats in other red states are worried about this ... this is the Senate but that would also\nMean that vulnerable at Republicans in suburban districts that Democrats have targeted would cut can use this issue

not convinced shut the if they're going to lose the house I Know that historically the in party loses seats\nBut that that the law for the seat is often the Jew Decatur and whether that's going to lose the entire house when you actually ask the question rephrase it does the in party lose control of the house rather than just lose a lot of seats\n'em and change the the the the political nature of the house then that's not as common it's only three or four times\nSo I think they can lose twenty seats and that would be historically in line with what usually happens but not necessarily lose

case we're looking at has blah and Brazil Malcolm you asked a question it's yours\n[noise] yes first food good to talk to chose to begin or what do you think about the arrest of a a set of Barakat who is a key ... a blowout financier and what do you think the likelihood that we can actually affect the way to extradition to the United states as\nWell that that's actually the second question is actually really really important one let me get to that but you know I told them I ... that's a key get at the key get or um any any government really in the region and all that if we can actually in the United states to be very important as well I think honestly the most important for Argentina\nBecause the ... clan in in South America and old Lebanese clan that tied to Hezbollah that's in finance in not just to elicit narcotics and things like that but the bulk of finding the terrorist operation including the army attack\nIn Nineteen Ninety four which is why the Argentine government should talk to him first um so what are the chance that they're going to extradite him to the United states\nThat a U.S person that we'd have to charge him with something you hear in the United states them with money laundering or something but I'm pretty sure there's there's something that we can charge and what but I think that you're not going to be anything like that happened after the election in Brazil\nAh because I think we're going to see how the political makeup his in Brazil and then the it there's a time the opportunity to do to do so uh I'm not sure that's going to happen but I think this is a great kind of a a symptom of the success that we've been having a more recently because I think you know the Trump ... ... they're going to complete it\nIt'd be much stronger on that even though it's not very vocal about it they'd been very strong about looking at the tear finance networks all throughout the world and particularly in South America where they they they looked at ... very strongly in and try to work with regional governments to go after him\nLet's say in Brazil I'm reading the economist about Brazil there's an exciting election there in which a man who is described as a far right populist who managed to I\nHe is now leading contenders are he seems to be from the column of none of the above I don't know how to say his name correctly in Portuguese all said Bolsa narrow ... he is he is he going to be a help\nDisrupting the protection of bad actors or a hindrance because he's a ... you\nKnow I think he's going to be a tremendous help he he comes from that an establishment wing that's been a wave throughout the world that you know I was kind of a similar or seen that happen in the United states will be elected President Trump he he would that non establishment candidate he has a bit of a military background but not much of a political background\nHere he was that X factor no nobody really expected him to do much in the presidential race at the beginning of the of the election season but now he became the front runner\nAny any looking like he may may win on October twenty fifth when they when they go to the polls it'll be a closer election and the first round which was more candidates now it's just him and a guy named Daniel ... and and so I I Do expect them to win I think he went and if he does\nAh he's very close to two religious communities including the image eloquent Jewish community he's close to the military and he goes to other elements I think they have direction only correct on who's the bad actors in South America particularly Brazil and I I I think he will be a tremendous ally if he gets elected Malcolm\nA designated this week the ... as a top transnational criminal organizations giving more resources to targeting the ... and the drug cranking ah activities racketeering et cetera and what was little notice is that the department of justice created a subcommittee\nOn Lebanese Hezbollah and now has Ninety Days to get specific recommendations how to disrupt and dismantled ... transnational organized network so what do you believe are the most pressing items that they can do how do they prioritizes and how will the administration back this so\nI'm Glad you mentioned this novel is is a a you know with all the things are happening in the world and and here in the U.S as well this is very and use that and that really didn't get a lot of attention but very quietly tests that she's announce something that's a major move for those that are in the ... community\nHe put one of the

made it has less transactional commercialization now what does that do in Latin America that gives Latin America much more authority much more priorities to put has blend a different category 'cause they still struggling Latin America understand terrorism particularly Islamic terrorism\nBut they understand transnational criminal organized crime because they deal with it every day so there's a lot has to get a more of a priority among a regional governments or what do I think they should do I think a subcommittee this and has been formed within the department of justice led by a veteran prosecutor named ...\nI think that they should focus a lot of cases that currently exists\nThat are already on the docket of Hezbollah members whether involved in America trafficking money laundering counterfeiting or even ... like the one I'm involved with in Peru above mama della palm dark and put all the way to the department of justice to prosecute these cases and get successful conviction can

high standard of care and services tailored to your specific needs compassionate caregivers\nAt least publicly I think that the military to military and security cooperation is extremely important to to both parties but I'm seeing is vulnerable politically he has been consolidated his power\nAnd one of the things that Egyptian leaders are you know they go to the well on is a is Israel and painting Israel as an enemy and and and having to\nYou know have kind of national unity uh in in a confrontation with a with the Israelis I think this is a lot of rhetoric for public consumption but behind the scenes\nOr it strikes me that the security cooperation will continue if if only because the Egyptians really needed they've proven themselves to be benefits incompetent and trying to pacify their own territory in the Senate financial and needed a significant amount of Israeli help\nAh the thing is he still taking phone calls from Moscow\n[noise] boy I think without a doubt that the Egyptians are interested in developing their relations\nWith ... and that intention to use the port for the Russian fleet is that going forward\n[noise] I ... it's very controversial in Egypt to have foreign forces have an actual permanent basing or basing\nA arrangements in in Egypt but there is after you know thirty five almost forty years of relations with the United states there is a kind of was full romanticize Asian of the Soviet period in Egypt\nAnd there is a natural place for the Egyptians to want to play the great powers off of each other to extract as much as possible from these great power so [laughter] um I there is a there's a genuine interest in developing the relationship with the with the with the Russian Federation at the expense of the relationship with the United states we've\nSeen that the problem that many of our allies or so called allies in the middle east today face our economic problems you cited it it'd be force even Saudi Arabia\nAnd imprison people taking their uh their goods their their assets um in Egypt where the economic problems are chronic but also in Turkey and we saw hundreds of thousands of Turkish citizens\nHave sought residency in the United states just in twenty Seventeen to twenty Eighteen and many more in UK and elsewhere\nHow does or to one seat and what is the basis for the new turkey for the economic basis when he's losing and dismissing the academics in the universities and many of the others are are leaving\nUndoubtedly there was a brain drain out of turkey this ongoing purge that has\nAffected the lives of almost a million people when you think about um you know family members ... included with those who have been purged or detained or a jail pending trial we're talking about large numbers of people\nWhat it says done has sent a chilling effect through the business community which has now um moved assets outside the country but also kept their heads down\nSo uh I think that everyone has has cowed and intimidated the business community to the extent that um\nAssets all the same time it's extremely difficult to imagine the kind of dynamism that you had in the Turkish economy in the mid to thousands for example under a ... a under circumstances where\nEveryone is essentially leads a a an elected autocracy and the and the kind of repression that continues but the business community says it though will continue to soldier on but it's it's not it's not the same as it was when things were more open in in Turkey\nIn the province it has not been in the news because of the Saudi Arabia matter there is a report that the Russians and the Turks are patrolling the border and does this odd go along with the idea that it will be a just a permanent stain on his country or is he pushing for more action\n[noise] ah it's complicated but it seems that for now that agreement is going to hold but it really is going to do a\nA an operation in ... in it led rather than permanently put it off um the Russian military in particular\nFeels very strongly about cleaning up a little pocket they called it a a festering sore a of terrorists to an extreme is\nSo um there are also reports out of it ... that despite the kind of joint uh operations between turkey and Russia um that uh various extremist groups that which by the end of the month have to give up their weapons are refusing to do so\nUh and that would trigger response from the Russians and the Syrian Government and the Russians have been supportive of the Syrian government's desire to reestablish Damascus has control over\nA over the country so I I I think it is not in the headlines but I think it's going to come back into the headlines sooner rather\nThan later Malcolm a quick like could you tell them what is the impact of what happened with Saudi Arabia and the other countries in the region that particularly running and turkey are in in the war in Yemen will this habit direct impact will will ah ah Saudi Arabia to be reluctant to continue the bombing in the expense of aid\n[noise] I don't think so I think as long as ... wants to have a crown prince Mohammed bin Salman as the crown prince\nUh this is going to be

this a jumbo had a show dot com you can follow me on Twitter at Jim Botox\nWe will talk in this part of the program about the American role in the world and that is of course has been the subject of controversy from the moment this country was founded\nAnd it has increased in importance over the years as the size of the power of the United states has grown our responsibilities have grown and this old world of ours has shrunk because of\nThe jet aircraft in satellites and the Internet and the host of other factors we are a part of this planet and a major part of this planet whether we like it or not and so we're talking this evening\nWith Robert Kagan he is the freedom and senior fellow with the project on international order and strategy\nIn the foreign policy program at the Brookings Institution a columnist for the Washington Post author of a number of books including his latest the jungle grows back it's published by ... and some time America and our imperiled world Mr Kagan thank you for joining us tonight\nThank round me that's a quite a title the jungle grows back and what's the derivation of that\nWell if you think about the fact that you know the world have been living in for all its flaws it's been pretty good uh but you know there are forces out there in the world a forces coming from China and Russia\nAre around ... ... that you know want to sort of destroy the world and created and that's what I mean by the jungle growing back and we need to continually push back against the jungle or it'll it'll take us over the Gulf us\n... and now of course there is a a view that has a at various times been the stronger or weaker but it's never disappeared in that view I guess can be summarized as a none of our business\nNone of our business let's just to stay out of the world to uh keep an arm's length here will just sit back out on our own shores and make our country better and we won't we will go meddling is somewhat but at\nThe shore and I mean it's very tempting because of course it's costly to get involved in the world but I think what we learn in\nA in the Nineteen thirties when we we tried to pursue exactly that policy we tried to stay out of the world is that also play the world comes back and bite sauce and then we have to fight a much bigger war and spent a lot more money and cost a lot more lives so we need to take the steps when it when it's still possible to do so at a reasonable cost\nAnd that means to be steadily involved\n[noise] now another issue that often comes up an argument if you will countering the one that you make in the book the jungle grows back is that\nWhen we do get involved and we have the best intentions we seem to mess things up and then of course is a view that emphasize by those who will magnify our failures and and minimize our successes\nI I still have a hard time believing like better off if we had Saddam Hussein in power\nOr that would be yet another vicious dictator or that we kept now at people who are now carrying out assassinations or in other people's consulates like the head of Saudi Arabia or we would have Iran still and so you know we make mistakes of the country uh I certainly make mistakes\nOr in St Louis about what we should do but the real question it seems to me is a are we going to deal with the threats that are out there are way and uh unfortunately in the middle east there are real threats that we already have seen on September eleventh that come out and attack us and we'd have to deal with them they're rather than having to fight them here\nAnd to keep in mind also are the areas that were brought up by dock\nOne as regards Iraq Saddam Hussein did not only have programs of weapons of mass destruction but he used chemical weapons against both the Kurds and the Iranians he had a nuclear weapons program and let's not forget that\nAh as for a Afghanistan that was again the headquarters of al ... which was a so inextricably mixed with the government of the Taliban that it was hard to tell the two apart when U.S forces finally reached a\nUh cobble a in some cases or a Taliban government functions were funded\nBy Osama bin Laden and al ... money let's not forget that we had every reason to go in the problem I think we have in many cases\nIs thinking that we can do things like this are on the cheap and the quick\nParticularly the second the Iraq War the notion being that will go in will pull out the uh\nThe underpinnings of the uh Saddam regime and the entire country will rush to the notion of a free pluralistic western style democracy and as we have learned a lot of parts of this world a culturally have a hard time going down that road\n[noise] so that's\nExactly right and I think you know sometimes you know we we we learn the wrong lesson or whatever mistakes\nSyria where now we have Russian forces we have a rainy and forces and we have terrorists forces or you know threatening us our neighbors sending hundreds of millions of refugees are in Europe and I think you know we can't we can't do everything and we should be everywhere\nBut there are places where we're gonna have to address some of these threats or they will in fact affect us directly\nOne eight six six five oh Jim Boeheim when eight six six five oh five or six to six as we go to a Marty who calls in from east Texas hello Marty\n[noise] yeah Hi Jim uh it it's a I always enjoy your show you know it's like I'm I'm working on a thesis right now the historian that the arc of history actually is\nInevitable there was going to be somebody who discovered the new world there was going to be a country that um\nThat are not a country necessarily but there was going to be powers that\nMap to the world and that brought marketing pillows and and and commercialism around the world that we're going to map to where they were discovered the world that we're going to be part of the progress that brings us\nTo the point that we are today and I feel that is inevitable and America seems to be the ah the chosen vehicles or the inevitable\nA position that we find ourselves in the world today where we are combating a individualistic notions against a you know I'm collective is notions and that's that's\nSomething that I think is important to consider\nAll right let's let our guest to comment on that are your thoughts about uh the the arc of history if you will\nWell I I don't know about the arc of history because I think a lot of things are contingent and and I really do think they depend on human actions but there's no question that the caller's right to say that\nYou know the United states found itself in a particular position or that do other country was in an idle some of that had to do with geography you know we talked about\nBeing surrounded by two oceans which gave us a certain degree of security but it also gave us the ability to send forces and maintain stability in Europe and Asia and prevent or is there\nA that would eventually engulfed us and it gave us the opportunity to to affect an international economy in a way that benefited our roads so I think that you know there is something special about America and we shouldn't forget about it whether you know whether there's an arc of history I guess remains to be seen by\nA certainly United States has shaped history and whether it's within since well yes\nAnd then of course it is that this might be if there is an arc of history we certainly are ... yet in a position to be able to\nAh accurately predicted one eight six six five oh Jim bow and of course we are a available to be heard not only in our affiliates stations but also a jumbo hadn't show dot com which means or anywhere in the world and the skill joins us from the Philippines where it is a broad daylight pillow gill\n[noise] here's Jim I'm just want to comment on uh on on your guest's views on ... like a Korea and Japan has\nUm treaty ah arrangements are with the United states and under certain conditions we going to be a trip wire\nFor the U.S to enter into a into another major conflict with his his or Korea or or or Japan were attacked and a lot of people don't realize it or not that many years ago this was United States territory\nUntil Nineteen forty six that's true although in the case of a of the Philippines I'm not sure how many a potential major conflicts exist and that is to say no true just exactly how many country\nDays for they are they we we do have an ongoing problem with the Chinese building a well artificial island into\nAreas that are are are claimed as a either territorial waters of other countries such as the Philippines and Vietnam or a areas which should be considered international waters point taken\nHow I look at our guest commented about that that notion of a of the some of the a bilateral arrangements we have around the world with the countries such as the Philippines or with the Japan with the with South Korea\nAnd the possibility that that these arrangements might drag us into a large conflict and Robert Kagan\nWell I actually think you know are they actually have the opposite effect if we are reliable uh allies we will deter\nA China from attacking them whereas if we are pulled back and and and those kinds of stuff that\nWe will encourage Chinese attacks and then I think we'll get drawn in to conflict anyway I mean the fact that we are reliable allies out their means that we can maintain stability and maintain eat and not have to get into\nWar is if we think we could stay out of the conflict that involve China and Japan and Korea and all those other countries out there I think we're kidding ourselves we've already discovered\nA twice over the last half century that we can stay out of those kinds of conflicts\nAnd if we try to do so uh uh if we tried other words to go for quote the peace and honor now in our time we usually wind up with either one\nThat's right and you know people talk about or offshore balanced SARS but that's what we were in the Nineteen thirties the consequences of that oil up a fight on shore so I think it's better to ... the security arrangements\nStay with us or more

of a of a your thought process Robert Kagan\nA I guess we would have to define a further for strike I doubt that were of a mind to go around and let's say when they first a strike a nuclear option a full scale World War three type of should of option although my guess would be that there may be\nPlaces and circumstances in which\n... proactively engaging a problem before it gets worse and something less than the nuclear level might be on occasion beneficial [noise]\nYeah I mean we certainly I I we I Can't imagine those using nuclear weapons in a first strike that's that's not been our policy in it and it it is not going to be but but yes if if we saw a a crisis developing a that might result for instance in another terrorist attack or\nA in a in a war that we could forestall a by taking some action I think we have to be willing to do that as we have in the past and uh and you know try to do it as intelligent lives selectively as\nPossible but you can't rule out the possibility

highly competitive but I see a comparison in the original as say the tragedy of the commons\nAnd at times when you have people that are vying for specific resources a vote they will come to conflict rather than the compassion\nAnd unfortunately a classic example of people that are still deep rooted in hatred among each other is the conflict in the middle east because it's so biblical so I mean\nPeople just don't get along at certain points in times when they think something of of of value of for them or their their uh ethnicity is going to be taken away and jeopardize\nLet me offer a thought here about two areas that were bound to be conflicts forever one would be the war in Northern Ireland which of course did not last forever\nAnd other goes back to some years ago when I was working with a young woman who said that she wanted to go cover the next war and she was moving to South Africa\nAnd at the time I said well first of all I was just back from Vietnam myself I said I'm not so sure you want to cover the next war but knowing you maybe you really do I said if that's what you want\nThen that's probably as good a place to go is any the only place I could have put on a par with that I suppose was was somewhere in India or Pakistan well of course\nIndia and Pakistan have not had an all out conflict in quite a while and there never was a full fledged war in South Africa\nIn which the south Africans ever had to use those nuclear weapons\nThat they in fact a later admitted the existence of and dismantled so uh if you want to look at those conflicts alone or South Africa which is still troubled today to be sure but there's been no all out war there\nA Northern Ireland which still has its problems but again the vicious gorilla fighting has gone away and I'm not sure what Robert Kagan I Would buy the thesis that some conflicts can never be resolved\n[laughter] yeah well I mean I think the conflicts can be contained and that's what you know we've done for instance in Europe you know when I when you talk about the middle east and help people of Haiti show there forever in fighting each other forever\nOr you know in the Nineteen thirties that's exactly what people said about Europe and it was true you know Europe and the Europeans have been fighting each other for centuries and people said well how can how can we expect to bring\nEurope to peace and yet and yet we were able to now I'm not saying that that is you know whatever we did in Europe we can necessarily do in the middle east it it may be more than an effort that we want to make but I agree with you Jim that you know you can't look at any of these conflicts in Northern Ireland is a perfect example\nA and say that there's no way of of putting a lid on it maybe people might still hate each other\nOr not like each other but it doesn't mean that they have to be at war with each other and I think sometimes outside forces can really play a helpful role in that regard\nYeah and then they get I get it boils down to the fact that perfection is not the litmus test here things are made better I think that's a much more a plausible a litmus test for any course of action to

expect this year with a medical officer from the Centers for Disease Control large release of gross golf a lot of uh what are we expecting this year\nI Wish I could say I'm we wish we could say oh we can never really predict for the coming season\nWhat it's going to be like how severe it's going to be right now it's it's just too early typically in the United states um flu activity begins to pick up in the fall around October um but right now we just can't predict what the coming seasons going to be like and that's one of the reasons it's important to get vaccinated every year because we can never know how serious it is going to be\nExact and for those who say well uh I was vaccinated last year I was vaccinated in twenty third team that it's something they need to realize and that is the flu\nVirus was the very sneaky food which keeps changing honest\n[noise] yeah they are really little wonders and in terms of how they change on flu viruses change constantly um and that's one of the reasons that in most seasons as we move from one season to the next the vaccine has changed to reflect what is thought to be\nThe thing that we're going to be seen most of it in the coming season um so that's one of the reasons to point to get vaccinated every year\nLook look back to last year than the uh what kind of a season was that\nYes so last season that she doesn't Seventeen Eighteen season was a very severe season I'm One of the most severe seasons we've had in the last decade with an estimated nine hundred thousand hospitalizations and eighty thousand deaths\nUm we had one hundred and eighty recorded so far pediatric that's from last season\nAnd one of the things about it was that it was a season where um the activity was very sustained across the country for many weeks at a time and really affected all age groups across the age spectrum very severely so last season we did have a very severe one um\nAll of that said we can't really draw any conclusions or make any predictions about what we're gonna see going forward for twenty Eighteen Nineteen based on what happened last year\nIn terms of vulnerability I guess there is a cost\nFor the younger you are the more likely you are to be vulnerable\nTrue um there there are some groups that are more likely to develop severe disease if they get sick more likely to get hospitalized more likely to have that\n... and those are the very youngest in the very oldest um those under five years of age particularly those under two years of age and those sixty five years of age and older\nI'm old I said we we also know that there are individuals outside of that age group for example those with some chronic medical conditions are more likely to get severely ill\nAnd even with that said we also know that we really can't predict who could have you know if you take any individual\nWhat individuals are going to have a serious outcome what individuals are going to get sick enough to go into the hospital or die I'm even previously healthy people young adults can get severely ill children who have no prior medical problems can get severely ill from the flu\nIs there more than one vaccine available this year\nWe have a a good number of different vaccines that are available this year um the two basic types if you want to divide them into two broad categories are we have\nFlu shots and then we have um the nasal spray vaccine shots are given with a needle generally and they um are made either with no virus at all or with virus that's been an activated and killed so it can cause disease\nAnd then the nasal spray vaccine is one that's made with live viruses but these are viruses that have been weak and so they can't multiply enough to cause any disease\nOf course most of us are not at all competing to make that choice ah ah other than the cost factor and I wouldn't be one to scrimp on those which one was more effective at at least based on past years\nThat's a really good question and it's also one that's very difficult to answer because I'm\nOne of the many things that very about flu is vaccine effectiveness varies from season to season and that can depend on the person they're age their health status how good the matches between the vaccine and what's circulating and also can vary from one vaccine to another\nUm so the most important thing people can do is talk to their health care provider about what vaccines they have available and they can help select the right vaccine for you\nIn addition to taking the vaccine water other precautions we can play against flu every year we were told be sure to always wash your hands a lot\nWell CDC recommends a sort of a three part strategy for preventing flew um and also severe illness from flu and one of those things is to um get vaccinated every year if you're within the age group that's recommended\nI'm the second and and this is one that can help not just with flu but with a lot of the other respiratory viruses that circulate around the same time flew does um that's a\nEveryday preventive strategy is things like avoiding contact with sick people washing hands covering cops if you get sick yourself I'm avoiding contact where you can spread of germs to other people those can help again not just with flu but with other respiratory viruses and finally um\nIf you do get flu and your doctor prescribes flu anti viral medicines take those medicines\nAnd I I Would like to know again the age groups considered most susceptible to blue\nOne hour or online news talk Ninety four one dot com [noise]\nThe CBS News on the hour sponsored

reason at all he had been in the public eye for all these years and not one time that they call them those nasty mayors and they had a running against Hillary Clinton\nWell certainly there was a shall we say a major turnaround in it and when they want when he won\nThen obviously that is something that a major sector of this country has not come to terms with they cannot accept that he was making not accept the signs bills into law they accepted the dictates national policy in accordance with the\nThe constitution or this was a major problem for a minute it's been now two years and I'm not sure exactly when this was going to sink in ... yeah he really did win\nWilly willy with all of a complex Schmidt look at what he's a team within two years have done more than Obama could do an eight year but they don't like that I can understand President Trump is not\nA career politician is a businessman I always say if you want to know what's going on with the body look ahead at the hands of

at a at a rally held on for a candidate Trump and President Trump how did you come to the attention of the Trump campaign\nOut of all I can tell you that somebody from it kept me out for us\nUm and it just it's so he came in North Carolina there was no way they was going to be in North Carolina we not be there\nSo it was a race for us to be at one of his rallies he invited on his day to day but

correct Donald Trump he's just a real person if you remember before he ran for president\nI mean he ... he looked at who he hung out with the real people like he was not even a a billionaire he hit the building\nYeah I Know what the people and the people he was because the U.S had\nSaid Oh yes he hurt us and if you look at it even right now in his presidency he's bypassing all of these organizations and taking it directly to the people nobody bought him he's not beholden to\nHollywood or the lobby is nobody bought him a paid him off he's only beholden to the people that voted him in

'em so we got them I'm just trying to catch up to date on the ... the very latest on this but I was very surprised John Brennan\nA longtime CIA director long time in the CIA yeah he was the CIA station chief in Riyadh Saudi Arabia\nBack in the nineties and he was there when the ... towers were bombed and I'm Nineteen\nUs service members were killed him that he's a he has a degree in um ... government with the concentration Middle East studies he speaks Arabic fluidly\nShow he knows those people\nAnd he was on a ... a with Chris Hayes last night on MSNBC and he says that the leaked information is coming from turkey\nFor sounds like some of the details of being provided to the press that someone has this intelligence to finding its way out\nThe fact that this ... in Turkey um I think indicates that the church might have been able to acquire some information some intelligence about what transpired at the ... when the shows you with their\nTheir surveilling well that's a good question I think a logical conclusion well if they would be able to acquire this this information somehow whether or not the Turks themselves doing other people are doing I don't know I don't want to speculate but clearly something's coming out of that costs less\nYes so see I mean there's Chris Hayes trying to Bush I'm going to act out and I don't I mean it's got to be ... and and and did you hear John Brennan man he was backpedaling as fast as he\nGo on and on I don't want to say I don't want to I don't want to speculate\nWhy you know as much as I criticize John Brennan over a variety of things\nCongratulations Mr Brennan you're you're you're not many people are willing to hold off until they get the facts or he was asked about a U.S intelligence on this and he of course points out that we don't rely a you know our intelligence work on just one source\nFive I think that the U.S intelligence has a pretty good read on the situation now from a variety of sources and not just the media and the press thrives what's coming out\nBy interacting with their Turkish counterparts as well as with other liaison services that might have some insight here talking to some of their started counterparts and various means of a collection whether it be technical or otherwise\nYeah in other words we probably have already have the information on what happened\nWhen you said we're not waiting the U.S is not going to wait around for the Saudis to investigate themselves\nWell it's about two weeks just shows you went into that costs less than over the past two weeks I Would suspect that the CIA and it's just her agency is going to any\nHave been collecting information processing analyzing it and providing that information to the national security advisor and to Mr Trump and others\nSo I mean they're not going to wait until this investigation that the Saudis say is underway is completed they're going to be providing them regular updates and when I was a CIA as well as with the White House there was constant interaction on issues such as this that have true implications for you is that\n[noise] so what he's saying is President Trump probably has already been briefed on what the our intelligence people know which makes me wonder is President Trump\nOh ... or is he being busy doing to cover up for the Saudi royal family back to Brennan he says Saudi Arabia and he knows that country he says they've done stuff like this before\nWell if you look back in ... history I think there have been chapters when the Saudi intelligence Kurdish services did engage in these types of\nViolence extrajudicial types of activities against Saudi just will not solve these [noise]\nAh my interactions with the Saudis during the last ten to Fifteen Years is that we were working very close with the Saudis and tried to professional asked them\nMaking sure they understood that their obligations are to ensuring that the maintain those security a stability of the kingdom\nBut do it in a manner that's not going to be inconsistent with the norms that until those Kurdish services need to follow I'm not saying that the Saudis see no did not engage in some things that we would find um um awful [noise]\nUh during the past Fifteen Twenty years but I Know that under the previous heads of the services such as the former crown prince Mohammed bin Nayef we work very closely with them and\nI Would never ever expect something like this especially something as horrific as this to take place under his watch\nSo he's going I don't think they did it and then he was asked did Mohammed bin Solomon was he involved\nI think it was my pencil operation that was directed\nBy Mohammed come on because he had such a\nAn overarching control over all intelligence and security matters in Saudi Arabia and all of the services there and something like this as a basis as it was to carry out this action against the U.S residents journalists the Washington Post and I saw a diplomatic mission

it is\nThis is the executive director of the Pennsylvania Democratic Party forced to resign because he posted on social media I stand for the flag I Neal for the cross I'm not making this up\nOr Salvadoran that's the hard way cells wasn't simply a loyal Democrat he was the head of the Allegheny county Pennsylvania Democratic Party also a military veteran you think should be allowed to stick up for America once in a while but now he made the mistake of writing this in a Facebook post quote I stand for the flag and yell at the cross\nNo not so long ago most Democrats would've nodded in agreement that today is hate speech and he lost his job but tonight their losses are gaining Marsalis joins us now\nMark thanks for coming on the show um did I miss state that I mean did you have to leave your job running the county's Republican rather Democratic Party because of those words on Facebook\nAnd again also a military that I stand for the flag I knew lived across loses his job\n[noise] well I was the executive director of the county party um and yes basically that's exactly what happened because of that post which reminds you was over a year ago that I rise to that uh I was asked to resign yes\nSo you're a veteran you say you stand for the flag and you were denounced as a racist for that\nCorrect the people who brought this to light tried to tie it to the NFL players taking a knee\nSo I I look I'm confused I'm I'm not a democratic voter never have been but you know I've been here a long time not a lot of decent patriotic Democrats doesn't seem like that long ago\nIt wouldn't have been weird for the head of a Pennsylvania democratic county party to say I stand for the flag and Neal before the cross would it have been five even\nRemember this is the the party DNC that blew the inclusion of God in their platform number that\nYears ago a crazy thing to say\nAbsolutely not and and I can tell you that even just last year when the Pittsburgh Steelers decided to stay in the locker room instead of come out for the national anthem\nOr one player villain a waiver who's an Army Ranger came out and stood by himself with his hand over his heart and he was not considered a racist so this even as much as a year ago or it would not have been unheard of to hear somebody a leader in the party defend the flag\nSo what I mean you're the executive worthy executive director of the party you obviously know a lot of Democrats in your town in traditionally democratic county what if what if your ... your former coworker said to you since this happened\nI haven't heard from any of them I understand the party line is that is a personal matter and I can respect that however those that are elected officials or party members who are not tied with my direct sort of chain of command if you will I have not heard from any of them\nThat's a shocking what is the saving you about how the parties change\nWell it makes me wonder if ah there is room for moderate Democrats in the Democratic party nowadays um there were some elected officials who said that they acknowledge that they've known me and I'm not a racist however it wasn't sensitive and unfortunately\nIf my patriotism and standing up for family friends has become insensitive or that I think we as Democrats need to stop and reevaluate exactly what we stand for\nStanding up for the flag is considered racist then what happens to the country do you think going forward [noise]\nThat's a good question I'm a little worried about that\nWhen are you going to do well um I'd like to

right that in the house and Senate um that people are angry about this I think President Trump understands that there's a lot of anger out there [noise]\nUh but but again it's it's it's not that this

of what happened what was the breakdown why didn't we know more as as he is he walked toward that conflict or from which he would never merge white and we know more\nAnd you in your column today go with some of the questions you want answered for example did you know you want to know if our intelligence agencies knew that he was being targeted pursued like this\nReally in danger like he was you up some stations do you\n[noise] well I Do ah the ... so they're they're two possibilities one is that we knew and people didn't act in a timely way and what they know and that really bothers me but

but we don't know much about how he's operating so we we don't have that visibility so that's got to be fixed that that's just not that's not a good situation\nFor us to to walk blind into something that was as disastrous is is so I think this is what the congressional oversight committees were were were created for small it's just like this they should they should it's it's a very secret\nI wouldn't expect to hire anybody else in the media would hear about it but I think they should review everything that was produced as ... you know take the psychological profile of NBS which\nCertainly is a CIA responsibility\nBut you know it should be reviewed that ... was it straight up what was the reaction of of people in the White House when they were when they were told us where they cautioned this is a volatile personality I could go down the list that Brian of all the questions I think should be\nShould be asked again there should be asked in private and asked in a bipartisan away but this is one where we got to get it right\nYeah I don't don't people bikinis not enjoy it's the prince and you say that if the prince who's going to be removed NBS who's going to be removed you say in your last point your column that they are that the people are rallying around prince ... bin ... the last remaining son of the founding king a a kings odd\nSo he and do you think that might actually be a change in leadership because of this\nI think it's way too early to say that ah I just think that that our intelligence agencies should be should be doing due diligence to see what's what's going on [noise]\nUm this is a moment we're in truth is king Solomon not MPs who's running the show he has in under the Saudis system absolute power and he can make decisions as he sees fit and if he decides that the kingdom\nIts future are in jeopardy or with the current leadership under him he's going to act I mean the one thing I've seen of the ... over many many years watching them\nIs that they know how to play the politics the survival\nAnd you know sometimes I make pretty cold blooded decisions so um you know king Solomon is the person to focus on prince Ahmed uh I had missed it there are other uh surviving sons of the three of them including some on [noise]\nBut but prince I'm at is the one who um all the Saturdays I've been talking to us two weeks or you know he's a person and we think represents the values the kingdom and so does it does and I don't get me wrong abroad is not a big movement people ... are being very\nCareful there was just watching the way to David but they're waiting for us\nThat's interesting and we're waiting for them to do their own investigation even though we probably have all the answers already\nWe have a lot of answers but they need they as

they come out of this investigation is actually a ... wage Democrats and Republicans in the house and Congress\nSo so I think this is a rare moment you know we've had these very partisan into intelligence ... and the house of Russia you know let's just put that aside for the moment and let's say agree that we have\nChallenge Iran which I think are good and on Saudi Arabia Saudi Arabia's strict so we can we got to get it right and I think Democrats or Republicans are are going to agree on that so\nThat writes starting point is to have a solid foundation of intelligence\nAbout about the place the people and the policies and everybody can agree on that and I hope I hope the White House would support it and say yeah we agree with this this is the right for the ride starting point you know the Saudis after their investigation but this one we have to do\nA size or not a partisan issue shouldn't be a partisan issue\nBy Leslie I think the listeners need to know how well this administration has been working with Saudi Arabia to achieve mutual goals on like the previous administration they're all in\nSo we're helping them with the who the rebels supported by Iran where we are the Saudis are helping us to help bring around to the table by hurting their economy the best they can and the end result would be starving Hezbollah Hamas\nUh then and maybe settling things down in Syria and the Israelis and Saudis are working together under the wire like they never had before so there is a lot at stake if I miss dated anything\nNo use everything you said is correct or we

will make homes and people in them safer make the structures more solid I went and toured\nA neighborhood in Holland that is an area subject to flooding a lot of Holland is below sea level and they now have these homes for flood blown error prone areas that I went to see that the homes rise with the rising water\nAnd the cost of constructing them no higher than normal construction it sure is

the unexpected\nA lot of these things don't cost\nIn many cases any more money\nOr just little amount Soto incremental amounts to make a structure much more robust make it safer\nAnd eliminate the

but Howard said to call the state\nThe insurance and I said that's a great idea so I gave them a call ... after a few departments or later I finally spoke with somebody in in the lady said that she can almost guarantee that that wouldn't happen\nThere's nothing in the law that prohibits said at this time so there was a law passed a decade ago for him it'd your DNA from being used genetic testing for being able to ... be used for health insurance but since then as more and more\nInformation has become available through genetic testing and how easy it is for people to do it the law has never been updated to cover\nLife insurance long term care disability insurance and so this is an area that the feds need to be all over in the Congress\nAnd not permit genetic discrimination\nSo I don't know I don't know anybody doing it yet just like you were told by the person at the state insurance department emphasis on yet\nThat's what I was afraid of because of that I had actually called the last ... specifically said it was a note for a for a genetic test for and I think the lab and if they didn't have instructions to do that I think they would do if\nThey would not do that and you know there's there's a question so many of us like me I've done twenty three and me and done ancestry dot com and there's so much information out there and their crimes being solved where people who haven't even participate in genetic testing\nAre being found by other people's results who've done genetic testing so this is a bit of a Pandora's box and the law is behind on it and and so far\nSo far don't worry that anybody is doing that diabolical early in the insurance industry\nSo basically I commend and getting my insurance ASAP just in case I get genetic testing down the road they find

[noise]\nI've got a new technique yet another one for you to use when you love to travel and you just want to know what deals there are so let's talk about you ripping yourself off\nThere's a new study that's been published by the oil rig a consulting outfit and they found that people doing four O. one K. loans\nDecimate your future financial security and retirement\nIt's very common that employers will make it super easy for you to do a loan from their four one K. plan\nAnd the philosophy of employers historically has been hey if we locked down our four one K. and people know they can't touch the money under basically any circumstances\nWhen they're going to be afraid to contribute enough money to save for retirement\nBut the reality is a lot of people do take loans out from four one K.\nAnd depending on whose survey data you believe it's a very very common thing for people to do four one K. loans and typically somewhere twenty twenty five percent of people will do four one K. loans\nBut the thing is when you do that those loans dramatically reduce\nHow much money you have down the road\nAnd in fact you may find that\nYou will have to do away your retirement years down the road that you'll have to work any of a number of additional years to make up for the last earnings from that four one K. loan\nThat's even when you pay the loans back and you may wonder how could that be\nWell there's a two for here when you borrow from a four O. one K. you have to pay back the plan right\nAnd so while that money is not invested in most Sears Holdings in for one case go up so you lose the up escalator on that money that you borrowed\nAt the same time\nYou usually will reduce what you contribute to a four one K. moving forward\nBecause you're having to pay so much money back to the plan to pay that loan back\nSo you don't have the cash flow to both pay back the loan and contribute so then think about what's happened you got money that's not invest it for the time period it takes to pay it back and you're investing less\nThat's that's the story\nOkay I Will tell you don't even think about getting involved in that because that is there is no true product or service that's being sold\nHere but it's just speculation that at some point people will be able to use these electronic coins and that sounds to me like that could very dangerously ended up being an

taken a show enjoy all the glitz and the lights and all that but don't get involved in something that may well turn out to be\nAn illegal pyramid Ponzi scheme and illegal game of chance and ah [noise]

grass is growing\nAnd you'll be able to see what deals there are from that continent to the United states\nSo this is just one other tool there is no one place to find all the deals out there but here's three sources if you're like me that the deal drives the destination\nIs with us on the Clark Howard show hello ed\nYes good afternoon clerk that we want to talk about transportation what are you thinking of doing\nWe do okay my wife and I are retired couple here we're leaving ... live in a central Florida\nAnd we've been on a few cruises the now that we're retired down here in Florida but we plan on going on a cruise but also uh we'd like to uh find out what sites are available for people that live down here because we're retired we can go on short notice a few days notice if there are\nAre good deals\nThat you can get on a you know last minute the cruises\nParticular that people who have that flexibility use and one that's very popular with people who do that is one called cruise credit\nAnd when you get to the main page there's a deal section and the most popular part of the deal section is last minute cruises and it's a cruise lines can dump their unsold inventory on ships at the very last minute\nAnd you'll find\nThat if you can be opportunistic like that and fire crews at the very last instant that that's a great way for you to do it also have you ever been to the website cruise compete dot com\nYou know I haven't said Cruz compete you can put what you're interested in doing and cruise only agencies and literally compete for your business\nAnd so many times they may be willing to give up some of their commissions um you know in order to be able to sell you at a lower price\nOkay that sounds pretty you know talk like last minute as you said on the website there are they talking a few days or like a\nGenerally with rose last minute is less than three weeks before sailing\nOr less okay less than three weeks\nBecause you'd think that most people that are buying a cruise they're not like you they're not living gosh if you're in central Florida you're fifty minutes or so from Port Canaveral which I think is the biggest\nUs crews port now there's a lot of ships sail out of Tampa that are like probably Ninety minutes from you and people in South Florida Miami Fort Lauderdale\nAcross the Everglades in Naples Marco Island they do these last minute deals and so it's very common practice\nFor for ... to do these last minute bookings 'cause you don't need air but most people\nAre living who knows where in the United states or even in Canada or overseas or whatever and they've got to make advanced plants so once you cross that Twenty one day period that's when you see so many of the deals\nOkay very good and the most of the large cruise lines they'll participate or\nNot necessarily it varies I'm looking right now on what's available on the thing I was talking about and they're showing a lot of cruises that are just in the next couple of days\nThat there are real deals on those that are about yeah about three weeks out there are great deals on and they show you how much a percent discount there at but I don't ever believed discount\nFrom a cruise line I only care about what the prices and comparing the price from one vendor to another\nOkay very good well I appreciate your help a lot\nCloser and have a great time and remember always join whatever frequent guest program there is for each cruise line and you go on because you accumulate enough points which you can easily do living in Florida now\nThat you start getting all kinds of benefits like maybe if you like to drink free liquor onboard don't do that before you fly um anything that makes it a better experience like free cabin upgrades those kinds of things that are available as you accumulate points on particular cruise lines\nKelly is with us on the Clark Howard show hello Kelly how are you\nHi ... I'm great how are you\nI Am having a wonderful day thank you what's going on Kelly\nWell my husband and I are finally getting around\nAnd ... we have to special needs kids actually yellow adults and we have no idea how much to put into special needs for\nThe amount of money potentially to set aside could be quite large and if they are young adults I gosh I don't know the sensitive way to ask this question so I'm just going to need to ask gays okay I Know what\nYou're going to say they have to ... to live [noise] it'd be a hundred years old [laughter]\nHow did you know that was what I was gonna ask he has\nA lawyer asked that same day so he said I don't know how to ask that so\nI I should just put that in there before you even had to ask [laughter] okay so we need to be prepared\nThat a you know could live you know\nAll right well a long time what people normally do is the first thing you do is for each of the kids you establish a five twenty nine able if you're familiar with five twenty nine ... if you saw a lawyer a that was probably explain to you\nAnd down I ... now I don't remember\nWhat it would have five twenty nine able is is it's an account where you're able to put money in for each of their children the gross tax free and spin on their needs is spent tax free\nOkay so the first money you put aside for a disabled child should always going to enable\nOkay and they vary in cost or because they're sponsored by states in some states have very very low cost tables and others have more expensive ones it's almost like a cousin of the five twenty nine college savings plans I'll talk about\nOkay the best briefing available in the country on buying an evil is saving for college dot com\nOkay and I know this isn't about college but they've done a very nice job breaking out the the cost for the able accounts\nOkay so if you go there you'll be able to see is a very simple chart you'll be able to see how the plan works and I want to congratulate the people saving for college dot com for doing such a nice job on that\nBut that would allow you to put aside it didn't answer your question how much money should you have instead I jumped right to this is the most efficient place for you to start putting money\nAs far as how you'd find in overall need for a lifespan that might be another potentially Seventy or eighty years\nTerm life insurance is almost certainly the best choice with the money going into a trust for the benefit of each child to separate trust\nTo go in ... uh living trashed\nI'm well it'd be if it's going to be for life insurance the warrior you've talked to would tell you exactly what kind of trust you want it structured into\nOkay and you have some meaningful expense and drawing up the trust that the life insurance would fine okay but because the the financial need if you were to die much younger than normal\nAnd you have a larger number of years that the kids have to be taken care of you need to have a hefty term life insurance policy\n[laughter] how is your house or perfect [laughter]\nSo that's perfect this is a great opportunity and I hate to ask you another impolite question how old are you\nI'm fifty two\nOkay that means that you are guaranteed that policy for the next Twenty years\nAnd that they would provide a benefit for that time now the question comes what happens after that time right so that becomes more difficult because the alternative is to buy what's known as a whole life insurance policy\nThat we'd be was referred to many times and the insurance business as permanent insurance but the premiums on it might be cost prohibitive you can't insure against every possibility\nSo I don't know if buying a permanent policy would be possible within your budget\nBut I Would say that combination of insurance going into a trust for the benefit of each child would be really to insurance policies to trust potentially and doing the five twenty nine able would be the right combination that I Would recommend\nNext news in one hour or an online news talk Ninety four one dot com [noise]\nNew CBS News on the hour sponsored by Sarah works relief\nI'm Pam culture shock the odds are against you more

sense stuff of staying out of debt and being on a budget and learning to save money and all of that kind of thing\nThen what happens from time to time as the schools can't afford the basic resources and so someone will come along side and the community of business or an entity of some kind and we'll pay for that high school to have\nFoundations in personal finance curriculum from the Ramsey organization is that we've got about four million students go through one of the coolest things happened lately is the University of Wyoming\nHas decided that every high school in the entire state of Wyoming needs to have this curriculum and they're sponsoring it in paying for it\nDang dang touchdown baby that's how that happens the college university says we're going to take care of these high schoolers in our state and make sure they learn about money and of course the University of Wyoming is the best\nCost alternative in the Wyoming area to go to college so this all works out really

things\nFor students to be able to apply that college search and uh and and be a real fatty consumer of higher education\nYeah because you guys do have low tuition I mean you're you're you're you're the best deal round I wasn't getting right\nYes there we are we have the lowest resident tuition at any public institution that grant doctoral degrees anywhere in the United states\nOf all fifty states of all the ... so like you were cheaper than my University of Tennessee you're you're cheaper than the University of dot dot dot that's correct wow very cool very cool and I got to tell you when I heard what your whole promotion was behind this\nI immediately wanted to steal it and bring it and use it somewhere in like in the University of Tennessee and I'll tell you were doing a few minutes but I Will get them to do it yeah you guys are creative I Love this tell everybody about this uh about this campaign and the the motto for the campaign is hands down the best thing I've heard\n[laughter] so that our our our campaign is called the world needs more cowboys ... we're not talking about guys and cowboy hats that ride off into the sunset but we are talking about a state with a long heritage and a university mascot and\nA cowboy that can be\nAnyone from any gender any background but we're talking about that in her spare we're talking about a curiosity and independence of boldness\nAt pursued that adventure and we're talking about someone who changes landscapes and and food for opportunities to make differences in the world we are talking about trailblazers and people examples the spirit of the underdog you know\nIt's not a cowboy isn't what you are but it's who you are\nYeah well and you guys are ...\nSo that means you're mascot right vessel decorate your football team your basketball team whatever's the cowboys I mean like my University of Tennessee Volunteers I think they ought to steal it inside of the world needs more volunteers that makes it just as much sense right and so as a good play on words but you you guys got you got to the table first where this way to go man I Love it\nIt's a great motto or does it says so much in unjust are so few words very very cool well we're really grateful to all of our sponsors around the country that are helping us and you got sponsoring the high school every high school in Wyoming is going to have\nAs a coming up soon the the high school curriculum because the cowboys paid for it [laughter]\nThat's pretty cool guile thank you man\nWe're happy to be happy to be a partner we uh we are we are a state that is very practical were state that very much um applicable in terms of being smart with our money and we wanted to make sure that we were not leaving out our opportunity to educate the future generations\nAnd know that there are opportunities in higher education to be smart with your money to be smart about that investment in your future and the University of Wyoming is a way to do that and we're we're helping helping our students in our future generation and the state of Wyoming through the Ramsey education product\nWell it's one of those when when when things as far as I'm concerned because you're you know you're you're helping them by sponsoring this ... going in there we're blessed because you're doing it with us and we appreciate that\nAnd the win is is that you get

I feel like I might one of the worst mistake some a lot of [laughter] I was wondering if you could give me some advice on how it would affect me if I were to return a leash car\nDealership or at this point do just keep the vehicle or none of the above\nWe take her car back that you owe money on or signed a lease on that's effectively\nA voluntary repossession and that that would be dumb because they're going to sell the car after they've repossessed it and the other an already possession lot\nAnd then they're going to sue you for the difference if you don't pay them the difference immediately\nAnd you don't have the different schools you're broke so I don't know that would be a dumb idea we're not going to do that [noise] um what we are going to do is find out two pieces of information one is called the car free ... company that you are paying the ... to ...\nAnd find out what the early buyout on the car is\nNow the early buyout is different than the total of your lease payments ... value at the end\nIt should be less because you're these leases are very new and there should be it's kind of like an early pay off I'm Alone it doesn't include all the interest from the time that you know from keeping alone the whole time show the early buyout\nThey can get the title in your hand then you compare that to KB dot com Kelley Blue book dot com private sales what the car is actually worse\nAnd I'll just make up some numbers let's pretend that the early buyout is twenty thousand and then you look it up in the car is actually worse sixteen thousand that would leave you four thousand dollars in the whole it's probably not far off of what you're going to find\nShelter four thousand dollars in the home and you sell the car for sixteen you've got to put four thousand dollars cash with the sixteen in order to get the title for the buyer\nAnd so um you have to have that other four thousand dollars you have to be able to cover the whole the journey and the amount that you are upside down in the way you would do that is obviously alone and so you start working with your local credit union with your local bank\nAnd you get a loan lined up for the amount that you're upside down and you put the car up for sale and you sell the car\nFor as much as you can possibly get for which is more than they will show at four in the report a lot to the bottom line is you're going to be responsible for this difference either way but the differences greater and you do more damage to your life and lose more control of your life by doing a repossession and so\nYou cover the difference cover the amount that you're upside down with another loan and I'd rather you'll be four thousand dollars in debt than twenty four thousand dollars in debt or whatever the numbers are show a day room she told you to borrow money no diver and she's telling you to move some of the debt and get rid of the majority of the debt by doing that\nAnd so you borrow and cover the amount that you're upside down [noise]\nYou know guys we've been talking a lot about this millionaire mindset around here and why it's so important to be intentional even with the little things there is one

I I guess down is the the easiest way to shape to have the mood around this program the fan base is very agitated understandably show you know about the dollars and cents\nWith with everything that plays into that and understandably so but ... I was happy to address that with us and said you know there is highest in this profession there's lows in this profession we've been through all of that before it's time to get refocused for this week and try to snap losing ...\n... am I realize your job there is to set the table but on this program and just talking to Auburn fans all week\nUh they're down they you know it just because you talk about things I was I mean it's reality but there's almost since ... among them that are lost tomorrow and the damage broken uh there's no there's no putting the water back in and I know that's difficult sometimes a before game to talk about because that game starts going getting away from them\n... you I think you'd be able to read it on the sidelines\nI Would agree with you Paul because the three game losing streak is a rarity fraud and has it happened and I think six years at this point so to have this type of Skid Row program with such high expectations and that's the biggest reason for all this fall is because there were such high expectations when you when when you get lifted\nTo cloud nine for for various points of the year you're a top ten teams are starting to you're in the top ten you beat a really good Washington team or to open up the season you are considered a contender not for the SEC west not for the U.S\nGentle champion and to get dropped off of that\nIn such harrowing fashion it seems like in the way that they've\nHad to suffer through that the last couple of the games to be flat offensively against Mississippi State\nAnd to suffer the laws they did against Tennessee I I agree with you Paul I think Jeremy ... it's a great coach I think he's going to get things figure it out there his mentality when he gets the right personnel I think that's going to be a dangerous program and the SEC again\nBut as far as the perception nationally and probably around the SEC is concerned when Tennessee is viewed as not\nA top tier SEC team for the time being and you lose at home pretty handily I Know the score is probably a little closer and then the game really was\nThat's going to really shift how this portion of time is perceived so at three game losing streak I agree with you wholeheartedly it feels like this is a broken bunch if they lose three interrupt\nOn the other side of that or a as I'm Talking to you and you mentioned being eligible for the record all Mrs appeal has not been turned down although most people think it will be a this the idea that almost is five and to and including those two is Alabama or what am I missing that I didn't I didn't expect that [laughter]\nI don't think a lot of people do but it's it's a lot of credit to Jordan to ... and this off into a a this off ... long ago the office of coordinator\nHow they've developed a running game they've only had five different running backs and their entire programs history run for a thousand yards they have a thousand your potential back in Scotty Philips on this roster we know that decay Metcalf has done for the season truly unfortunate laws\nBut as emotional is this team was all week about the loss of met cap they were still high end their praise of braille and standards of sophomore who AJ brown calls asleep or this kid is a threat and he's averaging twenty yards per catch in in limited duty this year he's expected to step up and they still have to Marcus lodge\nAny Jay Brown so this is it off and forget the SEC this is one of the best passing all fences and all the college football this is a Mike Leach style air raid that Phil long ago as a disciple love he really takes a lot of those concepts and makes it exceptionally difficult for defense is to try to stop these big wide outs that they have on the perimeter to I'm always been great\nI Know you're you're probably have a difficult time telling allies you fans in Alabama is in Knoxville and there'll be in Baton Rouge and a couple of weeks but they they better not be looking ahead Mississippi State has been hot and cold this year but they can be a just ask allergy fans if they if they remember what happened last year thanks for joining us and give us the scene down there\nWell there's no question Paul that had or drawn is certainly aware of the emotions of how they got beat a year ago it was a it was a singer to their football team or they haven't forgotten about it this is a a roster\nThat seems to deal with ... well they seem to deal with people patting them on the back well they just go about their business they've gotten better and better better each and every week during the middle of what are they for game gauntlet as you referenced in two weeks having to take on Alabama but this Mississippi State team\nGetting back on track versus Auburn getting back to their core of being a quarterback centric run football team\nHas given them their confidence back Joe Morehead I think he tried to work through the ... game that he wanted to have tried to include a little bit more of the down field pass and gain that he'd like to add to compliment the run but at the end of the day he realized Nick Fitzgerald's not progressing in that area we got to do what he does best to go back to the drawing board\nAnd they rush for three hundred and forty nine yards against all burns defense so there is no secret here in death valley what LSU on defense is going to have to do if they hope to come out Victoria's against the bulldogs\nLet's let's talk about let's start with Joel borough because ah I I don't know where they would be without him you know some can quibble or or criticizes numbers but you you know his importance give us your take on with him or without him where with this program bay [noise]\nWell I think they saw enough in miles Brennan when he played a year ago so I'm In the spring where they felt confident and comfortable that you know he could gradually come along and be a pretty good player until job or oh God on campus\nAnd then they felt like they had a little more majority maybe a little bit more football ... in terms of understanding what's asked of him within the ... and how he was going to direct the other pieces of the puzzle because the players around job rural right now are are pretty young particularly at the office of skilled positions\nThey have been down or the titan position due to injuries that they haven't been in the normal personnel groupings off into coordinator Stevens makers had to work around some things and as a result\nThey become a little bit more multiple in Joe borough is earning the trust of this coaching staff earning the trust of it or drawn in the sense that he's going to come into this game on Saturday Night and he's going to have more responsibility with you off and\nHe's going to be given a little bit more freedom to make sure that he's making the right call or maybe more over getting out of the wrong call and getting into the right one in setting up his play makers particularly versus pressure what's they're likely going to the on third down so I think they have been pleased with his progress they want to get to completion percentage up\nBut they've done three things very very well they've been productive on third down they haven't made catastrophic era when it comes to turnovers and they've been a productive team and the red area with this often\nTimes before you want to get your your thought on another program and I know you've uh believe you've seen them this year and that's all burn a they got all missed him are nobody really knows where this program is heading\nAnd can smell is on figure this thing out before it's too late\n[noise] well the first thing that I Would stay in relationship to this entire Auburn situation and the disgruntled fan base and I understand that I certainly do\nBut he is essentially one of two coaches in the last five years that has beaten Alabama Nick Saban twice and it becomes very easy to forget that it becomes very easy to forget that this team was you know player where are you know or two from being the college football playoff and I think that's what's magnified\nThe woes of this year is the fans look at this roster and they say look at his defense we had back\nOh we've got ... did them back they knew the question in the office of line ah we're we're going to be present early by I Believe they felt like they would get solidified by now and they have it and so it's not all ... it's not all of the office of line it's been a combination of a lot of things in in for me personally when I watch this Auburn off and\nI just I'm not convinced that this often operates and an optimal level one the quarterback isn't a part of the designated run game when you have to force the defense to account for the quarter back in the run game that can alleviate some of your all sense of wind concerns and it can open up your passing game that's one element that this off and has not had\nTime I realize you were there a to broadcast the game but I'm also going to put you in the position of being a fashion consultant and you know or I'm going here ah it was revealed today that that the LSU uniforms\nAre going to be nothing short of spectacular ah the Lsu football equipment tweeted out their helmet ah give us the backstory on what is going on and uh and I know this is a a they're paying homage to\nPast but what exactly is this about\nI don't know if they've actually presented publicly the house and the wise I think what everybody's so excited about here is that the helmet and by the way the Jersey in the pants going to be all white there'll be no names on the back of the jerseys I think that's paying homage to the gym to the path\nBut this is gonna be the first helmet of its kind we see in the mirror gold we've seen the mirrored Krohn from Oregon we've seen it from Baylor in a variety of other teams this particular LSU helmet is going to be purple\nAnd it is going to be iridescent in the sense that won the helmet turn or light shines on it in a different way it's going to change colors throughout the course of the game so I think everybody is kind of eagerly anticipating what that will look like we've seen all these new iterations of uniforms across college football the last ten years this was a helmet we haven't seen just yet is\nMy question is this going to be said for the LSU fan who's been a partying all morning at all afternoon when you start seeing this uh I mean do we need to let him know that he ... what are you seeing is reality is is not the uh it's just not the party and him I\nWould have EMS standing by it's a little bit like a like a mirror ball if you will and maybe a little bit of a strobe light only it's coming from eleven guys on the field at one time and if I'm a fan I wouldn't be too close to the side to the sideline and there's going to be another Seventy players there with the same held on so I\nI keep my eyes on the field and I would focus too closely on the health but don't don't stare directly at the sun ...\nWill be careful time I know you're going to be very close to the film it's always great to catch up with Tom ... coming up surely

hard to rank teams where they're going to end up in New coaches in the league new players and so it just it's another season for us another ground\nTalked to about ... about you because I mean uh it's it's it's it's been documented a quite a bit to the task that you you had and taking over there there may\nI don't know if there's ever been a more challenging situation though is that what you took over for for pat\nA and you know with that comes a ... than the normal pressure of being a at one of the elite programs but I think maybe even more and uh now that you get your beginning seven years does it's never easy but do you are you able to\nSay okay well I mean by that you have to be used\nDo this kind of sit back and kind of\nTake a deep breath the power we talked about this and a\n... it's always been I knew what I was getting into I Love this like the game I Love the university great support I got great kids if if I didn't have great kids and and love being around them I wouldn't be doing this it is it difficult absolutely it's hard to follow it it's hard to fall legend but it's it's great to fall legend so it's kind of\nA double edged sword but um I Love it pet taught me so many different things I put them I Try to apply I'm On a daily basis and nobody's going to be pets I'm and I'm just trying to take what I've learned and\nIt's good to just to feed myself but I enjoy what I Do I was\nTalking to somebody a about a year or two ago and he followed\n... one of the truly giants in his field but it but he the German talked about um a lot though because there's always a point of reference in I I Know you can't walk into your building without her spirit and and and and influence being felt but do you think often how\nHow did she do this or how would she have instructed me or or a ... and I know that you can't go backwards ... she is this program\nWill always she's always going to be there and it's a part of this program and we understand I Want her to be I I Want her name to be mentioned I I Want to our kids to know why there's a statue for Pat Summit but then we we need to learn from it and we need to learn from her definite does in her being here but\nYeah sometimes I Want to pick up the phone and go you know pat these kids are driving the what would you do and she you know I don't know if she'd be coach and right now she she she's pretty\nYou know you you got to it's a little bit of a given tank now but ah yeah I I Love her advice at times but uh I I just try to reach back and and take what she's taught me and and use it\nUm because kids say they want discipline they they want to be taught you you you just got to put it out there but they then they want to make sure you know they care and and that's probably the biggest thing she's taught me is make sure your players now you that you care\nAnd and she didn't coach without pressure or maybe different than yours but but for her she was measuring herself against herself well I think that's always the top\nOf your ear you're right when you when you when you when that national championship then everybody thinks you know how to win another another and then when you went eight it's like and if you don't you don't win it's like what's wrong with the ... and we build the kind of a monster here\nAnd I get it I Love it that's why they're so good it's like the football team we we just we build a monster and that's a good thing um but you take it and you try to building you you you try to get where we need to be\nYeah I mean I say this year because I I feel like a ... a long time I'm I'm friends that I I was here when when the wind power starting this program and when we get a call we're tendency fan is asking about the Lady Vols I kind of laughter myself as if this is a compliment I don't care what they're saying\nThey care that much that they are going in and we were talking about all the different programs and and the SEC\nBut this is the only program were were were they get angry and they ...\nYou know what they do and that's why I don't have any social media can [laughter] if you imagine\nIf it ah do you read it so I don't\nKnow whether it's good or whether it's bad or whatever it is I don't I my my job is to just stay focused for these kids\nAnd and and uh try to carry on this tradition is it\n... it I I Know it you know the fans get disappointed that we lose I disappoint and everybody's disappointed but at the end of the at the end of that is\nOne team and that was no today and this year that went home and and it felt great and everybody else was not very happy\nBut listen and we we deal with it all out on the football side especially one school but you know a Tennessee there there isn't a or a ... vote replacement there there's no substitute for winning at all is\nAbsolutely not absolutely not and uh you know I I get it get it I feel that way to somebody else a sit in my seat I Would come on\n... when a man if I was just like a small thing you know we are and we have a couple of mutual friends and they'll they'll call and say hey I I really don't understand the situation is yeah she's recruited well but I mean I and I say this because\nI'm you've handled it and you deal with it yeah I'm the most important they are still doing\nThat long for nothing he would have been seeing that something was wrong with two\nWhen coach said within so that when he was able to come back again last night\nI guess he's out coach said will lied about it\nWhat did he had a game last about two to injure like we all play out where beat at a ma and plan all that but to see that track meets and louder and louder do\nLars gone yes well\nYou mentioned it a little ... as you go okay I I heard loud and say\n\nHey get wind the rest of the gangs aim I\nCan say is number two to know what it is usually about guns now no say what they can't get rid of him see a passionate the T cannot ...\nCan be bothered by the other question for you okay I mean I we've I feel like I've known you a long time I feel like we're friends but I Do are you able\nTo enjoy or appreciate Alabama's successor you're always just too busy picking on anyone who dares criticize them\nWell you know do that anyway that's his name again Paul\nI got to do it seems as if I if I were in Alabama\nAnd I'm trying to shoot all my critics\nWhat I shoot him oh well I should all my credits ... care that\nYou may lousy they can't get rid of girls now though she an apostrophe can and cannot\nAnd something that has never been down this all the bands that filling up the seeds and Joe ... no outlet related but [laughter]\nI don't know whether it is or it isn't but uh anyway let's continue with a [noise]\nChris from is up next our equipment oh hello\n...

because it really wasn't alive will ease the call [laughter] I think it's a hundred and two [laughter] he he was from your doctor Knoxville and er he always got excited the week of the Tennessee game\nYet that was he was weak buddy you got that right and he tell a story from the ... the forties or fifties or something along the\nLines ever back a coach were being shelled while yes fear oldies\nShields walking on the [laughter] ...\nThere's what's got me a little concerned that being said\nOh I like to say that\nWell let me tell you why uh I don't like what coaches like to always say well you know it's raining on the other two to weather can be a great equalizer Paul what's the forecast for a knocks Vegas tomorrow\nOr give me a second I had it right here it's supposed to rain in the morning\nOkay but I Believe it's going to be okay by game time so I'm holding on it I Am okay I'm I'm checking my friendly a weather forecast here now that's not the local\nDown now where so where is the weather channel guy when you need 'em but they're always here when you don't [laughter]\nI Can't ...\nHe he's busy so we're standing\nWater [laughter]\nI mean how many times with Weather Channel guys been are talking about I saw him I didn't have to have an\nExactly or it's going to be OK them are\nWell I Hope so and I hope that's just not blowing smoke so not to discourage a no show or encourage notion\nThat whether or not that I was looking at today is good excuse me okay Chris [laughter]\nIt's going to be good the day I'm\nGoing to be beautiful today are basically the forecast says a rain ending in the afternoon it will not be an actor\nYou you realize a Knicks uh he he's got another that's another one of them a fair records uh he's he's Jake you know he's done a few things in the past there couldn't be beat Notre Dame the Texas who and what's coming up next to Mark Twain straight bears record was eleven so\nHang man he just he just keeps ... against ... argument that\nThere was the better coach you know what I mean how do\nI mean dead gimmick well listen stay out of trouble\nOkay okay oh I didn't really appreciate the call Clint\nI [laughter] we're back here and not so after the call from Chris from a Gulf shores Marty Smith are joining us [noise]\nStates as well people\nGorgeous day out here in Rocky Top [noise]\nWhat's going on Martin well I've been with the Tennessee Volunteers all day I um it's been a great day man I Love this a school I Love these folks here it's authentic college football and I just think it's great I just got done hanging out with Phil Phil former\nA kind of reminiscing with him a bit about that Nineteen Ninety eight national championship team that he coached and great memories he had from from that and you know he just told me more than three hundred former players and their families are coming back to more for the really\nYeah how 'bout that the whole team the whole teams being honored here are not well not that they did that a couple of weeks ago this is I don't remember that happen it's not it's not just that team it's like all former players like three hundred something God or it's just because it's Alabama via fail weekend poker\nYou should know that I could get alumni emails my I don't I don't know [laughter] let's go\nUh you know that that that one out there and have to I I I don't want the alumni list um\nAnd I do or am I yeah I Do remember that now a because it seemed like it was a couple of weeks ago when I saw so the entire so what does it go up to what was Philips demeanor\nA really relaxed he was really relaxed and it was fun to see him discuss that accomplishment and he was saying to me I found this to be interesting to he said if the college football playoff were in play at that point I think the years he said we're Ninety five Ninety eight\nNine in a non and oh one he thinks all four of those teams would have easily qualified and he said just for the record Florida probably would have to and so it was just a fascinating conversation I really enjoy his company yeah ... it's so interesting\nAnd you know his story is a here's a here's a guy that leaves here\nHe doesn't get the job a year ago after campaigning not campaigning but saying he would he would be happy to take it and then he and I mean it's hard to find a story that that that's more dramatic than when the guy who gets the job is uh is gone and the person that hired\nThe guy who got the job over former is God if if your former now is in charge of this entire\nWorld I Know it's amazing it really is amazing and what a difference in a year right I mean the vibe around here last year was talks and it was horrible it was just toxic and so he was the right guy you know he is Mr Tennessee and so to get him in a in a power a position of power like that\nYeah I think it's also interesting Marty that in spite of what happened\nTo him or in in a ... at the end of his career ten years ago and even a year ago former never\nSpoke out because this was his school\nClasses to lessen the people should learn a few never do it so hard to do that it's hard to do that ever right when you feel wronged\nOur human nature response is our national or natural impulsive response is I'm going to get you back right especially in the world of these things right here where everybody has such a quick response impulsivity to say oh you're coming to me I'm come right back at you do when someone shows that grace\nIt's wonderful to see and it's great to see that it paid off for him that he was rewarded for it because easily he could have gone after this university look look at everything I've done for the school saying all these players of the NFL we want all these SEC championships we won the national championship and you're going to do that to me and he didn't do that\n[noise] so yeah I I I was talking to the other day and and the fact that the he's the one he at one time\nThe Alabama I mean that's that's where they have they okay I think it was a nine out of ten to ... hours are ridiculous record\n... today don't understand how great just used to be heard somebody say earlier or one of our guys uh it was a ... a ... a he said you know ... the next segment twice [laughter] he's the only guy in a conference of ... whether it's so right yeah but uh but former\nWell I think it means that they got a guy who's a hundred percent invested in football and his only cares football\nYou know he's he's not worried about anything else what people say about him is irrelevant in his mind\nUm he believes he can win every game he believes he can out coach you know without scheme the bus stop 'em out there and got ... got full confidence I think the big thing about this staff and this coach and one of the keys that Philip former wanted when he went out looking for a coach it would have gotten understood this league\nIf you've not been in this league Paul you know this better they might you don't know what this leagues really about the staff knows what this leagues about I think that's what's kind of tendency pass excited\nAnd ... and\nClearly I mean for those of you who are paying close attention it's a shot at the former coach a ... who recruited well to appoint a and there were some good moments ... was it or whether or not all the extraneous stuff that that eventually sent this fan base over the edge\nI think the ... was done with the Bush Jones after he lost to Vanderbilt in twenty sixteen and he comes back for twenty Seventeen obviously the season to not go and the way he had hoped\nWe'll set out to hire a guy that was a hundred and eighty degrees and the opposite of books Jones and he did I mean when you talk about the total opposite of the really Jones is Jeremy Pruitt and a coach fruit as Brent said he cares about football\nFootball only at all this other stuff he's learning on the fly to deal with the media more into that what the fans all those kinda things as the first time head coach but he just dies in and he's he's um their late late in the office game plan and he's been game plans in spring for a federal games [noise]\nYeah and then let's talk about this game and uh again that there was a time uh when Philip former was encouraged this game\nA it was the other side that didn't think they had any chance when when fill up one seven in a row and\nWhat nine out of ten I mean it was an amazing I went and we were talking the other day about that and and and as far as that was regurgitate it I mean I remembered it quite well having lived in Alabama at that time uh it was still pretty surprising to think about how this thing has slipped so\nTo a Tennessee fan Brent ... when when does this program back I and I realize Auburn\nValidated Jeremy Pruitt but what's it going to take for fans to be looking at a game like this going we can beat them\nA couple more years of recruiting flipping this roster then I hear that four years ago well but that don't you hear that every time you know what I'm saying is that what they're saying that Florida you're you know that's that's what they say everywhere but realistically I mean\nThey're playing a different off it's a scheme of different defensive scheme they want different types of players they want to improve the roster as coach ... set on his coaches show Wednesday night if my wife\nCan't tell whether or not we should be taking them Tennessee I probably don't need to be recruited so they've got to recruit better talent they've got to recruit deeper talent and build some depth up there I think we're Tennessee fans are optimistic as this place is always attracted talent\nDubai look coach majors had talent search forget that this is a it's a pretty campus it's a pretty place right attracts talent\nSo if you got to coach you can develop the talent that I think everybody is optimistic and that's where tendency fans All right now to answer your question they need more talent\nYeah ... what was left fairly rare I mean the only sixteen twenty Seventeen recruiting class as you don't see the on the field that that just should and so coach Pruitt\nSmoke and mirrors right now is getting it done\nAnd I want to talk about this campus in in you know I mean I I ask you because you guys are younger and and you know a lot of people in the audience these students back there [noise]\nThey never they never lived uh in an arrow in Tennessee football was on the same level yes the same level as Alabama I mean they were the two premier football programs and it wasn't that long ago\nWhen I think that's the beauty and that's what we love the SCC and that's why you hate the SEC because it's much like the NFL even though you don't have free agency the window does it stay open that is what what next savings nuns been so amazing as he's kept his championship window open\nBut you see ebbs and flows and you see windows closed in areas of of success clothes and your exactly right I've got a Thirteen year old son he's never seen Tennessee when it ... you know now that tendency played for championships and dominated Alabama for a stretch and\nUm it it's it's a blessing and a curse that is the SEC cause blink and it changes quickly but\nCertainly not going to win them are and if they do then every Tennessee fainting and so you are wrong and I and that's great I Love that um what would be considered a successful afternoon demar\nBeside the unhealthy I I think going out and just competing I mean you competed at Georgia you found a little something the second half your you know kind of use that at all burn to get a nice when compete tomorrow and the next week I think it sets up for the game of South Carolina in ...\nIt's the Alabama at it it doesn't set up real well but I think that game could be the springboard for a strong clothes and a potentially strong closing recruiting for Germany ... ... I I think specifically in the game if if you could limit the Alabama big plays which nobody's been able to do don't turn football over\nThere had been a ball game and the second half the whole old everybody's interest in the second half of this game to war you're continuing to build confidence and you can really weren't on absolutely look the carry over from Georgia is what you saw it all is it gave\nThis this team some confidence that you know what my coach does what you do it\nWell it is and I'm just I'm just uh I'm just dropping in a drop ago but it feels different up here it really does or doesn't feel like smoke and mirrors it doesn't feel like I'm at a at a at a circus or a carnival it feels like\nFootball is back and and and getting better guys thanks so much Brent hubs in Austin

them I'm not really sure which one it was I'm Talking about Hillary Clinton the top trending thing on drugs today was that she might go for one more time and twenty twenty\nIt diminishes their delusion here in her or or do the Clintons still have a stronghold on the Democratic party I thought that they were done\nWell\nThey're they're not done I mean here's a proof of that um I mean we've had the me too movement a and it's taken out a number\nOf people ... on the progressive left noticed and hasn't taken out Bill Clinton now if it had the Clintons could never have announced this speaking to war and what you have to pay hundreds of dollars just to get to hear them\nSo Bill Clinton continues to meet a certain degree land ice in legitimate in the Democratic party how these people are managed to stay one step ahead of the coffee for three decades I I think he got to admire that from a distance between requires an unbelievable what's ...\nYes but also there has to be delusion there she lost she's now I think are approval rating is about thirty thirty\nThere is really hard because of the media does these things I mean for her to think that she's even still has a\nHas a chance as she told me too movement has exposed her it still doesn't really expose him your right for some reason he's still the golden boy but it exposed her horribly for how she treated these women that came forward again with allegations against her husband\nIn this day and age where the leftist pretending they care about women and protect you care about sexual assault how could she ever be prominent again\nTurn not only is he got away with it it's really obvious that the last ...\nDoesn't care about these things and here's the smoking gun proof of that or just a couple of weeks ago really we heard from Christine forward about capital and the idea was these women need to be heard we need to have justice for victims\nOf sexual assault all the\nHighest rhetoric now notice that the longer the Kavanaugh is confirmed\nChristine Ford became a non entity do know articles about her suddenly the whole thing has disappeared suddenly the median and wanting to get justice for the victims of forgotten about all the victims and I'm\nPretty sure that in probably a few months we'll have difficulty recalling her name do and so all of the shows the degree to which these are people who are being used as instruments of\nConvenience the moment they stopped being a human grenade they end up positive safely in the trash\nThat so it's a very good way to put a you're exactly right I mean the\nFact that find started selling these allegations of this letter for two months and men exposed a leak turn me when she didn't want it out there shows you exactly how much they don't care about these these victims were these alleged victims that are coming forward denounced as soon as the death of the nation going got the DVD it's out now they're going to do death of a nation dot dot com or ... movie dot com\nDestination movie dot com or you can just order and directly from my tunes any of the places that you get and then eventually later this month you'll be able to get it in red box and Walmart and everywhere when the physical DVDs out that's still a week or so away uh so do the digital downloading and streaming now\nThe media didn't ashes ignoring mostly what's happening in Portland in Portland, Oregon ... which are\nIt's a misnomer they are the fascists in our society are closing down roads telling people what they can they can do they're pulling people out of cars that are threatening people's lives they're damaging their vehicles and the police are actively standing down and they're being told to stand down by the mayor and those who are running that city\nIs this just exactly what we saw eighty years ago where Ninety years ago in in Germany and Italy is this how it starts you shut down roads and let anarchy takeover\n\nYes the the key to the fascist and Italy these ... a black a black shirt and then also Hitler's brown insurance is that\nUltimately they were protected by the state and\nEventually they of course when the Nazis took power they merged with this faith they became part of the state apparatus\nUh sometimes people will they equate I Will say you know and he has not the problem not remember that there are these white nationalist\nAnd they are the real danger I'd on pizzas nearly trying to stop them um and the problem here is that while the white nationalist sub politically and culturally and significant I mean if the if the Ku Klux Klan or to have a rally tomorrow they'd be lucky to get to a hundred people on every five times as many protesters yeah\nThe problem with aids and he's like I said that they are protected they have the Democratic party behind them they've\nGot the meat eating behind them\nThey are powerful elements in Hollywood and then you know they're powerful elements in government the mayor of Berkley Jesse arrogant as a member of sound and the Facebook\nGroups well broke the mayor of Courtland will call the cops down so this is a\nDomestic terrorist group you might say that actually has friends in high places\nWell it really does that mean and Chris Cuomo is it like my idol when it comes to media but he's here's a guy who's got a show on a major media thing\nThem do that as long as it's going against the people that you just talked about the the the alleged so you know All right or white supremacist or whatever I mean there there really are saying it's not equal when it comes to the law if the law breakers are doing something that we agree with\n[noise] I don't remember what the fascist and they basically said listen than Jews control the economy that Jews have in in in Sydney laid down in city insidious lay into all elements of government so we have to fight the Jews with with\nWith the kind of weapons that they use against us ultimately when Hitler was talking about the big lie he wasn't saying hey I got a big lie he was accusing the Jews of a corporate training a big lie right\nSo ironically Hitler was the one he was lying he was the one you want to take over the economy he was the one in line to salvage the radical control but he was projecting those accusations onto the Jews and then using that as a pretext for his own lawlessness\nAnd are busy or and I appreciate your one last quick question for the rest of the students or get death of a nation on DVD it's out now I'm ... years here's the thing that I see and and you either right or wrong and you have no problem telling me what I'm wrong\nHitler was charismatic I thought the guy was kind of ugly so I really can't compare him to a really good looking person that's running today that's getting a bunch of press but he was charismatic and able to grab your attention with the way that he spoke we're seeing that with a ... now in Texas a cause your Cortez now in New York\nYou're seeing it now in Florida with Gillum you've got left wing socialist who are admitting that they would like to impeach the president or or abolish ice or open the border or shut down the police I mean this guy or worked in Texas has called police the modern day Jim Crow\nBut these people are generally speaking good looking charismatic good speakers look nice on camera is that what we're seeing happen again like we saw with\nA Hitler back in the day Hitler came to prominence because people want to hear him speak\nThe power of Hitler in ... was that they were able and then very shrewd way\nTo tap into a deep vein of frustration and discontent too much of that in Germany came out of World War one the feeling that Germany had been screwed over by the treaty of Versailles and Hitler was able to sort of massage that discontent and they're very\nEmotionally effective and galvanizing way now obviously the situation is different the world is different history doesn't repeat\nItself identically by I think it's fair to say that this deep vein of democratic this discontent over losing the election they thought they were so close or the sense that they that that sort of thing does have been prying loose from the leaders of control and they're all like\nMad about it and what these guys like Ocasio Cortez doing battle and so on is they're trying to tap into that vein of discontent because they know that that's political capital there\nAnd they're also lying if they actually stay with the ... because the court judge was saying what she believes a awards has not awoke his lung using what spring Texas together and work across the aisle and I love every body and offer one on one for\nAll but then you look how he votes and he wants to raise taxes regulations that he wants to basically open the border because he feels bad about Mexico somehow so I mean it it it really is a couple of different tactics on how they're doing it but it is grabbed the most charismatic person you can\nCause you're going to get some votes just because people are are ignorant basically and they'll vote for who they feel like they like\nYou had the Democratic party has always been sort of been divided into the the wing of the income groups and the ...\nOf the sort of plot or it's just a Jimmy Carter for example to me if he were happening out and then come Google what he'd have to give it to him and he was well meaning his goals are good but he was just incompetent and itchy and Obama's than print guy Obama was in ... he was somebody who was in a sense of wanted to reduce America's wealth and power where it's all just by his standards\nDeath of a nation and go to dumping them in each of the nation movie dot com or get it on I tunes or it will be all over the place very very soon ... I Wish that you that you sell a billion of everybody needs to see your work and listen to your words and realize that there is a great education that we have not been afforded in this country and you're doing it for a state that moment\nI really appreciate it back after this sort of Joe ... show stay right here [noise]", "year": "2018", "show_name": "no_show", "city": "Algood", "day": "19"}
