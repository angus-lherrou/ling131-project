I Hope that things get better for you I'm Sorry to hear about the situation especially if it's certainly didn't do it um but I hear your point we're right back after this kills the in Asia take\nHere in Parkland because there's numerous entities that are at fault or that led up to February fourteenth I'd be the first one to blame if it was the gun I I go along with it but I I Know because I looked into it\nAnd I have an investigation going on Joe and there's a lot of people responsible for what happened said boy fourteen and one of a a it's not the n._r._a.\nAlyssa mulatto was up to Capitol you're used to I just don't we should get funding of acting work I think that's the issue it's a ... he's the father of middle middle would have been Nineteen this coming friday um\nLet me just ask you about some of the other survivors and I know that you're not a guy metal beat up on on him over David or Kyle and I asked you to beat up on them\nBut how would that not coyote camera in a cast you recently shorter said you know\nI didn't really know what this march for a large was really about and I'm kind of rethinking how I acted on stage and what I said and how and presented I went back and looked at some of the video and I don't know that I'm as helpful and I'm paraphrasing when I look at them as helpful as I could have been and then you've got the you know the AMA who's just reading about cabinet which makes no sense that's not fixing anything\nAnd then I think David is is a confused sold because one day he's boycotting people's sponsors and the next day he's getting into college and doing just that the other\nAny thought to be ... you of what we said from the beginning Joe their kids this is what kids do I agree with you but the left in this country the anti gun left in this country want it to say very the experts we have to listen to them any thoughts on how the progress since February\n... there's a couple of things I Want to talk about it's easy for people to just blame the gun you know what I mean that that's the easy route I could just anyone could just say it's the dawn ... ... and not really look into really what happened and that's easy but getting back to the kids that I'd really like to tell you have a\nCamera in ... and ... they came and they helped in the campaign they actually came out in Broward to try and make a difference so that they did come and help those to the ... the others I I don't know where they are you know\nI don't really but I Know Cameron Kane he reached out to me we met a couple of times camera that myself and he came out and helped us campaign he came to early voting so he really wanted to make a difference in Broward\nCounty I'm with you and I think that he's sort of had a realization that he does have the power and the social media strength that we used to make a difference and he stands backing says I don't know that I made the difference that I wanted to be others I think are are in their own world but but Cameron's seems to have come around did you\nHappen to have a conversation with him about about what he seems to be seeing now\nWell he wants to take a look at both sides right\nBut with any side whoever wants to talk to him he'd open minded and that's what the world needs more people that I'll sit down with someone who ... who has a different opinion themselves and work it out not someone that's just so one sided and that's what I think uh he came he gotten like\nIt is a ... he lost his daughter metal at at Parkland in Parkland, Florida there must be high school or Eddie our schools safer today\nThan they were in February ... they ... they are safe they're safer because they have more armed guards but could anyone\nGet into the school at anytime they want yes you know anyone's going to be able to walk in with a knife a hatch it a pipe bomb until we rarely secure the schools and I think it's gonna take metal detectors I don't know how many years it's going to take but that's the only way that we're going to guarantee our kids and our teachers safe inside of schools for one I don't think we're there yet\nWhy won't be hard and the schools what's the problem with with making it one way you one way out at least in the morning in the afternoon and 'cause I don't know what if you get into a stairwell nobody can get into a back door nobody can be no one could hide a gun to the bathroom and come back later and do something why will they just hartnett somewhere somebody who was an authority can see who's coming in and what\nThey have the well they are working on single point entries okay a lot of schools doing that in Broward and throughout the country but it still comes to it like you know so it's a single point entry if there is a student there he could bring anything in that he wants them to act that weren't\nSo until you know but it's just that society we don't we wouldn't want it like that we didn't grow up like that\nNo we didn't know I look I don't want to be I don't want to be a prison that's for sure\nBut at the same time I want to be able to either have enough armed guards and only one pre school isn't going to help you how to resource officer there who who sat on who's going to be nothing\nUm I I won't even more of them to to defend our children or I Want there to be fewer entrances or some sort of a a little card or something that you need that that says you're allowed to be that this guy wasn't allowed to be there\nAnd he got in and he got in with a rifle bag it doesn't make any sense so if if that sort of scenario can still happen and I wonder if you think you can what did we changed\nWell it just happened the other day you know how the get right down the street and Lauren Hill to a nine year old walked into the school\nSo I don't you know they're definitely making progress with more on guard single point the entries are that putting the parameters around schools thought until we get to the point where we make it like a federal building our court house any kid you know if he wants to do their job they're going to get into the school and the\nDodgers wants somebody there to defend against people it is a ... and there are ... and it is that it's getting very largely because of your efforts and\nYou know how much I appreciate a our friendship and be what you've done to make the schools safer when my kids go to school it's I'm Andrew Pollack F.

to garden good evening John we have much to say about the Trump Administration in China later on in the show but we begin looking at the Trump Administration and Korea the Korean Peninsula\nAh especially North Korea I understand the secretary of state is traveling to North Korea and the next day is is this the delayed meeting from earlier in the in the air\nThis was delayed because President Trump called off a secretary Pompeo's trip to I'm young I Believe it was just going to remember that before then Pompeo went appealing young first week of July the meeting was a disaster and since then we have not really had the progress that everyone has hope\nFor and garden or the Chinese watching this are they just bogged down in trying to adjust their GDP to look like gross split or is this critical to she that palm pale is going into ...\nWell I think that the Chinese see this as an opportunity because they've got so many they got so few options on trade and the other areas to dispute with the United states\nThey probably see this as some place where they can bargain their cooperation for help on something else where otherwise they would have don't solutions we welcome our\nColleagues suddenly professor suddenly of Tufts University professor of very good evening to you what is the mission for secretary of pump ... why is he going to North Korea this time good evening to\nPonytail is mission should be to make it clear to the north Korean leader that unless he takes\nSubstantive measures toward denuclearization like revealing some facilities coming up with it and then three of how many bombs and facilities he has unless he does that\nPump a oh should tell him we are going to enforce continued to enforce sanctions against you and your enablers Chinese as well as South Korea and entities who go on violating UN and us sanctions however I fear\nSecretary Pompeo may do the opposite and concede\nThat piece declaration so cold which is what North Korea and South Korea had been calling for incessantly over the past several weeks that the U.S would be amenable to signing such and and the Korean War peace declaration which is a trap\nNorth Korea has been calling for a peace treaty with the United states with a view toward effecting\nThe U.S troops in South Korea in the wake of a peace treaty between the two countries\nThe very red zone that through all of us troops in the south would come under fire and they would be a lot of political pressure building up in South Korea and North Korea will call for their withdrawal maybe Americans would agree with that which are all of us troops so that's the endgame North Korea has in mind and step by step\nHaving a piece declaration or an devoid declaration is the prelude to dismantle it\n\n\n...\nA Peter out of the president of geostrategic analysis and director of the strategic strategic deterrent studies at the ... to ... Gordon Chang and my colleague we're addressing\nA global concern which is the possibility of nuclear conflict there is a new paper from Princeton university's global zero proposing what you'd have to say it was a dramatic reduction in nuclear warheads and the way we watch\nPeople with nukes Peter a very good evening to you is global zero what is their mission statement good evening\nThe evening and thank you Gordon thank you John for this a global organization devoted to the elimination of nuclear weapons worldwide when he's forty\nWhich will be primarily done by unilateral reduction by the United states because other countries as well as they say in this new report will have to follow suit because of our wonderfully a moral example\nPeter that's not going to happen it seems to me that if ever you're going to get to a global zero it will be because everybody realizes they can't outspend the United states\nI don't understand the logic of our unilaterally reducing our arsenal to the point where it may not be usable and essentially having everybody else so yeah we'll we'll we'll do the same thing they're recommending three hundred warheads go ahead Peter\nTwelve and they issued a report very like this so this was last report it called for a thousand warheads than the United states arsenal and now they're under three hundred so they've reduced it by Seventy five percent\nThey said at that time in twenty twelve Russia was not a threat\nThan they did a survey of people who are members of the council Foreign Relations and said in twenty drop is Russia threat and a number of them said no and therefore they concluded Russia was not a threat that day they issued the report was the day the foreign minister of Russia issued a ... a threat to use nuclear weapons against NATO missile defense sites\nAnd as my friend mark Snyder has done since twenty twelve\nThe Russian military or civilian including Mr coot and hence you issued thirty\nThreats to the United states and our allies to use nuclear weapons these are not been implicit these men explicit threats syrup they basically done in this twenty eight team report it instead of having Fifteen hundred and fifty more heads under the new start treaty we would have\nThey think around to sixty we'd have to submarines that see that would be it the other three would be a an import and when you look at what the motives are we probably have as low as a hundred and thirty warheads\nWhat would happen is instead of having five hundred and nine targets meaning land based missiles bombers and submarines spread all over the country will be down to five to ... seat to set up bases on bomber base bombers would not be usable of the war has would be put elsewhere\nAnd then they have this crazy idea that warheads and missiles would be separated\nAnd where would we store these hundreds of warheads while they're empty silos in ten of it used to be minimum silos\nWhich gentle Cartwright negotiated with the Russians that we would not put missiles in them so we put all our warheads there and then we put about bull's eye on it painted bright red so the Chinese and Russians couldn't no but they just took out all our warheads didn't matter whether we had some rain and farmers are ICBMs left which we wouldn't\nWe wouldn't have any warheads\nSo in their twenties twelve report that they said it is reasonable to believe that the Russians and the Chinese the Syrian at the north Koreans in Iran pen targets equally in about a thousand that we could rationally save needed to be hit and retaliated against and taken out\nThose numbers have all of a sudden crashed to less than a couple of hundred and what they've decided to do is no military targets would be hit\nIn any country no conventional military targets would be it in a rut Talib choice strike we'd hit their banking their communications and their cities\nAnd that would be it and we wouldn't have to retaliate quickly because cities banking communications don't move they're all sitting there shall we would take at least\nNo less than Seventy two hours to respond if we wanted to and if we bought warheads out in the minimum silos Montana or give me an example for a minute man based to put warheads back on missiles you can do three missiles per month or wing and their three wings\nChicken do nine missiles a month you could put one more head back on minute man if you want to but they want to get rid of a ... player on the global zero wants to eliminate all minute man so we would go down from all over five hundred targets to as I said five\nThe interest with me and we do this unilaterally\nYes unilateral surrender work camp a unilateral surrender includes the fellow I Want to know how I can joined the international monitoring program I Hope they are really cool uniforms because well because their job will be\nAll surrender has been sustained by the fall\nBut what's interesting at the end it is and this hundred and seven page report\nThey're they they don't talk about verification because you can verify for example ... will be alert and that's your favorite thing it's like turning off a missile well with a keystroke on the computer I can turn it back on\nIt I could targeted wherever I Want to target it nobody will know so there's no verification of course but then they say this is toward the end they say\nEverybody has to now not to use weapons first they have to vow not to deploy attack submarines in certain areas the oceans in order to make the submarine safe and this is what they say in which everyone and I'm quoting sincerely vows\nTo do this quote unquote so sincerely vows is like a marriage\nA wedding they sincerely about ... you know on her and uh be true to your wife or your husband that now is that we we now have marriage in a nuclear policy instead of\nTrust but verify it's if they sincerely vow to do it then it's okay and that's literally that is a quote from the end of the a book or this hundred and seven page book so now we're gonna have unilaterally ten percent of the Russian force\nWill have it somewhere between twenty and forty percent of the Chinese force and we'll have about twenty percent of our current force that is allowed under a treaty for getting rid of everything that was one of the things that's really strange is\nSuffering has had a whole new set regional sixteen missiles\nEvery missile Bruce Blair says put eight or heads on which is by the way the maximum you can put on it what happens if the Russians bust out of the global other new start treaty or the Chinese build up we will have no buildup capability which Bill Clinton George Bush and Barack Obama all hauled the edge\nAnd we would have no hedge we would be stuck at about two hundred and fifty survivable warhead to the\nUm that would be it and the other guys to build what ever they wanted a bill\nGuards have about a minute So Peter you mentioned something before about how potent has been a threatening to your sense of use of nuclear weapons\nHe's been doing that especially with regard to the Baltics we've just got about thirty seconds if you can run through how global zero would do with pollutants threats to use nukes\nTo start a war do they have a plan Peter a thirty second\nNo no no no I'm not at all that's the whole point of building low yield weapons on a cruise missile or a deep five submarine missile it gets there quickly within Neal twenty to thirty minutes which we don't have anything that can get there that quickly today that's why it's not a question low yield weapons is the question can you get them to the battle\nApproved by the way announced this new strategy in April two thousand\nAnd two thousand six he said this is how we're going to do it and we're going to exercise this way and we're going to build these things and then twenty fourteen announced everything's going to be built done deployed in the field by twenty Twenty one and this

in in certain circles you know many ... is\nA move across the border have a are married to women who live in ... women um are there some businessmen who traveled there and then people who are on the sea consumers of a local news so they're well aware of what's going on and I think um you know as long as the situation continues and investors\nUm and you know there may be a response especially from a religious circles and even extreme of circles inside Pakistan and so I don't think it's an issue that can be swept under the rug\nAnd especially if you know that if the Chinese and the puck Sunnis would like to have this kind of a a economic uh kind of activity and uh the free flow of people and goods across the border\nUm and you know they're spending billions of dollars on developing the physical activity over the land border you know I I I just don't see a future in which there can be um you know a great deal of economic activity and this infrastructure can cut\nWhich is you know it's in it's a moral abomination respect what's happening but then there's also the economics of it in John it's supposed to be this outpost connecting I Try not to um to the Eurasian land mass and a and I just don't see that happening\nReally what's happening in terms of Pakistan is that the government has been supporting China with regard to the situation\nAnd this is where China's debt trapped diplomacy as it's called is actually working\nBecause right now in Muslim abroad you're not going to get a senior government official on the record criticizing the Chinese but of course when you look at the mass of people in any a Muslim majority country\nUm this does not sit well people may not say anything day to day largely because they've feeling coerced or because you know sometimes they just don't know about the issue but this just doesn't work when you're starting to look at for instance countries like Kazakhstan we're a long time you know the Kazakhstan government\nDidn't say anything about ... and now is really being forced to I think you're going to see the same thing in Pakistan\nThe fact that it is in the news is that a tell that they're frightened of that era\nYeah definitely because you know if another country was doing that and say the United states was doing that to its Muslim population it would certainly be in the news it would be on the cover of newspapers and and and the headlines there\nSo uh I think clearly a there's a you know some sort of a reason there was an intern obvious reason why I'm a private media in ... in the state owned media is a is most likely suppressing the information I it is covered to some degree in English language press\nUh but you know it's not something that's necessary on the front page and you don't really see it um you know people are are are ... you know outspoken about it ... you know especially if you know\nIn comparison to let's say a scenario if it was a you know happening in the United states\nQuickly Ira the

and the rise of capitalism and China\nAndrew good morning to you I report my conversation with the director of the national economic council Larry Kudlow within these last hours\nThat after the U.S embassy a deal put into place and pending approval by Congress\nThat the emu that includes the u._k. at this moment and Mexico and Canada the U.S MCA along with Japan are looking to speak with one voice to correct or to urge China to correct It's a incorrect trading practices\nThese last year's violations the WTO does China anticipating one voice with it from its trading partners at this moment Andrew good morning to\nYou know I mean I think a couple I was dreaming a there's it's very unlikely that the euro ... the United states and Mexico will be on the home page on this\nYear pools are desperate for growth and um they don't want to offend China and uh because they have a lot of businesses that operate ... quite a bit of money from China\nSo I expect very level of agreement between those three parties on this and the Chinese are are\nI think are banking on that because they know that the Europeans are kind of split with the Americans right now both politically and economically\nAndrew I'm what is the state of the Chinese economy today I mean especially after the September numbers is it a better than people say or where do you see it going [noise]\nRobyn can number so far I haven't met that exports were up fairly helpfully reports of a I have the August numbers were dropped ... percent pretty good showing 'em so there's a bit of weakness in the export powerhouse area of ... do ... in the south which accounts for twenty percent of exports\nAnd they're starting to see a bit of a recession so we may be willing to begin with but so far the economy's been held holding up surprisingly well\nAnd is that because of trade friction or is it does some other factor\nOh I'm pretty sure that they we can go out and going is because of trade friction the data inconclusive at this point but given that they have a lot of small businesses that export uh different kinds of cut and good than other states I'm sure it's trade related\nAnd one other question on just the technical aspects of this it took me a little bit by surprise but I saw that China's going to borrow three billion dollars why are they doing that\nPastors in the west ... assumes that a Chinese government debt is perfectly sell to us because they have a large a trade surplus\nThey have a three trillion dollars of overseas and foreign exchange and they have not defaulted on any national external debt I'm so it it's a good bet if they can get a decent interest rates are going to look for overseas capital\nBut why would the Chinese need the money\nBecause often uh overseas that she was willing to pay a ... it's expensive capital and domestically there's a huge amount of debt so they're looking to try to extend that into a get new sources of capital overseas it's it's a reasonable strategy [noise] the\nPuzzle China is looking for a negotiation with the United states or not the U.S is looking for negotiation with China or not are they in a waiting game Andrew and how long the wait how long before things deteriorate [noise]\nI think the Chinese it more or less given up because of the Trump Administration is it's I don't think it's really interested in a settlement they're essentially asking the Chinese to change the entire basis of their economy\nWhich the Chinese are are unable to do it would be one thing if the Trump Administration said okay look you've got a few stolen some of our technology in certain cases you're steel mills are being supported by the government\nEither area that we think you should focus on instead the Trump ... the ... and others make very broad brush statements and the Chinese are I think are starting to get to the point where they're washing the hands of the whole thing will figure it's a political football\nSo if they wash their hands what is the timeline does anybody an advance a timeline just says ... spring Nineteen spring twenty how long\nI think this is going to go on for a number of years because the Trump Administration as I said it's not going to alter its behavior so far we've not seen that\nAnd the Chinese themselves have figured that until they're going to try to deal with their own domestic economic problems in terms of slowing growth the only thing that I think it helps if it's a lot of small businesses in America stop start going on or having large unemployment and putting pressure on Trump's base we haven't seen that yet though\nSome Andrew in Hong Kong what is the mood about the Chinese economy long term I'm I get the sense that people are pretty optimistic but where do you see it\nThey are pretty optimistic because so far the crash that all people have been predicting hasn't happened\nThe economy has definitely slowing but we're not seeing massive defaults we are seeing an increase in default and corporations and small lenders but not massive default\nAnd the leadership is titled script over the riskier banks and the system so so far it's been a kind of a of a gradual decline but no collapse and then you got that booming tech sector with the huge\nA bike do ten and um and other ... about the Amazon of China that are doing very well and doing very well for western

there are various ah\nAh bodies of the United nations most notably the Security Council of uh like I'm not sure that I wouldn't necessarily in many cases be particularly prone to to depend on such

powerful weapon and I'm as you know\nI I don't want this weapon given to anyone that's not mature enough and the world is certainly not mature enough for this weapon and they will take it over they will regulate speech they will suppress their people they will they will use it for propaganda and group think I mean it's just way too dangerous which is why\nYou know I always thought the United states should a control most of this still\nAnd and we're seeing this because again it's a fundamental lack of accountability we're wittingly put all our shift says one big cloud and so you can

so Tony a century well you know what a there are certain certain things about twentieth century that that uh we're better uh the mere fact that we have a technical capability does not mean that we

what I'm I Can't tell a you know I haven't looked at the water hundred thousand pages of documents that they seemed to provide 'em you know there's there are a few things in here which is proven to be true that was probably beyond the pale of the law\nUm what what what bothered me about the uh the article is the the authors obviously showed their bias in several places I'm One of which were they say that ah the rich never really pay their full freight\nUm and ah there's a couple of places where they're under explanation allows them to make some rather crucial accusations which\nIf I knew all the facts I might be able to disapprove so I'll give you an example if you if I may sure um suppose that I buy a house for half a million dollars I put twenty percent down and I borrow with them\nPrice now what is that worth to me what is that included in my net worth if I if I gave it away at that point what would the value of the ... the well the value of the gift will be a hundred thousand dollars because it would be subject to that mortgage and\nSo now let's say there's a downturn like there was in the Nineteen nineties or two thousand three or two thousand eight when everybody lost value in the real estate and now my real estate is worth only four hundred and twenty thousand dollars\nAnd like a lot of clients of mine decided when the downturn came that was a good time to give away real estate to their children mhm so now it's worth four hundred and twenty thousand dollars I give it to my children what's the gift that I report on my gift tax return\nWas four hundred and twenty thousand dollars minus a four hundred thousand dollar mortgage twenty thousand dollars left that would be the value of the gift\nNow a decade later\nThere's been improvements all around the neighborhood knew Tony retailers developments of of of various sizes\nAnd I sell my children's sell that house for seven hundred thousand dollars\nOr have to pay off the mortgage so they keep three hundred thousand dollars I'm not even going to talk about taxes at that point but they kept three hundred thousand dollars and then one could say\nThat they got Fifteen times the valuation of the gift but you see that was perfectly legal they didn't but the article doesn't explain the leverage of real estate and so as a result I mean you you can easily said my gosh\nHow could that ever happened how could you ever invest in something\nAnd then sell it ten years later for Fifteen times what the value was when it was given\nA real charge recharge is my guest season attacking the

reporter for Business Insider dot com\nThe just of the New York times story I guess is that the president received a lot more help from his parents\nThan a a has been perhaps publicly acknowledged which is of course not illegal and that he in turn may have helped them hide some of their wealth later on almost a a I guess paying them back if you will did you go into further detail about what the times says\nShe I think that's that's a pretty good summary um of course President Trump for years it said that he had gotten that small billion dollar loan\nFrom his father to really start out and get as good as going and with the times reported was at least in twenty Eighteen dollars that I was really much more like four hundred and ten million dollars at least what he had received from his

believe that that's a joke\nObviously okay so we had a lot of help fine uh there's no question about that I mean I I never cared much one way or the other people's self made or not and I know apparently a lot of people do but I mean that to me is\nIs right down there at the tabloid level of something you would see on the ... the headline of the national Enquirer you know so he's not a self made as we thought well I'm losing sleep over it even as I think about it now the rest of it\nUh over charges of of possible illegalities uh that I Would take very very seriously the law matters do

they thought wow that's not trumping\nAnd now you have Chris Coons who I tend to think his level headed on the Democratic side say that Eric ... W db owner window Eric\n... a pie and great show I think ... ...\n... the main points I see about Kavanaugh he was good enough to carry the nuclear football having the highest security clearance on planet earth that's good enough for me\nI'm ... uh but uh\nMy daughter my daughter's got her bachelor's degree in psych and she'd like to get her master's degree but she says that this forward woman's a liar when she says under oath says she knows nothing about the polygraph\nIf you're a die if you have a PHD in psychology and the you know exactly how polygraph works and you know that if you cry during one it creates false negatives they only released to her questions on the polygraph test and I'd like to hear your take on that\nA couple of things number one what you taking it for she's taking in the summer before her name was out and she thought she was everything was going to stay confidential that's kind of odd she retains a lawyer oh that's kind of odd so now she wants to named ... she's not mad and whoever leaked out the name that's kind of odd\nI mean that destroyed that changed your life forever the fact is I talked to someone today who's best friends uh was really good friends with the person who dated her for six years\nAnd he told me this guy's got impeccable credentials and says she never talked about sexual assault well maybe that's a reason number two he says there's never talk never was claustrophobic never afraid to fly and never talked about a an ad and did to help her friend passed so I take tests that was where this story came from\nAnd this guy it doesn't want his name out there but was tracked down and did answer the questions when he was tracked down so that interview is out there too\nThe judge Kavanaugh was not telling the truth about his blackouts that's why his blackouts that may or may not have happened in high school or college could stop a judge from go to the Supreme Court how silly is this [noise]\nSo we come back we'll take more of your calls ... and uh and when we come back also look into this Russia investigation took a fascinating turned yesterday on the trumps\nIt's time to begin filling their shoe boxes again for operation Christmas Child this is an international relief program whose mission is to provide gifts are small toy hygiene Adams and school supplies for children affected by\nOut what caused by research to see I'm married if any if your wife came out with those allegations okay\nWould you be sitting next to her twenty four seven and that thing and go there with the and that trial\nWith I mean of course I'm not sure but I Would say this she won evidently she wanted her husband interviewed for this pro right Alison thousands also a lawyer doesn't do is is that true\nThat he had that you want it or has been in the media anyway that's none of the people that I Know Coons reference that you know the FBI didn't interview every one that Ford requested one of them being or has\nAnd the thing is that that's a good point job of that is also a preference the other thing I keep it in the back of my mind will you marry Brett Kavanaugh you know you're living in a public life to a degree if you're dating a I'm a you know other people that you know you you're not signing onto this publicly\nLife and if he's sitting behind her he'll never has is anonymity again\nAnd sometimes people are businesses that you need Republicans and Democrats let's say you owned a restaurant I don't know what the husband does let's say you're a realtor and you don't want everyone to know that your wife came out to try to uh destroyed Brett\nKavanaugh I think it was more simple simpler than that but I read was that he stayed home with the kids so that they'd have a sense of normalcy\nYou know came by and that fight or Joey thank you uh Tim was W. H. I. O. in Dayton hate him\nHey Brian love your show just a one to bring something up about a professor Ford why did she needed go fund me\nI'm a page her lawyer said that they were paying for everything but probably pay for all over flight and everything there to take care of everything for her I'm\nI'm just curious set that up because once she testified she said that she did not know how to get into it she didn't know anything about it and now she's a millionaire\nOr a couple of things the same way Michael Cohen wanted to go find me page or to pay for Lanny Davis Lanny Davis says Michael Cohen's lawyer and he is expensive so Michael Cohen has no money to fund me page\nSo glad he wants to get paid a so I go from page to pay for the lawyers there'll be grad us unless somebody comes up there and pays the bills\nSo that that's a good point I don't know if she did it to be rich ... when you have a PHD and your psychiatrist usually can make a pretty good living\nBut uh there's a lot of mystery around her but you know ... including a lot of the story now all of a sudden she wants to live thoroughly investigated she wants to mount multiple people and she only turn over the therapists notes if she's asked to testify in front of the FBI so\nHi Debbie Ramirez couldn't remember anything then she did remember something to Noah corroborate the story now she's got twenty witnesses or is she getting great law lawyers and they are finding other people that the ends justifies the means if I could stop it conservative from getting on the bench it's okay if I come out and cooperative story I really don't remember\nBrian or by the way I Want you to hear that and thanks we called him I Want you to you that Nancy Pelosi by this is what the caller from W RCN was referring to this is Nancy Pelosi listen to she compares Brett Kavanaugh to cut you off\nThe state Senate has gone to the early in the late ... phone from hearing her love is [noise]\n...

got nine they wanted more\nNext to going to say that Senator Grassley was mistaken when he said in Kevin O's background there was no trace of impropriety sexual drinking issues and not a whiff was the term that Senator Grassley had NATO with\nThat prompted eight Senate Democrats from signing a letter saying that's not true that there is something on his background check\nThat shows a ... inappropriate and this and I asked senator Coons about this I said is that it did you sign as you said no\nI said why not what are they talking about because there is something confidential we can never ever say it\nPublicly but it does show that Grassley essentially overstated when they said there was nothing on his record\nThere you go again last minute statements\nComing out to try to trip up an investigation they tell their trip up to Canada to see before it gets to the vote\nIt's about mccaskey Coons and Collins Manchin Heidi Heitkamp and others are tests are done all these kind of safe and test or they would do well for themselves to vote for Kavanaugh if they want it to be in the mainstream alone McCaskill\nEspecially McCaskill because she's in a dead heat with Josh Halley\nSo now she's in a dead heat but she's already committed to not voting for um those others have to say what matters more my political career represented by people or Chuck Schumer I I I I Know what I my

investigations so should be limited we do not agree that the White House should tie the FBI's hands simply not credible\nTo say that public testimony in last week's hearing is a substitute for interviews by FBI agents not only to senators lack the expertise of FBI agents we were only given five minutes to questions judge Kavanaugh\n[noise] five minutes or every single person Eighteen people and then of course you had the prosecutor from Arizona so Dianne Feinstein isn't the ultimate delay a game I Know the people on the Web that might be saying that she did a good job because she delay the process and it was really a later time bomb and everybody's place in IUD\nBut to me I just think overall most people don't respect what she's saying don't respect you blow up the process\nAnd certainly don't by the fact that she wanted she agreed to limited and the scope they didn't want to have a long investigation bleak said I'll give you one week of all people ... to give you one week you're not voting for him anyway Ken said it could just not voting for many recall robust year\nCarl I just play center Feinstein talk about how disappointed she is about the scope of the

it\nDidn't turn out the result they wanted a week ago they said seven of them signed a letter saying all it was for you guys are Clarence Thomas well they had you know Saturday Sunday Monday Tuesday Wednesday\nYeah the book there is no cooperation there's nobody who's come forward to say I can I can attest to the ... give I witnessed support to these extraordinary charges\nAnd that is true and Brett Kavanaugh was somebody you know and they're still getting complains Dianne Feinstein that didn't get all the documents but it has to do with your the president you work for the things that are still top secret in confidential right\nRight and look that's also an exaggeration of what his role what steps are very it was not his\nJob there'd be a policy advisor it was to look at the documents going to the president and make certain that they made the strongest carpal argument on behalf of everybody in that doctor who's advocating different options\nAnd that they were accurate and complete in prayer and\nYou know it it it it may be in the Democratic penetration that the staff secretary puts their finger on the scale and as a policy advisor but an hours they have a more important job which is the impartial up are they make sure that the document that's going to the president is the best documented it'd be regardless of what the argument is that it's making\nHuge Fran Townsend a person you do respect who's also unhappy ... former homeland security secretary and advisor to President Bush who's also unhappy that the FBI did not interview a cabin or or\nLeave as a prosecutor they couldn't have a credible and complete investigation with an out and interview a doctor for now I think what they're going to hear from the FBI is that they were constrained and who they can talk to buy the south of an investigation even if you take that\nOn face value that they were constrained to investigate\nThe allegations of sexual assault that still doesn't explain why it on area Dr Ford\nSaying they're already have heard testimony and they already have his testimony and sat fare well that is fair but what what are you not get out of that well you don't get out of that the therapist knows what she could have asked her for permission to and don't get the polygraph or the polygraph record what you kind of asked her for\nAnd so there are a lot of ... in a thorough investigation into profit here I think I Would have had an angel back out to say that\nYour thoughts girl well I understand where she's coming from but look if the Senate Judiciary committee chairman has asked for these documents\nAnd Dr boards or lawyers had refused it why do we think in a in a FBI a interview with those who Pina power that they are going to be any more forthcoming for some reason or another\nDoctor Ford's lawyer's Deborah cats uh the lead lawyer refuses to turn over those documents that have weeks so\nLook at it but I I I agree with Fran it'd be nice to have them\nBut they're the windows FBI agents walked in to do an interview audited dot they're not they don't have subpoena power they don't have any ability to compel uh there's there's there's every likelihood that that Dr ... Dr Ford in her lawyer we give them give them the same response they've\nGiven to the Senate Judiciary committee and its investigators which is none of your damn business\nCarl a breakdown in your friend of yours\nYeah absolutely and the ... don't get me started on and he is a court very individual of a norm of intellect tremendous character one of the kindest sweetest people I've ever met his wife is a great friend of mine really a delightful human being and I you know I I'm I'm horrified\nAt what they had to go through a ... it does he still want this job as much as ever did you think he ever regrets getting involved in this process\nWell I Can't speak to that because I haven't talked to him deliberately haven't talked to them but let me just tell you you will be an extraordinarily

have the FBI have a chance at this look at the Harris at the Harvard Harris Poll was very revealing for me which is why I put it in my column was forty been the wall Street Journal at the end of the hearing last week\nThirty seven percent of the people said confirming forty four percent said don't Eighteen percent were undecided which a big number for issue like this but then when they said\nIf there was an FBI investigation which is a time to poll was fielded there was no FBI\nWe'll follow up in the investigation but if the FBI conducts an investigation and there is no cooperation should he be confirmed and the number of flips it's sixty percent concern forty percent do\nCome out all day so I Will pick up the wall Street Journal column or Karl Rove thanks we come back Marsha Blackburn must be senator from Tennessee\nTalk Ninety four point one focused on the engine that's growing the upper Cumberland\nLike that there are more people coming through their doors and they're they're going to have a good year\nOr they are thrilled with the way they have or customers have people coming through their doors\nCouple of things I mean one thing about Tennessee I always thought it was a a right leaning state I'm sure you agree\nThat's probably while you're up in the polls you're up by the Brits are known as a moderate I just haven't known any moderate whether it's a Coons or imagine that ever voted against their party and the tendency is most ask themselves or they comfortable with the senator\nBill would vote against Kavanaugh because that's really what it comes down to you going to make that case\n[noise] well we have been making that case because I've said all along\nI Would be I guess like protesting a law and my opponent issue\nYet to say how he would vote on death than I have to tell you do you know anybody who has is still undecided on this and the answer is no and here's the thing\nWhen it comes to my race Phil\nBredesen my opponent had the opportunity to choose\nHow to run as a Republican that meant dependent or a Democrat and he chose to run as a Democrat if he went to D.C he would be right there with Chuck Schumer who is bought and paid for his campaign and that we know that and the people of Tennessee knows that and if you've got an eighty six days and can't\nMake up your mind on how you would vote on judge Kavanaugh then what else\nIt's a kind of ... a very interesting to see how this all breaks down in cars from when you look around in a in Tennessee right now that was a place a couple of days ago where they welcome the president in

like what was your interaction with the president like\nA and how much how uh how ... how much do you need them in your corner\nI Am honored to have him in ... corner and simply that he chose to come back to Tennessee and I tell ya he had just finished his press conference on the U.S in the ... and that is a very positive\nTrade agreement for ... the car auto makers now after market auto parts

very new there are only about a year old\nOh are you a police officer now oh who's usually when I hear for fifty seven people are public safety workers to some guy\nI work with the public eye in a

like you to get doing is putting money in that for a one day\nAnd start with what you can if that's one percent of your pay two percent of your pay whatever number it is to you and your husband can still live your lives but you can start the habit\nOf saving for retirement\nAnd then you're going to need to over the years whether you're working there working somewhere else with a retirement plan you need to keep stepping up the amount you're putting in\nAnd normally if somebody is younger I talk about raising it one percent every six months\nBut when somebody's past fifty I Want you to step it up one percent every four months\nPercent or\nCan't breathe anymore financially from your take home pay\n'cause you've got to get to where you're saving\nA significant chunk of your paycheck\nA reasonable amount of money for retirement\nAnd in your husband's case he has no retirement plan available to them at work is that right\nNow he heard that word or hear how injury\nI'm Sorry I'm really sorry\nYou know basically I heart or your\nWait wait wait wait you been living as a couple and you've been able to keep things going on your pay\nSo he should say that and what\nWe had a cat ... well\nOkay so what that means to me is that if if you will keep your lifestyle as it is his his pay starts to come back into the picture that he have as much of that as he possibly can and the Roth IRA\nOr since he's pass fifty he's allowed to put sixty five hundred dollars a year in it\nAnd I would set out where you do your budget where every year moving forward he can put sixty five hundred ended that now that he's working again\nBecause you really need to keep stepping up ... percent of your pay goes into retirement and he's going to need to build up for retirement\nAnd that's how you get it done even if you start you said to me is it too late it's not too late it's just the work you have to do is more difficult for him I'd like him to go look at my investment guy to cork dot com to see how they set up a Roth IRA\nAnd then start throwing the money in it every pay period\nGail is with us on the Clark Howard show hello kale hey how are you great are you getting married I Am a little more than a year away\nAll right how can I be of help with this wedding coming up\nI'm I'm trying to go ahead and start looking at options for our honeymoon and we're both want to go somewhere tropical in the Caribbean and so I was kinda curious as to whether you thought a travel agents are worse you know giving or correspond journal found the ... with all this time of uh\nDepends on how much experience you have doing Caribbean island vacations\nNot much we went to grand Cayman or what their parents more but you know I wasn't planning I'm only twenty three so\nSo that's definitely a situation where you want the services of an experience travel agent\nAbout getting generally someone who has a seat tc designation certified traveler counselor they've gone through extensive education and continuous training to be an expert at helping play on your trip\nAnd they're not going to be as cheap as buying some package on the Internet\nBut okay this is your honeymoon and if you buy something that looked great and you get there and it's a disaster that's a terrible way to spend that honeymoon so far as cheap as I Am\nI Would say this is a case where you don't want to cheap out and ... you're a real advanced planner Jim this more time\nBefore you really start trying to look at\nOr a veil ability and for any sense of pricing and be clear what you really enjoy doing for activities you want to do scuba you know you said you went came and did you go scuba diving their snorkeling within within yeah oh so you're a license scuba\nAnd we went we actually went snorkeling\nOkay 'cause I think through the kinds of things you might enjoy you have plenty of times since he got so much time what if you both consider taking one of the dive courses where you live okay and then that opens up a whole different series of possibilities for your honeymoon\nOkay cause you enjoyed the snorkeling right right right nothing like being a diver\nThat's a A R I Wish more enjoyable experience I've I've done dives doing something called snoop ... and I also did something I should not have done I did an unlicensed scuba dive I'm lucky I'm Alive now to talk about that [laughter]\nOh I'm getting looks I really did an unlicensed scuba dive and uh that that almost did not end with me still being with us I'm telling you it was\nNasty story but anyway it's if you're gonna do a Caribbean thing there are a number of places you can go that that really brings the trip to new level if you have this Google license or or you can do short of that and do this new but where you can go twenty feet down\nLow kinds but a but a a certified travel ... will really be able to help you plan it out\nReally yeah\nSam is with us on the Clark Howard show Sam how are you doing\nGood so um my buddy will not but I Know it was recently coming at it and get me to get disability insurance and I don't know if I should get it or not but my company does not have it part of their plan that would be a third party insurance\nWill your buddy sounds like he's my buddy\nGuy is I'm a big believer in people considering buying and maybe in fact buying disability insurance yeah because how old are you twenty\nEight so you got a somewhere close to forty years of working time ahead of you write\n... district show your three times more likely to become disabled during your working years then you are to pass away during your working years and was really terrible is you think about if you become disabled do you have a family\n[laughter] no I'm Still a\nSolo cello as a single guy who's going to take care of you if you become disabled mhm you have family that would take you enter they'd they move like no no no or to dress\nNo yeah they would I don't want to put that burden on them\nSo at twenty eight unless you're in a high risk profession yeah disability insurance should be pretty cheap okay\nAnd I like for you to do a longer waiting period on receiving disability coverage okay so that you lower the premiums and use your savings to ride through a period\nTill you get to where the disability insurance would kick in okay a lot of people think oh I don't need that they don't show without thinking Social Security will get me disability insurance right Social Security disability if you unless you are a relatively modest income earner\nThe news on

deserve what's up in your world\n[noise] ah so recently this week uh found out that uh my wife and kinda racked up about forty can a credit card debt behind the scenes are so kind of slap to the face you know I kind of found out this week for this last weekend\nSo pretty pretty tough to swallow\n... so she was hiding it from you\nYeah I'm ... and I you know I Can't just blame her I mean I I gotta take some credit because I never kind of went and looked and kind of a paid any attention and this is the second time so about two and a half years ago kind of the same thing and I kind of laid out a budget and then kind of slipped away from that budget and I think it was\nIt just kind of roll back into it I assumed everything was going okay but it just kind of wasn't\nOkay so you gave her a all of\nThe responsibility of handling the money and you weren't involved in the money\nThe hundred percent okay yeah yeah it is your fault you know um and it's her fault\nBut basically she was out of control didn't know what to do and uh just borrowed her way into a mess and neither one of your head your head and the game\nCorrect okay\nSo ah are you already to stop the cycle I'm show you how\nA hundred percent and as a this this week and so there's a I don't want to say more to the the problem that I kind of a solution but\nA on Wednesday this week I got a I've received at twenty nine thousand dollar inheritance check that I haven't put in the bank ... because I wanted to wait until I spoke with you to see how I or go attack us I don't want to I don't want to do any other dumb things I Want to continue I Want to start from scratch off the debt but I got to do it the right way\nOkay let me ask you this then it sounds like you're taking ownership for having kind of a dump this on your wife an abandoned her a issue taking ownership for the shame in fact she was ashamed and so she hid this from you because she didn't know what to do but she knew she was screwing it up\nYeah we we had a couple conversations or a ... for a church and we have some a marriage and Richmond stuff and we got to look into doing some more of that to kinda get up in fact I mean I I don't want to ... you know you've got to talk to but I think that yes we accept the responsibility\nYou know I don't know that you are necessarily hard to talk to you just abandon her\n\n... year left or out in the cold she was doing the best she couldn't she screwed it up really bad and was really a shame to tell you it sounds like that's the way it goes\nThe reason I'm asking and the reason I'm poking at you a little bit is because it changes what to do with the twenty nine thousand okay now the other possibility is and I don't think that's what's going on here but you tell me because I'm asking you is the other possibility is a this woman is a deceive her she's a liar\nLet me just clarify this for you there is no positive effect to your marriage when you lie to your spouse\n[laughter]\nWas that helpful you don't already know that they do [laughter] yeah well I'm trying to avoid it by ear you're all you're doing the cooking it up it's going to be a bigger fight once it cooks up [laughter] you might as well have a smaller by quickly [laughter] so\nHere's the thing if you're afraid to discuss with your spouse a purchase\nOr a financial issue that you want to discuss that is not a financial problem that's a relationship problem\n\nNow I got to tell you there's times I I mean I I have a ton of money I'm a multi millionaires times though I think I Want to buy something and I'm going to sit down and talk show and hey I Want to buy this toy\nI Want to buy another gun she's like you don't mean not again you have too many guns already people already would think you were crazy if they know what I mean yeah and you and I collect guns by the way so\nYeah if it ever comes out you know they're they're going to find out that I was like one of those crazy guys or something but I'm not but I I collect okay I collect so you know you don't need another car you don't need another ... you don't need another inner tube to pull behind the bar actually collect those I got too much too many like toys right ah for the grandkids and for the kids to play on\nAnd so you know I I get ready to buy a toy and it's it's not it doesn't even show up on our\nBut I still have to have this moment and I go I I actually got to make sure I talked to sharing about this she gets ready to buy a person's too expensive which is one of the few things that she buys this too expensive but like she says one of those purses is equal to one of those guns [laughter]\nUh well maybe maybe two guns [laughter] but uh you know isn't it funny how as adults that have the money even\nWhere there is not a stress on the finances have it a little bit of a dread about talking to each other so you really have to push yourself and make yourself and Rachel talks about this in her book love your life not there's the one of the seven habits just talk about money even when it's hard and it's almost always hard\nTo talk about it keep it clean and\nYour spouse is hiding money from you it generally does fall under one of three areas\nAdded value to the spouse is an arrogant\nRebellious immature prints are princes that just wants to do whatever they want to do with their lips stuck out and they don't like being told no spoiled child and the grownup body and goes and buys whatever they want to buy but know that it's wrong so they hide it from you\nMost often we find hidden that though is the what the guy was on the last call\nOne of the spouses has been given all of the responsibility all of the weight of all of the decision making isn't doing the money handling them well ends up running into debt because they're not doing a good job with it and now the shame is multiplied and it shame based hiding its guilty\nCondemnation base hiding so they're hiding it 'cause they don't they're they're ashamed that they haven't done a good job of handling the money\nIn which case if that's your spouse you are partially responsible just like that guy said\nHe was he on that because he should have been more involved you shouldn't be dumped this on his wife and you shouldn't dump it all on your husband\nYou shouldn't dump it all on either one of the both of you should be involved now whenever you again can carry that ministry of weight once all the decisions are made but everybody ought to know where every dollar is going pretty simple stuff\nSo you probably never heard the story but I actually was the guy who has almost been on Oprah more than anybody\nOprah called like five six times their producers did and would tease us like we could get on I've been on every other show back in the day you know I've been on a sixty minutes I had been on Larry King remembering Larry King was on the air I'm Sally Jessie Raphael you remember her with a red glasses you know all that I've been on all these different shows\nYou know everything out there ... except I couldn't get on Oprah and they would call and teases so finally they call and we get our Oprah parents and it was three different families on Oprah and I was supposed to advise them in their trouble on Oprah and the very first family\nOf course I knew what I was getting into and the families knew what they were getting into a sort of and um the very first couple I'm sitting up there are getting an argument with Oprah\nWhy would I Do that because Oprah was wrong [laughter] is what happened so here's the deal the wife had run up like Seventy thousand dollars worth of debt and her husband had no idea\nAnd uh I had told the producers I said what's partially his fault because he's not involved in his wife's life enough he's not loving his wife enough to even know what's going on in her life enough that she can run up Seventy eight thousand dollars if she unless she's just like a psychopath and her level of deception\nThis guy had and he he doesn't know what's going on under his own roof these free can clueless when his relationship\nAnd so Oprah's reading the script and she's like and Dave you say that it's partially spoiled and he ... or an apology I don't think I agree with that and I said well you would be wrong he does or an apology because he hasn't been walking with his wife to the point she runs up Seventy eight thousand all over the debt and he don't even know what the clips going on under his own roof\nAnd she's like well he delegated it to her I said oh this is not a business you don't delegate stuff to your spouse\nAnd just dump it on them and even if you're delegated in business you would always inspect what you expect you've never just walk away and hope it happened you wouldn't know what's going on in business and besides that this is marriage is not a joint venture God did not say and now you are a joint venture\nHe said now you are one and they used to or not one they're not on the same page and so [noise]\nBecause she's so ashamed and overwhelmed and the guys angry 'cause he's finding out he got eighty grand and debt that he didn't know he had and oh man it looked like a Jerry ... Springer episode or something and um you know and I'm a I'm standing on making him apologized to her for not being a good husband\nBecause of your wife can run up your husband can run up a hundred thousand dollars in debt and you have no idea what's going on you have chosen to not be involved in your own spouse's life or their psychopathic liar\nOne of the two but most of the time it's you just did you just dump it on them and then and then you cry because they didn't do it right after you dumped it on them and walked away in close your eyes\nAnd what we'll do the ... well\nYou know you thought but you didn't even care enough to get involved\nAnd know what was going on and so Oprah's all upset with Dave because Oprah was wrong [laughter] didn't work out well the rest of the show what we got through it [laughter] so here's the rule of thumb then we see couples\nWho have a good marriage have been married ten years or Fifteen Years or Twenty years\nSit down and start doing a basic budget together we're every dollar has an assignment every dollar has a mission every dollar as a name before the month begins on paper on purpose every month before the month of begins a unique budget it takes about ten minutes\nOnce you've been doing it a while\nBut it takes about three months of doing it to get really on the same page and get a rhythm going we see couples that agree on their spending before the month begins on paper on purpose increased their level of communication\nIncrease their level of cooperation\nIncrease their empathy for each other for the stress the other one's been carrying that they didn't even realize\nThey began to agree on their goals and their productivity with their money goes through the roof\nYou feel like you've got to raise when you learn to do this together\nOn paper on permission before the month begins give every dollar a name that's why we named the world's best budgeting software\nThe best for your phone every dollar movie of every dollar a name [noise]\nWay or the upper number Lynn talks with Dave Ramsey news talk Matty formally wise man hundred\nDid you know there are more than two million real estate agents in this country two million\nWhen all you want to do is buy or sell a house you don't have time to sift through ads on line or email twenty different people to find a few agents you want to interview our real estate EL peas have years of experience and are the top agents in their markets and in fact\nWe recommend less than one percent of the agents in the country that's why many of our listeners have success\nWith any lp Richard and Mississippi did and this is what he had to say there are so many real estate agents today than it is refreshing to find someone like your E.

called boundaries by Dr Henry Cloud I read it\nMany many years ago and since then Henry and I have become really good friends I Love ...\nI Love that book too\nAnd one of the things I grass from reading that book and other\nThere's ... there is a difference between forgiveness and reconciliation\nOf us that are wise in emotional maturity spiritual maturity\nAnd those of us that are Christians are called to forgive when you forgive you set yourself free\nFrom the bondage of the fence you're offended and when you forgive when you're a victim and you forgive you're not setting the victimize or free you're setting you yourself free\nYou can forgive someone and not be reconciled to them\nThan lady called a minute ago and was trying to figure out how to should she reconnect with her brother in law she's having trouble reconnecting her brother in law after he had affairs and everything else and he supposedly come clean for the last two years\nHis wife has forgiven him and taking him back and been reconciled to him but not the sister in law she didn't want to be around it\nSo here's the question at what point for someone's misdeeds do you forgive them and then at what point are you reconciled to them they're different\nGuy someone rapes you what a horrible grotesque violent unbelievably violent crime I Can't imagine I Can't imagine going to say something like that\n\nBut to not forgive them of eventually as you begin to heal from your emotional scars is to not set yourself free from that very difficult to do I'm not saying it's easy but when you when you do for give them you set them free but you would not be reconciled ever\nTo someone who raped ... meaning you wouldn't go on a date with him you know someone steals your wallet you can forgive them\nBut you're not gonna you know leave your wallet with them later your new wallet for them to watch over your money you wouldn't be reconciled with them probably ever in that situation but in the case of that young woman she was not personally wrong her\n\nYou know the guy's wife issue was wrong right and uh her sister in law was wrong and\nHer brother in law however I don't know how it worked out his brother in law but anyway as is letting it I guess her husband's family as a way I understood it but anyway the the lady that the the wife is who was wrong and she forgave animals reconciled to the husband as he supposedly is putting his life back together I don't mind me I did but his life back together I don't know the guy\nYou don't know the guy well once you knew that you can always do it well you know people that I haven't done it can always do it\nYou know any one of you listening is capable of adulterous affairs\n\nEveryone's capable of that and if you think you're not capable of it you're just about to have one I mean really that's just ridiculous shout at what point do you forgive someone when they've done something wrong at a distance\nLike that\nI can forgive him and you know I Hope he's turned it around and I'm like I'll sit around and reading my hands and be mad at him and worried about him I Hope we turned it around I Hope he doesn't hurt her again on his wife I'm I can\nThis guy again that's what reconciliation is at what point am I going to trust that his conversion his turnaround Israel should we run into this all the time with her coaching because one spouse lies to the other one about money what we call financial infidelity\nYour husband your wife lied to you and ran up a bunch of credit cards and you didn't even know it it's hard to trust them again\nAfter that\nMap you're going to stay married you're pretty well instantaneously\nGonna have to sit down and go okay I forgive you but I'm not necessarily going to be reconciled to you financially\nI'm a I'm going to watch over your shoulder on everything that's going on or we have a couple of come in and the guy is a ... as I you know he he's a been found to be a gambling addict which happens like every week\n\nFootball betting is destroying families finance us it's on the leave all bull\nSo he comes and he's discovered she's discovered he's a abetting addict an online betting addict the gambling addict and now he's gotten treatment he's in gamblers anonymous and he's seeing his pastor and he's seeing a counselor and he's doing everything he supposed to do does that mean she just turns over the checkbook to him and let him go run havoc again no\nNo it's a matter of fact we recommend that when someone's recovering from an addiction like that that that may not have control of and not have any access to money for a while\nUntil trust us rebuild overtime but ten years later ... should be rebuilt ten months later it shouldn't be better than it is now two years later or should we better than that it should per aggressively rebuild trust\nAnd so if ten years later you you're still or you know you have not bet on a football game again you've not lost any money gambling again are you trustworthy at that point you know as much as anybody else's and so we're not gonna treat you like you have no\nAbility to handle money the rest of your life but for the short term yeah we're taking all access to money away from you too you prove that you can have a little bit\nAbsolutely but then gradually trust his rebuilt and overtime is rebuilt\nIf you cannot when someone has\nOn something like we're talking about here has ... has not when when someone has demonstrated over an extended period of time that they're not\nEntering into the negative behavior and you can't forgive them and you can't begin to trust them in that area then it starts to be on you and two years clean if the guy's clean\nFrom his double life adult for survivors or whatever he was doing porn addiction whatever it was sound like it was all of that\nTwo years is a long time you should be some level of trust rebuilt assuming it's all real now if there's indicators is not real\nBut they're still looks like he's sneaking around if he's still got behaviors that make everybody question whether there's a real then that's different but I'm assuming this guy straight and if he's straight for two years than\nYou know it starts to be your problem if you can't begin to trust at that point especially given that his wife already which she might just be an enabler she might be\nShe might be ... and that could be what's going on [noise]\nThat he's cleaned up his life and you're just suffered you can't forgive me that's the difference there's a difference in forgiveness and reconciliation they generally happen at different times generally forgiveness should come faster than reconciliation\nIf I had a dog and it provides me\nDoes that Iran's Asia [noise]\nMost lunch up through your finances Dave Ramsey continues views top Ninety four point one\nI get asked all the time when in the baby steps is the right time to buy life insurance my answer is typically now\nLife insurance was not part of the baby steps because it's needed when your family has debt and not enough savings to provide for their financial mates that's when they're at the highest risk and no matter where you are and your baby steps it's a necessity not a choice this\nIncludes working husbands and wives as well as stay at home parents it's pretty expensive to replace a stay at home parent responsibilities I only recommend ...

your mom and dad are screwed up\nAnd we made some really bad decisions and because of that you're going to suffer more going to suffer and that's the only way we're going to get out of it and we got

years and we said we're done with that and we want the pain and discipline and so we had to tell her kids um\nHad to tell my son were not doing basketball training anymore so we got to who found in

husband and I\nWe sit out on our deck on our front porch and we talk a lot and\nSo when this all happened when when many you know I'm decided she was going to retire from basketball and we we talked about it we entertain the thought of it what do you think I don't know what do you think you know and so I knew that I I wanted to go on in my career and um I Would like to coach in high school and so\nAnd the opportunity came there and and I'll be honest with you we prayed and we prayed and we prayed and just really felt like All right we've got to go ahead let's do it lets you know I went and talked to Mr ... who is the athletic director at the time just kinda\nTold him I was interested in you know he encouraged me to apply and at that point there there were some really good applicants there so I I didn't really\nShare that information with a lot of people just because I just want to just you know wait and see how it all play out and then once it happened it just it happened really quickly I I was\nInterviewed and then like the next week found out that that they had that had gotten it and it was really really exciting and it just kind of funny how like I said you know started my career teaching and coaching ... high school and then you know to come full circle to be able to\nYou know have our family and get everything in place like we wanted to as far as their ages and you know how they could our girls could just go along beside us and not really feel like they miss out on anything and um so it just it I really just suck it was all in God's timing and it all worked out and here we are\nSo from beginning to end the process you heard about the job until you got to drop how long was at that time for him oh gosh\nMaybe a month pins and needles was a crazy for you\nYeah I mean like I said I didn't get the interview when I got my interview and then when I got the job was like a week so that wasn't\nTerrible you know but it was leading up to that and then you know we heard there was a list of the applicants that came out and you know so it was just it was just kind of funny it wasn't really dramatic at it I guess it was in my life because I was just like kind of in limbo and not really\nI didn't really talked to a lot of people about it I I talk to Scott I talk to my mom because she's kind of Iraq and needed her advice and council and\nAnd I talked to Bailey who was in eighth grade at the tower she was in seventh grade at the time and I really felt like I was really going to turn her life upside down going to a new school changing new friends\nIn eighth grade and so I I talked to her and she's a very mature young lady and we had a lot of conversations and\nUm she was one of the ones that if she would have said don't do it I wasn't ... because I felt like it you know her life and what she needed for me at that time was important and um\nWe we learned a lot of valuable lessons through that time about how to pray and and television and to rely on
