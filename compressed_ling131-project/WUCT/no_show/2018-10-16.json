Saturday before and after the game against Alabama\nPat tell she goes to Auburn they had a lot of things on the check was they were able to check off the beat of top ranked team they beat a top drank team on the road they beat an FCC west team on the road and I got there first as you see one of the yeah a lot of things happened yet\nDid a great team when it really was it ... it wasn't that a game without\nTennessee share warts but there was a lot of good things that happened in that game off it's had a lot of good impact plays a lot of long\nDirt down secondary conversions deep bench league gave up and yard\nBut made some crucial stopped and turned him over three times which was a huge factor that ball games\nYou know well if you have to be able to take a little tunnel here do at the glow go ahead go ahead because somebody here on the show last week said that I think stand if he's going to steal a game here and I'm not going to be the guy to my right was a little bit negative impact\nOr is it a little bit negative kind of rolled his eyes at me and I my my theory was okay my theory was that ... in Alabama this week to get there will get that I haven't come up with that yeah okay\nYes you got all burnt out of the race they run the SEC champs have been one to the west last year like juniors and seniors\nThey're not excited to play those guys are thinking about the NFL they're not playing the same guys I think the differences are got Tennessee's guys or decided to play football they're excited to play they had an off week they had some time to prepare\nTheir excited to play football I think that that show that they were there ... there there's work there I get it we didn't run the ball real well but\nUm their side of the play Auburn wasn't and I think also coach for it started to listen to our show and he learned that you've got to throw it up the\nThe guys like tell when you get to go at your maker so on June ... ... exactly\nAll want to be in there and they finally started with our show and I said you know play to already back to the poor and pet sit you know for the cow away a Jennings and we'll make place\nSo yeah but we're victory now have you got your notes ready to send their coach fruit this week\nWell we might have a little time to formulate a animal air Jeff and I are taking this is our off right now during Saddam was pretty special Senate was he was he did you know and I think the thing like you said he just gave us guys a chance to make place yeah\nSome of the throws you made were two of them were the only person that could make the catch was the Tennessee were you know we\nMade more long conversions and this ball we may end up long conversions and this ball game to last three games really because if you're if you're really look at the ball game\nUh we were in some bad spots yeah Bob I mean you know a first year we lose your first day on you know we're we're behind the sticks the whole time and time after time he came out and made perfect throws and\nHe had guys that went out there and just snatched it away or it ... it was it was just it was a perfect game for guaranteed on him because he's had he struggled he's been getting beat up\nA this was a game you talk about a confidence builder for a guy like him it's unbelievable and I I I Know Kelly MIT's great play but I still Jennings says the guy the\nGuy I mean he ... he attacks the ball I you know I think about that slant he threw it was like Hi and I mean but he went and grabbed it and and so you guys bouncing off yeah it's one of those guys that when he gets the ball and the you know when you're watching on TV you see the yellow line he gets like\nHe's going to find a way to get over that line he just one of those guys have\nTo twenty ... bad yeah I mean he's me I mean he got up I mean he he's got to go into two or three guys bring him\nDown at ... you know today and Jeremy ... who was asking his press conference about John Jennings and he said I Love the guy\nYou know he goes out he he had had a bad knee injuries come back from that he actually said something good about yeah he did and he said the guy the\nGuy does everything in practice yet he's been a perfect teammates he said I don't know I Know there was a lot of things that may be in the past but then my dealings with him he has done everything he's we've asked him to do and he has just been a bright spot\nOn the coaches coaches like guys compete coaches guys at the get down and dirty if there's a nickel on the ground they'll fight for and he's that kind of guy and he's obviously growing up you know matured and a\nOf things I took away from the game on Saturday one notch a warrior grew up um when you when you heard that Michael Abernathy was not going to play he's a quarterback your secondary\nAnd you're down Trayvon flowers using you got to safety is down\nSomebody's got to step up in Niger warrior I thought I did a tremendous job getting everybody lined up there they may be were a couple of bust about I don't know um\nIt seemed like the the secondary never was out a position now on the one touched down one they missed attack on that happens sometimes but other than that I mean Auburn didn't get a bunch of junk plays against them no they did you look at the Albert gained over four hundred yards and had a couple of ... and they had\nBut that's their opening to drives in their final drive that's where most of that you\nWere a lot of their yards came from and the defense is ... and uh\nThey made a lot of key stops and it was in a lot of the place I turned about didn't look at the game tendencies zero turnovers Auburn three ... game right there\nAnd and it's it's funny you say that because I felt like the first game and then we've been ... you know from last year actually the last two two and a half years my biggest complaint about Tennessee defense and the players is there were no explosive guys\nThan there was the first time I thought well defensively they made a of Philips made some good good yeah self made some explosive play made some turnover\nOn like all this Johnson and the back yeah\nYeah exactly and there was some explosive place that we hadn't seen in a while and you just kind of get the feeling that defense of unions get more comfortable with their their responsibility to roll with the kind of been here ... years back and say more aggressive\nYeah and then if you ... during the tunnel named the SEC offensive player of the week ... offensive down here the week saying those guys are had big big games and were awarded for that on a Philips and elections Johnson\nHad to be their best games has Tennessee Volunteers because you were able to get pressure with your front three guys and you'd have to blitz on back well you know the funny thing was a\nFirst Dr see real pressure yeah none\nIt looked like ... we're just gonna jet sweep and making it you're just like oh they're just going to roll right over here but after after we got the field goal in in ...\nI think we're the game turn for us was when we held him to a field goal in the second series yes and I think they I think the guys looked at and say hey you know we stopped him and then\nEnded up getting a turnover was it the next series I Can't remember exactly I all of a series worked out but ah they start playing more confident has started coming out because the quarterback and made some place on the stand them I mean they made his life\nMiserable why even little things like that they they run a double reverse you know past but man we had pressure I mean it was one of those he he was soccer is the kind of space any kind of panicked those are kind of things that it's just good to see that the defense making\nLive sometimes your head

ah one of the things that we have been working on for some time in cooperation with the university and with the athletics department and our coach is\nIs the fight against Alzheimer's and\nOur friends at UT medical center of course a house the Pat Summit clinic and we've had a a really a close look\nAt a lot of the statistics related to all commerce and one thing that I didn't know was there there are I think five million diagnosed cases now and that number's expected to triple to over sixteen million cases by the year\nTwo thousand and fifty\nAnd we knew then that we needed to do something and we needed to come together as a university and the result of that is the all in campaign\nAnd we are selling currently\nShakers for the Alabama game and the proceeds go to research that's actually being done right here in Knoxville at the Pat Summit clinic so we're hoping that are fans will get behind the cause\nThe orange and white shakers which Tennessee has a ... great tradition of\nShakers

statement as it relates to this fight and it's going to take all of\nThis you know I think all of those the new Pat Summitt well and saw how the disease affected her took her life but how she attacked in how she fought it and how she championed this fight\nIs I think inspiring for everybody and that's why I'd like to see everybody\nAnybody that knows anybody this battle this disease or know if

same is cash with a broom credit ... cargo trailers dumped trailers equipment trailers bee\nSo let me ask you know who who do you have is your second best team in ... to three and four teams right now\nWell I stayed with my second best theater seat on high stake twice destroy a lot of some of the current state of solve it gets to you to really get winds from them so I'd go Alabama one or two I'd probably clumps three at this point and\nNotre Dame ... and ... and they wonder if they want a couple of good games at one of the environment I was at the game in Blacksburg a couple of weeks ago when they check I don't know how good we can detect is\nSo I'd probably go Notre Dame before but I have a right to do the cough is LA LA she's got that are performing LA though is it a position where if they could beat Alabama a couple of weeks is not going to matter what happened because at that point they certainly have it all in front of them\nBut if they lose that game it gets into losses and knocks him out ...\n... itself\nIs father to be comfortable with the SEC to get two teams in the playoffs unless there's chaos and other conferences you know down the tracks\nBut the best scenario for that to happen in my opinion was Georgia went out\nAnd then we're that close game or the competitiveness of Alabama and his symptoms and then in that scenario I thought they both like go but you're right was that what she loses the band that with two officers it's going to be difficult\nFor them to get in ... because you look at the age of ... way uh they still got to play at the end of the season\nThat way and I'd be Notre Dame team does not get the play offs\nBut ... do you not did you not think George of the myth of Georgia got exposed to this last weekend the ... foot ... ball team this year just Georgia football team this year\nThey're not there don't they don't have you looked at who they lost in Alabama lose ... guys on if you look at some of the players or the last ... last year uh they're still good on the fence but they were not able to replace some of those guys they lost to great running backs and they're still good at that position but you know they're they're not selling but sales are not ...\nYes I think the fact that they were still a little bit unproven will be safe in the office of wire they've had some interest in how to get a lot\nThat those are things when you looked at them going into that game they had not really played a complete football game that been sloppy at times and I think you're right it did catch up with him on Saturday a at a state\nWhere it's Chris Lowe of ESPN dot com and also was on the nation you know many of these ... were stationed pushed to the wind up from Tennessee against Auburn raised the bar of expectations are a lot\nYou know you guys have I mean I Love his his his typical deadpan style he says well Chris I expected when every game we play the sport and I and that's the ...\nYou know why he's lying to you is I\nPromise you that's the way the coach Arabic area and I've watched the practice and I got it and that's the way you got you got even still had occurred in the team but yeah it raises the bar yeah I think what it has brought it to get through this game\nYou know and and not mentally physically are both retired to budge you looked at the back into their schedule and all of a sudden their games out there with her the way I didn't make a run out of all I think you do any credit for your finger\nIn August and certainly coming out of that first off the west Virginia just as a team that might have a chance to propose name\nI think a lot of people were taking it to the most refreshing thing look at it through Tennessee perspective is that teams gotten better and they're playing with more calm and that's what you want to see you going\nFor the rest of the way so I say I think a lot of people were encouraged all the Tennessee fans out talk to the way the team is responded again to Jeremy and stacks and he hasn't been afraid to challenge he'll continue to ... out\nYou know it was interesting today you also mentioned the fact you your plane Alabama but he still worried about Tennessee getting better I mean he said if they can they can't look at who they were playing they gotta look at how they practice today how they're going to practice tomorrow and they got to take another step into a so far the approaches weren't doing something\nSounds familiar sort of like the guy that's going to be on the other side of the side a lot of the\n... yeah I Wonder whether or not one that we're not even a\n... and that is there is that uh you know ... it's it's become clear shade but federal prosecutor getting better and creating death in creating ... ... you don't do that overnight you don't do that with horn\nRecruiting class and the thing that I ... about Jeremy ... never worn her very um well I got to get my players in here got you know yeah the one\nCountry moved to recruit players but\nThis is the and again you can't underestimate Bob how much pain\nHas responded to him I think they have sort of taken on that approach ... we're going to get better every week every practice and that's exactly the way they talk about it so I look forward to seeing how much better that seem to get\nThis year back when you hear him play the way in the past game and really open brings up because that shows you and I think it shows that the teams on your schedule but they can be pretty close it down the field when it will\nNo question what Jamie got this week Tennessee Alabama\nI got a home and I got I got thirty five hundred dropping ...\nLet's not ... not home enough for me as a whole different district right there I I Do have a whole game but it that way for seven nine two four and five\nTimes well we'll look forward to seeing in the press box Chris thanks for your time they're not always good to hear from you get your views on college football and keep up the good work you\nEven got sent me a player if your if you\nGive me George ... maybe they'll ship until you cod maybe so All right All right Thanks Chris ... Chris Lowe have ESPN dot dom and the nation and a really one of the best football writers out there and uh\nHe's seen a lot of teams and a lot of games in the nose on about this he does say him and he's really tuned in to not only did see see but all around the country\nThat he is you know it's interesting to say you know and I don't mean this not to be like you know the last coach we had the first year of the guys responded\nAnd they're responding now I just get a different sense though I just get a different sense this is not going to be a one or two I just get a sense of this guy the great thing about him the best thing I've seen the best quality I've seen is\nThe guys in the room that he's coach and he cares about his his players and his staff and all the other stuff you know doesn't matter and that's the kind of refreshing\nYeah and they completely different from the last eight to ... I don't mean to beat up on the left and right I don't mean a lot but it just feels different he is brutally honest yeah he doesn't sugarcoat anything and there's absolutely no coached be who you know you ... it's kind of refreshing when you ask ask a question to answer that his\n... his challenges though and the same as Bush is you know you got a lot of young guys and you got their attention and they believe in what happens when you keep talking about it and there's not success right then all of a sudden you know kids normal thing is they don't start they don't believe that um\nWe we'll see we'll see but I just I just buy the game Saturday really yes yes I agree I mean the mental work or not where we want to be but man that is a huge\nStep for it's a huge confidence boost I don't care what happens is next Saturday Auburn game was so needed for this football team I don't think your game qualified I mean it was it was the perfect game but the perfect man for fans and their body of\nEvidence that when you lose ... there's a drudgery to well what do you win a game boy just picks you up it really does\nThat's where I Want to hear from Tennessee quarterback the SEC off as a player of the week Jarrett Germantown I Want to come back in a moment this is the big orange outline on the ball network\nEveryday life is an adventure alarm clock traffic kids crazy scheduled share and Jason Lewis ... we want to how to use all everyday and comfort and style and during the jeep and venture days you can have thousands I'm hearing you cheat\nRight here in Eugene today we hear a ... percent interest rate for five years slash new cars with our exclusive one nine year war and have were located on one twenty auto lane inspired online anytime Lewis automotive dot com detailer detail [noise]\nFamily pharmacy is where the where your family health the owners grew up right here in the upper Cumberland\nThey appreciate their local friends and neighbors Christian values and the volunteer spirit all family pharmacy make sure you have the medications prescriptions and supplies you need your help these weird the heart is this is still in\nPower from home family pharmacy residents today at our locations in Jamestown Grange hall family pharmacy her family your health\nTennessee sports fan so check out the place where sports is the name center hill sports Murray Cumberland largest pontoon dealer with Bennington and sound based on two\nPlus quality free on pontoon most ski boats family cruisers and fishing boat expert service convenience stores and finance center hill sports voices their name one mile from ... center he'll lay the center hill sports marine dot net when your\nTeam scores you can't help but smile and the team it have family dentistry helps keep them smile healthy offering nation dentistry for more comfortable anxiety free way to take care of your teeth doctors Kevin in Sandy have part of the team you can count on for dental health and a great winning smile\nFind out more about syndication dentistry from the team and have family dentistry called five to six sixteen fourteen fetch five to six sixteen fourteen per visit have dentistry dot com\nCBS News on the hour sponsored by their works relief nine\nPM Coulter the computer world has lost a pioneer Paul Allen has died at age sixty five CBS has deep Letterman reports\nIn the beginning of the computer revolution Paul Allen was there the cofounder with Bill gates and Microsoft\nGates once called L and the idea man the two met while attending a private school in Seattle eventually though came of bowing out I wasn't told sixty minutes in two thousand eleven that gates was trying to ease them out\nThere but if we're talking about how we were\nPlanning to go ... my shirt down to almost gothic Ellen\nLeft Microsoft in Nineteen eighty three two years before the first version of windows was released but he kept his stock and when he died album was worth around twenty billion dollars ...

I had to make sure I had checked to date very carefully now you've written it up in the long war journal with details\nAh my first question to you Tom because you're a veteran reporter on this are you surprised that we're ... recreating the same negotiation that failed and twenty Thirteen good evening to Utah\nBeaming John well I'm not surprised I mean these negotiations have been coming for some time we've sort of telegraphed on the American side that ah we just want to get out of Afghanistan has been telegraphing or weakness for some months now\nAnd it's all by knows that and they know that they have a very um advantageous bargaining positions are starting from all this that the U.S doesn't have any intention of even trying to defeat the Taliban on the battlefield\nThat tall blond controls are contests a good chunk of Afghanistan to this day you know anywhere from forty five percent or forty four percent of the low end up to over more than sixty percent of the high end\nOf the countries either contests are controlled by the Taliban now they see all the arguments coming out of the American government that are all basically trying to explain away the Taliban and its depending victory here\nAnd they understand that we were just desperate to get out so no I'm not surprised at all but I think the bottom line from my perspective is that people need to keep 'em in mind\nJust how desperate this really is because there's a whole sorted long history here where the U.S government failed um in just complete a drum dramatically failed in what turned out to be a total fiasco in trying to negotiate with top on the first time around\nAnd some of the same arguments all the same argument that were made than are being made now and in fact it looks like we're having negotiation with them at the very same office that they opened in two thousand Thirteen in a manner that was a gigantic embarrassment both for the U.S and our Afghan allies\nWhat is the Islamic emirate of Afghanistan this is that is that a convenient umbrella for this or does that actually exist\nIt exists Islamic emirate Afghanistan is the um ... to ... state of the Taliban had in Afghanistan prior to that to nine eleven attacks that they lost\nAfter the U.S led invasion like two thousand one they've called themselves the Islamic emirate Afghanistan all along in fact you know we've seen some suppose that Afghan experts on line who don't even know this but it's ... it's been\nObvious for the entire time now and I mean the entire time in two thousand one to now that they wanted to resurrect or Islamic emmer Afghanistan this is what they consistently call themselves\nAnd why is this important well the U.S has tried to talk itself into believing that that isn't their gold at the top on doesn't really want to dominate all of Afghanistan once again\nAnd in fact when you look at the current negotiations are going on do how when that office was open in two thousand Thirteen\nThe Obama administration agreed to allow the tall blond open up that office in Doha as sort of a desperate measure to try and jumpstart the failed negotiations for a couple of years prior to that time us that are already failed to get any kind of real negotiations going with the Taliban and so there was sort of this desperate Hail Mary pass the bomb mission through allowing the Taliban\nRolling around in poison ivy to the back stroke in a lake\nFull of ...

visit scala dot com today to modernize your digital experience to the report on Somalia is dire\nThe U.S has a hand in air strikes and you add long war journal keep a map of the airstrikes and the frequency of airstrikes throughout the coast of Somalia is cheaply in the south\nYou have reported this past week the Shabaab is executing spies what do you do you measure the strength of Shabaab at this point and can you compare it to the Taliban\nWell you know that like like a tall bunch of Bob is principally an insurgency organization which is seeking to take over Somalia and parts of East Africa to build their own emirate their own Islamic state in East Africa and they're doing this under the banner of all kinds of the Shabaab is part of ... and has been part of all kinds of first for very long time\nUm and so we all kind of looks at this is the Shabaab is is designated as the organization or it's representative in East Africa to try and build an Islamic emirate there in the U.S is propping up the a nascent federal government in Somalia which has a lot of problems in his sort of very\nMuch an upstart effort is trying to prop up that that government has sort of a bulwark against Shabaab unfortunately Shabaab still controls are contests a large portion of Somalia just as a tall blond does in Afghanistan\nAnd to Bob's roots are very much a local they have a lot of local strength there for a lot of tribal relations and other parties that are sort of bought into Shabaab scheme in some areas and Somalia where Shabaab provides better governance on a daily basis um even though it's jihadi governance\nThan the actual government does and this is a big problem because what they're doing is they're trying to actually build this state\nSlowly and so the U.S has expanded its air campaign against sought individuals in Somalia the train weaken Shabaab hierarchy and to try and take out certain operational commanders who were thought to be especially problematic so over the last\nSince really early to thousands Seventeen there's been an uptick that my colleagues at one were journal have been tracking in a number of American airstrikes in Somalia against these sort of a well defined targets um and you know these are the Sunnis are stricter course controversial and some of them are not really\nIt has been going on for some months now and it's intensified for some

Muhammad this begins to feel like the Cold War Tom the ethics and the CIA recruiting men who have been executed by Shabaab\nYeah well actually Shabaab executed these guys who were ... they were allegedly recruited by the U.S\nBritish Intelligence and smiling intelligence to spy on Shabaab or to cause problems for Shabaab and Shabaab like other all kinds of branches does this fairly regularly they have a campaign take out\nCertain alleged spies to try and show that they are you know have infiltrated the ranks and that there's going to be accountability for that now what they're trying to tie this back to both the air campaign that we just were talking about with the U.S has been watching these drone strikes against targets\nBut also to the Islamic State's president so\nThis is an Shabaab Shabaab of course opposed the Islamic state just dissolve all kind of does and in Somalia the Islamic state has an upstart presidents that trying to basically carve out a niche from within Shabaab to try and challenged buffers the thirty\nThat's far Shabaab is is the far stronger ... player and I don't think that's going to change anytime soon Islamic state presence is much smaller but Shabaab is part of its information campaign to try and undermine Islamic state is accusing some of these spies including one in particular who allegedly worked for and my six\nOf taking money from the Brits and giving it to the Islamic state in Somalia to try and basically um build up the Islamic State's presidents and strengthen it at your Bob's expense I think that that's probably more propaganda information warfare and their part they're trying to undermine the Islamic State's legitimacy but you know the details all get very murky very quickly\nUm we just have a minute and to your knowledge is the U.S seeking to negotiate with Shabaab the way it's negotiating with the Afghanistan Taliban\nYou know John that's a great point you know the top on what's happened with his negotiates with the U.S us the same as the tall blondes Islamic emirate is somewhat legitimate in Afghanistan and of course the top honor Maine's cool see out while I with all kinds of the day on the other hand Shabaab which is part of al ... is trying to build its Islamic emirate and of course the U.S is not negotiating with\nThem and so we have two countries going in the same direction under al ... is a mantle and the U.S is negotiating with one part about ... linked but not negotiating with the other part yes yes we can't rule it out in the future ...\nYeah I mean nothing can be ruled out at this point I I doubt Shabaab would ever agree to any\nSort of overt negotiations with the American side um because America doesn't have the substantial foreign right there in in Somalia that it doesn't have guessed\nJustin who keeps the long war journal he's a senior fellow at the foundation for the defense of democracy\nThis segment\nNational security report brought to you by scholars scholars a leading marketing technology company powers millions of digital signs around the world leading the wave of retail transformation visits scholar dot com today to modernize your digital experience I'm John ...\nWhere the upper Cumberland talks news talk Ninety four point one where the upper Cumberland seems taught high schools labor sixty minutes from exercising does sixty minutes of football in high school\nPlaybook Thursday night it's six presented by mountains barn builders it's like being in the locker room of every team in the region without all the mountain learn builders high schools labels were\nBeginning Thursday nights six news Ninety four point one\nWhat do you think when you hear the word\nFurniture misconception in the mountains and because you are now to discover a new world\nErnest you don't sound furniture and cut them step into a world that's\nIt that's ...

Iraq right now it's very very good so John\nI go to you again on this ABC poll about sixty nine battleground districts these are the ones where the Democrats are ambitions to pick up seats against the Republicans because Mrs Clinton did very well in these districts in sixteen though they have a Republican\nCongressional member right now and what is the generic spread John and what does this tell you about this paradox of a good economy and democratic momentum\nI Would make an amendment to your statement the economy is good but Donald Trump is still a drag on Republicans a he has a lot of suburban women having said that the ABC Washington Post poll I ... I mean it's only one poll but it's a solid one\nThe Democrats have a generic lead of almost ten in that poll but on the sixty six swing districts twenty four which went for Hillary Clinton twenty sixteen the Republicans are ahead by one point the Republican\nNo other polls don't quite show that but they show that the swing districts are much closer because Democrats are going to waste a lot of their enthusiastic votes in districts they were going to win anyway\nSo I think in CBS back the CBS background poll also believes that if the election were held with normal turnout today they will be a two hundred making two hundred and Seventeen split not clear which party would have a majority I think we're getting too much closer house\nUm result than people anticipate because the battleground districts are not the country\nThat if you had institutional memory because you wrote through the title wave for the blue in two thousand and six and you also saw what\nA block Obama as a candidate he did in two thousand and eight how do you read how do you interpret this it's one poll I understand that it's a moving story but how do you interpret this\nThis unusual fact that the battleground districts the Republicans do well it\nIs much better now than it was back in those six in a way as Mr funds and tell you and I made it exceedingly difficult for the Republican majority in two thousand six and for Republicans in general in two thousand acres you'd already lost the majority in in the prior election uh my question for Mr fund is you're talking about the house one about\nThat is very interesting because there's poll movement in places you didn't expect\nA there's a new poll out a conducted by a democratic for that shows the Minnesota special election for the Senate to be competitive in clear single digits New Jersey there's a very hard hitting ad out attacking senator Menendez the Democratic incumbent for\nSex with teenage prostitutes quoting FBI reports from the Obama Justice department um I think that the Democrats are now defending more seats than they expected and if I had if the election were held today I think Republicans would gain Senate seats\nAnd gain that clear advantage it can vary more judges including a possible mothers Supreme Court appointment next year\nMission fund the Democrats were doing very well talking about health care health care health care I saw that on ads for the last two weeks and yet these other issues have come up a it's a puzzle to me\nIs is a lack of discipline or is this because in two thousand and six to Democrats in the house had the leadership of Nancy Pelosi and as far as I can tell she's completely disappeared I Can't find\nWhat remember about forty democratic challengers have said they're not going to vote for Nancy Pelosi should they get elected\nSo the last thing that she wants to do is remind voters that um she's there it is trying to become the next democratic speaker even though many members of her party clearly recognized she uses liability on the campaign trail\nThat it made me realize as you well know John that when they get there and they start getting shall we say acclimated to their ... those votes can change can't they\nWell yes but what if you have only two hundred and twenty Democrats or two hundred and Nineteen or two hundred and Twenty one you know Thaddeus it has been since Nineteen fifty two that we had the congressional majority that was less than five seats\nAre from two hundred and Eighteen we've never before in our living memory had an extremely close house where every member counts because the speaker has to be elected with two hundred and Eighteen the majority of the entire house\nI watched only clips from CBS the sixty minutes interview between the president and the correspondent but I was struck by one thing John and I'm puzzled whether this is too late or too little\nThe president is acting very presidential these days he's quite he's quite clear about his accomplishments he's expansive about the policies that they've initiated there is nothing hesitant about him at all is that is that showing in the polls job\n[noise] well actually Leslie stall who conducted the interview said I've interviewed the president or three times as a candidate as president elect and I was president the the change in his level of self confidence and assertiveness is dramatic or she says he's he seems to have grown into the job\nThe country may not be comfortable with him and the job but he's comfortable with it\nI didn't see a president shooting from the hip I saw a man who who was prepared for the issues you know how he makes it a little pyramid out of his fingers you and he's confident that the man I saw in that in that interview\nHe's on this message discipline I think through the election if it stays that will only help his party\nThat is meant just got a compliment Mr phone does the greatest thing I've heard tonight the country may not be comfortable with him he just comfortable and the job [laughter]\nWell what do you do you think that this will translate in the next couple of weeks the the messaging the tight messaging and the president and more parents whose because he's not going to stop campaigning for the rest of the Republicans\n[noise] no but I think that the Democrats submitted enough mistakes he's just going to remind voters over and over again that even though they may have difficulty with him look at the other guys and by the way given you know Elizabeth Warren and given Hillary Clinton and given ...\nIt doesn't look like professional paragon of governing virtue\nOr No Child if if I was struggling with comparable actors on the Republican side I think I'd change the subject my good

circumvent us sanctions according to a number of reports Adele supply crude oil Iran to to Russia to the Caspian and then it would be exported worldwide\nWe've seen reports that I'm Indian vessels were taking on Iranian oil then going to to ... to um Kuwait filling up and then selling it as if it is a it is Kuwaiti oil\nAnd the agreement with the Russians were supposedly reach last month when put president a potent and an Iranian President Rowhani met in Tehran\nAnd the the the other sanctions the other um it is exposure about the efforts by Iran to ah to sanction to to avoid the sanctions and the administration warn the world's banks\nThat they may try to use these duplicitous means to minimize the sanctions in panic they continue to fund terrorism and there's\nSigns that the the flow of oil seems to be according to new data from September that the oil industry is still quite robust and and it means that they are using a subterfuge and and other means like the example of India um\nTo uh to bypass or to cover their uh their exports so sanctions banning transactions with Iran central bank the shipping comes to oil companies are all scheduled to take effect on November fifth\nSo it could be that they're trying to rush to these things these as much as they can export and now but it is certainly indicative of the weakness of the Iranian economy we know the teachers went on strike today we know that the price of milk has has gone up sharply and other goods that can of tomato paste\nSold for sixty thousand ... in March is now a hundred and eighty thousand ... and the ... the currency as a has fallen so dramatically I think it's a hundred and forty six thousand to the dollar now\nAnd the projection is that the Iranian economy will shrink by one point five percent or this year and maybe almost four percent and twenty Nineteen\nSo Iran is under a lot of pressure that the sanctions will work the new sanctions could be very significant and the U.S has to find ways to close these loopholes\nThat in America you guys are recent report soon the Gazans believe in the ... the bigger problem than ...\n... ... exactly right and I think Palestinians over all\nA blamed the PA by a bigger percentage than than the blame the um ah the ... for for\nWhat is happening in it and and it's reflected his lack of confidence\nAnd it shows that in the election or change is not going to bring about any uh any dramatic or a difference so we were seeing the uh the the numbers that that came out that are more than almost fifty percent almost half\nA do not trust the PA they don't trust come us necessarily but they certainly don't trust the Palestinian authority and this is a you know a very significant figure when you're looking at what are the prospects\nFor a changing things in in the M M and the guy in gossip for instance because if forty three percent of Palestinian state of ... responsible for the bad situation and only a quarter blamed a Hamas\nAnd that and that's why they don't want to demonstrate against Hamas 'cause they don't like the alternative and they don't want the ... to take over and and especially don't like it measures against its own citizens\nA tremendous number of arrests by the Palestinian authority figures against those who oppose it in the west bank so they they seem to accept Hamas control of gossip\nIn Europe outcome I have learned because you've taught me\nThe Europeans have a profoundly different understanding of anti Semitism than we do here in the United states I don't know where it started but I Do know it's here today\nAnd Israel has always struggled against that anti Semitic tone in all of the major France Germany Great Britain\nOr Italy we struggled with it bought you indicate there is there a change is there an enlightenment in Europe are they pulling back from their exploitation of ah the the tragedy of the twentieth century\nUh it's it's a good question but I I think it goes too far to think that the that they pulled back what we're seeing according to this latest survey that the Israeli foreign minister did in in major European countries\nShow a clear rise in support and this is the first time in memory for me that um there's been a turnaround in\nIn Germany in Spain and Portugal in Romania where more maybe the support for Israel grew to fifty six percent in Portugal uh it went to the forty eight percent and and uh versus thirty percent were not supportive in\nSpain it was forty percent in Britain it went up the eight points to forty percent\nAnd this you know in the corporate area era and everything else and with all the negative media and and measures that were adopted into campaigns in Europe against Israel to see this turnaround I think it's it's really remarkable and I will tell you some it is not something I Would have anticipated\nOr the fact that in all these major ... countries in Europe or sympathy for Israel is increasing maybe it's a greater understanding of the um of Israel's unique position maybe it's because today the middle east includes or did they see what's going on in Syria they see what's going on in these other countries that have come\nTo realize that you have one source of stability and um you will have to see whether this is borne out over time but it's certainly a surprising about\nWe have a minute Thaddeus go ahead you know let's remember that the people of Europe are different than the elite that would deem to govern more correct\nThat is true in the countries like Britain and forget where it starts top down France tendency is to be bottom up but I think you're quite right that that that is a distinction and and still the numbers are not as positive as they should be\nAnd we see the campaigns continuing but this split the left right split that is exacerbating things may are also tend to benefit the understanding of Israel\nJeremy Corbyn not withstanding correct Malcolm that would be a tragedy\nVery

there are I suppose in the ... part of the students good evening\nGood evening Jim thanks for having me on absolutely\nUm I I Know that that even as many people out there received their health care from their employers I think it would be safe to say that as a general rule employers everywhere are looking for anyway every way they can find\nTo get out from underneath what they deem to be a burden and in some cases frankly a that is unethical at best and I suspect illegal\nAt worst but employers just don't like paying healthcare costs [noise]\nBut you're absolutely right and I'll tell you they don't like it for a couple of different reasons one it's it's one of the hardest things to budget for on a piano now because you have zero control over what the insurance companies is going to do\nA and then secondarily as a result of the Affordable CARE Act many employers are having to provide certain levels of benefits that certain rights and and could only ... you know\nCoach share the charges up to a certain level [noise] and so while the this is the challenge I Will tell you that\nEmployers have found themselves in this predicament oftentimes as a result of how they've approached healthcare over the last ten to Fifteen Years\nWe don't think of health care from an employer basis like we think about everything else on the ... and I run a business I have a number of employees and and what I think about health insurance oftentimes it's easy to think about that as a transaction [noise]\nThe reality is is that our health insurance premiums are derivative of the health care claims that we generate and health insurance is just become healthcare financing that's really all it is and so as a health care costs continue to go up\nFor some reason employers in the United states don't think about health insurance like they think about everything else on the piano and the economic principle applies here just as it does to everything else the costs that I pay today is equal to the number of units that I consume multiply by the price in which I consume them\nAnd so if an employer wants to do something to drive down costs they've got to start focusing more on the unit that their employees are consuming the units of health care\nAnd the price in which they're consuming those things and if they don't want to do that if they want to make this just a once a year decision that they fret over and really dislike making and then ultimately just pass the burden on two employees\nFor him is dot com slash they\nSee what's like ripple details mental services to

aren't run by doctors any longer run by Wall Street run by businessmen\nAnd and and the challenges that we have here is that we continue to see consolidation used to use it you would have an insurance

and a\nOne eight six six five oh jumbo is our number\nDr Gorka you take note of the idea that there are two spectrums any allergy objective truth and subjective truth I Would contend that while that indeed maybe put forward out there in this world of ours that subject the truth is an oxymoron your thoughts\nYes absolutely totally I I think it was incredibly telling I don't know if you call this in the cabin or hearing the Democrat Senate the starting with Cory Booker a used the phrase\nThe truth when talking about the test Monday from Dr fold\nThat is so telling her truth\nThere's no such thing as her truth either the truth or there isn't true so yes this is\nThis is what you get this post modern is on this is the the the construction of the left and the twentieth century whereby there is a denial of objective truth so yes the politics going to be divided into two groups those who believe there is one truth\nAnd those that believe everything is relative the those that believe that everything is relative um they they create the atrocities of the twentieth and twenty first century\n[noise] what what if I put forward a subjective truth\nThat says that ah every single member of the Democratic party is actually a communist and they were out to destroy the United states I mean I don't have to subscribe to that view although I Would ah concede that in many cases they are certainly pushing policies in that direction\nBut when I just said I wouldn't subscribe do but how would a believer in subjective truth telling me that my objective truth\nWas wrong but there is this right\nWell we are the best they they'd have to fall into their own trap there'd be no way if they if you believe in the concept of subjective truth for multiple truth there'd be no way for them categorically to deny your accusations so this is\nThis is the ... the two of the whole situation so yes it's it's a very powerful weapon\nThat you can use against the the liberals that spouting it every day\nYou identify Islam as an extremely radical religion certainly as it is practiced in much of the world today that's obviously the case now uh what about those who identify as long as a a radical political ideology or in Islam is there really a distinction\nIt depends I mean the the the theories as the theology and then there's the practice so that the question is what what is the practice or if if it's a Muslim who's living in America\nAre and and uh behaving in accordance with the U.S constitution then there's the problem if it's a country as such as Bangladesh show or elsewhere\n... becomes the legal system where ... law actually becomes the ... of the land with such as Afghanistan than we have a problem because then the the truth is that we hold to be self evident the quality of the quality of the sexes\nThese things fall by the wayside so you know blanket statements or a dangerous in this case because\nWe have Muslim allies Jordan is one of our closest as allies that he's a Muslim state but we have to\nCountry and who we are actually talk about\nOne thing that has bothered me a great deal about where this country finds itself today with the people on the left are pushing harder and harder or to outright a call for socialism I suppose in a way it's an improvement\nThat uh you have people on the left who uh or at least are saying openly what I always suspected they were thinking over the years and that is the socialism is the path to go I Do think that they've overstretched overreached I should say in that regard or is that the term socialism no longer a four letter word in this country\n[noise] yeah it's a very good question I'm disturbed that in the upcoming midterms\nFor the ... the Democrat Party candidates have\nOpenly labeled themselves a socialist\nA in a recent poll by the victims of communism foundation more than forty two percent of American millennials said that they would like to live in a socialist or communist America\nThis is incredibly disturbing if you look at the fact that in the last hundred years more than a hundred million people were killed and then they was socialism communism so\nYeah I think the Democratic party overall the radicals who have taken over the Democrat Party\nHave managed to socialize this would make it more acceptable than it ever was before\nAnd as we go to a call here I just have to have this it seems to me that what we are getting is nothing more than we should have expected we have for about two generations\nAdvocated control of the education of our young people to people especially if the collegiate faculty level in many cases have an absolute axe to grind and very anti American ideology who are are less and less likely to try to even hide that fact now\nAt a private school it's probably difficult to do a lot about that but in many cases we're talking about faculty who are paid out of state tax dollars and why the chancellor and presidents of these universities have not been called before the education committees of every state legislature in America\nAnd demanded to know why such and such and such and such is inspired if they want to see another penny of state tax dollars is beyond me\n... I I couldn't agree more are we abdicated the schools the high schools and colleges starting in the Nineteen seventies and that's where we are today so if you want to understand how somebody as a as\nA as dangerous as Bernie Saunders becomes popular in America it's because we allow the education system to be taken over by the radicals\nTo David in Cedar Rapids Iowa the boy had a job with Dr Sebastian Gorka hello David\nHell of a chance as a gay guy said mentioned earlier that there is a subject of truth in that ... or\n... that is it is claimed that there is such that as such we both repudiated the idea but go ahead well\nThat still test in opinion no matter how you know no matter how logical or no matter how uh how much feeling it put in to it but just followed by LA difference between the two is failing and logic\nBut then you know they generate a cell that is that that might be a big difference\n[noise] that and it's just oh shit show you know the getting rid of yellow subjective Jackson chairman and CEO and schooling and the first place\nIt ...

what would you killed is a good show guy I mean why what is it about him\nHe's been on a on the staff of the Saudi royal family for many many many years until recently became a critic of the prince a job to do the primary bill and is the is the branch of the gun\nUh and he's cracking down on all kinds of things regarding a rules in Saudi Arabia are so you've got 'em all these reforms going on then you got this guy and then you've got other leaders around the world that killed their citizens\nAnd nobody seems to blink about it\nThe other story that Wall Street journal is talking about is that um the\nPrince believes the show was a supporter of the Muslim Brotherhood and that to show he was a sympathetic to Islamic organizations that he was on the payroll of tar wages as Saudi nemesis\nI'm so these are all excuses uh but\n\nAnd then you got turkey who would love to see our relationship with Saudi Arabia go into the\nTank\nAnd they are they have a bad enough relationship with is turkey does then they're watching the relationship between the U.S and the Saudis growing\nAnd the one that\nPhone number is eight five five to nine five sixty six hundred Jerry in Milwaukee hello Jerry\nSaid I'm I'm In all likelihood Saudi Arabia murder this guy's Saudi Arabia has atrocious human rights record that hard to believe it was\nHer ... and ... and turkey doesn't\nThe turkey is bad too in Turkey it's it's just almost just as bad but this guy went into the cuts that ever came out I Would like to hear the recording but Saudi Arabia I mean you take to order to Saudi Arabia I mean\nI Hope Donald Trump is really saying he's really going to do something because it took a word won dictator and Russia to take the word is Saudi Arabia Saudi Arabia it's even worse human rights record\nWealth or I mean you're going to take the take the ... that's the problem who do you take the word of turkey who says yo yes we have we have audio video but we're not gonna give it to you and how did they get the guy ...\n... well well ... obviously mentioned spy on each other or are they a video to the outside the consulates that's a common practice I mean you might say it's not legal or not but\nHappens and we do that to some extent of other countries who are out history absolutely\nYep right so I I just look at it and I go we got we got two bad\nGuys that are pointing the finger at each other with all kinds of motivations for was to blame the other guy\nI don't know what I don't know what to believe now here's what's interesting is that\nThe pressure but I'm the economic pressure we start talking about we're going to have severe part of the president said severe three times over the weekend a which caused a lot of people off guard in fact even um\nLet me play this for you this is I'm\nSo Adam Kinzinger was talking first but um where's the one I don't think it's cut for teen Andy is congressman Jim Heinz Democrat from Connecticut ... says we need to be the world leader unethical behavior\nI wouldn't use different words and the president you is this is not a really punishing somebody were not an international court were not some kind of global parents what we are or at least this fire to be to be out front and leading on basic values and ethics a line or you don't kill journalist anywhere much less than a foreign country\nSo I Would hope that we would sort of frame that says we are standing up against the behavior that we saw potent and\nThere are a dissident there and what we may have been saying in Istanbul so we are going to need to get to the bottom of this I suspect our intelligence community has a pretty good sense for what really happens and then the sanctions should be severe\nYeah I think so too I think they'll get to the bottom of this I don't know the ... vote for that Jerry I think our people will will find out\nIf we can cook up to the end result though that Saudi Arabia is responsible for the murder of the shirtless I Hope we do more than just to slip but the rest because she went away and freedom of the costs are fundamental lights and it is true we\nHaven't had a presence over the last two years just heard much about that issue\nIt sounds like you're talking job even what congressman Heinz there was I actually think the president\nIs going to be the target of a town for a movie star Ninety four point was\nAnd so now we're at the stage where there are no really very good option um the White House is in a bind on this and it's because they went down this cul de sac to begin with without a proper line of communication someone lend the Saudi Arabian government to believe that they could get away with this that this wouldn't be a problem and that's why it's a mess now\nAnd that's what they probably are not only Saudi Arabia but many leaders around the world think there is no problem in killing somebody who that is it isn't it in their country\nNo problem\nPhone number is eight by five to nine five sixty six hundred Scott thanks

fellow\nSo this guy goes in the embassy\nIt makes absolutely no sense at all set up and if you want to look it will cause the problem look at the benefits of benefits that we don't do the arms deal\nWho benefits we don't do the oil with Saudi Arabia that's who did it\nWell we we all have seen the video of him going in ... ever whoever gave is that video also control the copy of that video and do they have a video of him coming out that they just won't show anybody\nI mean it's\nYou know they say they say they have a video and recordings inside but we heard or seen those do\nI Know and

actually been working for the Saudi Government for a long long time\n\nThat I don't know yeah I don't think it makes absolutely no sense to me I see you know I see is a set up I mean I just see a set up and I dare you you need to look at it or who benefits from the loss of a defense contract or maybe we\nDon't get oil from Saudi Arabia anymore who knows what will happen and I just it makes sense

out where the butler did not do it\nI'm\nI don't have a clue but my my my guess is along the lines of who is it that has to benefit from from this it could have been a screw up on the part of this

could buy wet suits you could buy spear guns you could buy boats it always it was always kind of funny to me because that was way different Sears then I remember back when I was a kid\nWas not the same but but yeah but that's the problem is that they I think they did\nThe opposite of Wal Mart Walmart went out into smaller towns across America Sears yes went to the big cities\nAnd set up these expensive overheads in shopping malls and Walmart does cleaned them with the lower price that so that's I mean it was cheaper so what are you going to do if you're going you're going to buy more expensive\nI don't think so so it's um\nYeah those it was that this is it is but I don't think that I I don't think that day is\nComing back I really don't I think we have\nWe have changed our culture

lamp part\nLand parts got by k-mart and then all of a sudden he was selling Sears thought of buying or selling stars the Sears and then all of a sudden next we heard he was buying fairs and we didn't know it was going on and then\nOur k-mart close three years ago and so we all lost their jobs after thirty some years working there and we always thought\nA lot as well and they he was selling like craftsman out on the other stores\nYeah and we always thought why why take the craftsman out when everybody to come for how many and Ken lawyer and he started it I Can't believe they went into a hardware and stuff and then it didn't bring people insist fears\nLike it used to like the gentleman said before we get our tools is to get our Ken Lay so we all lost their jobs and\nBecause he came in and then all of a sudden he took over Kmart after went bankrupt Conway hat it after the other two months or even in the bankruptcy before like Kmart yep and alone we thought to Walmart came in and k-mart\nStores are really old\nIt stars close by k-mart and so they just paid more attention all Kmart had bought other businesses that site fears and forgot to um you know pay attention to what made him successful effort\nWell I think your point is right if you if you have a product or brand a craftsman brand diehard batteries ah ten more appliances\nAnd you can get them anywhere the reason you went to Sears was to get them now you can get them to read\nBecause after thirty three years we lost our Sears closed yeah we have no Kmart ... law\nThat thing\nAnd I I I came I saw a warehouse says

a doctorate you should lead off with your education however if you had been in the workforce for a while and have had a couple of different types of employment or employers you should list your education towards\nThe bottom it's not forgotten but it has less emphasis\nOn education is clearly important especially as to where you included but that also begs the question if you're putting your education to talk and changing where your work might be ... what about your prior work what would you include in ... previous employment how much\nWell if you're going with a functional or hybrid resume you want to list the employer the city state the employment dates and your job title there's no reason to list anything more if you're going with a chronological traditional resume\nThen you may want to include a job description underneath that\nWhere you could have quantifiable a bullet points underneath the job description\nI've been working for about twenty some years have had several

the job for that matter\nSo volunteer work is very important it's also a great way to get references if you don't have very many references you're a recent graduate\nVolunteer work is a great way to

politics and policy and he knows that the amount of emotion out there he's looking at the big picture he's written a new book called them why we hate each other and how to heal\nSenator welcome thanks and good but I also like the ... you also um you're the book did extremely well too because you thought about the big picture you thought about culture or each other\nI think it's because we don't have the natural tribes that were used to as the place that you find happiness we have a collapsing nuclear family structure we have fewer deep friends than we've ever had and statistics on this stuff we have declining local worshipping communities and we have shorter duration job so political trouble\nIt was but it doesn't matter all that much if not the center of life but politics is trying to fill a void as people's neighborhoods that are collapsing and we should be attending to the first things first which is not politics\nSo if I'm In for a bomb in the house of watching uh watching on my Apple TV and then I pick up my iPhone um taxing a bunch of people and interacting with people that don't exist yet that I don't see you said that the stats one from\nAverage amount of Americans with friends have three friends three points something out it's down to like one point something now if you have is it because of technology it's a huge\nPart of it so I thank you for reading the book by the way we have half as many friends in America today as we did twenty five years ago the average American at three and a half friends in Nineteen Ninety today one point eight as you say\nAnd so the smartphone has great lots of wonderful economic things come from her smartphone but make sure you turn the dang thing off tonight and have dinner with your kids because it turns out that matter so much more than your smart phone if you go from two hundred five hundred and social media friends you're not happier statistically if you know the neighbor two doors down you're happier\nBut you're just saying these right now with America's for the most part a lonely\nVery lonely you talked to researchers at the national institutes of health they think that loneliness as the number one public health crisis in America it drives most of obesity for instance being lonely for a day is the equivalent of smoking Fifteen cigarettes I Want people to read them because I Want them to be healthier and not just physically but in their neighborhood\nBut we can't do a you know it's very frustrating to hear well the nuclear family has gone away and we hear a lot of the minority communities that is part of the way I Do about that makes me want to throw in my hands and say what am I supposed to do about everybody else making decisions not to have nuclear family yes so\nThe first thing you should do is invite people over in your neighborhood you got lots of listeners who are blessed to have a stable nuclear family there are a bunch of kids who don't know their dad two blocks from you invite 'em over for dinner hosted a coach little league and joined the Rotary Club joined co want us all that stuff is more important than who you're angry at in politics again politics matters\nBut it's way downstream from the stuff that really matters which is probably within five minutes of your house so\nThat's very interesting thing we could all do but here you are a knee deep in Washington the big policies the emotion lose Lindsey Graham says that was being spit on two weeks ago being spit on by people I've never met before Senator Jeff flake is being accosted in elevators by a woman he's ever seen before so how does someone look at that\nAnd think ... book really spells out how this happened\nYes so I've had those experiences to we I mean I think everybody like life gets death threats now I\nMy kids I have three kids aging from a ranging from age seven to Seventeen we host water stations that local marathons and people come up and and screamed that when the water when I hand it to a twenty year old woman running by and the marathon they'll scream don't drink get it's poised and he wants to kill you\nThey think they're doing that because we differ about legislative issues there's something much deeper wrong in their life if they're willing to scream that I'm trying to poison somebody when I'm volunteering at a water station\nThe only way you can make that stuff's better is in the neighborhood where you live that can't be made better by legislation in Washington you can't pass a bill that mandates people become friends but your listeners need to become better at being friends in a world where the smartphone is telling us we don't have to live where we are so if\nYou have an example of Washington and working across the aisle or with a buddy let's say ... it was more likeable and he felt like you could work with him I'm so Jeff Flake said this on sixty minutes and it I think it applies here\nSenator Flake you've announced which are not running for reelection and I wonder could you have done this\nIf you were running out of ... and not a chance\nBecause politics has become too sharp to ... there's no value to reaching across the aisle there's no currency for that anymore there's no incentive\nWell that's the problem that's the identity but is that the reason you shouldn't I mean if if the bench that saw somebody of like minded could cut a deal with on the other side are you concerned about you a political future if you do\nWe didn't parents can get involved in that just like the China till you who you can hang out with when you're younger they could

weakness to say I don't know what somebody else's ideas come out and not be yours that could show vulnerability where does humidity and vulnerability commit\nSome way some for some reason in today's world it seems vulnerable to admit weaknesses in the earlier days certainly for Abraham Lincoln money runs for office the first time it's a wonderful statement he makes every man has it's peculiar ambition managed to be a steamed up by my fellow man\nBut I'm not sure you'll understand me and I'm not sure if you vote for me\nAnd if I Do lose I won't be too chagrin make us I'm familiar with disappointment but then he says but I'm going to try five or six times until I'm too humiliated and then I won't try again I promise\nBut he said in that opening statement if I don't know something I'm going to learn it if I say something wrong I'm going to correct it right from the start he comes out of the gate with those qualities of resilience humility and empathy and they stay with them the rest of his life\nWill tell me if this was a leap did you could take run sure notice book on grand talks about how grant ruin the slaves after the emancipation was\nFreedom and when they were running to grant grants idea to say let's give these guys some uniforms and let them fight and he sees how the fault they got together and the galvanizing came into a unit and that's when we can start getting an idea of how what the world with this country is going to look like when this war is over\nThem I think that's right once the black soldiers became part of the union army as they did when he finally open the door to the black soldiers they fought magnificently and even the generals who'd been against the idea of bringing them into the army began to see that they're helping the cause and they're doing an amazing job\nBut Lincoln was reluctant at first to do it I mean he waited and waited until Nineteen sixty three\nBecause he feared that the whites in the army weren't ready for any fit the north even the north wasn't ready timing is everything he said so we watch the changing sentiment he watched what was beginning to happen and that's another quality of a leader you can't do what you may want to do unless the timing us write the timing was perfect for the Emancipation Proclamation and for allowing blacks in the army\nEven though it was driving Frederick Douglass nuts that he was waiting so long right exactly\nBut Frederick Douglass said once Lincoln takes a stand on something he'll never go back he maybe slow getting there but it's true I mean it when he issued the Emancipation Proclamation there was a lot of blow back in the north north and less ... legislatures passed\nRules saying or a statements saying we're not for this and we didn't fight for this where just for the union and some of them were threatening to secede from New England and yet Lincoln knew that the timing would be okay that they would come around and they finally did and then Douglas finally accepted yes you are right on timing\nWell Doris Kearns Goodwin here so if there was a natural leader even though we started off grew up sickly and he was somebody had to be home schooled it had to be Teddy Roosevelt it seems he built up his body because we couldn't early she did lady became physical way because he couldn't early right\nNow you know what's so interesting about that is that he made himself a strong person and that became an example are for the rest of his life he said one time there are two\nKinds of success in the world some is when somebody has a talent that nobody else can develop no matter how hard they try like Keats for a poem or Lincoln at Gettysburg but most people have said like himself\nHave ordinary talents that they developed to an extraordinary degree too hard to sustain before he was he wasn't a good eyesight person but he was a great bird or he wasn't that good of a shot but it became a world class hunter\nUm he wasn't a good boxer but he somehow lost an eye on point but he became a good boxer everything came to hardworking made himself who he was boxing in the basement well I mean by all the White House ... wrestling matches boxing the his favorite thing was taking people on these hikes in wooded areas of Rock Creek park\nWhere he made a rule that you couldn't go around any obstacle you had to go up Iraq if you've got to go down people were falling by the wayside if they're trying to find them in the woods two hours he would exercise every day it's one of the things I think about my leaders which is\nThat they able to figure out how to find time to think and relax and replenish the energy as we think we don't have time in our twenty four seven world they had pretty important things to do the civil war World War two\nAnd they just they surely did write a doors or when you talk about to Roosevelt he took on the monopoly she felt like the they're too much power they did maybe perhaps he would control too much of the economy and if you want to take on the ah the big guys the boys\nMaybe it helps that you were a hundred and ten pounds suffering from asthma your whole youth and maybe were picked on yourself and maybe you don't lose that ability to try to avenge it\nYou know that's really interesting I'm not sure I fully thought about that but I think you're right I mean he was bullied as a child\nAnd he felt that some of the big companies were bowling smaller companies and getting them out of business and he was going to defend the people who needed to help the people who were in the independent companies and and wanted to have their own life and their own sense of accomplishment and they were being taken by the big hand of these monopoly is I think you're right and thought about that well I Want\nTo

will focus on was Abu Saudi Arabia and of course the midterms everyone's leaving some judges were confirmed just so they can get out of there but Katherine Glenn Simpson arrived I understand on Capitol Hill\nGoing Simpson president the head of fusion GPS is there any doubt in your mind he's going to show up and take the fifth\nWell he already indicated through his attorneys are that he was going to take that to questions about the dossier ... he got it to the FBI in the spring and fall at twenty sixteen and then after the election using a Justice Department official\nAnd what role it played in securing the surveillance warrants for Trump campaign aide Carter Page and since then had hoped to avoid\nToday's testimony on the basis that he would take effect but the committee insisted on having him appear under subpoena and he's now going through that very laborious process that going question by question\nThen taking other steps so they have\nAn under oath pay\nThat's where these questions so where is the contradiction from his original testimony who's ramping up\nOkay so Bruce or is adjust department official and he was used by Simpson and former British spy Christopher Steele as a back channel to get the dossier to the FBI after the election November twenty sixteen and you can see and Bruce\nOr emails and know that there was contact with Clinton Simpson\nAs early as August twenty sixteen by Glenn Simpson told another house panel that he didn't get involved with or until well after the election so that's\nA big disconnect but Glenn Simpsons problems are much deeper than just the disconnect with Bruce or what we've been able to see in our reporting is that more than a half dozen sources connected to fusion GPS or the law firm that was working on behalf of the DNC\nAnd Clinton campaign and others for shopping the ... the FBI almost creating what critics call an echo chamber so every time it came to the FBI\nTo another source it would lend more credibility credibility pardon me to what was opposition research breast\nWow um and of course a James ... basically should didn't really think the dog if you play much of a role\nModel it ... that may be his position but at least when you look at the surveillance applications that have been declassified\nYou can see that the dossier was one of the top line item in the application and that it was not the only item but it was certainly a significant item that was used to secure the original surveillance warrants in October of\nTwenty sixteen and on the way into the session today\nI shouted a series of questions to Glenn Simpson including why was he taking the fifth but also more specifically whether any parts of the da da da da di and he did not answer that question\nNor the final question which was as someone who has worked in a ... as a journalist and the past how was refusing our question today really consistent with his own experience\nNo but it doesn't budge on this but I guess he's hoping the Democrats get the house ... stops right\n[noise] well this is I'm certainly the view of Republicans they've said very vocally that they think the goal has been to run out the clock with the hope that the Democrats take control and that's the end of the um investigation\nOr the other issue that's really up against the clock is whether the same committee will issue a\nSubpoena for the deputy attorney general Rod Rosenstein\nTo secure his testimony over these allegations he discussed recording the president or removing him from office in twenty Seventeen that's being Rosenstein denies but even even more importantly what he knew about the dossier and other intelligence\nWhen he signed off on one of the surveillance weren't renewal a in October\nTwenty Seventeen so it's not just\nUm what he said about the president but it's also his role or in the surveillance of a Trump campaign member\nOr a couple of things now understand that any material is being looked at a because he might of or he might have leaked information out about Michael Flynn's not telling us not telling the truth about whether we talked to ... where's this story going [noise]\nWell new records or have been released and what's been happening in the background is there's\nBeen an inspector general's investigation that's been ongoing at the Justice Department we had the review\nAbout the Clinton emails earlier this year but the inspector General Michael Horowitz told reporters at that time that he was also looking I'm at political bias in Texas\nWe're a regularity and securing the surveillance warrants\nDuring the presidential campaign and then all the specifically the leaking of classified information and based on the record that were made public even then you could see that there were multiple strands to the ... going to a very senior people within the FBI so McCain\nReally has a lot of legal jeopardy right now it appears with the leak investigation but she's also a in front of the grand jury here in Washington DC for lying to federal investigators about a week the wall Street Journal\nThat dealt with the Clinton Clinton Foundation\nBut yet he's still releasing all books I don't know if that's going to help his cause or not\nBut that that's been a delayed review by by the FBI um but what I Would say not as offensive McKay but a contacts on one of the takeaways I have from the last six\nMonths or looking at this issue is\nThat he was not the only one who may have been using leaks for Strategic reasons I mean director ... testified publicly\nUp and he specifically to mellow out\nShe the Columbia University professor to kick start a special counsel on the Russia probe and what we know from our reporting is that it leads to wind up as men to contain classified information so the question is whether director calling me will be found guilty of mishandling classified information\nAnd by the way we should struck in la Lisa page in Peter Struck also going back and forth about how they put stories into the press and celebrating it ...\nIt's going I think it does I think Brian is just going to be one of the big reveal a when the inspector general is finished which is the extent to which\nUm and I emphasize a senior leadership within the FBI and not not the rank and file by executives within the FBI during the political campaigns used makes to try and former crap the gotcha question\nGod's inherited you the best how you keep it straight or I can never know back in the moments\nNews talk Ninety four point one way or the early riser so hardworking neighbors planting the seeds raising the crops getting ready for\nI got one eight six six eight seven six six now and we're talking about three things really oh we're talking about what Katherine Harris just leapt off where Glenn Simpson is now behind closed doors taking the theft on every question answered by this uh by this Republican committee\nKeep in mind this investigation stops if they lose the house and if you're smart\nYou do these two things we talked to John McLaughlin was opposed over Donald Trump and by far the best thing Republicans could run on his something they're not and that is what will happen when Nancy Pelosi is your speaker her approval rating for this country thirty percent\nIt was less than that when she was actually speaker run through what she did last time how we'd affective she was in polarizing she remains\nAnd then you say what is not going to get done if she's there one of which is to find out what the FBI was doing it is higher levels to stop the president being from winning election and then once he got the election\nAnd now we find out what McCain gun combing gun a Baker gun struck gun page gun who's left Bruce or suspended or excuse me demoted\nYou're getting closer and closer to the answer\nAnd what I Will be running ads on what's been revealed already and what stops in its tracks and who's going to stop\nSome rogue agents next time and the FBI if they have a political agenda and they want to stop your Kennedy and I'm telling you I Would be justice teed off it but I found out that after Hillary Clinton won the election they're working behind the scenes to set her up for some type of scandal\nThat's what they do and President Trump there's got to ... with Russian next thing we got a special pro we're starting to understand how the heck we ended up with Robert Mueller we still do not know\nSo that all stops quarter page is one that they fired got ... or I kept getting a renewed and they were following him because he thought he was a Russian agent even though he had worked with the FBI because he had taught in ... spoke in Russia and he had some contacts there\nBut Carter Page is suing keep them on they had a ... or quarter page keep in mind they kept renewing and they have no charges\nIn a probe that puts an ankle bracelet on Rick Gates\nPuts a puts a Paul Manafort in jail\nA ruins the career of Michael Flynn puts fat but apple is in jail for a day but destroyed decided last year and a half\nThis just off the top of my head and I told the Russians were never going to show up until their indictment quarter page was followed surveilled by the highest ranking people and they got nothing ... thirty five\nKnow it goes beyond any damage as earning you know financial aspects\nI mean there is just been so many lives as you're alluding to and\nYou look at the damage to our democratic systems and you know our institutions of government back in twenty sixteen I'm just trying to get some justice in terms of getting some disclose or if you look at some of the prior dodging dot CA cases like Mr who bar as\nHe's the one that actually got some of the biggest uh information out there that you know senator Sherry\nThey think a lot a lot of things on Internet ...\n[noise] so keep in mind to ah George Papadopoulos on Twitter finds out this whole thing started when ... decides he's going to come out and blast\nA blast prime minister Cameron for blasting Donald Trump so Papadopoulos says is on the foreign policy committee for the Trump and he's twenty eight years old and he decides because he's got some power he's going to blast back a camera in combat but Donald Trump they don't like that and Britain say started looking into it\nAnd it seems as though perhaps you could put these two and two together they set him up\nAnd they give them some information from professor ... who is meeting with that professor ... we thought it was a multiple are best served teach at a London University now defunct and then at that time he says you know they're still recount an email thing is getting big the Russians got a whole bunch emails already to drop it\nNow Papadopoulos get this information and the ... down or of Australia because to them they start talking to have a few drinks\nAnd he says what are you know about this Hillary Clinton email because I hear there's going to be big things coming out of Russia now down or keep that information says you told them Papadopoulos who told Papadopoulos missed it now I miss it why would he carries a multiple pets are teaching in London both turned out not really\nTurns out mixed it is that a Russian agent doesn't that Russian contacts he works for Britain so if you kids Papadopoulos information and then set somebody up to ask him for that information it looked as though he's leading intelligence with Russia right\nCombining to find out that Russia's got Hillary's emails and they're about to drop down to earth there's given millions of dollars to the Clinton Foundation missed it works for Britain who is being an ally against Donald Trump we know that government is which is now the pose and Theresa May probably hates them just as much but that's a side for them\nSo they asked peppered apple is do you ever give up information about Russia to uh to another agent says no to go got you know why\nBecause ... down and says you did in retrospect he said yeah I made a mistake you got one day in jail now he's realizing how he was set up he's going to be coming in and I hope to drag 'em up the radio on the twenty six after he testifies and he's going to expose what's been exposed to him so far but if you look at all these things that took place and all the people that are around\nYou wonder why the mullah ... was even among other pro and now it's gotten totally out of control and how the Australian so work with the Brits to set up Americans who actually work for Donald Trump why the president and got word for Britain not doing bell the ways that the information that led to this investigation\nThey said it would have jeopardize your relationship with

I've got to surrender\nAnd so he surrenders and Washington is very insistent that the terms of this treaty be in our favor because when at the battle Saratoga under her ratio gates it was just the opposite a Washington was a very tough negotiator\nAre finally it's it's the the the ceremony to surrender but Cornwall is doesn't show up ah he he pleads illness and and uh ... voids the public humiliation\nOf having to turn soared over Washington Senate Philbrick are ah he's our guest right now so if you have the headquarters in New York\nAnd that to a general Clinton has Cornwall surrender anything but the south in the south how does the transfer right well it's interesting you know you think Yorktown the war's over\nActually it would be two years before the British finally evacuated from New York this was one part of the army a very significant part seven thousand soldiers there about ten thousand up in New York and so this meant there was still a significant army in America and Washington worried even though we won this thing the British are going to come back\nAnd uh there was a naval victory they won in the Caribbean all this stuff but finally the British Parliament realizes that people no longer want war no matter what we just have to get out of it to us in a lot of money to cost them a huge amount of money and uh you know it costs the French just as much\nAnd you could argue and many have that the French Revolution in less than a decade was a result of the fact that the French were bankrupted by their supporters of America and the revolution and about five thousand in New York you said in particular\nUh the the French no no the other issue the British had a over ten thousand pretend to have so that the Washington wanted to attack New York before he wanted to check tax the Chesapeake\nBut the French felt it was much easier to sail into the Chesapeake and they were right and they were right hey you know and they shifted Washington shifted gears I mean this is the thing about Washington he would\nWhen he realized you know they're not going to do it my way okay shift gears what can we do to make this happen\nAnd he and he did it in a very decisive and brilliant way because he made his preference for New York\nMake the British in New York think that that's where he was going to attack until the very last second when they realized whoa\nA Washington erosion bows army or on their way to Philadelphia and ultimately Cornwall is in the chest and they ended up just two years later just leaving on their own cars right it was the evacuation of New York ah in in November of Seventeen eighty three and\nFact if nothing else in Washington rides in um as a a you know as a ride thin it's it's it's now um you know we have one this and it's it's one of the major moments in American\nHistory yeah we ah went down to front is tavern ya where he had his final drink or the report is a with his soldiers year he was to overcome with emotion\nI couldn't really speak but he says come up and touch me and basically she would take to shake my headache meant yeah and they did and they watched as he walked out to a bar that was waiting\nAnd took him down stream and then you look out and you go to Francis ... only to do is make a turn you could see with a barge would be Oh absolutely I mean it's not as if it's been covered up by buildings you can see the path that Washington\nTalk now it's amazing when you go down to that Wall Street section of New York you know the it's a village or ... when you look at the historical buildings and it was all very intimate\nAnd when Washington left and he was on his way to Annapolis where the continental Congress was to surrender his commission from ... done you guys can have it up a country may be alone you know and King George when he heard that this was Washington's plan to retire to Mount Vernon\nHe said if he does that he will be the greatest man in the world because you know ... it was inconceivable to surrender power I mean you know so many dictators had had refused to do that in the past and the polling in the future but that's what Washington did\nAnd he made it possible for republic to then spring up from this this great victory right but at first it will be no president\nNo there was no president if there was a dysfunctional Congress or without an executive and it would take you know almost five years before the continental Congress would uh with the the constitutional convention would begin to create the system that we have\nToday I understand you can use to grant sure okay yeah we're going to have a few more questions because\nThe other thing that's happening now since last time we left more than ever since the attack on history and our past\nAnd

K. I. P. L. A. G. G. E. D. dot com\nTells you how to beat the system that the airline hubs just for reference for the ... prior mentioned United\nFor flights to Chicago Houston Newark many times the fares are crazy high\nAnd so people were you skip flag\nTo beat those high fares delta Atlanta Minneapolis in Detroit ... ah American Airlines Charlotte Philadelphia Dallas and so these airlines build these fortresses\nBut United is really upset about people not paying the fortress hub price when they're going to the fortress hub\nDoing a hidden city or what skip flag calls skip flag that I don't know where they came up with that term so United courting magazine is now\nThreatening people with law suits and collection agencies\nFor doing hidden city tickets so let's say as an example you were going to Houston and instead you might buy a ticket to Austin or San Antonio where El Paso and it might cut your price\nEighty Ninety percent when you get to Houston you just don't take the connecting flight\nEver it is you're doing that's what United is really upset about and the legal notices that United sending people are ridiculous they are to a level of meanness bit is absolutely Clark courageous\nAnd I believe that it is a legitimate strategy for you to do to save money\nIf you go on clerk dot com on our my travel guide I explain to you how you do it but you won't have a problem one of the things you have to do is you have to travel with only a tiny micro carry on because if they take away your carry on bag\nAt the gate that bags going to the city that they were planning for you to go to that you're not taking the connecting flight you obviously can't check bags you can only do it on a one way fair but the savings involved in this\nGigantic and American United and delta have spent a fortune building up these fortress hubs trying to keep out competitors simply for the purpose of driving fares up to the highest levels possible\nIn these fortress cities and they don't take kindly to you coming up with ways\nTo beat the system and get a lower price there is nothing against the law\nDoing this United in fact called it an act of fraud fraud is a crime\nUnited send your lawyers back to law school\n'cause it's not fraud is just somebody making a smart decision to save money you're listening to the Clark Howard show\nI used to have a sweet tooth had it removed when I was a kid so what

changes as the child gets closer and closer to entering college\nIt's too complicated to try to figure out your own investment in the mix unless you work as an investment professional as your day job\nSo going in the age based portfolio is what I recommend what I've done going through the plans as I've looked at them to find the ones that are the absolute lowest cost because over let's say a typical investment cycle that someone's putting money on for a child's college\nThe money sits in their roughly ten years\nBased on when people put money on and the money you put in through the years and so for that\nInvestment cycle the cost of the investments matter enormously how much money you'll have there for a kids' college by the time they're spending it and for tuition and other eligible expenses and undergraduate or graduate school\nSo my guide that I've just updated at Clark dot com is all about driving down costs period\nAnd the good news is that college five twenty nine plans have gotten cheaper and cheaper and cheaper with intense competition among those that are the direct salt\nBut one said involved commissions again I don't even look at because they're so on economic you should never consider them\nBut the great news is that when I first started writing about and reviewing five twenty nine plans long ago the list of those that were good for you to put your money on was teensy tiny\nToday in encompasses most plans sponsored by most states in the country and many states in addition to getting use some money tax free for college you get a tax benefit up front for participating in a plan\nAnd so check out my guide and it's something that I uh do partial revisions overtime and then do a major revisions to\nRoughly every Eighteen months and the reason there are times I Do partial revisions is to actually won a plan may change sponsors or the existing sponsor main lower costs or two\nThe decision I made about a particular state plan was wrong and I may downgrade planner upgraded plan on further review but the idea of this is that\nYou have an opportunity if you can afford it to put money aside to defray the least in part the cost of a child's college education and have that done the most efficient way possible tax free growth of your money\nHaving said that though\nNever sacrifice your own retirement\nIn order to put money aside for kids college your retirement comes first\nThe reason why a simple there are no scholarship plans for retirement\nBut there are many alternative ways to pay for college including the most overlooked of all and that's going to a more affordable college is the number one way to reduce the costs because the dollar never had to be expended for college\nIs a dollar you don't have to say for it\nAnd again if the culture and your family\nIs college is not likely for a kid you don't want to save in one of these plans\nBut always save the max you're allowed to enter Roth IRA\nBefore you focus in any meaningful way on a five twenty nine\nI guess the only a pastor is that\nIs if there's a state tax benefit going into a five twenty nine if you can put in what will get you the maximum tax benefit and state in addition to the tax free growth that would make it a one and then the raw IRA funding would be a one a\nRed anyway you can see my explanation pet CT dot com would go with my five twenty nine plan guide is this I Want you to be in a position\nTo review\nPick a plan\nFind it and be done\nIn less than Fifteen minutes this doesn't have to be hard it doesn't in any way need to be intimidating and you'll really be glad that you set up a plan with the goal of being to add to it\nEvery month if you can automatically to build up real money towards college\nJill is with us on the Clark Howard show Hi Jill\nHi Clark how are you great Jill I Hope I can be of help to you\n[laughter] I Hope so I have a question about the online [laughter] I I've been listening to you and recently I took your advice and have a chunk of our savings to one of the online banks and like he could get that I went to a bank rates selected one that\nHad a good interest rate and a five star ratings but my my nagging concern is that I didn't see a direct link to the bank so I had to Google it kind it and that set it up it looks like it but I still have this nagging theater that one of these times are going to go into\nAnd money's got a subtle down right okay so let me tell you what is with a you worked at the bank Craig list with any of these lists um when someone doesn't pay them referral fees [noise]\nThey're not going to provide a direct like they're going to give you the information\nBut it's the best right out there with that's why there wasn't a hyper lengthy would take you right to it okay\nA bad bank or one that you should be wary of it's just that since they wouldn't pay money any kind of commission is going to be a little more work for you to do business with them what kind of rate are you learning\nA Q and a quarter\nTo quarter already ... that is I think today the highest anybody's paying is too okay yeah it it ...\nIt was when I set it up and I mean I guess my other question is since there's not a brick and mortar bank locally and I think the banks that are cases supposedly based in New York but other other special safeguards that you should take when you use an online bank is because I'm not sure what I Would do all the sudden I couldn't access my account or the bank's website\nWhere you can always cross validate that you're dealing with real people by going to FDIC dot Gov and checking to see that it is a real institution band that you're insured to the quarter million\nAnd as long as you have to cross reference you're you're good to go and online banks are going to be a bigger and bigger part of our financial market in the United states because particularly people who have come of age in the last Fifteen Years\nGoing to physical bank branches just isn't part of how they do things and so the the future's going to be captured by online only institutions\nAnd what you're doing is just plain smart\nI Hope so I Am certainly seems to not leave money on the table so I appreciate all up here get advice and and that makes me feel a little bit better\nAnd I'm curious what were you earning at the place you had the money before\nI had it at a credit union and and actually they are currently pay two and a half percent but only on you know up to a certain amount of money so I was getting a good interest rate on some of my savings but that was a lot out there that I wasn't gaining anything on\nWell two and a half is really great that's fantastic um I didn't know any credit unions were paying savings rates that Hi Beverly with us on the Clark Howard show Hi Beverly\nHigh Clark how are you\nGreat thank you Beverly you got a question for me to save some money\nI sure do but at first I Want to thank you for what you do I we all appreciate

transformation in how when you're a homeowner you sell your home\nAnd the changes taking place right now or things that probably would have happened sooner if it hadn't been for the last decades financial scandals and resulting real estate bust but\nThe way real estate has worked historically with you putting a house up on the market\nAnd listing typically with an agent and waiting for buyers to come along and hope somebody makes an offer and not knowing if the house is going to sell and one week one mind one year or seemingly never\nYou now have more and more options around the country to put your home for sale and immediately have a buyer think of it kind of like how in the car business more and more places will buy a car from you\nEven if you're not a customer of theirs they'll buy the car you have and they'll give you a price and you have so many days in which to decide to accept it in real estate and more and more cities especially in the south south west and west\nYou can contact one of these companies or if you have several operating in your area you want to contact all of them and see if they'll make an offer on your home\nThe offers they make are on typically about

serve you\nWell I've got a situation where we are\nThere are so expensive several thousands of dollars even and my favorite warehouse club or I Know it's nice to reputable Christ\nOr when you are you when you say favorite warehouse club are you talking about Sam's or Costco\nIt'd be Costco\nCosco has some very basic hearing aids that you may be able to buy it like five hundred dollars a year okay but you can do a lot cheaper than that and get a true real hearing aid and that's what you'd like you'd like a better deal right\nWhen I'm starting to see is in the newspapers or magazines some other tearing a type of companies and I'm looking to find out if they're reputable or if there's any other recommendation that one little bit better priced\nOkay so there's two things you'll see in the ads one you'll see her ads that are very cleverly written that under the law the devices are not considered to be hearing aids they're referred to as peace saps under the law\nPersonal sound amplification product I think is what it stands for\nAnd those are being very heavily promoted on the Web and as you mentioned the newspaper ads and people are selling those from anywhere like under a hundred dollars to typically tapping out around three hundred dollars\nAnd then there are actual real hearing aids that require that you also have the services of an audiologist in order for you legally to be able to get them because a hearing aid is licensed by the FDA\nApiece at you and I could go start our own Mike ... piece at company now there is one that's kind of a step in between and I'd like you to look at the website is I hear medical dot com\nAnd they sell a hearing aid they also sell a FDA approved test kit where you can do your own actual fully FDA approved ear test okay because the way the business works right now 'cause\nA lot of places do the hearing test quote unquote for free\nAnd then they make the massive mark up on the hearing aids is to my knowledge we're the only country on earth that uses this business model and so I hear a medical gets around that you buy you actually paying for the hearing test\nAnd then you get the really inexpensive true hearing aid\nSo hurt anything about them or any others are reputable so we don't spend money on something that doesn't work for a dollar\nOkay so the thing with hearing aids who's going to sound terrible it doesn't matter if you spent five thousand dollars on hearing aids the customer satisfaction with hearing aids is extremely low so that's why I'd like you to start off with something much less expensive and see

going steadily down for the flights fight in Costa Rica in particular a lot of the cost of the trip once you're there is actually higher than it used to be because of the ah the amount of demand there is for going to Costa Rica\nTo the coast and also to San jose in the rain forest and all that have you ever been to Costa Rica\nFlow hotline magnet\nWell then what we can do with that may be going and

live right in between the stuff\nSo I Would go to ... website because many of the cheapest fares\nTo Costa Rica other Central American spots and spots in the Caribbean now along the eastern seaboard a lot of those cheap fares are there because of two airlines Jet Blue in spirit jeopardy has a great airline spirit is an airline\nBadly it then [laughter]\nWhat was it like share with your fellow listener any and everything you want to do that just as well they didn't charge you to breed though\nAre online at all [laughter]\n\n[laughter] it was that there were a lot of extra charges once you got your shower and like that [laughter]\nYeah I I understand I was looking at while Arab and European airline that flies from the U.S to Europe it some amazingly low fares and what's funny is when you get past the ticket like I was looking at tickets that were Ninety nine dollars each way to Europe\nThe add on fees ended up being at least one way more than the fare was\nYeah so you know you got to look to all land thing now but if you want to go to Liberia or go to go in there out of San jose whatever whatever it would work out to be how much flexibility do you have about your travel days\nOf the lines open at ...\n... that'll get you very that'll get you a very cheap fare when I'd like you to do is set up a what's known as a fair alert from several different departure point since you sound like you're willing to travel a little bit could be the best fares outta Charlotte North Carolina is an example\nOr about the best fair might be out of Charleston South Carolina you don't you know in in your general vicinity and then track fairs also on kayak dot com K. why okay go into one of their fair searches where you do plus or minus three days\nTried different departure airports

today\nFinally suddenly home he's speaking on the radio on and I'm only tune in after work as I'm driving home um and you mention that for\nPeople that are under the age of Twenty one so that Eighteen to twenty um they wouldn't be allowed to get a credit card and due to face federal law\nAnd I looked at a credit union um things graduating from college so much going on for years now and I'm just Neal that the way that I knew that because I recently issued cards and helped cause kids' clubs students I should say\nSo after doing some research to find exactly what I was talking about I realized that it was the credit card act of two thousand nine that you're referring to but\nIf people are able to pay down debt than they could get\nA credit card to younger than Twenty one so college students at a part time job there A L K to submit an application and they have limits though you have to submit it via fax male [laughter] which isn't hard to do from a financial institution and I mean this is only one way\nTo start building credit\nAnd I just submitted a question on line or a blur to yeah just kind of\nWell I appreciate that you know most of the time when I'm being asked the question it's about students who are not working you know they're just in\nCollege as fulltime students and the idea of the card act was it was such a high delinquency rate\nOn credit cards when college students were given them the first week of school at age Eighteen or Nineteen\nThat's why the card act provisions are there but uh especially if the kid is I use the word kid even though you just corrected yourself if somebody is working\nAnd they're going to school they're considered to be someone who is some degree of financially independent and they are eligible to have a credit card if a financial institution will issue one to them\n[noise] so you were completely correct\n[noise] ... the other thing as I Know plenty of high school students they graduate maybe they don't offer a technical school or a four year degree program but you know they go right into the workforce and for them to have to wait until they're Twenty one of the credit for them but\nThey don't have to if they if they show that they are under the car to act as long as I understand the provisions right as long as they are financially independent they're eligible to apply for a credit card at Eighteen\nYes so it's only

only eight to five [noise] five two to five [noise]\nMembers starts off as our in Kansas City Hi amber how are you\nGoing to I'm not sure how can I help me by\nMy head than adults above her pension pay their previous paint job\nI'm In league with a lot or in the mail offering a cash payout retirement in ... the letters for sixty percent of the president value at church normal retirement annuity\nMhm I heard to advise people on the path to take\nThe path pay out\n... my concern is that they're with I read the news announcement\nThat the state treasurer um that that the pension plan had we can financially and it ... years ago there were fine to cover like Seventy nine percent of the future benefits and stuff like that mhm\nCan unemployed where I'm not half of them [laughter] and when it comes time for your retirement you\nKnow what I mean they can be broke a lot of pension funds of going broke and the problem is you don't own anything you're just depending on the screen but pretty much so that she had another reason to take the lump sum and almost always and you can you can uh get with a financial advisor get with more ... more of us are ...\nUh they're they're about five steps too complicated to do here on the air okay\nBut basically you can put in the amount of payments you would receive and put it in an average death age of uh Seventy six for a male Seventy eight for a female [laughter] that's how they're calculated typically on actuarial tables\nAnd uh then you figure out what the president value of those payments are because that's what you're going to receive and\nThat's what they're saying that they're offering you and it's probably the discount rate is the interest rate and it's probably six percent five and a half percent something like that so you probably make five and a half percent on your money and if you die you lose it when you die not if you do when you die you lose\nNow and so if you took the lump sum\nYou'd be making ten twelve percent on your money if you invested in good mutual funds and when you die your family get some money\nBy show the lump sum Ninety nine percent of the time comes out better especially if you include the fact that when you die you get to keep the money\nYou know they do\nWell it I mean fortunately it's not a lot down on American Idol I\nYou know but I I I Would ... just saying then it's a mathematical theory on that you run through on whether whether it's a hundred thousand or a million or or ten thousand you know the theory is still the same\nAnd it's just it's an it's less important if it's a small amount of money right I get that but in other words the mistake is not going to ruin your life you know that kind of a thing but if you want to run the actual numbers out that's how you would do it\nAround twenty of them how many different creditors are you a ... regular goes all that's like utility bills and that kinda stuff seriously I don't have any you don't have any that you don't have any debt okay now\nOkay then you just need to call your utilities and make sure where they on auto draft on your account\nYes gay then you're going to\nGive them your new account numbers and get all that switched over today show that you take over the handling of your money and you can just like random mother know that you know with grandpa was passing out in what you have to fool with this honey San won't take it over and I'm I'm enrolled in the financial class and\nI'm going to get control as a twenty five year old man of my life and I'm ...\nI'm Sorry she absolutely and now she's in jail why she in jail all my sister cross jog is critical card game honing really\nWow okay well you can let her know that you took the bank account or a due to all this weird notion of family then\nVery interesting wow\nSo people in the family are not real happy with grandmother right now I take it\nAnd no not at all you know\nVery sad sad to be Seventy years old and that and so and then the next thing you need to do is you need to pull a copy of your credit bureau report and you can do that for free once a year with each of the three credit bureaus and see if there's anything showing up on your credit bureau report regarding identity theft\nRoommates who she is open cards and your name as well\nOkay well\nLet me help you to your sister may or may not have been really mad\nAnd she may or may not meant for your grandmother to be picked up but here's the thing the only way if someone opens an account and your name\nThe only way to get that account cleared other than pay it yourself which would be pretty stupid to pay an account that you didn't open when someone stole your identity the only way to keep from doing that is you have to file a police report\nAnd when you're filling out the police report they always ask you if you know who stole your identity and if you don't tell them that would be breaking the law and so your sister followed the law properly when the police report as being filled out and said yes I Know who the identity the as\nMy grandmother and I'm I'm surprised actually that they went and picked her up but they did and you know show 'em because it is it is a federal law it is a federal offense now to steal an identity\nAnd so um she she's in trouble [noise] she's in real trouble but your sister ... could maybe accidentally activated all of this because she just had to do a police report to get the identity theft removed from her name\nRight but she may have been just mad and gotten arrested I don't know either way's fine with me but um\n'cause moments definitely a thief but oh my goodness ... sat thing though more horrible thing you guys are going through not Cody um much how much do you make what kind of money do you make\nForty thousand a year okay are you really ready to take this over and learn how to handle money if you are I'll show you how which in our class and say okay\nBut you don't have to wear your shoulders back now not look for anybody else to babysit your you're too old for a babysitter so time for you to man up here okay you hold on I'll have Kelly pick up and we'll get you signed up for financial ... you can go through the clash is our guest\nAnd we'll take good care of you in show you how to handle money and then you go handle your money [noise] thanks for calling in to open phones a AAA eight to five five two to five\nHow devastating\nStealing your stuff I mean\nI I mean I run into parents are still are kids identities and that's pretty much gone but when your grandmother does it oh my gosh\nIt's just heartbreaking and then a suicide in the family on top of that with grandpa oh my gosh what a mess this money stuff man it's it's a big deal not because money's a big deal but it's just so revealing it reveals\nEverything else about your doesn't it [noise]\nJesus so do you send your treasures where your heart is\nThis just to send money problem yeah money problems when I had money

of our debt\nCredit card car I'm In a few other debts and the only that we have left is student loan debt mhm\nUm and so we but we between my wife and I we oh about a hundred and fourteen thousand dollars in student loan debt [laughter] um so we're just trying to figure out what we can do between the upgrade of the the new house and the uh the student loans that we have left how will\nWe get paid off just trying to figure out how to do that [noise] [noise]\n... uh spend less than you make and put it on the student loan I mean what are you thinking about I don't understand\nWho basically we're just we're just trying to figure out like a bit there's three of them between us I'm a teacher [laughter] um I Know the built our loan forgiveness programs but I'm just trying to figure out\nLoans programs don't work there ten years long you don't want to be in debt ten years\nWhat's your household income\nSo take home between my wife and I we um we make ... about fifty seven thousand a year\nOkay and how much is your house primary\n[noise] so we haven't gotten a person we just moved um so the house payment will be around sixteen hundred a month\nOkay you're right at a fourth that's not bad right and you have no other dad except the student loans\nCorrect okay and show if you put twenty thousand dollars a year on these is going to take you five years so I think I think you've got to look at ways to increase your income\nOkay you got a lot of student loans for two teachers were yours you're going to meet you where did you get your degrees\nSo she has a master's I got my bachelor's receive we we both work in a new northern Arizona university\nWow you must have put everything on there um [noise]\nYou lost your debts small is the largest the three loans pay minimum payments on the two big ones and attack the smallest one with a vengeance that way you can see that trees all over from your shopping\nIf you just chop a tree and it never falls over it's no fun you know so you need to see you need to feel that reward of that little one going away when that little one goes away then you can attack the next one down but you got a five year plan unless you had some income to this uh and it's going to be a tough five years really hard\nAnd so I'm probably picking up some tutoring some coaching some something things that teachers do on the side or to earn extra money probably make another twenty grand tutoring in\nTurn your five year plan into a two and a half year plan\nI don't have any I Can't afford any mhm okay so the company that I'm interested I'm with now it's been like five hundred dollars a month or something just for me mhm mhm so out of\nFive hundred dollars or five hundred dollars a month or six thousand dollars a year you're talking about taking a pay cut of nine thousand dollars mhm you're going to trade six for non if you're doing it for health insurance four one K. benefit is worth very little and the other benefits and you know more time off is not what you need you need more money\nMhm that and the potential to grow with the company would be a lot more quickly hum I'm next year or two what'd you double your income um wouldn't quite do but no ...\nI couldn't I couldn't be looking at the next two years I can be looking at like maybe maybe another ten thousand a year back up to where you were from yes plus the health insurance yeah\nYeah well the the the benefits are worth very very little in this equation um I Would not do it for the benefits\nOkay I might do it if it's taking one step back and I get into a career I Love shark and take six steps forward 'cause I Want to or how old are you a twenty three so the question is when you're forty three Twenty years from today\nMhm does this take you where you want to go Twenty years from today\nIf it's not until you are you in that direction than you're doing this for health insurance benefits and that's a dumb idea\nOkay [noise] um I mean maybe maybe not this job or in mind I don't I don't know exactly how are you not only that much about the company quite yet but it it does open the door for for the [noise] it's uh it it it can turn it could help

device on Friday nights last friday at seven to news talk not for one dot com [noise]\nA good program has been so far and we are just getting going [noise]\nFishing off in a big topic of conversation this recent story from Yahoo in the wake of the pack twelve mistake\nOther power five conferences confident in their replay procedures you may remember the story and we are going to review what happened and why probably won't happen anytime soon Steve Shaw always great to have a Steve on the program who runs the officiating for the SEC state good to have you on and I and I really appreciate it because\nI followed this pact twelve situation and our goal is not to beat up on them but I Would like to have you explain what happened there and why we don't think it's going to happen here or anywhere else in the future\nWell when we started collaborative replay in the Southeastern Conference or you know a lot of people were involved from the technology standpoint Cal Cunningham our video director gotta let it but one of the things one of the guiding principles that we had four collaborative replay\nOr was that we were going to use replay officials are in the office and they were going to be part of the collaborative process and commissioner saying he was was very specific that no conference personnel would participate in decisions uh and and that included me\nAnd a ... you know I own every decision so it was my job to train these guys get them ready or get the technology in their hands and make sure that they've got all the guidelines that they need\nBut then on football Saturday\nThat decision is completely in their hands working with the replay official that is in the stadium and you know ultimately it's collaborative so people have said well who gets the final say well we want it to be collaborative\nBut you know the final say goes to the guy in the stadium but uh if they can't come to a decision together\nThen the replay real rule really kind of spells it out it it's not clear and obvious\nIt is not indisputable then the place stands but it it was very specific from day one from the commissioner or that we were going to use replay officials and they were going to make all the decisions in the process and there'd be no influence from the conference office on game day\nSteve I've had the privilege of of watching this at your office and it it's it's very eye opening in ... and I realize you try to communicate and educate people as much as possible but if you if you wouldn't mind take the audience\nAnd and explain what really happens\nWell as you know Paul it's a very intense room on Saturday but\nThe the thing that has helped us through the collaborative process is\nUh we've been much more consistent and we've avoided what I call the the dreaded incorrect outcome and so really what happens you know if you go first go through the replay booth in the stadium at the hot seat I mean not only when you stop it but are you going to stop the game sometimes without temple off and says you only have a couple of moments\nTo make a decision made him going to stop the game but when you stop the game\nThen that TV's looking in the window the clocks ticking or you know the fans are buzzing and it's a hot seat you got to make a decision\nWith the collaborative partners we have three officials so they have primary games but any time there's a stop\nIn a game day three come together\nThe room is a very solid room there's no you know we don't have any sound in the room and they're just looking at the video evidence in the quiet of them three together they can talk together one of the three communicates with the a replay official in stadium and actually when the fancy the referee come over\nAnd and put the headset on um he's actually he can hear both the replay official in stadium and in Birmingham\nI'm so they're three collaborating together but ultimately the the three officials in Birmingham talk through collaborate come to a decision share that decision\nAnd they can actually see what's on the monitor of the official that in stadium or so they have to you and they can talk through that and and so they come to a decision together\nAnd then communicate that to the referee and so it's an intense place a it's a long day but the the three officials that we have there are really good they're all three you know X. officials\nAll three had been referees and you know at the division one level and they are all three actually coordinators in their conferences so very good football minds are very good at making you know with good football commonsense following the guidelines and replay and it's worked very well for us are not perfect\nA perfect sometimes isn't the object of holder or but hit has really been good and since we started collaborative our consistency and correct calls have have really been solid\nSteve I Know for fans at home it seems like this was going on forever [laughter] ah but it is in your mind what what's a good ... and I know you you want the right result that's the most important thing but is there a time frame that you would like to keep the Sims show the games don't\nSeemingly play out all day all night\nAbsolutely and that's been one of the things I mean so the the starting point is you have to make the right decision so there's there's no question we've got to do that but [noise]\nUm and and not just our commissioner 'cause he's really charged us to keep the game moving but even in the rules over the last couple of years we've done a lot of things to keep the game moving and clearly replay is one of those areas that that can impact that\nAnd so I'm two years ago he gave us a pretty big challenge to add to this 'cause everybody's concerned when we went to collaborative oh no these things are going to get longer now\nAnd we've actually made good strides last year our average replay time was a minute Seventeen\nOr which his expectation he had given us was a minute Fifteen so we're still short of that but that significantly down from previous years and so far this year we are under the minute Fifteen mark a and we've got to stay there with a thing\nTake the time it takes but if you have a review that is going to be long when you get to two minutes um you know Matt\nEncouragement to the to replay geysers it's time to wrap it up because if you don't have indisputable video evidence if it's not clear and obvious and you've looked at this thing for two minutes\nThat's your answer and let's get out of it and let it stand and move on and so\nAh we've done much better or the area we've attack this year is to get rid of the law reviews no fan wants those are certainly TV doesn't want them and and we've made good progress they are so uh that's where we're going to continue to go after it uh but keeping the game moving is important\nAnd getting the right outcome as important as well\nTo save a million things we could ask you about\n... million games but I Do want to and talking about last week a national\nUh the ... Florida game looked pretty rough for the average fan your coaches after each other players are getting a toss can you give us a as much as you can ah an overview of of that situation in in\nWhere when right where one wrong\nWell in it also had some interesting rules interpretations they came through in that situation so\nUh what we had a targeting foul that was the correct call a player was injured and so you know coaching staff in attendance came out or to attend to the player it put the two staff closer than they normally would be\nAnd I think our officials really is a great job handling this um you know as as people saw both benches empty but we kept everybody separated so nobody actually got in together and and and started blows\nBut as the cruise looked at this so when both teams emptied their bench I mean that's an unfortunate like act to leave and there was no way we can get individually every number so the crude then and rightfully so in mechanically this ... this is the right thing to do\nThey issued an sportsman conduct vow to everybody on both teams because they had all left the bench area\nBut what was unusual about that was that you know the rules changed a few years back\nThat if a player gets a second an sportsman like\nFoul and again he's disqualified automatically by rule well we had a player in the game that had gotten an sportsman like file earlier in the game correct call on that\nSo then by virtue of his whole team getting this this became his second and he was actually disqualified for the game so there were actually two players the player guilty of targeting and then another player who got his second ... conduct file was disqualified as well and we've got a lot of questions on that but ultimately I\nWith what he's been doing in the first half whether that will travel to Baton Rouge or not\n... what are you or your report card on a coach oh you're on so far\n[noise] I I think it's been amazing uh and listen to he uh he's a coach that continues to amaze or whether you like LSU or not\nI don't know anyone who doesn't like ...\nAnd I would consider myself among his biggest fans I doubted whether he could do it I I Can't doubt him any longer I mean he has done too much this year and it's been remarkable and in quite inspiring to watch a Lance is up next Lance go right ahead\nLawsuit don't tell U.S foreign policy he made a ... a large it the championships he'd be I'm a card you can make he's done pretty much just said well I Want to get yourself getting oh what did you speak to our team two weeks ago not to go to a wedding oh go ahead\nAnd you want to say if we play that game it\nDown you know land land so I've already made that statement American repeat the same thing every day yes LSU have LA shoe store to buy the lord and lady you know it I Know\nAnyone who understands college football knows that\nYeah that's what you said two years ago when you were down there with us and ride of your mouth for three hours what happened to you know you know what I'm saying God has a three hour so we've got to like start\nOkay Laura get get get get your staff sergeant or like a three hour phone call\n\nOr I mean I

I read it before but you're you're talking about what\nYou're talking about the predictability I think last week I sat here and said hey they're tipping they're run past based on information personnel instead of two weeks ago upset it\nPretty much all season and so I was watching this last game as they do every week about three quarters through and I'm like man it's happening again so I ... around the whole tape I started from play one started script in every single time they changed\nA formation and or personnel and when Chandler Cox's in the game in the game or tied in which I think it was only three or four plays that it wasn't Chandler Cox and it was another tight and they ran or through screen on Seventy four percent of place and when they had for a wide receivers in the game they threw one Ninety One percent of patches now the last\nUh you know two minutes or less fourth quarter you take all those throws out trying to get back in the game it's still eighty five percent with for a wide receiver so my big context is I think last year we saw when this football team couldn't run the football effectively and this year with no carry an Johnson it's a different a fence and so when you try to tighten up there\nAnd you're run in Seventy four percent of the time of defense can say OK based on his personal information ... load up the box bring an extra linebacker and that's that's tough situation for an up and to be successful in on the other side were claimed about how bad your dinner was banned about this ... I get it he's made plenty mistakes and there's a lot of blame to go around but when you throw the ball\nIn a game Ninety One percent of the time\nIn one particular personnel grouping\nAll the teams got to do is say okay we're going to play coverage every time you get in a set it it just making it very difficult situation problem to be successful\nAnd you're done a number of our brain games and you met with a mouse on and Lindsay and bug where he said he he's happy with which ones are today or you're smiling\nCourse no reference I don't know what's going on behind closed doors I'm not going to say I know what's going on I Would imagine that there's a little tug of war between what this game plan looks like he's got three people that are heavily invested in it remember Jared system was going to leave for the NFL I Know very ... I asked I asked coach mouths on what was that conversation like state him\nAnd I was on chip Lindsey all sat down and said here's what this year's going to look like\nHere's what we're going to fix from last year here's how we're going to set you up to be a better pro here's where they're going to set you up\nTo be a better quarterback we haven't seen that happen so I think George didn't wants one thing I'd think chip Lindsey based on what he's done in his past as an officer coordinator sure doesn't look like a chitlins game plan I think he would like one thing that ... done something successful for very long time so you have three egos three guys that one and often to take a certain identity and I think we're getting a poor version of all the\n... so ... heads to almost this weekend season clearly I'm\nHanging in the balance and I say that because you beat on this and then you can start to say okay we're paying them right you're sure doesn't get any ... it's a it's a fantasy but that's how football works without this game is over ... what can overdo\nI mean here's what I I was doing an interview earlier\nAnd I said look I I'd be okay if I flipped on film and I no one really cares what I think but in my own mind them like I'm OK I'd be okay if I slipped on the film and I ... I'm not playing very well but you know what they were trying to attack the middle of the field they were doing things different Paul I had another text or tweet whatever the other day and I said\nDear system has had six completion from the eight yard line to the forty four yard line between the number is not the ashes between the numbers that giant section or the field he's only had six completion all year this office is just not trying to change they're not trying to do anything different so next week this week against Ole Miss\nI don't care if it's a winner last if I'm smiles on her find anybody that's watching if I'm an Auburn fan I Want to see something different I Want to see a different game plan once the movement I Want to see different passes and runs that have different personnel is trying to be unpredictable trying to do things different otherwise what's the point 'cause\nYou're probably not going to be a Georgia you're probably not going to be the ... and maybe you are going to be good games but right now it doesn't look like it so you got to do something different\n[noise] let's talk about another program that that needs to be different in two weeks and that's George or you've had some things to say about ... as well\nIt's interesting and and as I've said all along I think Jake from is a very good quarterback now a few weeks ago I said I think from a pure talent standpoint if we're projecting to the NFL is probably a free agent type guy he was not a guy that's controlled seven yards down ... and throw it through a brick wall and he's not\nA you know a camp Newton or just in fields or anybody else when it comes to mobility he's good at being a quarterback\nUm but if we dive into this and I got some criticism because I said I don't know how good he is because I don't know if we've seen him tested yet I think we saw him tested again tells you what the ... the first time that we really saw Georgia in a situation where they had to throw the ball to win\nAnd the other defense knew they had to throw to when you could argue the national championship were from it to picks against the great Alabama team but\nI was maybe one experience this is the first true experience where they had to throw the ball and it lets you knew they had to throw the ball to win and he couldn't get it done so I started diving more into the stats there and if you look at Georgia on third down they have the third most favorable\nStarting position or starting position but distance to reach the first down in the SEC nice best or most favorable in the entire power five and ... from has the third worst QB are in the entire power five\nOn third down so that tells me is that when the defense knows they're gonna throw they're not very good so they need to do something different right now I don't think that's just in fields yet\nBut I Would have liked to see Justin Fields in significant time last week or like in to see a few drives where he could be a thrower he could be a runner we could see what a defense has to do to scheme against ... guy 'cause right now they're using them as a package guy even though when I talked to ... smart two weeks ago he said he's not a package guy\nDefenses have to do in order to stop a guy that can run the football and throw the football not that he's a takeover right now because this is still Jake Trump's team but Jake from has not been doing everything perfect as I think a lot of Georgia fans think\nThis is a week off and we can talk to you about a next week for the curb your smarts thinking about that game right now do you think we'll see a different look from fields\nI think we'll see more like what we saw against Tennessee 'cause against Tennessee with five minutes left in the in the first half\nIt was ten nothing the only touchdown Jordan scored was on the blue fumbled it got picked up and we saw just some fields get almost an entire drive he started driving had five or six plays in a row and then later in the fourth quarter again he came into stark a drive where he can be a ... threat quarterback not just guys going to come in and do his own read and hop out and from back in I think we'll see\nJustin field of the few drives and then we'll start to figure out\nIs it is this really create problems for defense can you really handle a little bit more of the playbook because until now or right now is it sits he's talented but we just don't know if you can be as effective at as ... as being good at protecting the football and run in the offing yeah he hasn't been dynamic but he's been solid despite the bad third down numbers\nYou need to get feels more opportunity to prove that he could do that or find out if he can\nSaturday Night Baton Rouge or LSU hosts Mississippi State fans are already talking about\nThat's the mindset fans don't control but but players coming off of the biggest one of their lives uh they're thinking about that too how does that was you deal with Mississippi State which has been a mystery team all your\nYeah I mean you you got ... here's what I Love the ... I think had some some comments about coach Joe\nAnd what a good job he does that preparing the team for a game that is the role of a coach citizen CEO you got great coordinators to run the office and defense so coach always in an extremely good job of having his team ready for the match up\nEmotionally physically whatever that is he's had them ready I think there'll be ready again but here's my biggest question is who is job or oh\nI Know you guys are getting sick can be saying that but he was what Fifteen of thirty for two hundred yards at a big run at the end but it was already a to score game at that point he completed just three balls that went beyond ten yards\nSo job or doing a good job at managing things but then again he's also one of the worst second worse than the SEC against pressure so that tells me he doesn't know where to go with the boys on the complete and thirty three percent of his passes against pressure with sixteen sex\nWhich tells me when the blitz has come and he doesn't know where to go with the ball\nAnd then he also can't push it down field is effectively you might need to get to Mississippi State team and in Alabama team so I get a job arose in a great job\nFor LSU of emotionally having a big play maybe when they needed it but he needs to be a guy that can mean is the game from start to finish if they have a chance to beat Alabama 'cause right now I don't think they do without a job or all played last week as good as everybody thinks he played watched the film\nThere's a couple of throws to throws the one down the right sideline in boundary great ball the one towards the end of the game other than that there was nothing that job arose did that said he's a game changer he's the reason they won that football game and I think I got to see something gets Mississippi State if I'm to say it lets you even have a chance against Alabama\nFinally ... the quarterback situation at Alabama you you've you've done a quarterback you fight with injury a lot of debate about to arrive now he says he's fine\nPlayers are always fine but ah against Tennessee what would you do as a with Nick Saban deciding how or whether to play on which we we think we were he will how much deployed um\nNo I remember you probably remember Spurrier or alternating player quarterbacks every play and it didn't work\nVery well it didn't work exactly that's what we we know for a fact if you've got to quarterback ... you don't have one if you if you're going to do it like that I mean look at look at how the excitement is doing now he's got two great quarterback\nHe doesn't rotate 'em one play act or the other you don't do that you upsetting the team okay the team doesn't even know what to do\nOkay now I'm not I look I got to congratulate LSU they look good and I'm going to take a little bit a different approach and Darryl the Alabama I don't care who they have a play or who they play\nThis is what's going to happen when they play LSU there's\nOne thing that Alabama does the Georgia does not do they put pressure on the quarterback they get sex and that is how they will they ... they're going to be the LSU it might it's going to be a tough game for a little while but\nYou know you you know well you know well I I Am willing to tell you right now there's going to be three or four sacks\nBorough in that game because Alabama's got a good four seven you know they might not have the greatest impasse coverage it but it's coming you know but there's no way Georgia conveyed Alabama right now I'm not a I'm not a a like a a stupid Sandy just says oh we can beat anybody\nBut I Want to go after Lance one time to rise last year what was the score Lance Lance was forty one to seven they shouldn't even ahead that seven yeah it was a different coach will last\nYear we play day and low and it was thirty eight to three or something like that now Florida is better in this going to be a better game this year and I'm not going to say George is going to win because\nJust can't wrap my head around I saw Kirby was something but now I'm not sure\nThat he said why Saudi was when you're coaching your team and you're doing in your in your your rotating your quarterback like that it makes no sense Paul every time Justin feels came in for one\nIt was going to be a ruined okay\nEven in the games prior right the gangs prior that we played and we put just in the ... okay\nWhat did we do we didn't get him ready we didn't get him ready to throw the ball anything I think he's had none attempts against the ACC teams passing them all three for three in one game I think are no I mean three for six but\nMy point is is who is Kirby Smart please tell me I'm trying to\nWell we have a mind I mean he he has had some bad game so the only game two years ago last year I think we were the Auburn game he has not had many lately uh I think it's\nReally now a matter of of of of how Kirby Smart recovers from this game and I think the Florida game will help to find the season and even even that game will not end the conversation because I still think Kentucky in Lexington will be very very difficult game die hard is next step you were on the air go right ahead\nA hello Paul I'm first time caller i._d. this uh they've been listening to your show watching it for a long time I think ...\nIt's it's really hard to know what to say in regards to go smells on it all over that I Am old enough to where I used to listen to all run on the radio\nOr when that was about the only time you could hear 'em except maybe played Alabama or to see on TV when she was there a ... million dollar labor with coach die uh but uh the mental toughness at all over and just doesn't appear to\nBe there uh and and I did not get here what George Rogers had to say can you kind of\nYeah I mean let me just kind of he only he said he reviewed the tapes\nAnd has done so for several weeks and he says at Auburn is one of the most predictable often says that he's ever seen that you you can easily predict what they are going to do depending on the set that they're in\nA while I agree with that completely my brother's I've been talking about that for a long time in a certain players come in the game and and certain down in death steps in and a hit on a like a lot of people I may not be on a\nFrustrated with this thing I heard a press conference today yet and they just talk like a man that that that knows he's got the upper hand on over\nA and first of all I'd never answer any questions I Know I'm starting to get aid to have the answers\nWell listen I I was with him friday on the program he came by and the last hour in and I asked him about what happens next and he did what a coach usually does uh he talked about hey the second half of the season starts tomorrow well if that's the second half of the season is going to be a long second half\nOf it it's it's it's awful I mean that that Saturday is just absolutely inexcusable and I know there's ... blind problems are but a a person has built a program here six shouldn't have off its allies brought a him up and he has not built to broker\nA and I you know I mean I Know you said I've heard you say it several times ... there's just no way a orange getting out of this deal with him are they\nWell uh it was interesting a bright and Marcello covers Auburn was on her earlier and he he gave a different view you sort of a ... if ... of Auburn loses ... and then loses to pay the rest of them and have it as a losing season he believes it will get so bad\nNow I I'm not ready to go to that point yet but things can fall apart in a hurry I and you know thirty to thirty eight million I don't know what the number is it's more than I've ever seen or will see a is ... is a significant amount of money to get rid of it\nYou to believe that will happen but I've covered SEC football a long time I've seen ... happens in crazier things but I've seen some crazy things we're up against the
