just with pat right Jeff Francis and gentle she's got a bounce back pat after a difficult and I would say disappointing loss to South Carolina\nYeah a very disappointing loss to South Carolina started again look pretty good uh op ed is really played pretty good football for most of the game uh especially in the first half in early in the third quarter look pretty strong a\nDefense is where they really falter day just\n... the last drive of the of the first half and beyond they just ran through Tennessee like a knife through hot butter butter knife through butter\nYeah whatever they said oh we got the idea yeah I went through an easy yeah you kind of feel like you know we talked all bring we had a chance to who stole a game and we felt like you let one go there um I think that the game changed for me\nAnd I give South Carolina ... they had a week off ... again change when they came up second half of what to tide in\nIt for whatever reason it just felt like we did not have an answer for that\nYou wonder you know I'm I'm speculate I don't know but you know got like Abernathy factors play a lot of good of you kind of solve some of that back there a lot of guys up\nIt didn't seem to have an answer for that it seemed like when they started run the ball a little bit because their quarterback where he all of a sudden he he kept on made a play he kinda got himself into the game and uh it just it just was not good\nYou know Bentley seemed to struggle a bet he he doesn't look like the same quarter back we saw in two years ago\nAnd it seemed like to me they were gonna try and maybe take some of the load off ventilate and see if they could run the ball\nSailed tendencies and reacting when they had success run on the ball they just kept doing it but you know they haven't run the ball very well know at all no they were seeing run it and so what's that say and they struggled struggled to stop Iran too so yeah yes we random ...\nGood it really well I saw a running back playground thought Chandler and Tim Jordan I thought they ran really hard for me that was a bright spot in our current Tom played well too but I thought of running back to play really well\nYou know it's interesting to me too they brought to Carlin feels me in off year the secondary you had a couple of package foreign best and most of the planes he ran worthwhile\nYou know what's interesting is you know he hasn't been involved with the often it's all year long yeah so he probably\nI mean it's a new audience I mean he knew some of them in the spring maybe I don't know we prided no much they probably had a package for in flight pack they call to network and going and they got to be good for him I I'm really glad happy to see him as it says after moving like that\nAnd you know Tennessee fans have been critical play calling and all except for this game I think everyone thought that health has best game but you know it just goes to show you I mean if you can run the football you can call and good place I mean if you are on the ball it just opens up things so much for you and I think that's kind of what you saw ... percent of\nThe yeah and uh they're it's a lot easier on third down into three than it is they're down in\nEight or nine or what we talked about that in the pre game show we knew we we knew that if\nWe were in third long all day long that it just wouldn't feel happy day\nA question for you guys I Wonder\nYou know the question should've Germany German Pruitt pick the feel go there and for for who your thoughts\nI thought into the wind it would've been a bit risky but you know some ... got a pretty strong leg but um [noise]\nIf they would have made they throw will be a whole or in may catch then that would have\nTaken it a penalty mentally heard is that yeah I recently and when when it first happened and I'm going you got to kick feel guilty I got to kick to feel go I did not take into account wind direction\nOr how strongly I when I was the other way around I didn't think of ... I was like I don't think a field goal was any way going to win that game I was like you got to go for the whole way in fact ... ten yards turn nine yards whatever it was set up but the way we were playing I'm like you know I felt like I felt like we're going to get it\nActually thought we won the game when we tell them to their game winning feel I thought my you know we gotta yeah you know we help will feel go though that's kind of way that game\nWas yes because Tennessee uh put together a bunch of ten play driving when they did the ball most than I had success hadn't turned the ball over you go down there if you don't score you kick a field goal and yet overtime and you just have the feeling at least and I'm like you I had the feeling they're going to drive down there and do something positive\nHope for a quarter I was like field goal to the team to kick steel goes to lose a team that yeah I felt like a field goal was to stop that he\nWas points so yeah I Know I get it I mean ... obviously you'd like to know what I was a cowboy drop their job so you know he made so many great play them on ... down the cotton balls and I mean turning my field and made guys miss and made so many first dance\nAnd they're probably drops one of the easiest fastest that he had on even ...

it's a much to improve football team and they've got to God's got six interceptions on their defense so they've got some turnovers\nMaybe just don't do it towards them and we'll be okay that's a good football yeah obviously they look like they're trying to\nProtect themselves out of the the bottom of that half the league and looks like they're on the way a little bit\nTighter and got involved in the office on Saturday presented to you I Will cut us first I\nDid and it was it was pretty it was a pretty boy went up by\nMen and I get here in town and made a really nice throw their I'm\nHappy to see you eat a lot will catch it and keep it\nYou know but the other thing\nThe tide in especially when a dominant what Anderson got banged up tied in kind of been missing from the passing game the last several weeks [laughter]\nI think it really has I think it's something I don't know if they if the tide in is really\nIn their plans that much in the past game it's hard to tell I think it should be I think I think I think\nWhat Anderson is a guy that could be really special for you I think he's gotta\nCatch a lot of balls it seems like the the tight end and then we were there and so I agree but the the fallback spot to depend a lot of pull back from Michael mentioned\n... fit in I think the formation\nOf that whole back out here it's a lay off and uh so anyhow that they ... but it's a ... yeah\nThey threw the ball from the middle of the field but the sideline a law that didn't go down metal didn't take many long shot you know\n... and ... it's the here which they got Gary Taubes played really well but at the same time there's like there's some girls that he had like you know for kind of the kind of easy throws out there just kind of like a little out of the girls\nI'm like I Know he would love to have backed you'd probably get even higher percentage of what coach Bruce yeah to you know there are several throw the I I thought he played right well I think I think the I think the emphasis this week\nWould get the ball out of your hand I'll tell you what he did a really nice job on some of those bubbles screens and people don't really I notice this stuff that you know\nTo throw bubble screen those things they're not as easy as everything but man when you hit him in stride making like a hand up I thought he did a great job with his accuracy our nose and when you know when the guys out there in space and he's got to like reach back for\nAll of a sudden he's not nearly as good a runner but if you get them in stride he's a better I thought here in town of ... you got to put it on them where they can make a play or a you know in that in front of a war they can get going north and south\nBut the law walls got his first touchdown grab has a tendency volunteers ... which great clip great player interview present or by great clubs it's going to be great and we spoke with ... getting his first touchdown catches it tells you volunteer\nYou know what thrill for you to get your first touchdown and catch a Tennessee talk about the play and get in the end zone finals\nIt's on the line backers kind of stuck him up think run and then a snack around the back of 'em and Garrett delivered a great ball there for the touchdown it's amazing I Know you work so hard to finally get that first touchdown I just exciting time for it it was exciting but you know celebrate for thirty seconds then it's on an extra so\nTalk about your seasons so far all how do you think you've played how do you think you're I Know you're adjusting to a new system and\nBe more of a block or and all those type of things is I've been a tough adjustment for uh the coaches have done a great job of a help me out through the adjustment and I can always do things better and I got to keep track of my skills and um but as as far as the season you know I'm I'm just on everything I can to get better every week\nTo talk about your out running of those things are getting better than is another some really worked on and catching the bowl\nI'm yeah route running as part of it right now my main focus as a being a dependable blocker and you know I'm not in the past rushed guitar quarterback so\nI'm ... fun and you know that's what shows up in the paper the ... games as you know are there in the trenches in a lot of people don't realize the tide and has to block so much I mean every time you were to you really can do or\nA pulley redoing counter blocks or you're trying to pick off somebody yeah yeah titan titan especially in our off into such a sponsor for a lot of blocks um you know whether it's past pro\nVersus you know coming around counter a lead we use a fall back and I'm not play that some so\nTied in position as as very versatile and assault fence and I know that you are right now the stakes really hurt against South Carolina and that's you guys have been talking about that but you still got to clean it up don't shoot yeah well we again we beat ourselves in South Carolina is a great football team but we are\nReally shut ourselves in the foot today and we got to work on her and are self discipline sometimes and then those penalties specially I'm Down in short just break your back yeah you know penalties present penalties or\nHe it's it's hard to sustain a drive when you do that to yourself and we'd that way too much to\nAll right big month of November coming up and you guys know what's a what's at stake in November yeah so in November ah we've gotta we've gotta finish our our seasons strong\nAh we've got plenty of SEC opponents that or you know really good teams coming up so we gotta we gotta finish strong or give us a quick update on your brother how's he doing in the ... uh or find out Monday is going to he's going into Green Bay so hopefully some exciting news what does he learned about this experience than I used in the titans came for a long time and see\nTalked to were told you anything about the\nThe rigors of the NFL and all and he said to the fences are very complex but you know he's a smart guy so I trust you'll\nGet it that's a great clip great player interview Eli Wallach save time with online chicken a great clip skip the app or go to great clips dot com so a little news they're hoping that eats and I had a good try out today with the Green Bay Packers and maybe and makes the club those uh uh\nYou guys been through the NFL Experience it's kind of nerve wracking and trying to figure out where you fit in and trying to find a home in the NFL sometimes tough yeah it's awful nerve wracking it's a you know it's it's a week to week job it's your life it's not college\nA graduate seniors that had been at Miami but he got hurt hurt his hamstring in camp and then Chris rentals who was a red shirt freshman or had never really taken many snaps with the first or second season before ... all of a sudden was given the job as a starting quarterback\nAnd he really exceeded expectations he was fantastic played in six games I'm kind of another size got five ten but led the niners are to some really good wins earlier in the season and then after Kentucky game\nEvery weeks ago the first try to start the second half um he went on to run and as you hit the ground somebody fell out of one of the line but Delauter and broke his ankle so he had surgery and he's done for the year and that meant evidence of suicide only gotten healthy ... week\nI'm ... now the quarterback and he he finished that drive they scored repeat western Kentucky I'm\nHad you know some ups and downs against middle Tennessee a couple of weeks ago which was his first ever starts in high school\nAnd then came back last week um and really quite a good beginning southern miss it and we got to win\nSo he's our quarter back right now has San clue kind of a wild cat that situation for him he'll come in played three or four plays and did some really nice things had a touchdown against a southern missed this last weekend big fourteen you are running a third downplay he bought a player but sheriff starting quarterback\nAmid tell us what what what style off into we gonna see this next weekend [noise]\nWhat are we looking at how\nYou said ... and I back or is it why didn't wide open\nAnd not so much wider they'll they'll Benny may as our top Ronnie back ah ill lined up the ... the eyeball the quarterback a sheriff's will sometimes go on to center\nProbably sixty forty out of a shot gun but they want to run at first they can run the place and fifty of them be runs they'd be happy fifty fifty five the recipe it throws 'em all depends on the game goes but they want to run at first\nAbout defense you mentioned that your been really good stuff in the run who send the guys with the tendency to look for in the deepest the side of the ball\nIn really good up front for as a but it's been our linebacker plastic that's been fantastic uh Jeff gamble right now is a leading tackle or red shirt junior back you look at most of the guys on the defense um\nA lot of juniors and younger this a couple of ... big one he came to campus as a wide receiver and after a couple of years they put them on the defensive side of the ball and ball here\nAnd back it was more of a hybrid kind of position they'll drop of backing coverage they'll bring them up um again he's just been like a ball hog he's just he's on the ball and new defensive coordinator Glenn Spencer this year and he has really focused on\nOn stop on the run and these guys have really bought into it [noise] Alex high Smith up front has had a fantastic season form a walk on 'em and how the guy just making big plays honors\nAnd ... who's a true junior more land or Florida\nUm get Fifteen tackled this last week had an interception he's playing at a high level we've had a few injuries I'm In the secondary but right now the feast lion who's a plane back there has really last three weeks stepped up his play\nAh so you know each week they seem to be getting that arise out as a young program actually that's what you want to see\nIt curious just the makeup of team we we're we're I mean were they develop the kind of you know a lot of tennis events not permitted conference usa were they kind of develop their niche recruiting and ... and what's the makeup of the the kind of the guys that they are detracting [noise]\nYou know they want to hit the Carolinas first first and foremost got a lot of players and north and South Carolina down the Charlotte area itself is is really rich and salad and we're going up against the schools and the ACC close east Carolina an app state as well a lot of kids from the Georgia I'm Virginia areas\nI'm ... and it's just a ... year the F. B. S. level so when they started the program\nYou look at a guy like Larry Hogan job will be out playing really well Cleveland Browns use our first\nGuest star to come out and make it up the next level but he was a guy coming out of high school in Greensboro that had one offer ferman in Charlotte and it took Charlotte and he's the kind of guy that at first you know we had a lot of guys that\nI wanted to stay close to home and and play football but as soon as we started the program that's been conference usa had at the invitation to come to the F. B. S. level we weren't going to do that for quite a while and they accepted it so it kind of wrap things up in the street for years\nWere playing with guys that were recruited to plant the F\nYeah that that's interesting\nSo now you know we're starting to see those guys we've had some success in opening up semis around them to recruiting game an embassy in some you know more talented players come in\nBut it's a process and we're not there yet but we're getting better\n[noise] you know of where does the you I'm sure the football program fit in and the landscape there in Charlotte when you look at you got the Panthers you got a NASCAR you've got to the horn it's uh you've got the Charlotte basketball team which is really popular so where does football ... and all of this now\nYou know there was a lot of excitement at first there'll be honest and it was a grassroots effort to get this program started for a long time\nYou know the students and the alumni we're watching football but never really got off its feet and when it first was announced it was a lot of excitement but as you know in a town like this it's a pro town\nAnd sometimes you know it can be a front running to be one of the Panthers are playing well if they're not you see a fall off in their attendance in the horn is the same way and unfortunately\nIt kind of seen some of that already and just six years\nWhen we weren't winning and mostly not when I get home I'm the crowds you know haven't been as big as they should have been I probably should the fact one of the local writers this last week said something about that\nUm but for the first time for winning at home all for for Windsor here at\nHome at ... stadium so as fans come out they can leave and be happy about what they saw and I think is the program grossly strikes a win more you'll see\nThe director might feel and he's really embrace Charlotte school as being Charlotte ... and and you know being in Knoxville you guys have the market right there there's other schools of course Memphis and and ... that's that's your city that you're\nHere were part of the Panthers that are just you know fan but they have this one at the gals I'm not on it and got AAA hockey or the checkers AAA baseball to Charlotte diets\nBut on Saturdays were still battling North Carolina and state do Wake Forest is girl out of state so we're trying to find our niche\nIt's still a young school founded in the Nineteen forties don't have that really deep alumni or years back going back you know a hundred hundred and Twenty years yet so it's a process but I I Know what's going to get better\nWay it's been better this year with the big four wins and our chance to take on a tendency on Saturday Matthew thanks for being with us tonight was he a Saturday and the press box\nLooking forward to a guy thing okay science math map to swear who is the play by play voice of uh the Charlotte forty niners with us here on the big\nOrange shot above my were men are just looking at something that is what you're talking to me\nAnd I'm not saying me tendency should if they do what they're supposed to but was it better be ready to play I mean you know team that can stop it given up a nine yards a game rushing mhm anybody can stop the run it gives you a chance and if they can run the ball a little bit we haven't been great stop there on um\nYou know you just you just don't want to let them hang around\nWell and they played you know ap state and they played on the menu at the age of ... ... you know and now southern miss so they were\nThey beat southern miss did they did they beat westerns can tell ya yeah those those are two good football yeah given all the programs salad programs they they lost a close game that middle Tennessee which always you can score a lot of points so\nUh it's not something that we can just it's not I mean you can't just walk out there through your jacket there and say it would have jocks anymore but still your helmet out there [laughter] yeah so you're handling that they're just you know we're getting away we at the point\nTo slip by there yet but nobody they liked it but I think people need to understand the\nDifferent level football that this is going to be a much better team than say if you if you I mean they didn't say yes yes oh Utah yes in hats off my buddy Randy center he's got them going he does he does that they've wanted to check this out with your dog named ... ...

the lane the conflict in Afghanistan\nIn my lane the I'm going to stretch back at least a hundred and fifty years Afghanistan has resisted and repelled empire after empire\nAnd then it might be that the United states is going to be on that long list written in stone somewhere in a wasteland we've forgotten to find a bill real Joe and Tom Johnson the foundation for the defense of democracy or here\nThey keep the long war journal and we begin with what we know about the assassin who struck at Kandahar as police chief and killed him general rosy we also know now this attack wounded Americans including an American senior officer\nBill a very good evening to you what do we know about the shooter at the ... attack in Kandahar where did he come from does this look like an al ... trained outfit or not Taliban ... outfit and is there a difference good evening to\nGood evening John yet to answer your second question there isn't much of a difference in the Taliban operate hand in hand we believe they train together we know they fight together on the battlefield or the assassin who killed general secrecy could arguably the most powerful\nFigure in was argument for the most powerful figure in southern Afghanistan certainly in Kandahar Province a key provinces in the country the birthplace of the Taliban\nSo I'm with the Taliban did was they infiltrated is a fascinating notice up to China and he became a bodyguard for the governor of Kandahar who was also seriously wounded in this attack\nAnd a vehicle trade empty the Taliban released a video of him speaking\nOf talking about fighting the Afghan government and with interspersed in this video is him training at a Taliban training camp and is your listeners know we talk about these Taliban camps all the time they're often ridiculed by them saying\nYou know the training is Mickey Mouse or whatnot\nBut when we you know when you have an attack of this level of sophistication that are almost killed general Miller that will get a senior general Gerald being the commander friendly forces or U.S forces in Afghanistan\nAnd we we can't dismiss what we what we see on these videotapes the Taliban are preparing for the U.S departure and they're going to go at the Afghan government full tilt when the U.S has got\nThe logic of this attack bill is that it could have gone forward and any moment and that they chose the Taliban chose to launch the attack when these senior American officer was president I guess at that point that guarantees that it makes it into a global news\nAbsolutely so yes I mean I I Would guess that the generals who was the chief of police in Kandahar he probably was one of the two prime targets but this attack appears to be well planned\nTime it's because we care especially if you know\nYou

this morning\nHe did in the morning news talk Ninety four point one [noise]\nI'm John ... some of the foundation for the defense of democracy they are senior fellows they keep a long war journal which is an excellent way to watch the transformation of Afghanistan in the coming months and years\nThe U.S has been bogged down in a combat that is very typical summarize since the attack on New York and Washington within a month but here we are asking ourselves how is the Taliban doing as it advances district after district\nBill you have a a report\nThat how the Afghan population lives in districts that are no longer in government control that he is a way of talking about how ineffective the central government is in ... uh in alliance with the U.S and our allies are partners they're\nA articulate a little more what does that mean they're outside of government control what does it mean for their lives and for the future good evening again\nGetting job yet at first to break down the numbers we we we estimate that nine percent\nOf the population lives in areas that are controlled by the Taliban and another forty one percent are living in areas that are contested by the Taliban and tested may mean a certain percentage is controlled by the Taliban and certain percentage control by the Afghan government these are typically the districts that where most of the fighting occurs\nBecause this is where the Taliban and the Afghan military or going head to head off what would it be like for that we want to be a wouldn't be very clear we can't say that the Taliban or you know in a contest that area that that is we kind of consider a no go zone\n'em again this is this this will be the most difficult probably even more difficult than in ... in areas under\nTaliban control um areas under Taliban control you're going to get their harsh version or sharia you know whipping and you know they they're all the craziness of their Islamic law that we've seen over the last several decades\nI'm In the areas that are contested\nUm you know you could be living in a town that's in in a contest that area that may be under government control or influence\nAnd the next town over as is Alvin control there is often a lot of fighting in between these areas you're ... if you were living in one of those areas that might be government control\nYou're fearful that the Taliban could be coming next the next day that the Taliban are coming to tax you that the Taliban to come to do all of those horrible things as a fellow man does and you know we're trying to show people here is\nLooked at the situation in Afghanistan as far more dire than the U.S military the U.S government is trying to tell us they're trying to paper over the situation so they can cut a peace deal with the Taliban but the numbers\nWhen we analyze the situation we can't come to any other any\nLet me underline that bill the President Trump made a speech I Believe it was the spring of Seventeen talking about his commitment to Afghanistan and\nThat time we believe they were going to extend their ... extend the deployment us troops and our allies in Afghanistan does it to look that way given these retreats\nNo if it does and what happened is you know the president said we're gonna we're gonna make the Taliban were to beat them to the negotiating table by eating them into submission to the negotiating table instead were beating them as in running quickly to it says it within six months they they basically dropped\nThe idea that we can cause a military defeat the Taliban and just decided to do negotiations um by all the indication Trump wants out of Afghanistan before the next election next presidential election\nI just think if that's the U.S policy we need to be very clear about what is going to happen to Afghanistan when the U.S leaves\nYou have a map long war journal I recommend everybody go to the map you get it right away they break it down into government control contested Taliban control and unconfirmed mobile\nAnd it very much looks like they're surrounding the mountainous center of the country I see them particularly dominating the area around ... is that the way to read this man\nYeah that is I mean the Taliban controlling test numerous districts\nIn the province just south and east and north of the capital and I said look if the if the if the U.S wants to cut a peace deal with the Taliban\nLet's let's say the Taliban you know decided hey we'll make some agreement as soon as U.S forces are gone the Taliban are going to turn on the Afghan government they said they won't share power and I think when you look at the geography and you look at this map and see who holds the upper hand here in Afghanistan\nYeah uh and it's not just around Capitol certainly dominated around Kandahar which is the main uh trade route and also smuggling room from Pakistan and the Baluch area\nAnd then all along the Iran border look at that they'll all around Iraq all contested by the Taliban has a lot\nOf effort in the west and even shocking is the north in the areas that you know really ... the former northern alliance strongholds areas are confessed that it's it's very concerning when you look at this and it hasn't changed for the last year was the Afghan military has not been able to be back into\nTime I want to go back to Iran because we talked about Iran working with the Taliban does that does that leave out al ... or is al ... an agent some in some fashion about around the Taliban relationship well\nTwo things were quick John you just picked up on something that's very important which you noticed that the the territory along the Iranian border and part of the explanation for that is that Iran according to multiple pieces of evidence now it's actually hosting tall blond training camps are sending fighters into western Afghans takeover that turf\nAnd part of what you've seen these ... these nations that came out last week we were talking about the first segment is that Iran is actually even given the orders of Taliban commanders and some of the in some instances according to the U.S Treasury Department this is very\nInteresting in a in an amazing development the EU has already see that are ... with the Taliban in these operations but it does involve okay that answer your question because of course the top armies closely allied with al ... and then I'll kind of has its own agreement with Iran that allows 'em a kind of fighters to sort of trends that Iranian territory they move funds communications\nAnd other sort of vital assistance through Ryan territory in a kite is embedded in the Taliban insurgency so they are also deeply involving\nCentcom becomes is Tom when they put out releases about uh the Taliban working so closely with al ... did they talk about Iran caught it and the Taliban the trail\nYou know very rarely will you see anything like that they the mill US military is not exactly forthcoming with Dr information was going on it's left off the to connect the dots and also other departments of the U.S government queen U.S Treasury department US state

navy the Chinese feel embolden and that was the lesson of letting them takeover Scarborough Shoal so you know the point is\nChina will get aggressive when you show strength China will get aggressive when you don't show strength the problem is the nature of the Chinese regime\nAnd as much as we'd like to think that we can sort of engaged China and that we can have happy outcomes\nI'm not so sure that we can you know what we can do is just try to contain China and hope that we can deter it you can't deter with weakness and unfortunately that has been the foreign policy choice of a series of presidents Republicans and Democrats and that's the reason why Trump is in such a very difficult position right now\nAnd that no matter what he does is going to be in some sense dangerous Saturdays\nThe procedural safeguards on on the president for licensed communist China is there is just the nature of the regimes this was found to happen isn't it\nI think that is that it was bound to happen of course is one of those things that you can never test 'cause you can't devise an experiment\nBut the point is your first your first statement was absolutely correct there's nothing there's nothing that the United states or any of outside power can do to ... institutionalize the Communist Party that's something that the party has to do itself\nAnd we're just in no position to influence that debate inside China\nIs this being driven by the terrorists to be the trade dispute is this being driven by the fact that Xi Jinping sees the window closing for strength because his economy is weakening into Nineteen\n[noise] you know that it's an aggravating factor John but it's something we had to do anyway because we couldn't allow the Chinese to steal hundreds of billions of dollars of us intellectual property\nThe Chinese economy was weakening already what the trade dispute did was to accelerate certain trends and certainly what we saw for instance just a few hours ago you know the Chinese currency is flirting very dangerous lead to the seven um UN to one dollar to us\nTo one dollar mark and in the black market John you cannot get seven to one you get something like eight\nTo ... I saw that that mean that that sounded like panic garden\nIt it sounds like panic especially because if you did this year ago you would have a one point five percent transaction feel the black market today that transaction fees five percent five percent John\nThat is a garden there is no way really the only alternative is further west the United states to pop up the Chinese economy has a very time they're stealing technology they're putting in barriers against free trade and blaze\nAnd basically being ... until his country and they will still continue to put forward threats such as we've heard correct\nYeah I I think so if that is in a situation where you've got an hardline state you know China's moving from authoritarianism to totalitarianism you've got a leader who is in secure who is got great ideas like Mao Saddam\nThere there are no good solutions they're they're innocent nothing that outsiders really can do except to try to contain and deter apart from that um we are plus too you know we're ... we're we're just witnesses watching a slow motion and sometimes a quick motion tragedy in China\nOne more detail garden about these threats from she and why way are they sitting at a tone I seen for everybody else as they speak around the world are we going to see this kind of bellicose\nTantrum from every trade representative every diplomat are they all on a leash now does speak poorly of the United states and Europe\nI think that uh the tone and see jumping is set really means that every official is going to be really difficult to foreigners because\nI'm to actually have a nuanced conversation or a friendly conversation with an American or somebody else\nIs very very difficult in these circumstances especially when you also consider that the jumping is tightening down control internally so you put all this together and it it just shows that China is going in directions which are extremely disturbing and the best that we can do is just pay attention to this because if we don't pay attention John\nI'm the worst outcomes will almost certainly occur\nThat is one more question how quickly does the rest of the world seem to understand us finally\nI don't think so that is I think we're coming around to a better understanding of China but we are\nWhich are getting worse really by one of the day but certainly by the week\nIs Caitlin towel Mitch garden that's who wrote the piece in foreign affairs which I recommend do everybody Caitlin is an associate professor of\nCaitlin television associate professor of security studies at the Edmund a wall school of foreign service at Georgetown ... essay in foreign affairs is adapted from what China go nuclear assessing the risk of Chinese nuclear escalation in a conventional war with the United states\nInternational security spring twenty Seventeen and the short answer is yes\nYes no I Know where they will go nuclear because\nThey do not have the forces that Russia managed over Seventy years to offset the U.S forces\nThere's just an asymmetrical confrontation led by an unstable leadership without legitimacy and a man who's making flat right now against the United states of America and declares himself president for life if that doesn't sound like a thriller first chapter what does I'm John bachelor with Thaddeus McCotter and Gordon jak\n[noise]\nThe Russians have hacked our elections are infrastructure our government secrets owned a random survey pillow now or hackers John bachelor the ... all notions of what a\nDeadly by looks like in bite\nFormer intelligence agent Eric Anderson page turning new thriller the tables are turned in big power cyberwarfare Eric ... new novel from done books as bite B.

there's much more to say and we're not addressing it in terms of the vote next week but the blow to the nation or the very hard blow on attack on a synagogue innocent people shot\nWe're told and the allegation is against a man who as at this point appeared in court he used to be charged with hate crime I don't know what else is going ahead but their federal crimes here\nAre the puzzle David for me is that this has been a threat routinely against religious Jewish religious organizations in Europe\nThe surprise was that it comes to America that the nation where the Jewish people have enjoyed the success of these last century's is the one that struck most profoundly by a shooter good evening to you David\nShot because it's the type of attack that we feel like we hear of overseas weather in

Semitic massacre occurred like it did and in the synagogue in Pittsburgh\nIt seems to magnify everything I also think is because I'm In part a we're at a point in in American history where the

marching marching the latest news is that more than five thousand military personnel are headed to the border in various stages\nTexas Arizona New Mexico California\nThe news from Central America and from Mexico is that\nThere are there maybe two or more caravans marching young men we see video now that some of them are violent as you can understand in that heat with very little prospect of six test leaving their homes and marching north for unclear purposes [noise]\nAh ... the first caravan is now about four thousand according to the latest grows and shrinks to reach the U.S border perhaps around the time of the election so gentleman the polls are moving by who can tell David I start with you is the caravan\nA story about the poll or is this split screen\nElection\nI think it's a split screen election in part because where I think kind of back to where we were at the beginning of summer which is a house that it's poised for them to the Democrats may not but I think it's ... it's sort of headed there and the Senate that it's not going to and you have two different battleground cheer you up in\nA suburban or next door to the battleground where Indians of Trump or\nAre mixed at best a very poor and voters interested in making changes for all sorts of reasons and then in the Senate\nA bunch of red states where Republicans are poised to not only keep their majority but adds to it\nAnd so I think things like the caravan may be a helpful in the Senate races where we know the Kavanaugh episode woke up a complacent Republican electorate and got an energized and and the caravan of certainly not going to be on your helpful\nUm and it may be helpful in some of these races although I don't know if Republicans need much more help\nIn the Senate races at this point I don't think it's going to\nBe that determine it is if at all in the house and I think part of that as they are now so many competing issues are that are helpful to Democrats or helpful in terms of where they're going to steer independence and then I think they're going to overtake the care of an issue but in part it's just because we have two different battle\nOr Mitch fund the Trump voters in twenty sixteen were not routinely people that the Republican Party counted on for voting I'm being very diplomatic wandering around this story are they going to turn out is there an issue they care about or did they wait for twenty\nI spoke tonight with John McLaughlin a Republican pollster who says the most important issue next Tuesday will be does the Trump voter turnout\nAnd that's why Trump is so assiduously going to Trump centers in Fifteen twenty states are running six rallies between now and the election trying to get out the vote or he's not going to any counties were he was closer lost to Hillary\nWe will know that and I'm I suspect them the whole thing about the caravan is about driving up the Trump vote saying that you know on President but do no time for relaxation the country is still in danger and that's why Trump uses such Marshall language even the tone that would seem inappropriate after Pittsburgh\nHe's trying to basically say we're still in a war footing which means we have to demand sacrifices from you go vote\nThat is you have a question a gentleman we're talking you know obviously it's a mid term it's a base election both sides want to turn their supporters out are you seeing any single issue that is really swing the independence one way or another\nDavid\nI don't know if we're seeing a single issue I think ultimately Trump is the factor and where Trump can be helpful in John mentioned where he's going to be traveling\nTrump is helping to turn out his base and what we're seeing unlike a year ago is very little separation between the Trump base in the standard Republican base and there's little separation between the Trump base in the Republican incumbent who Trump didn't always get along with but does at the moment\nI think in the house it's working against Republicans by and large you just have so much energy and money even where Republican enthusiasm has picked up\nUm they're still fighting across such a big Plainfield it's become so why that even today the Republican House campaign committee ... advertising in Charleston South Carolina in a district\nThat are elected Tim Scott a few years ago and really shouldn't be a problem for the Republicans but it all I did say they're just so many house\nDistricts that are competing for because of all this anger and ain't that has been motivated by a a rejection of Trump but that's what's making it very hard for for Republicans in terms of the house fight John\nYou know the first billionaire president ever elected\nHas apparently encourage lots of other billionaires to go take

by the way Democrats by the way no longer complaining about Citizens United you'll notice these super PACs and these billionaires are dominating the playing field financially in this election or the Citizens United has not benefiting the Democrats about the Republicans\nAnd John as six million dollars from Bloomberg uh one district in one district because he wants to house that's it\nHe wants credit for turning the house he wants to read it for carrying certain districts he wants to establish his bona fide he's as a Democrat\nYou saw him as a Clinton teased as to get a job today\nWell if

met today this was a non binding resolution some when people read it shouldn't\nJump to too much uh but they are essentially trying to say that Oslo has run its course that they were supposed to be an interim recognition of Israel and to the Palestinian state was established that was an established because the Palestinians have allowed it to be established had been negotiated\nTo they're talking about cutting security tides and economic ties based on the\nThing to Ninety four Paris economic and political and or if this goes back and get actually voted on as a binding measure\nThat will be

more\nThat is American the prime minister of Israel made a trip to Oman would go to great\nThere's a very important a very positive and because they allow that to be publicized even more and now they talk about it and they said that you know this whole home reaction in the Arab world to it tells you you know some of the change that has taken place\nAnd maybe the basis for further engagement that I don't know what a month economic and other ties will be but certainly it's a he has tried to the ruler of a month to bring the Israelis and Palestinians gather\nA and we'll see whether that plays out the the other big measure was today in Abu Dhabi where the Israelis won the gold medal in the in the judo in the in the classroom judo and I'm at the grand slam that's being held there and they played for that\nIn them and the Israeli was recognized that Israeli flag on his uniform that was a minister from Israel there\nThey got around to a big round of applause from the audience and attendance\nAt

I'm not aware of such a group or are you\nAware of any group or organized group I Do know that law enforcement agencies and federal agencies to patrol the Internet\nDo these mental or resources allow\n... that's correct and they also depend on people like your caller if they were looking through the Internet and saw something suspicious to call it and\nI I Would note a distinction and the two cases we're talking about is the this is my language not anybody else's but in the case of the pipe bombs we seem to be talking about a total whack job and in the case of the Pittsburgh shootings were about\nA a a very dedicated true believer or two entirely different kinds of cases\nIn two different types of individuals you're absolutely right\nI'd be thoughts about the best way to approach either one\nWell I mean I think that if we talk about say Iraq the Florida bombing suspect\nYou you're talking about a very good law enforcement investigation that brought him into custody within days of his first bomb being delivered to George Soros and the amount of work that the NYPD\nThe joint terrorism task force the FBI put into it to be able to bring it to such a conclusion to come up with the print\nTo run the print determine where he was by licenses and then put it out in plate readers it was a plate reader that saw his cargo by that alerted officers to allow the FBI in swat and everyone else to move in the following morning you know\nWe have a call from mark in Huntsville, Alabama next to the evening mark\nHi Jim how you doing tonight in mind that you\nWrite well damn I'm I'm a little bit a disturbed and appalled now uh as I told your are your your your check in person you know that I'm an American black first I'm an American second on black\nWhat disturbs me Jim is this piece women side that synagogue or my marriage\nAnd he went in there and kill them\nNow the part that really disturbs me about this whole thing is why do they have life on the table I hear live well he's going to be executed note there should be no light\nHe killed my American Jewish brothers and sisters only think spill on the table is do we kill him today tomorrow or next week oh I should not be on the table\nAll right ah and certainly I understand obviously the motivation put forward by Mark Thomas Ross can or for the record I happen to believe that the death penalty has a place in American Justice of many others of course do not your your thoughts about that\nI think the only story that police didn't kill him in the shootout that day\nAnd I agree with war that the U.S or is he is tried and convicted which is right in this country because we don't want to give up the rights of of of trial by your peers if he is convicted than I think he should face the death penalty\nAnd something to be added to that we have a case of what I called stupid lawyer Driggs in this country past a certain number of appeals in a certain period of time you are playing games\nWith people on death row and I would argue that keeping people on death row perennially is in itself a form of cruel and unusual punishment I think there needs to be a limit or just comedy stupid while you're ... you could pull there aren't that many ways in which\nReversible error and that and other bases legitimate bases\nFor appeals can be made beyond that then finish the sentence in my ... my view your thoughts\nI totally agree I Believe that a certain point in time you see your\nRight to appeal if you can be been convicted a case like this this is very good evidence that he was the one who committed the crime that he was caught at the scene and if he's convicted should be put to death you know\nI got about twenty seconds you tell us what you do at the sea and be protective\nAh we are a full service private investigation and high level security firm based in New York but work throughout the country\nVery good please stay on the line we'll speak briefly ...

that is the state of the world that we live in right now unfortunately so to blame it on some onions and political office that's just kind of a cop out in my opinion\nI Would agree with you completely and it's really unfair to blame these incidents on the president\nBut it I think is fair to say that the president sets themselves up as an easy target for criticism sometimes maybe not maybe not fair criticism but as an easy target\nA and he could avoid some of that if you would would simply go about the about doing so let me ask you a doctor bench than about the state\nOf a mental health care and

people are following a lot of what is set the tone of it's being set by all these politicians and you know during the Obama administration and there was a lot of it's not the way we are it's the right thing however he felt was the way the entire nation was to feel\nThat there's no doubt about the fact that politicians are not as responsible as they ought to be I'll do many of them are frankly in the business of trying to stay in office they feel the way to do that used to not commit to anything to avoid confrontation\nAnd a commitment and uh that is probably the most compelling reason for for

front page of the communications act to thirty four\nI think the Internet has become a a a place that people gather with like minded individuals and it's just like dogs two and a bone and they just keep going around and around and you don't hear different points of view I mean you probably got one of the last national talk shows that somebody can call in and talk on and\nHere's some different Amos I think the video games that I see are extremely violent\nAnd um we repealed the fairness doctrine so I just think that there's so much anger and hate I mean I I Can't believe that I held park prison events one mile from where this individual lived\nUh it's just it's just unbelievable and I just wish people would stop thinking about politics for a while\nAnd just keep thinking the fact that these eleven people died and something has to be done\n[noise] I I Would agree are on one point that you made Ken and that is that we do in fact spin a bar too much time talking only to like minded people\nUh most people today are spend their time with like minded people in person or on line on social media and ah that does tend to create an echo chamber and I agree with you\nThe fairness doctrine a is a great way to see to it that the multiple voices are in fact shut down or the fairness doctrine ... it was a terrible idea and we're better off because it's no longer here Steven Andrew North Carolina good evening Steve\n... I ... I Hope I can put the style together as as they are but I Believe it's a point that they used to be made it seem like to me and my generation go up there was\nSevere consequences but what you see it if you step outside of the law um\nYes just banned it alive thing you could disrupt\nA places you know that is with or\nNot only where you ... you use things not only legal sanctions but you face societal sanctions people would avoid you you would not be that and welcome at the uh the Rotary Club or a or in class uh and when we do some people like we used to it and frankly that's a shame\nThey afford it\nJust going out getting to the to the fans they just type place but I think the mindset has banned for a good while just like here in North Carolina a big thing was the Taylor and download a

a warning here a ... alert coming up yeah back in mind that being an older fellow I can recall pre air conditioning and we used to sit outside of a summer evening because it was a cool place to sit on the porch and neighbors would be outside and we would just naturally start to converse\nI remember when we got our first air conditioning unit\nIt was awfully comfortable in that house but I Confess at that point oh I I still do the people I had known before but new people moved into the area I was less inclined to know your thoughts\nAnd I don't think that the games are allowed I think that the wisdom advisory I'm so let me give you another one that that's not from my book but this is one from the book but it's the same exact point\nIn the last Seventy years in America the average size of new home construction in the U.S has grown by more than three acts\nMore than three times larger average new home size now compared to the midnight it could be but what are the things we know is that with your house gets larger and you're like get large to get larger the separation from your neighbors gets larger and you end up having fewer of those relationships in your community and so there are places in America where people are thinking a lot\nAbout what do you do to restore that sense of walk ability so that neighbors know each other and rely on each other more\nAnd there is there's a move in some communities again it it feels artificial sometimes ... but one of the things to try to do is move from a big huge back deck like I confessed we have at our house\nTo a front porch which is closer to the proximity what are your neighbors are walking by\nThere is happiness it's correlated with having gone through that shared experience not just of getting to converse with your neighbor 'cause you're not locked up inside your house but frankly having even something in common as boring as the weather on those days when it's really hot and you were sharing that front porch of because you didn't have the air conditioning it was something he went through to gather\nHumans are relational beings we are social animals were not just now I work for we want to do stuff and we want to do stuff in common with other people and a lot of times shared experiences even if they're on the perfect\nOr become the foundation of future character and future bonds even scar tissue or on your on your fourteen year old or on your seven year old is something that becomes a foundational experience for future memory\nNow than the drop in our average lifespan now that's a real physical problem it's not about relationships\nOr at least I don't think it is ... this has been one of the hallmarks of the American existence shura the next generation has better opportunity is higher income or education and they live longer what happened\n[laughter] yeah I actually think it is related to relationships at the national institutes of health now there's an ...\nThere's um that the number one health crisis in America is actually loneliness ten years ago you couldn't find anybody at the national institutes of health that would have told you anything other than obesity as the number one driver of health problems are and and public health expenditure and the U. S. now about Seventy percent\nOf obesity is viewed as a phenomenal of loneliness or is it downstream consequence of loneliness it isn't the case that people get fat and then they lose their friends\nThe people get lonely and then they get fat and so at the near term biggest driver of costs that American health care is obesity is defined as being more than thirty pounds overweight and a a pretty hefty share of American about thirty four percent of folk\nUh R. O. B. most of that is a downstream consequence of loneliness\nOpioid addictions overdoses suicides a whole big range of the new drivers of early mortality are things that seem to be related to not having a lot of social architecture and your life not having a lot of friends not having a lot of community\nNot having membership and a lot of organization this is really new we've had\nPretty good public health data on what people die of\nFour eighty to a hundred years right now and we've only one time in the last six years at even two years is declining like expectancy\nIn Nineteen sixty two Nineteen sixty three that was a flu epidemic that bridge over the calendar year and we had two straight years of declining life expectancy is you're turning Eighteen organizer third consecutive year of declining life expectancy in the U.S\nAnd it is driven overwhelmingly by deaths of despair suicides an addiction and overdose and opioids is one of the the big drivers most all of that is related to decline and community that's not to say there are also\nEconomic consequences but there was an interplay between declining economics in decline and community so bunch of places in America that we think about sort of be industrialized saying you have economic collapse and community collapse working in tandem fewer jobs are less sense of meeting falls shared work with other people\nAnd the declining sense of participation in\nNeighborly association of America and these kind of crisis or or the crises are vicious cycles\nAll right that covers the problem is most of which I think we were vaguely aware of all not not as well outlined certainly as in the book them but the second part of the subtitle why we hate each other and how do you feel what are your solutions [noise]\nGive you a three and four big one's a number one we have to figure out how you put your phone down at the dinner table it sounds too simple so maybe the broader way to say it is we have to figure out what our technology as for\nBecause technology is amazing I'm a nerd about this stuff and I strongly believe the digital revolution will create more economic output in the world has ever known\nHow we're headed toward a place with more high quality low cost stuff than anybody's ever envisioned\nBut just getting more stuff doesn't actually satisfy people it has to be put to use in service of actual relationships and community and right now we we need that there was a guy named Andy crouch who has an interesting book called the ... family and he has a phrase\nA called the need for us to become near near Amish are almost almost Amish and the way we use technology which is our new tools including digital tools like the smartphone\nAre incredibly useful for work but they're probably on that destructive and most of our social lives are so Andy proposes this thing one hour a day one day a week and one way we eat our families need to go through a full technology fast\nNext news in one hour or online news talk Ninety four one dot com\n\nHe's CBS News on the hour sponsored by the recruiter\nHarm Tom photo of your head a victim funerals that will be going on all weekend Pittsburgh [noise]\n\nTwo days after the slaughter at the synagogue the man accused of the massacre appeared in court shackled and in a wheelchair he was formally charged with killing eleven people in what has been called the deadliest attack on Jews in us history Bowers was surrounded by U.S Marshals and only said yes to the judge\nWhen he asked him if he understood the charges against him corresponded\nDavid ...

Democrats and Republicans who commanded respect and actually the civility of decency in the Senate but while I was never a fan of secretary Hagel I feel he's\nVery very much on target here\nPerhaps

which is an emotionally disturbed person somebody who was confused conflicted look was there a partisan aspect to this that's obvious to everyone but I think on it\nYou look at his background you look at the fact that in two thousand and two he ... he made a terroristic threat that he was going to blow up utility company in Florida the fact that he's been arrested for drugs that fraud this guy to

the white supremacist wouldn't have anything to do with them\n\nAnd the seminal probably wouldn't have anything to do with a white supremacist so his his he was confused mixed up uh I like the term emotionally disturbed person you might want to call that insane but [noise]\nYou know people like this what do you do if you know that you're supposed to call the police and say this guy's had

find them in a in a database or something that's a public access the thought of a report from the site is really how they design\nWhich is why when someone has set up a red black which is which is worse\nUm which is worse I mean it is censorship there's no question that censorship so uh if if the police would have if they start scouring gab for example\nA well all the civil rights people would go crazy about that when they say how dare you go through the the people had that as a may ... you don't like but they would but they have the right to do with the government can't stop him and police are government I\nI don't feel that it would be a fringe went up first of All right if it's a public site and it said moderation by each other that up participate in the site\nAnd that that could have been a a method that had been you know if someone had good moral values are reported hey there was a guy that looks like he's going to be going up somebody why why can't we get him you know banned from that site and then otherwise that's a reason for that ...\nWell the problem is a he probably was on a a site that uh were full of Jew haters they they were all neo Nazis and all that sort of stuff they thought it was great so are the same side\nI Can't say that I disagree that like that stuff that group can get out of hand but overall if we don't have this we wouldn't be discussing on on on the network news that hey this guy had a predisposition let them know that\nIf it hadn't been for this that predisposition that otherwise would never expressed well if you hadn't gone to that site\nYou know there's an interesting in a parallel to what you're talking about because the NYPD got in trouble for monitoring mosques they were going to mosques that had radical ... moms and they were looking for people that were being radicalized into gee hottest\nWhile they got in trouble for the government you can't do that you can't go monitor these houses of worship well that would be what they would be doing here they would be monitoring this you know they would be but what can you do you can't the government can't say that you can't make a bad thing ...\n... ... as it started

getting ready for the next\nRight all the family talked about when they came over from Scotland they just did a grandfather and fathers talked about just fighting the British and when the British came here to fight that his dad died before childbirth but the older brother says I'm fighting these guys and then the uh him and he and his brother who is one year older\nAnd they both volunteering to go well you're too young as well be a courier whenever you need so it was a mom and two brothers the other the older brother dies of heat stroke at one of the battles and then he and his brother get captured and put into prison and force him out march like forty miles barefoot into a freezing prison with no clothes\nBasically and then while the go while the British on horseback the mom works out a deal to get the kids out\nBut the older brother dies\nAnd it's just like him and his mother his mother because I had to go around money during the war the mother leaves to go work for a for a relative she dies soon next thing you know Andrew Jackson's an orphan\nHe should've in any other country he's in the scrap and put it in America even then you have an opportunity the town gets together now extended family rallies and he never get to present his entire upbringing it's brutal it's tough\nBut there's a sense that these people saved me\nAnd Andrew Jackson spend the rest of his life bleeding red white and blue hating the British\nAnd loving America and to have a forty one year old major general self taught leader put together an army and three and a half weeks and take out the British in forty five minutes to me that's a story America needs to here\nYeah yeah it was um a a ragtag mix of people to it wasn't like he had professional soldiers that he was able to pull together\nThere were um if I Do remember this part about the war of Eighteen ... of the battle of New Orleans was a ... you got to a ... it's like a story that has to have certain characters they had pirates real pirates he he he he got them to fight with them as well ...\n... feet knew the whole ins and outs of New Orleans and all the canals and all that for a thoroughfares and so the British needed a John Pete and his power to abandon say we're essentially them off the mob on water so\nThey will go and ... and stuff that go into the Caribbean they bring it back they'd open up they pay off the New Orleans officials and they'd open up small biz ours and they they have run of the town of New Orleans\nSo John ... he was approached by the British says well you fight for us I'm going to get rid of all your crime so I'll make an officer they say can we think about it they approached a New Orleans they said we don't want to be British we we've allowed this whole America ideal\nSo how do we do this they go well come with us feels Jackson doesn't like criminals so Jackson's convince he needs you on the ... he says okay so ... provides the gunpowder the knowledge and he provides additional men he put that was pre men of color occasions or Indians\nAmerican Indians who bought with him throughout regular militia as well as Tennessee and Kentucky or a rifleman\nAnd who don't mess because if they miss they didn't eat\nShow who are fighting for their country and they hated the British are people they can take New Orleans was at stake\nWell they were going to take New Orleans even though the treaty of getting resigned and stop America from growing pass in Mississippi we would not have had a westward expansion in Britain was determined to stop us\nThis was their last chance and they lost it because of one man's ability to put together an army and rally for the red white and blue Andrew Jackson\nYeah I think when you hear about the war of Eighteen twelve and the battle of New Orleans particularly was a make or break it for America and it seemed like well it seemed like the the\nYeah I guess on paper but a British apparently during that period from the Seventeen eighties all the way up to Eighteen twenty they they ignored it they just push us around it abused the people and abused or a flood gene government so\nSomebody had to stand up to well\nFor a guy like history you certainly know a time or I Would say this they were radicalizing the American Indian tribes giving them arms are getting them up and they're making the American settlers their enemy\nAnd the we've as we tried to move west with families or they were just they were massacred and interned there was a sense in America we're going to grow we're going to have to let these make these guys had here the treaty that they sign a treaty of Paris had country in the Hartford convention or said we're not fighting the war\nTalking to Brian kill me we're talking about his latest book Andrew Jackson and the

away flames hatred for fans by a president who kept talking about this caravan of ... has that famous Harris\nI'm this is a um [noise] this is a triangulation a lot of people are making this this is sort of doubling down on not just intellectual dishonesty but but just disgusting levels it's scapegoating that the\nPittsburgh synagogue shooter\nWas dumb house bird to action by the president warnings\nThe thousands of people who are\nHeaded our way in order to intentionally violate our borders that a president who is vigilant about that\nSomehow set the stage for this kind of a reaction I mean how low\nWill these folks go and and and I think the answer is in why is the author\nWe say training I mean why is the author very very first thing that the president didn't condemn the attacks in Pittsburgh and in the pipe bombs the very first thing in the media did was blamed the president and make him responsible for these ridiculous acts\nYou can't start putting the responsibility of individual on anybody but the individual who carries out the crime he delivered on the promises he made and if anything I think it is that a and divisive the way that every single thing that comes out of the media Ninety percent of what comes out of the media is now was negative about this president\nAmen amen and that's where our level of discourse has been dragged out\nAs you hear a word for word and page after page in speech after speech about how our our ability to get along is kind of been thrown into the toilet about how our level of discourse incivility is all kinds of dashed against the rocks and observation that you certainly can make\nIs it because Trump won or because of a Trump tweet or because of some sharp elbows a salty thing that he might have said it's summer rally are you kidding me is everybody that stupid\nReason our discourse has been dragged into the muck is the reaction of people who hate him the reaction of people who cannot handle that he won the media have been biased for as long as many of us have been alive\nAnd this this is nothing new\nBut the level of hatred that's how you know the change is real by the way the level of vitriol the level of venom when

applies to what the employer is looking for\nWe better understand though I think what the purpose of a cover letter is so do you have better odds with a cover letter and your experience\nAbsolutely much better because\nAs well as tailoring your application with your resume you can further tailor\nThe application with the cover letter always always always do a cover letter even if you're doing one of those speedy indeed applications when they give you an option for cover letter right one\nOkay well we understand the purpose and the important so I think so give me some basics of a cover letter and what people need to keep in mind\nWell when you address the letter you want to try and address a person who is possibly going to see the the letter the HR director or the office manager anybody that you can investigate that might be reading the letter and their address\nSo it's a good idea to track down names first\nAbsolutely than the first paragraph is going to tell them where you saw the job posting whether that's on the website like indeed are monster or career builder or whether you saw that on the company website where you saw\nSo where you saw is important so that they know where you came from yes correct we're speaking with Gil Ruben ... getting career advice on in motion Gail we've covered the basics of what you need to start to cover letter we're getting into the first paragraph now what is the important thing to include in the first paragraph\nWell the the important thing to include in the first paragraph is exactly what position you're applying for I wouldn't send just a blanket\nYou're applying for then what you might do is highlight some of the\nRequirements that the employer is looking for are they looking for two years experience in education are they looking for two years experience or three years experience in sales are they looking for five years experience in human resources put that in the first paragraph\nAs we move on then we go to the second paragraph know what's the next paragraph\nThat next paragraph will show will draw from your resume in very specific sentences full complete sentences how you fulfill the requirements that the employer has said that they are looking for\nSo in my case if I were to say I was an on air announcer for six years at this radio station I Would definitely want to include that in the second paragraph absolutely\nAnd you would also want to include what markets you would work for in radio if you worked in Cookeville you'd put that previously you would put the previous market that you had worked at\nUm if you had done some public relations that was involved in your radio experience you would include that if it pertains to the job\nIf you had any kind of computer skills that were related to the job you would put that if you had any language skills you would put that\nWe've gotten two paragraphs now how many paragraph do I need overall\nWell you want to have a closing paragraph this is as important as the other paragraph\nIt asks for the interview you want to tell the potential employer when you're going to be available for the interview and how they can reach you what is a good phone number what is a good email address so they can choose the mode that they contact you at\nAnd that you are willing and able to come on an interview\nThree paragraphs in old and my total

that thousands of people somebody said you know now that when they build a down I'm pretty good at figuring out how many people thousands and thousands of people in the bridge when you looked at that bridge loaded up with people that's called an invasion of our country\nAnd there's always up to seven thousand there as they make their way into will probably be McAllen, Texas lieutenant colonel Allen West is in Texas his book is now out it's called the whole Texas hold the nation victory or death or go kind of turn a lieutenant colonel Allen West welcome back\nTo be with you Brian how are you\nSo colonel five thousand two hundred troops go to the border you you in the military for decades you can't really do much right you gotta support the border guard\n[laughter] yeah that's the thing because of ... you cannot ... yeah the the federal troops\nIn our military are not allowed to do any uh domestic law enforcement operations that's what this would end up being a you can see this as they are still a our military does not have that the jurisdiction and you have the border patrol to do this and that's why I think we need to make sure that our border\nPatrol or properly equipped to handle these type of situation and\nThe good thing I think the president has articulated this before and also a homeland security secretary Nielsen is that we want to bring these troops and so that they can do you know the the backstop ... more the logistical support that it's necessary so that you can get more border patrol agents into what are called penetration so\nNow they're saying that it's so important to understand a realized Brian is that uh we need to be looking at the other avenues of approach that the drug cartels or other use along our border because if we you\nKnow send a lot of resources to this like Allen sector other\nThings are going to happen elsewhere or drugs or probably try to flow through a more weapons are phase of this nature so we need to make sure we do have a good coverage along the border and maybe that's another way that we could use the military to supplement with some of the intelligence gathering of surveillance a resource the platforms there\nI mean the hope is deterrent as the word spreads the central south Americans are being favorite Mexican stay home\nAgain maybe the word is Donald Trump is serious there's five thousand troops we have no hope only a tent so the deterrent has to get down there\nWell I think one of the announcement is a that shouldn't be made right now because when you look at this a flow of individuals it reminds me a lot of low that you saw going into Germany\nThere is an incredible preponderance of single military age males that's why I refer to it as in in the in the military or you know these are you know Fifteen to thirty five year olds are on the company males you know I\nThink that we should say immediately that they will not be allowed to enter into the United states of America and and we need to say here here the type of people that we would even consider to to have these asylum interviews with\nA and and they have to be family unit or there or you know children that are you know by themselves below the age of Thirteen\nYou know we will consider them but if you're a single military age males you know we're basically going to take you to the closest military base put you on the one third as the Seventeen but want to fly right back we're going to\nFind the the the nearest airfield that we could land you in ... and uh you you can figure it out\nAnd why you you were President Obama said any gestures outlines exactly why I think he's an ineffective added touch president content\nThey're trying to convince everybody to be afraid\nMalnourished refugees\nBut most importantly\nSo he's he mocked any mocked even to it or a greater degree at a different appearance he thinks we were afraid of malnourished illegal immigrants to point\nWell obviously has not been watching I mean the folks that didn't say it along the way but then again he was the same person that mocked a President Trump with his plan to bring manufacturing\nJobs are production back to the United states of America restore our economy but now he said he wants to take credit for that so President Obama's out of touch him when you listen to that clip you just play it seems like a a delusional person\nThat was staggering it could get his thoughts together this is a very serious thing where people want to breach you or your border when people believe that they have a right to enter your country because they want a better job that's not the whole purpose of having a solver border\nThat's not the purpose of having a ... like the United states of America we want you to come here but there's a front door there was a legal immigration process\nWhere we thought we tend to colonel Allen West his book is now out whole Texas hold the nation I got to ask you about taxes take cruises lead is down to five points fifty one forty six over Beto O'Rourke that's a Quinnipiac poll kind of reliable Fox subscribes to it is it that close\n[laughter] you know Brian ... of course when I'm Out and about now say some of the early ... I see a little bit of a parity\nBetween a Republicans and Democrats and I live with a blue county\nHere in Dallas the Dallas County yeah there was an enthusiasm that the other side lost and then also you have to take into account that Greg Abbott is the top of the ticket the governor very popular governor he's you know up there about you know twenty twenty two point lead I think that's something that we should look at it as far as Ted Cruz a\nGoing along those coat tails but you know you can never tell I mean Donald Trump was supposedly got blown away by by Hillary Clinton look what happened on on election day I think Ted Cruz\nWill pull it out I Believe that he will went somewhere between seven to to not points there will be a lot closer than people want it to be but I think that there was a very good marketing job of a representative O'Rourke a but his message just not right for Texas\nHe is but you write for our show colonel\nShould victory or death colonel thanks again\nCause a

Andrew Jackson twice a one time the gun did not go off it got wet and he ended up being the guy with a cane fright\n[laughter] he actually died with bullet still in his body including one large\nNear as hard that they were never able to operated on a because it was considered so dangerous uh\nThe Jackson within a dual with an opponent and who is considered to be a perfect shot and everyone said he's a garner and so Jackson they marched out they turn and Jackson didn't shoot his opponent shot and they thought how cruel objects and you're just kind of stood there and\nAnd he must have missed and this guy was a perfect shot and then Jackson cooling lowered his pesto aimed\nAnd killed the man after it was over they found out he hadn't missed the perfect shot had actually shot Jackson and that was the bullet near his heart but he had survived that so [laughter] very dramatic very interesting people both of them\nYeah I just love the Andrew Jackson philosophy is is pretty cool and his mom gave it to him she said this make friends by being honest keep them by being steadfast never tell a lie or take what is not your own newer sue for slander settle the cause of cases yourself he did

campaign that sound resonating\nMorning Brian and hey what's what's happening\nMultiple media markets and I've been able to get out there and let people know that you have a business guy somebody who's been created Fifteen hundred jobs unemployed three thousand people over Twenty years who ran for Congress has a Chevy dealership has taken away a prominent versus somebody like Sherrod Brown who really when he graduated from\nCollege and ran for office has been in office for forty four years is only worried about one job and that's his uh and it's interesting because that message resonates the\nProblem is a ... you you might not notice I jumped in this race\nJust seven months ago when the individual who was running against share the last couple of years have to step down for family reasons so I've had a seven month a opportunity is trying to get people to know me and it's happening people are finally getting to know who I Am\nRight congressman and a couple of things if he was just amazed that these senators from states that are ... battleground states never vote a with the president I mean short brown ... never vote for the president but yet the people of Ohio already voted for the president at the very least it's purple right\n[noise] well absolutely and he and shirt brown has voted with the president gets along president he was ... bomb almost a hundred percent of the time he has been voting against this president across some against this president approximate eighty five percent of the time and that's the other thing I've tried to let\nPeople from Ohio no he's a fourth most liberal center and the country ... outlook Ohio's a purple state printing read it's not a liberal state now he votes Ninety four percent of the time of war and he probably would be better representing Massachusetts or California than Ohio\nRight and I think that's a lot Claire McCaskill is trying to market yourself to the middle\nI'm you have um you have a cinema also trying to

are sending so fair and balanced have not shown to be fair and balanced what kind of centered or would you be\nWell look I've shown that uh Brian when I went to the house the first thing I was disgusted all it was all the backbiting between Republicans and Democrats and I literally on the first month started a bipartisan breakfast at\nSeven years later is still going forward so from joked about it every day and our debates and all anybody comes to practice but you know we have almost thirty members hurting Republicans and Democrats that talk about things we can work on together uh and I've said this time and time again our problems are not Republican problems are problems are not Democrat problems are American\nProblems the problem that I've learned no violence in being being in business and then going to the house of representatives says it's politics gets in a way of everything and that's why we're so divided when we should be at least looking at ways we can get things\nDone right or that would be key maybe they're maybe it's going to come and vote to try to get things done after a while a congressman what do you plan to do to close I Know governor case it gets finally backing you\n[noise] yeah the the real issue here is just getting people to know me I mean we've spent seven months of getting around the state are trying to get as much a media attention I chuckle because ah I'm as the president calls it the fake news and much of the mainstream media\nHas been very vocal ... toward much in the local Ohio media has been very vocal toward shared because his wife was part of the media for so many years that\nWe've been breaking through that little by little but we're just going to continue to get that message out a business guy somebody who was created Fifteen hundred jobs versus somebody who's\nPolitics for his entire life and we're going to continue to work a travel state I'm In and get them get the message out that's the key when people get to know me they come my way and it's just been such a big state that I realized even in our last poll\nWhere should brown has a Ninety two percent name id that's the difference we got to make up that difference or make sure people know who I Am\nAs a six point devastate right now so let's let's look at it is a couple of issues out there and the plate or on your on Congress is going to have to take a look at the president's got an executive order working he's going to announce it officially Sunday\nThat he wants to get rid of birthright a birthright citizenship you have to illegal immigrants parents were born here you're a citizen Trump things were misinterpreted in the constitution were used in ...\nI I Am a big believer that Congress needs to be immigration program people in Ohio and people across this country\nAre mad because of too many illegal immigrants chip brown actually supports not only no no border uh he he wants to eliminate ice like the rest of the Democrats and when it comes to sanctuary cities he supports them too that's where people don't like so they start there and then they started looking at an immigration system and say it's\nBroken and then they look to those that are born in Ohio or in this country and say you know wait a minute we're we're letting them come across the border we're doing everything just to let go immigrants and\nThat's why I say it's just not one issue if the entire issue we need a strong border wall when you to make sure the Congress gets immigration some kind of immigration law passed and um\nThat's what I'm hearing you know in Ohio across people mad that anybody can walk in the state I'm but I'm not sure we can override the fourteenth amendment just yeah I Do believe in the constitution and I'm not so I think we need to support those as well but president bit of help\nBut it has been a big help coming back to Cleveland on Monday next week the vice president in tomorrow to try and push the votes I mean this is about getting the voters out or let's face it we know the Democrats are going to be out we got to make sure the Republicans and independents are showing up and a\nLot when it comes to cap it off and all these things would just got to get people making sure their vote\nAnd it was in in play you wouldn't have the vice president President coming gym and they said best of luck\nThank you so much by a

wonderful Daniel Daniel you are thinking of buying a home and you live in the state of\nColorado\nWhere the housing market has been brutal for people\nWho are trying to buy a home and beautiful for people who are already on one\nExactly where do you fit and all of this\nA lot it's below living here but I'm definitely uh as far as trying to the first now become a personal dire and it doesn't seem very accessible\n[laughter] that's a beautiful understatement are you in the Denver metro area or where are you\nYeah exactly I guess right outside Denver\nSo in Denver it's become impossible for someone to middle class job to buy a home right now\nIt's just the way it is and it's been very frustrating to people I read a story in the last few days I forget which\nI think it was in the Financial Times that did a story about how there are people and middle class professions in Denver they are actually choosing to move somewhere else in the country because they don't see any prospect I'll ever be able to own a home\nIn Denver at the kinds of salaries they make in a middle class kind of job it's tough I I\nI really don't know how people do it it's you know we ate my wife and I we you know as a as a household we make well above the median income a site you know I I can only imagine for those people to blow the median income you know what they're facing\n... one of the issues in Denver which is not just to Denver a problem it is in other areas as well is the cost of land acquisition for\nIt's the permits the costs of hiring labor and the cost of material new homes are a out of sight and builders because of the base costs they have from ... things like that they only want to build larger more expensive homes\nTo try to make any profit out of a deal so are you really have to you and your wife really have to concentrate if you want to go ahead and buy now\nOn used homes but housing markets go in cycles and anybody who's been in Colorado where Utah for a long time knows the swings that have occurred in both states where the real estate going on a pendulum\nOf extremely high demand followed by a wave of soft demand\nDo you think you and your wife have a little patience and you are do you want to go ahead and pull the trigger now and getting\nThat well we definitely I definitely have patience and I'm looking for a long term and that's kind of relate to what my question was is a ... you know for for folks who by during when it's you know the the market's really hot\nUm are they worse off than than people who buy in a in a buyer's market you know just long term because\nYou know for for a second home no matter when we do as a second home you know housing values are gonna be up or down if we jumped in when things are very hot um I Would just fall under is long term that would impact our finances of negative way\nSo the way you make that test is by comparing the cost of renting today versus what you were effective cost of homeownership would be today\nIf when you take the cost of the mortgage taxes and insurance and they had those together if they are more than twenty percent higher than what you can rent today your best off waiting a while before you buy\nIf you can buy a place at a margin that is less than twenty percent higher\nFor current cost of mortgage taxes and insurance versus rent then particularly if you're going to own a property for a significant number of years which in an overheated Marco liked the Denver metro area you want to look at a ownership window of ten years\nYou're comfortable in owning a house for ten years and you can buy a within that that price window I'm Talking about no more than twenty percent higher effective cost per month in rent then go ahead and buy\nOtherwise I'd away for a down cycle and they always come\nOn I think I'm gonna late [laughter] I think our focus is going to be or just you know stick it out in the apartment and pay 'em as much towards my student loans as possible\nFor that is a very effective strategy you know a lot of people don't feel like they've really settled down\nIf they're renting instead of owning\nBut that is something that is um in some sense psychological and if you can get your financial house better and ordering getting rid of student loans is a great thing to do and rent and let the market find new equilibrium I Would do just that\nJames is with us on the Clark Howard show Hi James\n... knew it was\nGreat to have you here James here a little muffled sounding right now though\nSo sorry about that is a little bit of that is better [noise]\nMy holds true for you is all with the fortune one of them they had been contributing to a traditional four one K. or as Seventeen or so years fall I currently can should be eleven percent where they should\nJust this month all they had the ... that they're going to start off and on the wall four one K.\nSo I'm kind of half way and semi retired and say I'm ... I'm going to be contributing about Seventeen years give or take on that you should see it's all ... all which would be more beneficial to me\nI Love the idea of you having done a traditional four one K. all these years moving forward doing the raw four one K. because whether it'll give you an retirement and your company match that six percent company matches\nWill still be pre tax money even if you do the Roth\nFour O. one K. moving forward\nBut it but having a pile of money that's pre tax pile and a pile of money that's after tax pile which the Roth becomes is extremely helpful in retirement to make sure that you harvest money is you need it from what would be the most efficient at that\nTime in that year also we have a really good shot the tax rates are going to be higher in the future than they are now and that would make it a potentially better idea to do a raw four one K. instead of traditional moving forward\nBut there is an exception and let me discuss what do you whether you're an exception you get if you're making huge money and your job\nThen you want to do the traditional because if you're an extremely high income earner the odds are better that you're in a higher tax bracket working then you'll be in retirement\nHome I Would say if you're in a very small percent of people would be in this territory um are you single or married married to both of you work\n... right if your income is north of a quarter million dollars a year then you'd want to do the traditional\nHates it so that has\nSo yeah so if you're at one twenty five family income I Would do the raw four one K. moving forward and if you can hang at eleven percent because remember you're going to have to use after tax dollars instead of before tax now\nIf you can keep your contribution

Christmas shopping season there's one thing I Want to make sure you don't do through the shopping season that so many people have done in the past regret so much\nDid you know that if you work for a smaller employer somebody other than a giant company\nAnd if they offer you a four O. one K. did you know the your expenses that you're paying on that four one K. are usually four to five times as much as they are for somebody who works for a giant company\nSmall businesses midsize businesses face an enormous administrative burden and cost offering four O. one K. plans and those costs in most cases are passed on to you\nIt's weird but it now costs more\nTo have a four one K. if you're employed by a smaller employer than it is for you to have your own IRA or Roth IRA with a low cost company\nAnd that's why I recommend to you that if you do work for a smaller company that you put in to their four one K. only up to the match\nAnd then after that if you're disciplined you put money in your own IRA with one of the low cost companies on my investment guy that Clark dot com\nSo this is a terrible problem that why is it that somebody who works for a smaller business which more than half of Americans do\nShould be discriminated against on a four O. one K. plan versus somebody who works for a big company it's just not right especially it harms the long term growth potential in the United states if it discourages people from working for a midsize or small business\nAnd they tend to go to work for a slower growing bigger company it actually squeezes the future potential the U.S economy\nSo there is a new rule working its way\nThrough the bureaucracy that hopefully in the next few months\nWill allow operators of small and mid sized businesses to go into pooled for one case where there were a trade association they'll be able to offer a much lower costs four one K. and in many cases\nEmployers who are unfortunately offering high costs for one case will be able to offer

physical home or you can say you know my oldest brother huh that's what he's so you so you'll be able to answer the question is what my oldest brother\nI heard and then his wife are tired and they have no real permanent address and they just go wherever and right now they're living in Arizona for six weeks\nAnd then they're going to go to Japan for four weeks and just wherever the deal is on a cruise ship or at a resort or travel internationally they're going to go to\nItaly for two months and the fall and they're doing everything on the cheap\nSo the question of where you Dahmer style I'm like I'm not going to give you the book cancer I might give you the real answer okay like\nPer inch do for instance you know tax reasons yeah I'm sure injury and write a voting I mean how do you do that if you're if you're traveling\nRight so you establish residency wherever it's almost of convenience like a lot of people will register a Montana because the taxes are so favorable and that's where they'll dom asylum or are they do so in Florida you work for a state with no state income tax\nIs rule number one mhm and usually what you do is you do I'm now again this is not the book answer this what people really do okay if I give you the really do answer\nWhy I call okay so what people will do is if they have a friend or relative or whatever in a zero income tax state you Lisa room from them in their home and you sign up with these probably never use the room\nBut you just pay them like a hundred dollars a month to be able to call their place you're home\nSo you don't actually fish we have to own property and know your residency states\nKnow the big thing is you don't want to set foot ever in the state you live in now if you come from a high tax state you live in Connecticut and that's why we want to find\nYou say you're never and Connecticut again right if you go if you go back to visit relatives in Connecticut you stay in a hotel\nIn somewhere else in the tri state area and then you drive over to see 'em but you're not spending any time in Connecticut 'cause the big thing and high tax states they're going to try to come back at you and say wait wait wait wait\nWe don't really believe you're a resident or whatever\nAnd you've been here a lot you're not there are a lot when you leave Connecticut you leave Connecticut\nOkay so you just basically do the math figure out which is the most tax has been changed your state and decide to live there\nYeah and it practically what most people do is they do for the Texas or Montana are the three that are done most often but there are special advantages to Montana\nAnd so if you look around on the Web and you'll see where people posted articles about why they use Montana as their dominant style

because\nAt Twenty one way that you said she's graduating from college and she's only Twenty one\nYes you know most people don't finish college now till twenty three twenty four\nRight she had she actually had skipped a a year of high school because she entered in advance program with a school up in northwest Missouri and uh it gave her both college credit in high school credits\nAnd uh she found that she didn't particularly like that program is supposed to be a two year program\nBut then she took it upon herself when she found that she would have to go back to high school to finish her

like a throwback getting an undergraduate degree by your twenty first birthday John joins us on the Clark Howard show Hi John\n... thanks for taking my call I've learned a lesson you over the years\nWell thank you very much you have something that's been pitched to you you want to run by me telling me\nAbsolutely I heard you talk about the long term care insurance but mostly the traditional pie and we are just to insurance agent I my uh state planning attorney who recommends a whole life policy\nThat he got the ability to use for a certain amount of long term care insurance up to ten years at a certain amount for both me and my life\nA very smart move by the insurance industry\nHas long term care market has mostly exploded because the number of people who claim long term care and has turned out to be far larger than the insurance actuaries expected and so the big\nYou heard the pitch for what happens is you buy a whole life policy with a writer for what sometimes is referred to as a living benefit\nWhere if you never need long term care you just have a death benefit that goes to the beneficiary designation the policy\nOn the other hand if you do need long term care with money that would have been paid out at death instead is paid for the benefit of care for a long term care facility\nChair in your home a nursing home whatever up to the limits that the policy calls for and you've purchased\nSo for the insurance industry what it does is it caps their risk than what it does for you is you have a premiums are ... you pay and you know that that benefit up to that dollar amount will be there for you okay is that how it was explained to you\nBoth very much so I I guess the question is I've always followed what is your philosophy to go which a term insurance ... I'm well covered there and I was wondering what I'd be too much for that to get a whole like policy that I don't need to check that\nYes we are dealing with a very broken system so long term care there are a small number of companies that still sell it on my long term care information that Clark dot com and you don't know what will happen with the premiums if you buy one of those so despise you certainty\nBut what it does do is you're paying a great deal of a premium for that certainty\nSo ... are you someone who could ... you might not like it but you could afford the premiums if over the year the IRS the long term care premiums escalated\nYes that's true\nIf that's your case go with traditional long term care insurance and go with one of the mutual insurers bitter on the list like um northwestern mutual is an example would be a better choice Joe joins us on the Clark Howard show hello Joe\nHey ... factor thing like certainly fuck I got a\nProblem a concern here and I want to live here and there are several several full page ads but the competitors are they all sound and\nAll that much about it how can I Do about it and so in price\nWill you know the United states is almost alone in the world with hearing aids being so expensive\nAnd so if you were overseas is kind of typical that for a pair of hearing aids you'd spend around oh four hundred eight hundred dollars\nAnd in the United states it's common that you pay several thousand dollars\nFor a pair of hearing aids but now the competition from overseas is coming into the United states plus some homegrown players and one that I Would like you to look at Joe is one call I hear medical dot com\nThe letter I.

recording okay each um her to a new or miles a little bit older so five hours or working or hers hers is worth what Thirteen thousand mine of about seven mhm\nOkay well um\nYou can do what you want to do I if I woke up in your shoes I have to tell you I've worked with families that were in dire straits over the years that were forced into bankruptcy you're not one of those\nIf you choose to file bankruptcy just cause you to dead young lazy to address the situation let's say even say you did it over two years\nIt's only Seventeen five a year and your debt free other than your student loans and I'm not talking about the student loans will be gone and when you're talking about the credit card debt to be gone in one year\nSo how fast do normal people that call the Dave Ramsey show that work our plan pay off a hundred and thirty four thousand dollars making eighty five about four years probably\nAbout four years yeah\nThat's the normal routine for people around here that would be student loans and everything\nAnd um you know I I Would not move down in car initially out of your wife's car into a into a six thousand dollar five thousand dollar car initially I might end up doing that as we go along we'll see how it goes what do you do for a living sir\nI'm operations manager\nI'm okay and what does she do for a living through the pastor\nOkay All right cool um does she ever do any outside speaking for money\nYou know she knows wetter\nYou do speaking Miami says she speak on Sunday mornings\nYeah see that's very very difficult to\nOkay All right\nI mean I Wonder if if you know she might sell do some ... occasionally for somebody that was ill or on sabbatical or something in that congregation pay or a little bit or\nMaybe she works and evangelists to outrage and they pay or a little bit for speaking skills or maybe dot dot dot you do something I don't know I mean if you add ten Fifteen thousand dollars a year to this equation\nOf income and you guys tightened down your budget and nothing I mean nothing where you have no life because we're going to clean this mess up you know you can clean up the whole thing in four years maybe three\nBut four for sure uh any clear up those student loans really really really fast as a part of that equation I'm Sorry the credit card debt as a part of that equation really really fast but you got to cut them up you've got to quit using them and you've got to stop living the way you've been living because it's not working agreed\nOn despair is that makes sense yeah for like you know\nThe Bible says that no discipline seems pleasant at the time but it yields a harvest of righteousness you guys make good money so I Know you're not stupid people you're not dumb\nThey're not dumb you just been doing some dumb things which makes you just like most of it was added a lot of dumb things in my life dude I'm with money in particular as high end up teaching is because I got a P. H. D. and D. U. N. B. but ah you know if I don't I don't know who it was they gave you this advice but you need to stay away from them\nBecause they gave you really really bad advice that's my opinion I think you can not only can work through this I think you should work through this\nI think it'll be a testimony to God's power and you're all his life that you turn this around and that you attack at an attack at an attack at and that you can start having a sense of self control the sense of discipline and it'll change your marriage on communication levels it will lower the stress when you're working the plan together\nAnd you can do anything how old are you guys\nUh to twenty eight I just turned thirty two\nExcellent show when you're thirty six and she's thirty two year debt free how's that field\nAre you ... you know life no vacation with no eating out for a short period of time for a short period of time\nYou live like no one else show that later you can live and give like no one else I think about what how much how much money you would have and how well the you could become and how generous you could be if you didn't have any payments right now\nOh my gosh\nLike about the peace that would be on your house the stress that would be gone say it's worth it to pay a price to win but there's a price to be paid to as opposed\nTo be fat you got to your own home and you don't get out of a whole by jumping out usually you climb out\nScratching and clawing pool and dirt under your fingernails you know what I'm saying you can do this man I'll help you I'll help you don't want you to go through our

offices all around the country where you can sit down face to face and review your contract to find a solution they've accepted thousands of timeshare owners this year alone\nThey're the best in the business because they simply have more options for exit than anyone else it could be a long process\nBut there with you every step of the way and timeshare exit team is so confident in their exit

a good question I ride Derek with us in Phoenix, Arizona Hi Derek welcome to the day Ramsey show\nStay in his honor to talk to you to have\nYou too sir how can I help\nYou or your tone of money make over book or just changed our lives I got it as a wedding gift and it was the best wedding gift we implemented it\nAnd pay off twenty thirty thousand dollars a day and eight months and that that ... free sense so it's been awesome good um my question to you need your help with this because sometimes I feel like I'm controlled by fearing over thinking when you quit your day job which is good\nTo go full time entrepreneur\nDo you have the full time job or do you have the entrepreneur gig running\n[noise] yeah that's what my wife does she sells the clothing for the ... um\nShe's doing very good at it and so I work for a local government here in town a mechanic just trying to figure out when that time is to leave that retirement and benefits and security\nYou wouldn't believe it was her the mechanics thing to sell women's clothing [noise] ... ... are you already involved in the business\nYes she's been selling it for a year and a half um\nShe's she's Kelly she she makes in one week would I make and gross in a month as a mechanic mhm um so I Would be going fulltime helping her with in Boise and shipping in the back office stuff while she sells all the dresses skirts\nMhm into and and what do you make a make fifty two thousand a year\nYou can't hire somebody cheaper and fifty two thousand dollars a year to work in the back office shipping stuff\nWould that be the best route to go\nAs well at least ten okay you walk away from fifty in order to lose a job you could have hired somebody for twenty to do\nThat ... short\nWell she she gross is she is gross two hundred and ten thousand so far this year\nHer when she grows his okay unless you're going to add more to her business in savings\nOkay or in revenue than what you are making now than it is not making sense okay because grossing two hundred and ten is fine as long as your expenses aren't at three hundred and ten\nNo yeah she's got cost goods sold out of that that's not profit we're talking about there yeah ... is it is around a hundred thousand out of that she's going to have taxable income of a hundred K. and you need somebody to do it\nOh she's working two full time jobs that were working from eight AM to kinda eleven twelve sometimes mhm okay\nSo the question then becomes what are you going to add not can you quit okay so it's just a business perspective because the other thing is scaring me here is if if this thing a ... out on you\nThen you're both out of work if you quit yes if it flamed out on you if the fad passes on this particular clothing line five years from today is is things do

starts this hour in Phoenix, Arizona Hi Brandon how're you\nDoing better than I deserve but a little confused oh how can I Am [laughter] well my wife and I were a debt free for our health uh-huh and we've got a one and a half year old little boy yeah eight and we want to [laughter]\nWe want to play and prove college but before he goes to college is most likely for our faith going to sort of a two year mission right and I know that probably doesn't apply to the ah the college savings plans ...\nWe've got a chunk of money right now about seven thousand dollars that we're going to put somewhere but we're trying to decide whether we should put it down on a mortgage with one way or the other will be paid off before he goes yeah or by a couple of good or for that to be something um\nWho could build up that the permission and college fund\nGotcha okay and your debt free except your home cooked in addition\nTo the seven thousand dollars do you have an emergency fund a rainy day fund of three to six months of expenses\nWe'd do you how much is in that about ... good\nOkay well well you're out what we call baby step for five and six baby step ones with thousands saved too is that free but tiles three is a fully funded emergency fund\nBaby step for is putting Fifteen Percent of your household income\nInto retirement which you should just start doing that as a part of your savings you're investing plan right now maybe step five is kids college and beyond that six is pay extra on the house as you can as fast as you can\nShow what I Would do with this money is I Would hear a market for school and mission trip\n'cause you guys are obviously LDS right we are you OK\nCool so what what I'm going to do is say out of the seven thousand I'm probably going to drop five thousand of it into a five twenty nine for my one and a half year old into a good growth stock mutual fund that's all for college has to be used for college take the other two thousand and just settled in a mutual fund\nAnd your name no big deal just regular mutual fund and your name and you just on the file when you drop the paperwork into a file right mission trip on the file\nBut it's just earmarked for that it's in your name your controlling the money and if everything goes as planned and he's going to do is to your mission trip and ... then that two thousand will grow into enough to help him do that the other five thousand you'll add to it periodically throughout his life\nSo that there's enough in there for him to go to college when he goes back from mission trip\nOff that's a good plan I have not thought about what it out like that\nYeah just a little bit here in a little bit there and then you know you're just monitor it you look up and he's twelve years old and you go hey this is a two thousand dollars not grown to enough to take care of this or it's got way too much in it I might take some out of that and throw it into his college or I might take some out of it and throw it at my house\nWe got an offer to do the care taking position and the guy a the a four hundred dollars a month to take care of his vacation home I'm In the same town we live\nUm [noise] do we sell our home\nOr do we keep it and continue to make a payment on it\nIt's not completed\nWell we're at a point it needs a paint and flooring\nAnd you're living in it\nNo no um well we were living in a mobile home um but then we got this offer to live in this house basically for free and he pays a live here and take care of\nI got that okay so that's ... so you've never lived in this other house no okay\nShe'll be able to show them the conditions than yeah like I Can't get financing on it right so you're going to take a whipping a what will it take money wise to finish it\nUm\nFlood never had a professional answer on that but probably about eight thousand ten thousand dollar\nYeah and what is your household income\nUm well my husband he worked forty hours a week what kind of household income [laughter]\nProbably thirty seven thousand a year\nOkay so your husband's the only one working well we have a business um it doesn't make it out and running it doesn't make money\nHis income is about twenty seven thousand in the business makes about Fifteen thousand nearly\nOkay [noise]\nAnd then doing the care taking position or will be like in about forty eight hundred cash but we get housing for free\nYeah I got up or until you get until he decides he doesn't want you to take any more and then you don't have a ... for free anymore that's right so I mean you could walk in the barn fire you\nUsing issue again thank nice so um you have any idea what the house you have shorter built would bring as it is\nUm well we had an appraisal and if it were completed it would be about a hundred and sixty thousand that smart completed so probably a hundred and fifty hundred and twenty five\nNo no not if it's not completed it won't know um because ... it's a further discount than the cost it takes to complete it it's a lot further discount because basically the typical consumer cannot buy this house\nOkay because they don't have any money and they're trying to get a mortgage and they can't get a mortgage on this house\nAnd so that limits your in but they didn't limit your selling pool to investors and they're going to discount that a lot deeper than that if you get a hundred out of there should be flying I'm thinking so um [noise] how much will be borrowed against it so far\nAbout how the south we owe thirty thousand but they're from property attached Jay how all the gathering a hundred thousand\nYou owe a hundred thousand against the house and the property which would bring a hundred and sixty if it were fixed if you sold the property is well\nYes\nOkay All right yeah I I Would look at trying to pick up the other ten thousand dollars in an additional loan and get this house finished and let's get it so as soon as possible\nAnd then just continue signing nine and ... yeah\nYeah we all have you know you should have some equity in your pocket at that point I mean I'm not a ton but you're going to get a little money out of it so you know it it just hasn't worked out for you you realize that right yeah\nYou've got way too many hours in this house and and really didn't get much out of it went all the smoke clears here right you'll get a little bit but it's not it's not it's not worked out very good so you know you're going to have to reset that and then the second thing I'm going to tell you as you guys need to look at your income\nBecause your household income as you I'm very very low income and ah so I I Want to think about careers what can we do to get our income up long term and I want to think about some part time jobs in the meantime\nBut um yeah I Would get that house finished up I'm saving scratching glowing painting and [noise]\nYou know if you borrow three thousand bucks or something that's fine but let's let's try and get it sold as fast as possible now if the land is such that you can sell off a piece of the land without selling the house in order to have the money to finish the house that's what I Would do first\n... showing acre also corner use that money to finish the house then get the household and that way there's no more debt involved Olivia is with us in Lexington high Olivia how are you\nHow are you better than I deserve what's up [noise] and\nI had a question and her head can amount of debt and and I'm wanting to pay that off the air that right [noise] and then I saw in recovery for an addiction and an idea that it's going to therapy so [noise]\nAnd I ... ... budget and\nPet therapy at the end it likely not going to get aid and sound kinda adequate that I'm not really sure way to put it in the budget for how big of a priority like\nHow long have you been clean and have any good for you well then what is it\nAnd ...\nI'm not going to put therapy on hold right now there's just something you need you need some accounts were to walk with you as you finish this life transformation and that that is essential to you having a life\nWould you agree with that statement [laughter] now what I Would do is is number one it's not a permanent situation\nUm the therapies not permanent it's not going to be there the rest of your life\nFifty years from now you're not gonna still be going to the therapist okay I Hope I'm and then uh otherwise they're just not very good [laughter] but ah at some point you'll you'll pull back from that and the second thing will happen is is that as you continue to address your income\nAnd you're out go you're going to find ways to make more income and as you are more emotional healing\nYou're going to feel more energized to make more income and so if\nThis month you don't pay any extra on the debt but you pay your therapy good\nIf next month the same thing happens okay but by this time next year we ought to be making more money right let's do something let's kick her life in gear and let's start to clean up the mess to but for today Seventy five whole day's you've been clean\n[laughter] that's a great start by but it's not like you told me you've been clean for two years by the time you're going for two years we ought to be have different having a different conversation about the money would that make sense to you [noise] so let's get Hugh healed and then let's see oh your money\nAnd as you and it's not going to be suddenly like a switch flips and you go OK I'm OK Now getting the money no not at all or nothing it's coming gradual it'll be incremental you'll feel better you you know when you're\nNinety Days or years four months you ought to feel different than you feel right now and you ought to be able to do more and make more and save more and more and you know you you all have more focus on the money 'cause you'll be more healed and\nHave to spend less severe emotional energy just coming through this right now your game on just getting through this is that right [laughter] okay I Want you to finish turning the corner you turn the corner you're finished turned the corner and let's let's gone out\nAnd then as you make incremental progress move more and more than money from your new income and your increased income\nShop for today\nWe want to take care of Libya [noise]\nYou're doing a good job to your show\nThis or whatever and the show [noise]\n\nHow often do you look at your bank account and wonder where all your money went how often are you stressed about bill's afraid your paycheck will last

life if you're tired of living paycheck to paycheck it's time to join the five million people who live without money stretch get started with financial position of our city today by visiting\nSure uh originally a kind of had that chopped up in my mind is that that special needs ... kind of functions the same way with the other boys have a college fund and baby step five\nUm the uh and that we would you know we'd be saving for all three of them but the one would have some some special conditions and special rules because of course\nUh you know his his features are boring sport too early to know what is your fully what his needs are we've been blessed that he's\nHe's healthy developing well you know there's this guy said limit for him just like anyone mhm um and we don't have to ah [noise] ah you know it's hard to really didn't know if he ever have any limitations [laughter] but uh but now as we're getting into it and we haven't find anything quite yet\nBut it would come down to the wire why things that I'm uncomfortable with is that you know if I start investing any money or finding try I I lose control of that to the trustee that we've named and while while I trust the ...

I Do understand that we are clearly indifferent universe is but I appreciate your call Melanie is in Charlotte Melanie go right ahead\nHey Paul thanks for taking my call a link to your show great to hear from them\nI wanted to ask you a few years ago when she went into Tuscaloosa with Leonard ... being the runaway favorite so the Heisman Trophy at the time and\nWhen we came out of that game I think he had about thirty yards and Derek Henry was the next up front runner and to know is there any chance at LSU turns the table and\nSlows down to his run to the house within a enough data say job or a it's it's a joke um [laughter] the front runner but I just want to do you think how she's slowed down to enough to have others or be considered for the hospital\nWell listen it doesn't take much or Alabama loses game and to has a bad game or he will certainly slip or because people will say this they will say that until Saturday Night he hasn't faced a a good team and in reality\nHe has not faced more than one good team and that Texas a and M. which has already been saddled with three and could have for losses by the time this game begins so or he would he would he would drop like a rock or if he has a bad game of Alabama loses\nSo there you have it uh I think the only person that can beat a to a Saturday Night ... ism shelf if he somehow loses composure should he get hurt should he get rattled there was no evidence that this will happen but this is the toughest environment\nHe has faced this year now a little bit difficult to compare this to the national\nChampionship game he came in at half time it was a desperate move he reacted well we all know how it ended but since then I mean he is he's been far and away the best player in the country\nRight right well um do you also think that I'm at that age we're on is the most underrated coach and the SEC at this point\nHer presented by have family dentistry news talk [noise] Ninety four point one [noise]\n\nWe welcome\nYou back so glad you're here I can Smith Meyer joining us so the judgment expert care Ken thanks as always as always for being are so many things to talk about but I Want to start with this story that is\nA literally breaking as we speak a it looks like that ... going to be retained it Marilyn he had a players only meeting a within the within the last thirty minutes some players are walking out this was a story that we've talked about in the past\nAh I ah I also adults like the president of the university while as low who was announced his retirement or was not in favor of this decision because considering at his press conference he never mentioned Dirk in by name a lot a lot to chew on there but your thoughts\nYeah you know all it's a little reminiscent of the beginning or see them at a ... Ohio State I yeah I always find a person or an organization seems to go out of their way at length to tell you what something is not\nThen it probably is and Ohio State did that with ... and that whole mess\nAnd Maryland is gone out of their way to tell you all the reasons why there is no toxic culture there and yet if you look at that report\nThat came out I think a week or so ago it's hard to include otherwise but this this feels like one of these are there's another shoe to drop\nKinds of situations to me or you just said Wallace loaded and back this that's reminiscent of Ohio State as well upper recall that university presidents president seem to hate situation you've got to end it low appears ready to retire\nUm but why do you think dark and instituted the toxic culture or not I think the average person on the street looks at this and says how how does that guy reasonably come back and function as the head coach you said yourself I saw I had written Burke recorded some players walked out of the meeting\n... you know let's say that he he couldn't he says the rest of the year does anybody think that some parents is going to spend their son to Maryland to play for dark and um I I don't think the stories over yet\n[noise] yeah and again uh we're we're ... this was a story that's going on as we speak another story that show also going on this afternoon urban Meyer giving an interviewer with reporters saying ah admitting when we already knew that he has a some health issues assist on his brain a gene Smith a\nGave an interview saying that they're working with him and he uh intends to stay on you you know where to urban said yesterday you know with his wife said on Twitter about me earlier in the week uh unpack it for us\nSally ... was after you on Twitter I thought okay that that's just further deterioration of the situation here\nUm you know it's not like you called her husband a murder or something like that you question whether or not he was going to coach again next year well that's what you do\nYou know your your sports media guy and and so her a response themed is proportional to what the issue was but you and I talked about the several weeks ago we both said that we didn't think urban would stay the rest of the year\nUm I kind of just how do you have to go to Cleveland 'cause everybody's figuring you're jak so we get fired well Jackson did get fired by the urban goes to ... to hold on or not nobody really knows but\nHoly cow if you've got the kind of a health issue recall a few weeks ago where the pain in his head literally brought it to his knees on the sidelines 'em and you've got all these other things going on we know that a health issue as what finally cause them to get out of four and half\nThe guys got some legitimate thing happening to and from a medical point of view I don't think anybody would blame him whatsoever\nOr if he didn't endure the stress of big time college football coaching and I continue to think this is going to be his last year on the sidelines there\nTalking to you say okay yeah I mean I was I was already moving on and you ... are buried the leader [laughter]\n\nDid you say a mascot\nMight then you just have changed fall I\nWhether it's the system has had whether it's the stuff at the beginning of the season we're whether it's something about his base personality\nI said early on this guy just looks like a guy who who cracked I think he's still cracking I think the ... do game is evidence of one of the leader crafts team cracks it happened to him that Iowa last year\nUm and and I just I think he's finished I uh I don't I only finished as a person I don't mean finished says a tech coach I just think he's done with his tenure at Ohio State but whatever the reasons are when the end of the ship\nThem in one one last thing can on on that and I'm sure you saw his statement yesterday when he was asked it ... ... if you did a I Would like to describe his body language when when when when he said he was coming back for another year was reference to\nComments I made you made a lot of people have made about him uh he never looked up the he seemed completely lost a I'm not being critical of him if if health issues are overwhelming him but everybody's pretty said today they're not\nYou know it's interesting what you bring that up Paul is I didn't see his press conference I heard it on the radio and sometimes you know you you can sort of hear something in a person and what I heard was lifeless mess\nI heard lifeless mess\nUm it's the same thing I heard when and Jim ... the last few days last year I'm uh right now for what ever other reasons are urban just seems like a guy\nWho's gas tank is near empty and he's fighting every day to squeeze a few more drops out you can't do that and the kind of job that he's got I'm not being critical of the guy or anything I'm just saying that sort of what he looks like sounds like feels like\nAnd when somebody gets in that spot eventually get to the point where they say you know what\nThis is not for me I Can't do this and I just think that's where he is\nTalking to ... Smith Myra Ken so many interesting situations are developing with coaches in the SCC and and you you we've gone through this a couple of different times I wanted to ask your opinion uh uh uh\nBut but certainly the coaches that are on your radar both positively or negatively\nOr you know the negatives type ... there's a couple of guys I'm I'm Wondering about and it got to understand\nYou know I just I watch lists and then I tried to see if they're not connected maybe they connect maybe they'd bell but Kirby Smart and uh and jumble Fisher a and let's go in reverse I I've been a skeptic of the general Fisher higher from day one he's got the fabulous track record I Know I Know\nUm but you know he does that face mask thing on national TV that tells you something about a guy style he's known as the emotional guy he's known as the guy who coaches hard nothing wrong with that\nUm it makes me wonder what he what he does to the week and now he goes to the Mississippi State lose the game you shouldn't a law swell when you've got to Seventy five million dollar contract when you started out like a house fire and a and M. debt\nAnd now you go on the road you lose the Mississippi State the pressure that built on him as the head coach and builds on that team is powerful and that can be constructive and I can really advanced you or it can be destructive\nAnd I'd I'd be curious to know whether jumbo winds up taking that last allies coaches who are also making millions holding them accountable for the guys they recruited that guys there they go China Daily basis\nOr whether he takes the other players I'll be interested to see has season holds up and how is recruiting class colds colds up ... likewise the curb your smart\nSets them to commit to lately team hasn't looked right uh yeah I beat Florida big big game I don't know if that's the beginning of a trend for them or an aberration I'm that bullet Kentucky either so we'll see but it's just that program just feels like something is uh\nNot right in both of those cases the two guys and coaching a inside SBC it outside Paul that said that to me no surprise mixtape and dabbled sweaty that both make tough decisions with their quarterback both those tough decisions are panning out\nI think they've changed the rules to the games these days if you now if you don't have an electric quarterback you're an ad in\nA I don't care what people say about Jay crime he good quarterback he's not he's not ... not ... and I think Diablo and Nick and then the ... everybody else and I think that the coaching class\nHold hold that thought we have a few more minutes to go with Ken Smith ... we're up against a break here when they Tuesday\nAfternoon tune into my new favorite TV show fans ville presented by Dr Pepper airing every Saturday throughout the college football season during the commercials\nAnd fans will Dr Pepper delivers a Tour de force performance alongside a legendary college football coach stars Brian boss worth any Georgia and less miles critics are saying it's good\nI was asked a similar question about Barry owed them that have been as countless times about mark Simpson I couldn't answer the gentleman because\nI just don't know what to what to say you can't uh at some point you have to break through and I point the stoops because he he's finally done it with patients but that's a tough one when you have to take a flyer on a coach based on the future not based on what you're saying\nI don't know about you Paul ... and I look at a program so essential I look at two things what's the what's the potential for the school itself and then what's the potential of coach\nGet to the schools potential out of it and I personally don't seek Kentucky as a school that's ever going to get to an Alabama level or ... or in Oklahoma level\nOkay and maybe I'm right maybe I'm wrong I'm but mark soups has gotten everything there is to get out of the University of Kentucky football program and not only does he deserves credit but Paul let's remember\nBehind mark stoops is an aide de who backed him\nAnd ate the who the long term and looked at stoop says that we can do this and I think is that this is the guy who can do it and that is so rare\nThese days but at the same time I think the Kentucky fan base didn't have unrealistic expectations like somebody fan bases do these days and so they they wait it out too and now they get rewarded\nAnd and but I just hope healthy stays because he's obviously such a great fit but there's a credit to suits but it's a credit to that a de Paul and the board behind that ate the university president behind that ate the they all lined up behind march suits that you're our guy we're going to give you the time of the resources to do it\nAnd everybody's been reward and it's a fabulous story isn't it and then when we don't see very often anymore\nBefore you go to the ... conundrum which we've talked about earlier and we will continue to talk about but ah\nI I Know you said you don't think he's going to be back but how does this\nPlay out the rest of the season with a his lame attempt\nAt the at the trying to put this to bed can\nHe he never\nHe never speaks with conviction when I hear him about these things are so hopefully people will stop asking him or he'll just say I'm not going to talk about it anymore but he he has a head coach it and he's a world class head coach and so I think he'll finish out the seasons try to take this team will probably Seventy south the season strong because\nYou know he'll fight is way through it which is what profession\nUnless there's some seminal all of that ... that occurs in his life between now in the end of the year that fills that empty gas tank\nAnd and revitalize that guy\nUm I think that on the inside he's ... on the outside he'll do everything he can do to get the get the job that he obviously has a great crew of assistance ball they survive the first three weeks of the season without it so it's not like he's doing the job by itself\nBut let me tell you that's a tough slog for a guy like him if he really is kind of running out of gas\nOr that has a tough existence to continue for what now another thirty days six weeks for the rest of the career that or the or the season than the big and and then if they get into the playoffs you still got a while to go but he'll he'll find its way through it\nThank you very much can always a pleasure such great information we'll talk to you talk to you guys with my one of the best around when it comes to analysis and judgment we are back

[noise]\nInside the route to join us\nIt is the cover of the Big Ten a teddy it's always a pleasure so many things we wanted to talk to you about that ah we weren't planning on or is it going in this direction but thanks for being or for that start uh with the Maryland situation it's still hard to get used in Maryland being in the Big Ten I'm even for you but ah what's your reaction to what we've heard from College Park today\n[noise] yep all I usually just to protect the Rutgers in Maryland are still not in the league a which you can certainly do during football season left so during basketball about Maryland but you know the question today is what do you have to do to get fired as the head coach Maryland 'cause being ten and Fifteen and having a player\nUm collapse and try and have a culture that a lot of parents described as toxic and dangerous is apparently not enough so shockingly enough DJ Dirk in is a back at the helmet derelict\nWell he probably will pan is a ... I take it back uh I don't know if he's going to be padding that a\nDismal one last record or or not but a good for him and the let's move on to urban Meyer were ah he does have credibility as three national championships you can more easily understand or the decision a couple of months ago but what what do you make out of\nHis recent acknowledgement that he does have headaches not that we needed him to tell us that\nHe is staying there but it wasn't exactly convincing when he said that\nPaul at something and exactly you probably saw the news today you know he pulled it a few reporters aside basically say I'm Still standing\nA pleasure to be here next year but you know he has a medical condition I mean he has the U.S is that is on or in his brain and it's causing headaches and people see it you know he runs his hands through his head here and press conferences he um\nIs that some balance issues he ... he looked like he was going to you know perhaps go down excuse me sorry about that\n\nIt looked like he was going to go down to one of the games so it's a really strange situation and he\nIs always concerned because of how this affects recruiting [noise] but now he's also a concern because you know Ohio State got crushed by Purdue and Michigan as all this uh\nYou know all all of this momentum now so if you're a reminded Ohio State subtly you feel like you have to say hey I'm Still here I'm OK and we're still do\nA [laughter] you cover this league you you know what the whispers are you know the nuances of of language\nAnd and I I listen I've been a critic but I I don't want any I don't want to see anyone suffering it looks like he is suffering you know do you think you'll be back\nSoon I Do think he'll be back if we can first of all I don't see him as an NFL head coach I don't think he really desires that um and he's too young to just step away so as long as he could do it he's going to want to do it this is his dream job and he is still in a raging success and I'll tell you what\nIf Michigan beats them this year Columbus no there's no way he's going to want to go anywhere so yeah I think those you know all those reports and all those odds that came out about who's going to be the Ohio State head coach and twenty and Eighteen [noise]\nYou know it's kind of fun for us to speculate but\nHe's still got this program rolling I mean look they have some horrible losses they got truck by Iowa last year they got really beat up bad by Purdue a couple of weeks ago but but let's not of course lose perspective these are still the giants is a Big Ten in urban Meyer is is that Ohio native wants to be there\n[noise] let's let's talk about the games [laughter]\nAnd this is a big when Penn State which\nUh survive last weekend or an epic fashion or heads to the big house in in the headline or the week\nIt's a good team different or how ... how are they different in ... and I'm really anxious to get your thoughts on this game as well\n... you won't probably enjoy hearing my opinion on Michigan I I still not convinced [laughter] and I certainly still not convinced that Michigan is going to you know when some tough road games down the stretch because our balls crew has not done it on the road since he's been there and obviously that Ohio State games in Columbus you know\nGranted it's a great defense especially in the front step\nBut here's where I'm clouded I've seen him play live this year and one was the last the Notre Dame and that was never named without invoking Dexter William So the Irish way better now than they were in week one the other time I saw Michigan was at Northwestern north western\nPlane or that Jeremy lark and their best skilled guy with a medically retired took a Seventeen to nothing lead in that game Michigan finally woke up\nOne twenty Seventeen you know kind of took the lead midway through the fourth quarter so based on those two performances it's hard for me to come out and say yeah that was like a big champion I also look at it and I say you don't want that Wisconsin game Alex forty Burke was not himself I mean he for pick six that that you and I could have gotten over\nOr the defense of live in a void that\nI I think he might have actually gotten can cost in that game um again credits in Michigan for ... for putting the heat on but Cory broke at a particularly bad game as it is receivers and then bridal work he was injured you know went five for twenty five in that in the game against Michigan State\nProbably shouldn't have been out on the field and I don't know how close are you able to watch it but you know there there's a late mo but in that game were said Patterson was rolling right flings into a crowd bounces off a couple of guys\nAnd into the hands of the ... century of Michigan receiver so they're getting breaks they're taking advantage of the breaks but I'm Still not convinced based on the results that I've seen so far that Michigan is really a a top five or ten ...\nInteresting very interesting or did he happened to be a ... it\nIn northwestern five years ago in ... game day came there and it was the Ohio State game it was one of the coolest things I've ever been a part of um and I bring that up and goes north western just continues to uh amazed though the wind over Wisconsin or that they had Michigan earlier in the year it was quite an extraordinary\nGame are they came ... where was I was I came in Evanston or it was\nIn an area of Notre Dame game I'm pretty good year to own season tickets to uh for for for the Wildcats are talking about this weekend's game in ah the especially the Notre Dame side\nPaul very true the craziest one of all they hosted Nebraska a couple of weeks ago the brass cars up ten million or order\nAnd in northwestern needs to convert to force tens just to get that Dr were they kick a field goal to go down step then they get in Nebraska and a three and out the ... to ... to North western one yard line northwestern has no time outs to let it in two seconds left and they go Ninety\nNine or some of the game when it it over time with their backup cases I mean you know ... at that point they had about a one point three percent chance to win or something like that so that was the one where you say\nThis can't be real so you know they beat Michigan State that one wasn't totally unexpected even though they were largely underdogs and then um you know they have a solid victory over\nWisconsin last week Wisconsin follow the ball bunch of times look unimpressive so northwestern ... you know but he drives people crazy with their inconsistency but here's the thing about that theme I call them America's greatest Dodger Dog they are awesome as an underdog they are horrible as if they if you play Akron or your plate do you're going to get a loss\nBut they've been great you know as adults Michigan State um Wisconsin and there are a big dog as another day and I'm not convinced they're going to play great I actually like the Irish in those game but based on history northwestern\nYou you have questions about Michigan do you do have them about Notre Dame or do you believe they are legit\nI think Notre Dame is absolutely which is I mean there were three into\n... without a book there were three and a ... Bush they were just getting by and then got to give Brian Kelly credit we've both been critical of him\nAnd he flips quarterbacks and e book have you seen this completion percentages [laughter] you know they were in the seventies and said oh my God that's ... ... and then he's over eighty percent against ... and the extra Williams who goes back from the ... the Russian gave it a credible about a life of the defense is very good\nPotentially a personal story that we don't know and frankly those are the kinds of things that should not favor or factor into some of these decisions\nAnd I think we've got to there's too many of these reports that he had purchased and either they didn't get ignored or get a a biased from one you know one side to the other to reach an agenda that maybe he was an agenda decided to early on\nAnd I just don't think that's right especially when the young man's life spent Los\n... and and that's what's the other she was about to drop probably right now is we're talking Williams when this family speaks out it is going to especially in light of\nEverything that's going on in this country right now it's going to be there's going to be a lot of heartache in their voice in in this university a which already looks terrible is going to look even more despicable\nMark how you can't take the high road and I heard somebody say well you know the one strength coach or something took responsibility\nHere's what upset about that about everybody knows what damage control is when these situations happen but when they happen there needs to be transparency there needs to be responsibility and and get all commenting just decency and uh I don't know as\nYou ... your ... your ... your profession million but I mean I had a situation once many years ago when I said something\nA on a year it wasn't that big a deal\nAnd the I came back in ... tried to deal with it apologizing to the person in the next thing you know the corporate attorney came in so what are you doing I should say I'm Sorry you said you can't do that you you are in it and you know in a anyone who does a medical malpractice\nOr will in interesting we go in reverse of that that sometimes a U.S in the sincerity\nOf a physician will carry a lot more weight than the typical lawyer ring that usually doesn't get any well\nActually the statistics show that doctors who are well like time had great bedside manner get sued last another doctor hundred percent ...\n... ... and I mean I think that gets down to this whole thing of common decency you know what was most people\nEven people who have been greatly it but we don't want to be embroiled in litigation in depositions and appeals they will what's fair they want to get on with their lives they want they they hopefully maybe one other thing is to change so that it doesn't happen to other people\nBut you know a ... and we all know fall and and you know you're you're a public figure you have to be careful sometimes but you know well there's a big difference when allegations of proof for sure and and and\nI I just think that\nIt's it's shameful what this family has to go through\nAnd what this university has done you know I\nHad said something into but you know constituent to the university aren't just alumni their their donors there that the fans they the citizens and all those people I have a need to take a look and say this oil to run our ... our university and you you know my feelings about what's going on here in Knoxville and and and\nAnd I think that's shameful in many ways\nAnd go why did the only person in the University of Maryland who took responsibility we are the president he he he took total responsibility and apologize he's on his way out\nRight well that's what happens so why why would you do the right thing you lose your job and that's wrong\nIs wrong and and and we need to reward people for doing the right thing as opposed to punish people for doing the right thing and you know maybe that's\nYou know a a a famous New York while you're one time says something like you know the stock in trade of any\nAny any good lawyers telling their clients are acts like a dam fool and tell them telling them that yeah you can sue but still it's not the right thing to do it's not the right thing for us so far I think that the person you're going to sue and and I think a lot of that's plays into some of this but\nThese boards have got to recognize that that\nYou know if they have a personal relationship with this coach or this athletic director than there but it'd be a better way to make these decisions otherwise they're always going to be challenged well\nThank you William as always great to hear from you\n... and my friend ... don't please don't tell me lands again I appreciate it my friend okay\nThank you thank you and ...

thank you for being with us\nBanks are glad to be here\nWhen you talk to people as you get out not door to door and visited rallies and the like what are they saying about this election what what do they want\n[noise] well yeah it's hard to say because there's such a divide you can talk to one group of people and you can talk to another\nAnd there'll be completely opposite and so Michael has been to talk about those areas where there is the claim that and sometimes that's hard to find 'em\nBut I just I really think that one of the problems and most people that I talk\nNeed a fair break and that's not necessarily the case with this general assembly\nHall so\nWell if you look at the actions that the general assembly has taken they talk a lot about taking action to bring businesses here to Tennessee and we all agree that\nYou know that it would be great to have um more business come to Tennessee and yet it shouldn't be at the expense of working people for example um [noise]\nThey have talked about also bringing more retired people here and so the general assembly is phasing out the hall tax and that's a tax which is on interest and dividends on stock investments\nAnd buy a curtailing that tax it hurts our our local economies are local government and city\nBudgets in hurts our schools and you know that just doesn't make sense to me it's like cutting off your nose to spite your face that we want to bring more people here but in the meantime we're making our local and city government struggle that much more for our schools\nAnd the other thing is is that we want you know we talk about when we try to draw in the business\nI've heard economic development officials count the fact that our wages are much lower than the national average and I don't think that's something to brag about I think that it's time that we have a living wage for working people here in Tennessee\nYou also talked about the possibility of revising the sales tax is released ...\nYes if you look at the tax changes that this general assembly has made\nThat all help the most wealthy among us and businesses the only tax break that working people have gotten is reducing the food tax from five percent to four percent and yet on the other hand they have increased the gas tax\nSo it's pretty much a wash and I believe that there should be no\nTax on food thing\nI've heard my opponent say that he thinks that the sales tax is the most fair tax because people have a choice in what they buy well people don't have a choice and buying food and that would help the most disadvantaged among us to get that small break when they go to the grocery store\nHow would you approach looking decisions as relates to spending and saving up what what's your philosophy you evaluate\nWell yeah I'm Glad you asked that because\nI'm a licensed attorney and my experience has been in public service and most notably I spent more than Twenty years working for the Tennessee Valley officer the inspector general and inspectors general are watchdog agencies\nThat conduct audits and investigations of fraud waste and abuse\nAffecting their agencies and\nBased on that experience I have a good idea at looking at what's whites full and what's not\nAnd you know it's just a common sense common sense consideration not to mention the fact that I have I've looked at so many different audits investigations I that's my background\nBut beyond that I think that we have to get to the point where we can talk to each other and negotiate and reach decisions that are fair for everyone and right now with a super majority in the general assembly that's just not happening everything is happening it's based on a highly\nThe government is more\nGranted government should be run fairly equitably for the public good as well as for the private and right now the public's size being ignored\nThey're also seems to be at this point the biggest difference there has ever been perhaps as it relates to urban Tennessee in ... Tennessee what do you bring to the table in terms of trying to represent the needs of the more in line parts of the state\nYeah I'm really glad that you asked that because\nThe longer I have done this the more edited it is that our rural areas are being ignored and and buzz yeah in statewide government as well as the leave me an input politically running for an office it's it's very difficult in a rural area\nAnd if I'm elected I think that the house and the Senate both should have rural caucuses that go across party lines because there are certain issues facing the rural areas that that exist across the board regardless of what someone's political viewpoint is\nAnd um I just ... I Believe that you know our our big cities are urban areas they have a stronger voice they have more money does represent that's tied up in their elections and rural areas or just forgot and it's like ... they don't really matter\nAnd as a result of our people are forgotten for\nExample if you look Ivor Van Buren county um\nThe state keeps up with county sat or distressed and with a goal of by twenty twenty five I'm that no county and in Tennessee would they distressed when they started looking at this matter in Ventura County was a a distress county and now it is\nAnd the state decided to a closed down the and in the conference center at fall creek falls that kept it closed all summer and just tore it down\nAnd ah are going to be building a new one is plays well\nThat's something that has really hurt that area I Know that um\nYou know the status may sound reparations to the local county government sent to the people who lost their jobs\nBut it's not enough it's it's happened in a county where there's very little political power there is no one really standing up for those people and I just I think that's wrong and that's what I could do if elected to the general assembly to the house of representatives\nIs standing up for the people in this rural area so that they have the same voice the same schools as any body does living in Davidson knocks Shelby counties\nMaybe some out of pocket but we don't know what that proceed procedure cautious which makes it hard for us to shop and can compare and being informed consumer\nSo for looking at trying to help people and healthcare all over the board to make it more affordable better access\nLower drug costs lower premiums we have a better job of having more competition but also have transparency and billing and cost\nUs so that way that lowers the price just like we do in our economy and and how we are how how goods and services work um in in that endeavor and health care should be different\nCamera and health care has been framed as a national issue over the last several years one of the things that the state can do to achieve some of these things you're talking about\nWell we started last year um one thing that we did was removed the gag clauses in the insurance company gag the pharmacist it's called the guy cause they they would not allow the farm says the contract\nTo talk to patients about what a lower drug costs may be um a what a cheaper alternative may be or even if the patient said is there anything cheaper cash wise in my co pay\nThe pharmacist was not allowed to have those discussions so this last year we remove the guy clause Washington I think President Trump just signed it the other day to remove it at the federal level as well\nUm so that's one thing that that we have done um to get in to get that and so a lot of times what government can do is\nIs getting back to where the provider and the patients should be the ones who are in charge of their health care but a lot of times the insurance companies are in the middle directing extra services or extra things if the physician doesn't feel like may be needed\nThat they're having to do just to get to the hoop to where they think they should go so I think from a state standpoint the things that we can do is is do a better job of breaking down those insurance barriers doing a better job of making sure that patients have the right information to be more informed so they can make better decisions\nAnd government also to get a health care policy where you have um less government mandates in those policies which makes it affordable and there's a couple of states who were going to look at this coming year called short term insurance you have a lot of people who are young you don't feel like that they maybe need health insurance\n[noise] um or it's not affordable for them to do it other states are looking at these things called short term insurance plans on which have really lower the cost and allow those people to have an insurance plan that more affordable based on what their needs are at that time\nThey may be having the big plan than an older person how\nArea seems to be a leader state wide in terms of\nAll in high school level am I reading that correctly in what more can be done\nYes I mean I think we're moving in that direction I think uh there's been a big push to as I said the tendency promising Tennessee reconnect start using our teeth cats were vocational schools\nUm to help us I think we can do even better\nMeaning I think if we compare it to where when you graduate high school with a high school diploma and a certificate and your job righty um when you turn whether you're Seventeen or Eighteen when you graduate high school will be a step in the right direction instead of having to wait maybe a year or two longer to get that certificate after high school so\nI I think we're doing a very good job I think also we're working hard to partner with universities like Tennessee tacking Rhone stay like community colleges um ... businesses to offer if they need some type of specialized training\n'em for business in Cookeville across Phil then that the vocational school can work with them and the university to to create a plan that will help them train their employees\nUm so that or future employees so that we can have the best labor force for what we need in our area\nAre we making progress in your opinion in the fight against opioids\nWell yes I mean I think we made huge progress um you know three years ago I worked with lieutenant governor McNally to pass a bill which decreased paying bills by forty eight percent reduced doctor shopping by Seventy six percent\nThis last year I worked with the governor on his tendency together plant 'em and up until this year we have decreased the total amount of prescription opioids by over two million per year\nUm and so with this next legislation I think it will push us even lower the balance is is there still people who need opioids is appropriate for some patients\nAnd and chronic pain patients still need to have access to him so there's a delicate balance there I think we've done about everything we can with the prescription side of it\nNow I think we have to focus with law enforcement to crack down on with the bigger issue is with opioid which has been Neal in heroin which is what's leading the overdose deaths in this in Tennessee this last year was the first time that prescription opioid deaths have decreased lower than two thousand and Fifteen\nAnd ... heroin heavy increase so what it is now as we focus on the illegal opioids coming into the state and do an crackdown and I work with law enforcement um to to better control or that in our state\nResources have been poured back into infrastructure in this state but it doesn't take long to drive to see that they are in need still there yeah [noise] do you feel like the legislatures going to have to step up in a higher level or are we making progress there\n[noise] well I mean I I think our infrastructure is improving I mean I think we are as far as roads are coming I I think it's working well I think part of our problem is in the state of Tennessee is we're blessed with great roads and a lot of paved roads\nAnd and the cost of that is is going up and so to try to maintain them um has become harder because of the cost but I think we're doing an excellent job and the governor past his plan or two years ago to help do a better funding on that mechanism\nYou know I was I like the ... amendment which I think we could still go back and do the hawk which is to move\nSome of the sales tax dollars off of a neat the purchase of new and used vehicles and put that tours roads which would help as well I think if if you also looking at sewer water as far as infrastructure abroad bans I think we're progressing on all fronts and brought brand is is the next biggest infrastructure needed in rural areas as well that we're working on\nAnd that is one of those areas that significantly impacts parts of the upper Cumberland what's next in that Iran\nSo there there's still a grant process going on we are and there's it's a partnership between private and public which is a wonderful thing it's all on government and so we've opened up\nWalk down I'm as it was we open up the competition and we also put in fifty million dollars which was the first round uh last year that went out I think areas up here in ... county but when you're talking about\nUm getting rural broadband into rural areas it will take a little while and it's going to take a lot of money to get there but that is our goal in the end um and I think we will achieve that\nYou were serving Cameron section at a time when the budget is good state is healthy and is growing but we all know that can change where where do you feel like the legislature is in terms of making the best use of its money even though there may not be that stress that there has been at some at some time\nRight now I think that's what we've done over the last eight years you know there was a a Moody's and standard and Poor's put out a a a fiscal stability of the states\nIn Tennessee is ranked fist I'm mad as being the most fiscally sound state\nAnd was the only one of seven states that they defined as being able to handle the next great recession just off how they've been run their budget and their budget reserves or their rainy day fund is we have without having to raise taxes or cut significant spending so I think over the last eight years we've done a wonderful job with the budget to prepare ourselves\nFor the next recession um whether we have been cutting a government I'm about ten percent or five hundred million dollars\nA week or saved in the rainy day fund at taking it from about two hundred million dollars to a hundred and sixty one million dollars and eight years all the same time returning the money back to about a hundred million back to the families and businesses in Tennessee\nSo I think we've done a wonderful job in the last eight years to get the budget to a place to where we feel very safe if we have a recession that we can survive it without having to raise taxes or do other things that other states may have to do because they're not as financially sound is what we are\nCameron sex and why do you want to go back to Nashville\nWell thank you um I like to go back to to Nashville to finish what we started to work on health care to continue to um work on tendencies economy um and work on education Tennessee's a wonderful state we're moving in the right direction and one of the things I've learned down there\nIs with all the right leadership with the right people in the right places with the right governor\nYou can move mountains and tendency is just a shining example for other states when we go to conferences or like\nHow can you do tax cuts how's your pension fully funded how can you be doing this stuff when they're having to worry about raising taxes are trimming their budget\nAnd and so what we've done in the state of Tennessee has last eight years is by far probably the best that we've ever done in the history of Tennessee especially when you look at the number of over four hundred thousand net new jobs moving in Tennessee\nTennessee leading the southeast and household income growth so I think he would I like to go back to finish what we started\nAnd and that's what we're going to do and that's what we'd like to do an insult some of these other issues as well work on health care to empower the station\nContinue to work on education and make sure that case when someone graduate high school with a K. through twelve that they're ready to go to work the next day whether it's through the certificate or they're prepared to go to college whatever they so desire but Tennessee and another and hopefully in eight more years\nAre we putting enough resources into educating students of middle school and high school level specifically not everybody's ready to go to college but making sure that there's ...\nI Know that um we work closely with the cat here in clay county and I know one of my other county Suffolk County that I work very closely would take it and they they do across the board and I think that um we need to\nPresent more options for students we need to make them understand that you know go into college is not the only way to go there there's\nMany plumbers and construction people and many certificate papal that learn a skill and make good money at that and and you know have very fulfilling lives so\nI think that we are failing kids in a little bit that were not showing them all their options because there's more options out there than just going to college and getting a four year degree\nMagic question that everybody wants to know how do we get more jobs into these rural communities like a clay county there doesn't seem to be made you think do you have some ideas on what the state he'll do\nI actually do I you know\nTimes have changed the the large manufacturers are in a large cities obviously because they have more of a workforce in large cities um the small factors course you know with NAFTA um clay county lost six factories and not think it was Nineteen Ninety five\nSo I don't think we'll ever go back to those days I think we can serve people better by looking at other more creative ways to get them gainfully employed\nI think that on line is an excellent way for people to have an economy in a rural area I think that broadband and all these rural areas um dependable Robin that that can work from we've even discussed here in ... county having\nTypical to have an online job and you know things like that so I think we really need to get a little creative and think outside the box instead of having manufacturers come here and build a factory you know ... brick and mortar we need to be thinking about what we can do to teach people\nHow to have an income without having to have that\nHow close do you feel we are to having pure solid broadband access let's say in your district\nUm we have some good service in areas waiting ... course we have the twin likes cooperative here in ... county and we have very good service in some areas and then in other areas we don't um I I\nI always rag on twin lakes but I have talked to some people in other areas of clay county that say oh it's terrible you know it just it just cuts off all the time so I think we really need to look at\n... making sure that all of our area have access to broadband because that is a necessity if we're going to you know have a flourishing economy based on that and we're gonna have to make sure that everybody has it\nIs at a good place Carolyn in terms of growth there not been major tax debate in the legislature in the last couple of years but we all know that can change in a moment how do you approach looking at ... shoes and and what's the responsible thing to do\n[noise] okay so what my issues was that you know the state of Tennessee and doing very well but this district district thirty eight industry at forty one are right beside each other and there are\nThree counties and these two districts that are distressed counties was that what that means is they are in uh the lowest ten percent of economies in the nation compared to other counties\nAnd we only have Fifteen and the whole state so I feel like with the proper representation at the state legislature that the state of Tennessee would help this area\nI think we just need to go down there and say look you know we're struggling here and here's what we need and we can do better in this area because we do have some very good\nEconomies and Tennessee and Tennessee is one of the ... states and the nation and I really feel like if we light everything out that the state legislature wouldn't be all for helping\nThese counties\nFinally Carol why should someone cashed a valid your way to the voting booth\n[noise] I think they should vote for me because I'm a professional um I have a masters or in business\nI'm a certified public accounting my husband has owned a business and so on it for twenty five years and I had my own business\nPlus I grew up in the country and I mean my grandmother was on a fixed income and we used medicate and and we use food stamps at one point when we needed it\nI think the thing is everybody's scared nobody wants people getting something they don't deserve or they don't work for but at the same time we want to help
