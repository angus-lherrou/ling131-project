Twenty one passes tried to be balanced\nBoy just we just felt like we never threatened them down the field they were kind of sitting on the short routes couldn't run the football um that that was that was frustrating\nWell three first downs in the first happened ... get sworn in in in ...\nAble to move the ball down the field a little bit and and I understand that you know we've had some protection props protection was the best that has been this this year but still you have protection prompts so maybe you're trying to protect your quarterback ... ... when you get into games where you got to score points you know you're going to score points the Georgia\nI just feel like you get to try and be more aggressive and then when\nWe had I just want to be the first or second series we missed a little twist there and he comes free and and you know hit hits gear and Tom I Wonder if that kind of\nScared them about being able to protect I don't know but yeah you're right but it just seemed like we never\nThreaten them down the field\nYou know the one thing to do a defensively forced for ... and then recover in ... and that would change a lot of momentum\nThat never happens I had you know it's that every time I saw the other team got it [laughter] you know the last ... last\nTwo weeks you know the roof caved in on it at Florida you know we had the bomb or Thursday and then they go bad\nTurned against us and it seemed like it just kept coming in Georgia you gotta you gotta you think you're going to\nHave to look at you accidentally fall I Want to yeah you know the the hard part of the way and you don't expect the tied in to pick one up and then run it or\nSomething here here's my again my my gut feeling when you were really good team okay bad things happen okay and you're right we get a strip\nThey're tied in picks it up but I Would say but we also instead of just fallen already picked up it okay but we also Mr tackle the Penn that's right okay so and I'm not you know so we tackle that guy maybe hold a field goal\nDoes the real good teams find a way to make that that last ditch play and then changed getting that\nWay housing here in San of what I thought he was okay uh\nNot really trying to do much ah I felt like you know he's protecting the football pretty good uh tried to take a shot and got caught one time but uh\nReally hard to say say because they're not asking to do much as I don't seem throwing the football down the field\nAny but there's all sorts of guys in this country can they can do\nI mean I could still they can do a little bit\nYou think the little bit more income and they don't\nRepresent the drop of who gets the job if I could keep for pulling my guy\nRight there was a cop type Chandler only touch the nine times\nYeah yeah well\nLet me but you only ... I said the problem is you only ran you know forty six place where we like to point six a carry yeah you just you can't build any momentum any rhythm often simply when you can't run the football I mean that's the\nBottom line you know they read they ran for two hundred yards we didn't even come close\nI Would leave him on the field more\nRegardless uh and I think they I think they cut the rotation down a little bit the other day a played him and Jordan more than the other two guys but a tie it to me uh [noise]\nIs your most explosive back he's the guy that we get most of my touches yeah\nHe's he's a home run threat I think you know just off into looking at play makers channels one Jennings and ... those are the kind of guys that are tight and it's got got some guy got agenda Anderson ill you know can you build on with those guys can do and maybe you know force feed those guys the football somehow\nOur number tonight on the big orange hotline is one eight hundred six eight eight eight six five seven that's one eight hundred six eight eight V. O. L. S. or you can tweet a question to us at ball network underscore I. N. G. hash tag ask Wal network or one of their um aspect of the\nFootball game you guys mentioned the tied into a little bit and throw into the tide in ...\nSo you use him\nYou know ten Fifteen your rats in the middle of the field leader seems or her crossing routes you know drag routes across the middle you bootleg where you can getting\nWhere he's got the ball where you can catch in space 'cause I think the guy who's got some athletic taps and daddy can catch football seem to get in spots where he could be in the open and run with it\nI mean those are all going to be ... we can all go through all those things up but if you can't you know get four five six yards on first town run and run the football\nYou know things are those are academic\nIssues where they don't bite on your plate you know nobody's opened Germany banks got to play a quite a bit on the fourth quarter but had another fumble that's one thing he's got a correct if he wants to blame or he does and I and I\nAnd I got a feeling that it's going to be a while before we see him in any meaning they're meaningful situations when you just can't the guy runs hard and I mean I really like some of the runs he makes\nWhich he just can't take a chance on a guide land a football on the ground especially\nTurnovers are crucial to this day\nI mean there's been a lot more talented back in the history of football who have gotten bench for not hold on the football than he means so ... that's that's the first thing you gotta do you can't turn the ball over you know back in the day he'd he'd he'd be walking to\nClass every day he might be you know he's not doing that ... we had a chance to talk with coach Pruitt act the game on Saturday down in Athens, Georgia here's our talk with tendency head coach Jeremy Pruitt after

the rain coming down but it's a great and I'd be inside and having barbeque and Zach in Tennessee football glad you're with us slide one eight hundred six eight eight six five seven is our number CJ fake\nNews joined us a lot of folks remember J as a wide receiver would tendency back in the early to thousands now he's back with the volunteers as the director of the via felt programming projects you get good to have you back to be here it's going to be back in Tennessee also everybody wants to do with the Wii I felt programs all about and what made it attractive for you to get involved\nWith this you know anytime I can come back and help former players and help the current players at the opportunity I just couldn't say no\nWith a cold former coming to me personally with this position and it was something that I had to jump on 'em specifically the vehicle program is kind of a two fold thing\nWe want to work with the current players there to help them transition after football figure out what's next in their life and then also making sure we bring back our former guys and make them feel connected with the program because it's definitely important to get those guys involved when you're trying to get things back\nTo where it used to be anything you do for Francis in line what helped me out of\nBugging me for free stuff and everything and the guys out of out of a badge and your\nFirst job is to get the former players to realize they're not on scholarship absolute I mean I'd love to say well you know what what are the ... what what I think I think is really cool I think about you know anybody that sends their kid the cop\nYou want to know alumni a base and you know fraternities do it um you know I felt what what are we doing for some guys that I mean not everybody we all love the everybody wants to go play in the NFL and have Peyton Manning like career but that doesn't always happen where we do it for the guys that that that don't make the NFL in in are going to go get a real job\nAnd that's what we're doing is you think about the via cell brand that's that's one of the things we're doing so you just think about that network and and how many guys are in the community\nAll over the country who are in jobs in profession that these guys here now are looking to get into developing that network making those connections\nAnd then also reaching out to community partners and making sure there are in a position to help these guys and you know whether it's internships or or actually job placement when it's done or or getting that experience making those connections and that that's really been a big thing what I've done so do you guys work with the the you're courting players the freshman sophomore junior as all the way through ...\nAbsolutely you know the freshman you're you're talking about you know developing a plan what are they really want to do when they get\nAnd they learning how to write a couple of or doing some of those basic things that you know these guys don't know how to do or don't have any stare so developing that and then when you're older guys you're definitely they're trying to get to enter ship the actual work experience and then from there getting that job placement and making sure we find a good connection\nFor see I I think it was a great example of all this is Kyle Philip she's an outstanding academic he's got his degree in three years he's getting a master's degree but he knows in about\nA month and a half or so football's over maybe for him and hopefully we'll get a chance to try out in the NFL but it could be over and now he's got to get on with life and so this is what this bill programs all about saying hey guys football if it goes fast when you get to Tennessee absolutely\nEagles fans enjoy it now but also start thinking about what you're going to do after you get out hero or after football's over you know some guys do going to play but still after that\nYou know they weren't as you were in that boat I mean you thought you were going to play in the NFL for ten years you break your foot and all of a sudden everything's flipped upside down so that you had to face that that I got to find something else ...\nAbsolutely that's one reason why I kinda like this position because I've been there understand you know you might have plans for something else but but one incident or something can change everything so so just always having a plan and figure out what to do next big reunion weekend coming up\nAlabama we can yes ... and that will talk about what what's the weekends ... will have several events or it's open to all via fell so all former football players managers trainers 'cause you know it takes more than just the players to have a successful program so you definitely want to include everybody\nAnd I just getting them together you know we just coming off the Ninety eight reunion in having those guys on campus\nThat the the value that that brings to our athletic program and also to the football team specifically is is invaluable\nYou know there's all kinds of memories I'm sure you have the one I remember about you\nAlabama five over times fourth in Nineteen Nineteen year old job\nYeah I mean the route I remember that yeah I can I talk to her article you came across a week yeah\nAbsolute those ... and I was coming across the field so really it was only one one person he's on a thought too you know everybody's clearing out and I'm coming across the field\nAnd I remember that play like it was yesterday 'cause we call the time out right before that happened I remember that he was all on ... I remember the ... so ah but you know things worked out and it it it turned out\nGood Friday and Saturday it was just a great call he says oh my God\nYou know sometimes I think when we start talking about the great quarterbacks to play to Tennessee and we got\nTwo guys here that play quarterback for two\nOr three averages right here and you notice he didn't say we have to\nBe I mean you are the leading pastor in Tennessee history when you left Tennessee in your lap by you know it's OK twice may see just get back up Casey closet\nHe didn't get enough credit either one of the games the one where he was the one in Florida and you want an Alabama he when he won all these big big games and I think people kinda gloss over some of that just because you know Casey wasn't a flamboyant guy and he you know didn't go on to have a great NFL career but boy he was a great college quarterback\nYeah I think his name was ... the Iceman or or something like that yeah and that was cool case he was you know he was\nMouth temper you know everywhere he was the same but but when he got on that field he produced in front of his freshman year on ... Seventeen to on the road he was Nineteen into on the road and you know he wasn't pretty he didn't look pretty throwing it but you know what the ... he got a place you have the\nThing is I remember the first game you ever got into his LSU\nAs a freshman they threw him that he he got so nervous she couldn't call planned [laughter] than to see him and be such a good player overcome that stuff and yeah and they're like yeah it's pretty good guys ...\nThat you played with the ... seat in court oh I got there was you know done today at Harvard Kelly Washington and then by the time I left rubber media that class was ... years ago there was\nA you know uh several years ago we did a a\nVideo for a university for the ball network and it was on the quarterbacks play to Tennessee and we talk to everybody from Bobby Scott Schwab brat and we talked to a Payton and Steve Martin and all those guys\nWe had to go out to California you get Casey 'cause he was coach in high school football so we flew I flew out there and do we talk to him and you know and he's got this always the Iceman type beer you know and he's combing through California cool\nAnd so we talked about all these games you talked about your catch and and then I said what does it mean to play football at Tennessee for you\nAnd you got choked up and you know and he got he got we have stopped tape because he got so emotional which was just it kind of blew me away a little bit because you didn't expect that from Casey but it meant a lot\nTo him to play here and have all those big wins and what he contributed to this program\n... just to be a part of this tradition of legacy you know I I Try to relate to the guys they're now understand what you represent that that tea on your helmet that tradition as it goes back a lot longer and a lot farther than you'd probably even realize so having an opportunity to represent the then\nAlso leaving your own mark that special and and and this is a special place ... and say pride and tradition never graduate and I hope\nThe guys here ... they could be a part of turn things around so I really do hope that you know there there's a lot juniors and seniors have got beat up and you must be on it's been it's been hard last year I just hope they can realize you're probably right of more than ... realized they got a chance to do something very special they really do\nAbsolutely I agree\nWell and you see rating was back on the sidelines on Saturday in a bunch of guys come back ... back and so I think the guys get it they understand and they see the banners inside the you know that this places one championships or\nWhat you're doing a great job bringing it back and making sure those guys known now for these guys understand there is life after football absolutely thank you say ... good to see its fate in one of the ... as one of the\nGood receive is going to be with us for breakfast program at the University of Tennessee\nWe'll get a rundown and college football from Chris Lowe when they come back to the mall but this is the big orange outline on the ball network\nCouldn't your team scores you can't help but smile and the team it have family

dental health Anna Greene winning smile\nThe um it's kind of natural the post office about it on CNN hidden it and that's why we got to do and that's what we're products of man overseeing things ahead it a hit a vertical down here\nAnd there wasn't it sometimes you can't teach that you've got to be able to kind of feeling before they get there is you gotta fill it in a you've got to be able to see everything ... you are you have two weeks before they are bringing in what do you want to work on what does this team did work\nExecution focusing on details\nSince ... just said that this team needs to practice a lot in the next two weeks to work in these little yeah we're going to be out there I guarantee you got a better feeling don't you have to show what your game or the team play\nWe definitely do is you got to buy it and believe it man and this guy that executing\nChandler this which great clips great player interview save time with online checking a great clip skip the app and go to great clips dot com\nChandler has talked a lot with Alvin ... about how do you do this how to how to get on the flat how do you get open how to catch the ball how to run a that's kind of style and uh I I think Chandler it's shown it can be a weapon because he's got that great speech\nHe he does and I think he's the guy that I can be effective from the tail back position or\nOutside or you know running a little option rats like a ... you know get him the ball and space you saw the other day when he got the ball out in space and he may and he did was go\nYou don't want to talk to him about the the vision\nAnd a running backs that's one thing you can't really teach them yeah most great running backs either understand it and feel it and you have to cut back naturally and some like right now banks wants to run over people Chandler wants to run around them and so to be a great back you're going to be able to do that run around\nThere is also I mean to me when you have poor running back but we're running back\nThink those guys need to get rid of them the game I think you need to get to because I think it changes the pays for the defense but I also think you've got to give\nA good running back more than five or six eight touches whatever history I think those guys they get a feel for the game come to the speed of the line backers other fitting and that vision I mean you gotta you gotta get wraps and you got to get the full of the game I just don't know if we'd had anybody at that spot get in the flow of the game\nWhen Chandler records missed the one game and so that took some theories away from him but I Would think if you would talk to\nSome Germany Pruitt maybe a ... would like to have seen him get the ball more than five times from scratch yeah he he likes running backs that that pushed to pile yeah much more than\nYou're going to get our guys and they will miss end up in the end I mean I I'm more we give me some touchdown scores still on at Alabama stuff but anyway uh\nWe uh I like ... Chandler because he's got some jump and he you know it's like ... ... hits you watching\n... you know China's got a lot of that and I think they should they should take advantage of you know you were ... I just remember the Texas saying I'm game I noted on that show and you're thinking\nWhat a weapon yes you know where's your been so anyway that's he's having a great year in the NFL is so we wish him the best of luck in ... one of the bus bought as well we'll continue with more\nTalking about Tennessee put more on the patio here at dinner and barbecue back in the mall but this is the big orange outline on the ball network\nIn Crossville is the one car and all of our goals the\nTri homeless forty one of your love and mini Cooper ask whoever summer I'm only forty miles one Seventy nine them on twenty four team jeep wrangler on limited with ... three eighty nine of them have Kurt has\nYou cover give us a call one eight hundred by us they want to Shore Drive ... three Seventeen just one mile south on the rise of the online twenty four seven Dave Kirk dot com\nAnd you're a Senate seat sports fan so check out the place was poor as soon as the name of the center he'll sports movies the offer Cumberland largest pontoon dealer with many and South Bay on Tuesday\nPlus quality free on bond to most ski boats family cruisers and fishing boats split service convenience stores and financing available\nCenter hills for his marine\nVoices their name one mile from soil movie oh center he'll lay the center hill sports marine dot net and your\nTeam scores you can't help but smile and the team that have family dentistry helps keep them smile healthy offerings to nation dentistry for more comfortable anxiety free way to take care of your teeth doctors Kevin in Sandy have part of the team you can count on for dental health Anna Greene winning smile\nFind out more about ... dentistry from the team and have family dentistry called five to six sixteen fourteen fetch five to six sixteen fourteen per visit to have dinner street dot com\nLive sometimes your head sometimes you get a set back but you can't afford to let anything knock you out of the game for over eighty years Farm Bureau who served as members in Putnam county with trusted auto home life and health coverage\nAnd for more than twenty seven years filler Baker has been on your Farm Bureau agent Farm Bureau meal Fishell insurance company or the tennis evolves eleven sixty five south willow avenue calling for three to Fifteen Seventy one today and learn why Tennessee turns to Farm Bureau\n[noise]\nPollination not sure what were the game or more years and help you check out the Facebook Twitter Instagram for inspiration on how to wear your big orange gearing style\nOf bringing the latest fashion trends and information on brand new tendency products in stores now\nGo Vols\nImmense Exxon Mobil field test scientist observes subject day at station with dealing with synergy gasoline available and three grades and meticulously engineered to help protect them from deposits while giving you better gas mileage clearly subject days intelligent [noise] maybe subject wants to get a burger and be best friends [noise] subject days later the\nInclusion synergy gasoline gets you better gas mileage subject as a maybe for burgers and best friend's\nExxon Mobil energy lives here fuel economy claims compared with gasoline beauty minimum government standards results were very close to the Exxon Mobil dot com for details\nSearch for great barbecue as over award winning dead end barbecue uh thirty six Twenty one so little of that but it would Knoxville features hand\nPulled pork and chicken sliced beef brisket smoke sausage and St Louis style spare ribs there fresh meats are dry rub that slow cooked for up to Seventeen hours with hard with smoke for\nPure East Tennessee barbecue several sides that are made daily homemade deserted ice cold beer there's a lot of good barbecue around the SEC but in Tennessee the place to be is that the debt in voted one of America's top one hundred barbecue restaurant\nI wasn't sure what we get out and see\nCome into the season you know they changed officers coordinators always run had told me he felt more comfortable with and fingers op officer coordinator\nThey look or ... looked like they got an identity finally on the opposite side of football their resumes you just look at resumes is just go to the football ...

Mogadishu October three four Nineteen Ninety three twenty five years right about now the U.S to push forces rangers others into a rescue effort in the area Mogadishu was collapse to our understanding this is the George W. Bush administration\nLate in the administration uh and\nThen the Clinton Administration inherited it so that's why in late Ninety three the U.S is still involved with special forces and operations the movie Black Hawk down is telling a Hollywood telling of the first battle Mogadishu so rosy on Tom Johnson or here so we know\nThat we've been fighting in and around Mogadishu for twenty five years at least twenty six twenty seven years have you stretch back to the early days of the U. S. landing in Somalia bill the Italians who struck some in Mogadishu what is the expectation\nAnd Italian a unit of part of the European in Somalia was in a in a district in Mogadishu with the Shabaab suicide bombers as soon as you know twenty five plus just about twenty five years later\nYou know al Qaida continues to halt the west\nIn Somalia and and and I was involved in the black Hawk Down incident Mohammed ... who was killed in one of the nine ... kind of military leader he was in Mogadishu\nOr some other kind of trainers and they instructed the tribesmen who were fighting the U.S during the black Hawk Down incident on how to get the u._s.\nFox and the the voter the tail rotor and that's what brought them down and cause you know the the the may lay and that lasted ... days in the city so you know we continue to fight allocated to this day to Bob in its branch there as we noted earlier\nThey uh they they Shabaab likes to use suicide attacks against everyone and anyone that it can ah it it\nHad a a ... in Somalia is one of the we were the first I Believe there's two or three American suicide bombers um that have conducted attacks Somali that's for the first American suicide bomber enough that it's attacking and and I believe you hit a un compound a couple of years ago and killed dozens of people\nAnd so the Italian operation was struck by the Shabaab a operation do we operate just quickly bill do we operate forces on the ground in Mogadishu absolutely\nThe U.S special forces a partner up with African Union and Somali forces and when we launch airstrikes often it's because we engage with Shabaab and there's heavy combat and airstrikes or team bailout um our forces and to the office of the partner forces there\nYes the long war we think it's Afghanistan no Somalia twenty five years and counting Tom you know that Mogadishu the the Shabaab still mentioned a county when they when they remember their origins\nYeah you know it's still not really understood a John but one thing is we have to document all the time is the fact that Shabaab and other groups like them around the world have adopted the kind of program all the way through and this includes all sorts of\nDifferent operational I'm sort of a strategies and tactics right down to the ideology and sort of the playbook there for who they are going to reference as sort of key ideological figures and in their thinking and how they look at the world and ... and the county is certainly one of them\nUm you know Shabaab has referenced the economy's in their propaganda and the Taliban is well a number of times and this this is just not something we find to be uncommon with a lot of these groups and it's one of the one of the indicators that we look at the show how these groups are in fact I'll ... or a part of all kinda\nWe go to advise the attack on a military parade many wounded many dead and last week when we discussed this there were videos provided by the attackers of the martyrs in the operation but it's in much dispute these last days by Tehran\nThat the attackers were ISIS a mock news agency put an announcement out part time you tell me their airstrikes launched by the Iranians in Syria that seemed to be a coincidental\nWell the Iranians struck Islamic state targets in eastern Syria as a response for what happened in Nevada that the tacit admission by the Iranians the display over bluster they know that it was in fact the Islamic state the carried out the attack\nThe Iranians for their own reasons and their own interests are very keen to blame anything on the Saudis the Americans Israelis there's a whole laundry list of sort of actors that they try and point the finger at but the bottom line is that there's there was early on after this attack was already evidence that it was the Islamic state not dispositive\nNot foolproof but there was strong evidence that it was the Islamic state and that evidence I Would say in my judgment is gotten only stronger over time including with these airstrikes by the Iranians which as I said it's sort of a tacit admission that they think Islam if they did but John in the last\nFifteen seconds go ahead and\nLet me said even released a very special message from its spokesman touting the attack and advise and that's not the type of thing they do unless they really mean that they did it Tom just\nBuild roads you they are a senior fellow and the foundation for the defense of democracy they keep the long war journal not just Afghanistan but back to Somalia twenty five years now I'm John ...

Seventy seven Seventy seven\nPlus if you add in what John was referring to in the beginning you got to see June paying who basically maybe thinks he's got a closing window of opportunity to deal with us\nBecause he's concerned about his economy his ... got to be concerned about other things this is a very good time to take the United states on so that's why you know people talk about a quote unquote decade of concern I think that it's or maybe a couple of years of concern and those couple of years that is their right now\nThe Chinese ministry of defense complained that dictator violated Chinese saw China's sovereignty know Vietnam and Taiwan also claim this fattening islands Gordon does a destroyer captain make a decision on his own to come this close to ... I mean all the park and\nIt totally dominate the area or they're dealing with a super warship and its wired into our network so it's not alone out there does that destroying the captain the P L A navy started captain makes its decision on the spot or we see under orders is he talking to Beijing when he does this\nYeah I'd be really really\nIt's making decisions on his own because that's not the way the Chinese military works in addition to all the chain of command issues because for instance are kept in was not making decisions on his own but you know in China is much more tightly controlled you've got political officers at all levels in the military so these decisions were being made back in ... during a at extremely\nHigh level fatty mean you mentioned in our camp grooms acting under orders to can you explain that this\nIs the freedom of navigation operation these are not planned by the commander of a ship these are plan not even at the level of seven fleet or I think that we're talking about ... of the commander of the Indo Pacific region\nWhich would be Honolulu and probably even up further up the change to the chief of naval operations the top admiral\nAnd indeed I I wouldn't be surprised if the president himself were generally a prize of what the navy was going to do maybe not on a specific um pass by like this one but in general what the plan was so clearly this politically sensitive on both sides and you're not going to have decisions being made at the lowest levels\nA detailed garden we're told within these last hours that secretary mad as he will not make\nA trip to China a it's a little unclear whether there was a trip planned and they called it off or whether they were planning and they just decided not to go forward do you find any significance Gordon given Mr Mattis his last visit where there were shop words that the Chinese are no longer talking ...\nYeah well this is significant you know there were going to be a meeting um they had maybe specifically a ... a set the time but they were definitely going to have it because this was part of an established dialogue\nAnd what happened is the Chinese said that um Secretary Mattis is counterpart was not going to be available so of course the Pentagon I'm\nNo called off that trip [noise]\nYou know this is one of those cases where you've you've got the Chinese throwing a temper tantrum is in their interest to have this milk Tamil exchanges and they're calling them off because they're upset about one thing or another and we're seeing this temper tantrum play out it's like you've got sucks in Beijing who are now acting like three year olds\nThat society is doing so what is Madison now when the when the he his counterpart is available or does he accepted\nMeeting does he know where does he said well you know I might not be available now myself\nYeah I ... that's a great question Thaddeus and that decision is not going to be made by Mattis that's going to be made um maybe by the president in consultation with his senior White house staff\nUm you know clearly I think that the administration and say look you know we're not just not available for meetings with you until you guys decide to act responsibly that would be my response unfortunately that's not the way people in Washington think\nPeople in Washington think that you've got to have engagement you got to have these contacts\nAnd so therefore they appeared desperate to the Chinese to have\nThese discussions these discussions do produce anything you know except we produce a lot of carbon as we fly over to Beijing are they fly here for really no purpose at all the Chinese are not willing to talk they're not willing to act responsibly I just don't see the point of talking to them\nCoordinate question because you do a great deal of Congress to have a great deal conversations with major media figures and you travel\nHave we passed a point guard and where the relationship is broken how we how are we past that now are we I Know we're very well informed this audience is very well informed China but I Can't tell whether they're still feeling whether there's still some sense\nAnd repair job but we shouldn't try to repair it because we're pure to desperate in the past\nYou know what the you know the past ...\nYeah I think the Chinese right now are not willing to talk so I don't see this being repaired um because we're not going to make the effort they're not going to make the effort we have got to raise all sorts of issues of their objectionable conduct they're going to react badly to this\nSo I don't see that we're going to have good relations as people to find good\nFor a very long time I think the relations are going to be good because good is getting what you want good is standing up for your principles we haven't done that for very long time John and you know people can complain a lot about this president but he's doing the right thing with regard to China and we need

if you drink it is not true but when he says there's so many people that have yet to find that hard to believe and I\nMean again there are various levels of of drinking I mean he said that he's he drank more than he should have but of course is the real issue here is not whether or not he at one time even if he had blacked out\nA better than up itself is not what's at issue here the idea is that he would have done something horrendous like sexually assaulting somebody I mean for example I uh I I drank too much of an occasion but it's sort of didn't improve my my capacity for sexually assaulting anybody you know I just simply\nI lose interest in the world you know\nYeah he's ever been arrested in either think that it's so I I certainly understand that but when at on a college student in the eighties I find that hard to believe\nAs well as does the ad that the majority of college students in the eighties did not suffer blackouts as such\nA again or even if they they drank more than they should have there are gradations of drinking and they do not in my mind constitute an issue of uh of confidence to hold disposition especially for someone who today apparently a drinks

encourage more auto manufacturing in the U.S and higher wages for those Americans making those parts\nThe Dodgers a gym has this report from Washington on why administration officials say this could also affect a lot of other prices we pay like for dairy products chicken and wheat\nThroughout the campaign I promise to renegotiate NAFTA and today we have kept that promise\nPresident Donald Trump says the newly named United States Mexico Canada agreement to us and CIA it's the largest us trade deal ever made the agreement came together hours before the October first deadline\nOr a number of Mormons [noise] died I kept pressing\nDeal requires forty to forty five percent of auto content be made by workers earning at least sixteen dollars an hour the most advanced protections for workers\nEver and requires more of a vehicle part to be made in North America in order for the carts be free from terrorists maker Ford says it's very encouraged by this quote to benefit the scale and global reach will help to drive volume and support manufacturing jobs\nThere it was a deal breaker in a win for the U.S the deal will also open up Senate candidate dairy market to us farmers that could produce better prices in the U.S milk butter cheese yogurt and ice cream this deal must be signed by Congress within sixty days a Congress that could include a democratic controlled house after mid term elections\nAnd be democratic support for this is a lot of things worked into these remnants Mexico and Canada are very helpful for workers and labor unions for that matter so let's say it might be surprised\nIn Washington I'm In ...\nAnd the president says that steel and aluminum tariffs remain in place on Canadian and Mexican imports the White House officials say they will negotiate that issue separately from this trade deal was take a look at just what has happened here\nWith our guest Michael butler is a public policy analyst professor of finance at Stockton University and the

gym ... one eight six six five oh jumbo one eight six six five oh five or six to six delighted to have you on the program tonight as we are talking about the new deal had been worked out with Mexico and Canada\nAnd do that deal has a ... is designed to replace NAFTA was something that is a little more American friendly we'll see just how that goes over with or the Congress or whichever Congress it turns out to be of course with the mid term elections coming up and keep in mind of course\nThat although there are elections in November the new Congress will not actually take power until January so you could have sixty days left with this Congress I'll be at a with a a a lame duck Congress\nAnd the doctor Michael ... is our guest is a public policy analyst and professor of finance at Stockton University and\nA lot of what we've been saying here I think goes to the very core of a problem but I have always seen with the sort of thing and I guess I could summarize it this way that the more that a free trade zone involves disparate economies\nThe less likely is it to succeed and again that's just right off the top of my head and I never got past econ one oh one but it just strikes me\nThat a disparate economies don't work things out so well so I think what I'd probably both surprised about is that we worked out this deal with by far the week or less developed of the three North American economies Mexico first\nAnd it's the Canadians who is the economy is much more similar to ours with whom we're having the biggest trouble so if you would address my theory a professor you may give me an a through an ethanol take my lumps go ahead [laughter]\nWell let me let me say this um you're you're you're correct um unless the less then developed country has some real advantage and making something versus another country for instance\nTo pose the a and here's the example I use my classrooms um suppose the the the U.S needs a week and they need coffee\nSo we're very efficient at producing wheat we have the right climate for it we use a small amount of resources get a large amount of we\nWere not so good at making coffee we don't have the right climate for it we can use a lot of resources and not get much coffee\nA country like Columbia let's say and South America is just the opposite they don't have the climate or to grow wheat nor the the know how do they have to use a lot of resources and get a little bit of weight on the other hand they have a great\nThey use a little bit of resources to get a lot of coffee what happens they say suppose the U. S. specializes in making just we were going to get huge amounts of wheat\nColumbia says okay will specialize in just making coffee we get huge amounts of coffee then we'll trade our coffee for you and we both countries end up with more coffee and more week without adding any more resources\nSo free trade benefits everybody well why is somebody complaining you would say and the answer is if we stop making coffee in my example that make just wheat anybody making coffee is out of a job you say well you can go make we\nBut the skills may not be transferable from the industries that leave to the industries that are build up and that's what happened in in Canada the U.S has an ... is very efficient at making dairy products\nTo to get free trade you should let us make the dairy products and sell them in Canada we'd end up both countries would end up with more a production of dairy products but the problem is what happens is the Canadian dairy farmers well they should go do something else but\nThey say we don't want to do something else do we want to continue to make dairy products for and that's what the rub is with with Canada\nTo a call from Sharon in ... Missouri a grieving Sharon\nGood evening can and about ... ... to to think I heard today only once on radio news that China has announced that they are going to be paying carrots\nOn unspecified items and it sounds like there's going to be quite a few items that they are terrified and second\nBase bad trade agreements that we had had\nThis I'm Sorry I I just I'm too jaded anymore I Do not believe it added some how to its stake notion of what we've got to help everybody else\nThere is one law that goes about all of their lives when it comes to politics the tower and that gets followed them money and if you follow it influence\nThat is put on our politicians\nBy that lobbyist by different governments by our own government if you follow that money you will find exactly why we have had bad trade agreements ratified\nWell we're coming up on a break your a lift the Dodger give is linked here I'm sure in more learned opinion after the break a share and I will add a couple of things here uh to what you just said please stay on the line of one would be of course that are no matter how much lobbying occurs on behalf of foreign governments of goodness knows there's a ton of that\nOutright passage of money to a political candidates for public office from foreign sources is very much a no no and the second thing is I think you are vastly underestimate him the extent to which so many elites in this country ... oh so so guilty about how rich we are I'm jumbo handed and we'll be back in just\nA moment it's going to be the talk of town for a Ninety four point one\nHow about some smart and talk for a great dinner Utah Ninety four point one wants to send you to talk like that are on I\nGrew I headed to the lights are down ... points on\nLog on to talk for a one downtown now and then you might win Seventy five dollar gift certificate and enjoy it unless you have the White House and\nOnly from news talk\nAnd my wife's ... funeral I saw something I never saw before a this is Brian Presley press the funeral one of the sons of the deceased to send his dad a letter or a few years ago asking him questions about different details and memories she had through his law\nDead responded to all the questions and they shared those memories at the funeral Presley funeral home we realized how this would benefit other than [noise] so we're now a partner with be remembered that town which may be accessed through our link on our website ... funeral home to do is private Web site where you can plan everything\nWe rages another point is a dumping I'm going to bring up when we come back from the break but the point is you you said that ... we\nWe shouldn't have to give the the Chinese our ah our intellectual property secrets but of course to build a plant in China Today that's exactly what the Chinese epics corrected from us\nAnd we'll come back and talk some more about uh some of the the Chinese applications that possibly this new trade agreement with Mexico and Canada a may preview one eight six six by boat jumbo with our guest\nDr Michael Bostwick from Stockton University in just a moment [laughter]\nI'm a ... so I have one job I Can't staff sounds high for being John ... who can give you twenty four seven thousands of life is agent always been around for over Seventy five years and as a Ninety seven percent satisfaction rating five just got mediocre and he says ... cycle\nAuthorizing award winning\nNo he didn't\nDie co expect great savings\nQuicken Loans America's premier home purchase lender\nWe've created a new way to protect you from unpredictable interest rates are exclusive rate shield approval first we lock your interest rate for up to Ninety Days then it rates go up your rates days locked but you've rates go down your rate drops either way you win call us today at eight hundred quicken or go to rocket mortgage dot com\nRacial upheaval only certain three year fixed rate loan Scott precaution permission and conditions people having liquor licensing office effects analyst number thirty thirty initial conditions are exclusion may play\nOnce a day for tennis you ready to play a is everything All right this site is ... electric dean knows that allergy congestion can get in a way of enjoying the moment to go ahead and practice without ...

dot com [noise]\nTalking about the jumbo Hannah Joe one eight six six five oh jumbo one eight six six five oh five or six to six were talking to Dr Michael butler from Stockton University a professor of finance there and also a public policy analyst and we're looking at the new proposed a trade deal again it's not a done deal yet it has to get congressional approval\nBut uh it I suppose it does a lot of a stretch to assume that even a badly divided Congress\nWould be able to say yes to a fair amount of what is in this\nLet's talk to David ... calls in from San Francisco tonight to David good evening\nJim up in your guest out here in San Francisco we've got two major a financial problems directly tied to this Chinese steel\nAnd uh one is the bay bridge which got opened a just a fabulously shore to five years ago and it was\nThis was the new post earthquake Bay Bridge right\nRight yeah and in fact if you remember just the dollar value uh at at in the Nineteen eighty nine earthquake they said it would be a quarter of a bill\nNew bridge opened a couple of years ago it was a what six billion dollars in costs in six billion and financing so it went well forty eight times to become a twelve billion dollar broken rich and I was defective when it when it opened\nThen are you saying that that was built with with Chinese steel oh yeah and what was going well I didn't know that yeah and what\nWas significant about it are no rules the governor and this crosswords\nAre right okay yeah\nThat was the Republican governor and Willie Brown was the former mayor the two of them put it together and they created they actually created a foundry in China to manufacture the ... the bridge apart there were very few repeating part so it was almost entirely custom\nHand the they had something like twenty thousand inspectors per part\nAre you know each park had to have an inspector massive heart ... almost to the to the man they refused to accept delivery on the part yet it was over written by a a project manager who had no right to override\nWell that that sounds like a terrible deal I must say although I'm not sure quite how it fits into the uh the context of this discussion regarding a trade matters other than the fact that I I guess a professor bus or you should always look twice when dealing with the Chinese [noise]\nBut after a current in Rochester, Minnesota is next to below ...\nHigh you know the thing that bothers me about the ah the steel here from China and is if you drive a car\nA lot and you have to have your brakes re done you may have found out over the last Twenty years that you can't turn a rotor\nAnymore because the Chinese steel that all the car owners are made out of it is so poor that it is not turn of all\nYou know years ago you used to be able to take a break rotors or your drums in and you could Milam down and get another life out of them but nowadays everybody has to throw away their owners because the ... the Chinese steel maybe cheaper\nBut the quality is also cheaper\nAll right I Want our guest to comment about that we've had two calls regarding the quality of uh dealing with the Chinese\nIf it's that bad at least in regard to steal I mean you know when you when you buy a a broom at Walmart you're really not looking for the the\nThe the nicest brew him out there you want something that will sweep the floor or something like visiting well I mean a indicates will break drums are about it's not such a good thing in the case of bridges and that's a terrible thing maybe you will die\nOr is that the other problem in trading with the Chinese the question of quality if you do we had a question some time back about\n... I forget who was food or pharmaceuticals but there was some serious question about Chinese quality\n[noise] yeah that's that's always an issue in a product like steel obviously quality is a essential there especially are going into products\nOr like a bridge or something that could cause some severe or injuries but how about some of the uh smaller consumer products look at the textile industry\nSo if I'm the California used to have a huge textile industry and workers were making let's say twenty dollars an hour and as a result of that they made a real nice shirt that sold for fifty dollars\nWell they decided to outsource to make the ... the uh shirts in China where people are at the time or paid about a dollar a day so now they can make the shirt uh and\nTwenty dollars so well that some people would say that's a very positive thing uh it's negative in that people will lose jobs here but it's positive in that all consumers now can purchase much more goods and services because the prices are are lower\nExcept of course those workers were out of work who can't afford anything at all [noise] I mean the notion that we should we should we should build our economy strictly around consumers uh that that strikes me as a little short sighted and in fact it may be one of the principal reasons for what happened in the twenties sixteen presidential election\nThat's right uh so uh up until Donald Trump the the thought was well\nLook let's try to get these products to the consumers that the lowest possible price even if you have to sacrifice a low quality get it at the lowest possible price that means consumers will be able to buy more things\nThat as a result of that they should have a higher standard of living\nOne guy saw news on the hour presented by

... the statute of limitations\nI've heard from the from lawyers that there is no statute of limitations on sex assault in Maryland so ...\nSo then you can just say anything you want years or so and I I my my point is they are already set a precedent with Roy Moore on this stuff and a guy and so we let them get away with that and they gave rails way more for something decades ago and he was a Supreme Court judge of Alabama after all that\nAnd as well as Brett Kavanaugh already building a high level of judge for years and years so and I just think this is the cost to overthrow this country and I and I think they're going to be successful actually saw what well I'm\nCalling just attempt what about all those good people out there who truly believe Christine board has a arguments\nBut I really don't care because you think that have been doing at the\nTime that that it it makes no difference to me\nAnd they started she shouldn't have been there it's a it's just a scam the other that that I\nBelieve that not one that I think it's a complete set up and I think she's a scam artist and a it's a sham and a and I'm not one to really pull for elite is like Brett Kavanaugh by the way it is John Roberts we went to a same dog and pony show and then he gave us All right and uh\nAnd so I don't really think Brett Kavanaugh's worth really fighting for ... from that standpoint but at the same time I just think it's a it's a red herring\nYeah that's one of the things about a Supreme Court justices you never know what they're going to do when they get on the bench so ah there had been

build a mile a road and\nYou know the the roads in Texas are far better they are that better than they are in California so you know they are the politicians are drafted the pilots summer in a way that is going to make it a little bit tougher but I'm telling you for anybody paying attention or they're\nNot happy about this the gas tax and that's going to be repealed up I promise you that\nMy guess is John Cox he's running for governor in California as a Republican his website is John Cox for governor dot com John Cox for governor dot com John Cox a a superior court judge recently ruled a that charter cities cannot be forced to abide by the sanctuary state law was signed by Governor Brown explain that to people\n[laughter] well yeah and this is a a monumental decision because the sanctuary state law for basically protects MS Thirteen I mean that's what I was there to do it\nAnd ... avenue so it was all in favor of that but I got to tell you that the mothers and fathers of young or Hispanic kids as well as other kids in this day don't want\nI must Thirteen in California mounted this lawsuit and very gratified that the courts held that charter cities don't have to comply with the uh law and let me tell you it's going to be a non issue after him the governor of his were get it going to get rid of it\nJohn Cox before this happened I didn't know the difference between a general lost city in a charter city he turns out that the largest cities in the in the state\nUh San Francisco or LA San Diego Fresno these are all so called charter signal over things like I'm a police authority and therefore they can uh cooperate with a with the federal immigration him if they want to uh during routine traffic stops and worry about the immigration status of people\nUh this is not what the governor wants to happen but apparently if you weren't charter city and there are about a hundred and twenty\nYou have all these rights but you don't have as a general law city\nAnd uh but I wouldn't my breath waiting for San Francisco to do anything about this uh I mean you\nKnow they're they're in the process of trying to get that the state to approve a a ... sites where addicts and shoot up in a nice the you know clean environment which I think is it's certainly ridiculous and it's not gonna horrendous drug addiction that's afflicting California\nJohn Cox when are you in a debate your opponent\nAt ten am a radio station and he doesn't want to face me across a table on live television Larry I mean he's afraid that my good luck so\nJust you know over a yeah\nBut really it's really actually uh he'll look like such a young connects them a a which is good and I promise not to use his youth and inexperience against\nThem John Cox speaking of of good looks he he it by a ... and I'm thinking maybe that's why you been able to get away with some of the stuff he's gotten away with this is the guy who had an affair with his best friend who was his campaign manager the wife of his best friend who is his campaign manager who does that\nUh I don't know that's the broke called people tell me a re I've got so many issues that people don't want the rest of the California looking like San Francisco does these days I mean\nYou need a roadmap to avoid the feces on the sidewalk so you know I don't think Mr newsrooms answers or California or anywhere near what people want

trade agreements with an incredible new U.S go Canada agreement\nCalled us embassy a sort of just work and [noise] we have negotiated this new on the principle of fairness and reciprocity\nTo me it's the most important word and trade because we've been treated so unfairly by so many ... all over the world that we're changing that by the way without tariffs we wouldn't be talking about a deal just for those babies out there that keep talking about tariffs that didn't please don't charge tariffs\nWithout terrorists wouldn't be we wouldn't be standing here I can tell you Bob and all of these

where the most advanced protections for workers ever develop\nNow caller asked me if I'm prepared to apologize of course not\nLet me tell you something initially President Trump talked about terrorists in uh for national security remember that never mind that we produce most of our studio here and the two other major suppliers Canada and mix centuries so the national security stuff with the U.S and you know if he's not saying that\nNow if the goal is to reduce tariffs with our trading mall for in the short run doing something to make them stand down\nThe question is is this going to benefit the American consumer\nAnd next to her in New York Times called a decree for the president and it is they show did as well and it is because the campaign to reevaluate their to renegotiate NAFTA isn't going to be positive for the American consumers for example [noise] New York times points out that for the first time\nFor any tariff free vehicle must come from so called high wage factory\nAgreement says those factories listen dollars an hour in average salaries for production workers that's about triple the average wage in Mexico right now and the assumption is that division will force automakers to ship supplies from Mexico or Canada to this country\nBut there is to that automotive analysts have warned that the provision could have a damaging effect for Americans quote by raising costs were American car buyers and incentivizing automakers to move production to low cost countries outside of the country like China\nSo we don't we don't and I want to find out more about it before I determine whether or not the president has done the right thing with NAFTA and know what's popular\nAmong the base especially and now that has become a anti free trade and um the Republican Party also anti free trade are both parties now have pretty much the same position on trade\nOne more time\nThis is about consumers and tariffs if they are designed to protect industries that are that are failing or prevent the business people from doing the kinds of things they need to do in order to make those businesses competitive\nAnd if the idea is to retaliate against or the other countries for so called dumping products on us dumping simply means of other companies are are being subsidized by their government\nThey're not making money but they are being subsidized by

campaign and we're now starting to learn to things or at least that bad and may be worse what in your view was the motivation my personal thought would be that the motivation has to do with this sense that\nThe United states is oh so rich and the rest of the world was oh so poor and therefore we owe it to other countries do shaft ourselves and ah and therefore make it easier for other countries but which is a pretty lame excuse in my view\nYes yeah I I'm not sure what exactly the motivation is but every single one of the trade agreements is lopsided in favor of the trade partner laughed at what we have with the European Union agreements with China\nSouth Korea which we sort of fixed a little bit last time a last week rather and Japan to their all lopsided and as a result of that or buying a

pay their workers are they started out as a dollar a day there are a little bit uh over that but\nIf we make things in in China instead of making it in the U.S and having a shirt costs fifty dollars making in China bring it over here it only costs twenty five dollars consumers will be able to buy more shirts they should have a higher standard of living and that's good for consumers\nIn the

people love that even the trade group with standing behind him off and leave for an hour well he took questions Tucker\nTucker you're you're very interesting because as much as you're into the traditional\nWashington speak as as a way it's always done you wide open to doing something to do it taking in Trump and noticing rather than judging notice he's doing things different but saying not necessarily he's doing things wrong that's different than a lot of\nA lot of Republicans in a lot of Democrats why you open to that\nBecause it's needed because the decisions that the people in charge made have been disastrous not just small decisions for big decisions on the economy and foreign policy on the culture they're having to work that's why the middle classes dying that's Trump got elected\nThat's the best part of the downside of Trump because he doesn't know how to get things done because he doesn't understand government doesn't care about details but the best part\nIs his willingness to say obviously through things like maybe we should secure the borders or what are we still doing in Afghanistan or why are the other signatories to our trade deals not living up to their end of the bark and et cetera those are all totally true things that everybody agrees with except in Washington or the people who made the decisions are embarrassed to admit they're wrong\nTrump takes a lot of crap for not apologizing that's a fair criticism but how about the policymakers who got us into this garbage in the first place where they apologized never what did they learn from their mistakes nothing\nI mean did you know what I'm saying like that's the best part about Trump is telling obvious truth is\nI always know you as an opinion guide the Daily Caller is part of that you know so you decided to to launch that\nUh and it's doing shit incredibly well it's on everyone's punch list in the morning at three o'clock in the morning for me later for you to find out what's happening new and get a perspective but the other thing is you choose to do something almost nobody else does\nYou choose to book and engage people that disagree with you usually open how did you come to that or was that a no brainer for you is that a producer they told you that this you want to have to defend your argument in your a block almost every night\n[noise] no I mean that's organic that's what I Believe it I mean I'm very liberal in the truest sense of liberal I Believe in free speech and the free exchange of ideas I Believe in openness I really do\nI don't I'm exactly the same on the air as I'm off the air I only say what I really think I you might think I'm a total buffoon maybe you're right but it's sincerely who I Am and I think that you should if you're advocating for something explain what it is you're advocating for\nExplaining reasoning what exactly are you saying these are not hard things you seek to influence public policy in the way three hundred million people live their lives you should have to explain it I I sincerely believe in that it's a core beliefs\nBut you also research you're not just winning it and going on instinct you are to defend your argument would you research and go to be you can go deep on your argument you can go layers deep you're not going to just out a out yell somebody\nWell yeah but I mean the the good news for me is I control what the terms are so\nI decided what we talk about and I don't know I don't know much about the law the sea treaty or abstract art so we don't do a lotta segments on those things which is a shame it is a shame actually I'm I'm against both just for the record right but we do topics that I care about that I think are really important immigration is one of them and\nI don't know that's what I'm paid to do is to learn about stuff so I Do write\nYou you're the one who gets paid I did not know who that was so we did break here on the top of the name of the book and we're going to talk about this a of a ... as long as the book is a out and you want to come back\nBut you look at the Democratic party and under a minute and you said this thing has changed I get this is a different debate we're having I asked you sent TV Patel wait until the radio audience the bottom\nLine is it's a mirror image of what it was when I grew up and the things that they once defended free speech due process colorblindness they now attack why because now they are in power and so the people in power always against priests\nThe population into tribes in order to rule them than it is to try to rule over United country I mean that liberals took power and so they became the opposite of what they were and that's the best found on college campus exact exactly\nSadly yes right\nTucker Carlson up and

the uh in the legal system in the law in the community have his reputation so a couple of things\nWhen it comes down to the actual vote itself\nIt's going to come down to Murkowski Collins and flick so Senator Jeff flake asked say I'm going to vote this out of committee but I'm going to give it seven days and by friday I Want to investigation and then we'll move forward or not depending on what they find try to read between the lines I since he's hedging cut seven\nDoes no good to have an investigation that just gives us more cover for example we actually need to find out where we can find out how we have to realize that we may not be able to find out everything that happened uh we've got to do in Folsom investigation\nYeah what does that mean now to the president's credit a quarter of the Washington Post and he said it publicly I said to these I told the FBI expand it if you have to you know whenever you have to fall would you have to follow now that said you were a person who comes out and sat down with Kate Snow of NBC\nIt's fiction novel I challenge you to listen to her speak and not have all the all the fire alarms in your head go off and say not telling the truth not telling the truth not telling the truth sadly if she was the victim of of uh which he claims is\nA group set on unwanted group sex\nThat is terrible but she cannot link Kavanaugh's to the scene that he had a red caught that he would hand to women that these punch was spiked at a high school party\nThat he was around the punch bowl is that going to be okay with you can you'll life withstand these types of wild cat allegations\nSo Lindsey Graham looked at this as seeing how this has developed obviously he knows Kavanaugh for Twenty years fan of 'em on every level and says this cut their team\nI don't think we're going to find anything new from the supplemental FBI investigation to take Jeff from a yes or no I think than Murkowski answer Collins wanna make sure that the FBI\nDid their homework the check the committee's work that that ... that that our work was good I think that's what this is all about no more not expanding it to all this crazy stuff\nNow listen and Lindsey Graham has got to do something that they used to do that you would expect which what college do and I think he would just sit down with her and say listen you're Republican forget about this guy the sexual assault thing does not stand up it wouldn't stand up to a relative in your house or good friend of yours you would not accept it\nSo you saw his record you see President Bush making calls and constantly surprised backing them thoroughly pride Blakeman worked with them every single day you see the people that know him don't\nGet caught up and pay back for not ceding talking to Merrick Garland that is what the foundation of this\nAnd a lot of these people at Yale or liberals and see a change in the court and the change in the country if he ceded and willing to say yeah I saw him drunk maybe it was having a few beers and the whole way doesn't mean he didn't he thing wrong\nAnd Deborah Ramirez says I have some people that are ... by story will see because if you're going to corroborate your story maybe you should have told the New Yorker because it didn't come up and the New Yorker magazine story a jealousy on news Ninety six five and a window Hey Joe\nYeah obviously the Democrats ... but I didn't want to point out that when you're accused of a criminal act you should take the fifth and I think the judge was really stupid to\nGive any testimony regarding this\nReally I don't think he had a choice\nWhat he wanted to ...\nTo ... but he would say this was occurring mental accusation or take the ...\nI don't get ... what's the what's the point of view there you are in other words but if you're innocent till proven guilty and you're innocent why wouldn't you use that opportunity to show your innocent\nTo the point of the Fifth Amendment is to put it on to the prosecution and say you prove it I'm not even talking about\nBut Joe oh we're not in a criminal proceeding\nNot in a criminal proceeding he's in he's testifying on his background where there was one of his three hundred nine cases or is a ten year was eight years with President Bush or his use on the on the circuit court\nThis is one of ... and now it's personal behavior these are just questions it's beyond a job interview which was supposed to be I get that but you can't say it's a criminal behavior I mean criminal proceeding\nThanks so much for the call a new way should have taken the fifth I I don't understand from that um [noise] so ... there's there's a lot going on here the person that makes the most sense who isn't just the right wing zealots\nSee Graham he has a really good idea he said they want to mix this entire thing if they want to just say oh we're not going to pass him if these Republicans will get on board we know this is ... by Jeff Flake he is out so he will not be a problem in the new uh with the new term\nWe know it's probably going to be Senator Rick Scott so that won't be a problem he will probably be chairman is Senator Lindsey Graham of the uh of the judicial branch of the judicial committee\nOf justice committee so it looks like grass is going to step aside and he basically says why don't we put it to the American people again let's decide who could control the Senate cuts Fifteen\nWould be an appeal from a political body to the people who put up the air\nAnd sea at these Trump state that elected President Trump to do exactly what he's doing a cutting taxes and appointing conservative judges they're okay with the decision there senator I don't think we're going to get there I think we're going to get fifty plus but if we thought one vote short for the good of the nation\nHow would a pill this to the people of the country and less than have a say\nAt the ballot box Joe listening in Boston Joe [noise]\nHey Ryan it's just it seems so profoundly juveniles that they're going back to high school and seeing how many beers yes yup and also the same time really hypocritical when in the last administration you had a president that admitted to cocaine use in his own books\nIn that ... at that age\nYeah exactly exactly so apparently you can't be a Supreme Court justice but you're going to be the guy that picks the Supreme Court shows\nThat is a great point which I'm not ... brought up before now some of the media say that he no longer has the credibility of the accuser it's about Kavanaugh approving his credibility which I think it's scary\nThe White House does say they will expand the investigation but they're not going to just look into how much he drank in college to look at incidents and\nIt's not clear if he's going to talk to ... or not but they are talking obviously to Deborah Ramirez all ready to talking to mark judge right now they're going to talk to Patrick Smith they could have done that already I imagine there are always going to talk to that woman ... who was friends with a doctor forward when they were younger ah I'm not sure how much further they gonna go\nCarl is you know like K O L T and Scott's bluff the Nebraska Carl\nHello Brian to love your show thanks so much Lewis honored\nYou bet ah just wanted to mention that uh the remember a Senator Reid out and about a during the election and he brought up thing that he had information that they had ever pay taxes and it was totally fall and if you're totally false and in the end a reporter finally asked him about it some time after the election\nAnd his response was well he didn't get elected ... that's exactly what's going on here\n[noise] absolutely I mean in that idiot Harry Reid or from the Democratic prospective decides to make it a simple majority and nuclear option getting these judges passed\nAnd because of that now you have Trump doing the fifty one over fifty one votes these judges get through despite the thirty hour delay of game per nominee from a Schumer and now it's Supreme Court justice you could have the new you have the nuclear option or else they would really have sway\nIn this process because you would need sixty votes but that was all Harry Reid's a bad play Chuck loose on W. L. A. D. and Poughkeepsie New York hey Chuck\n[noise] yes what's on your mind will tell you my truck\nOh yes I Want to talk about the ... of the uh the seventh or less the gracious yep they've done six before so I'm told everybody told you know what I say is that if they turn out\nThe other six water of which are more with him on which for them with our with our arms and legs of the president of the United states and all of world visitors first is a very long time I would go back and look at it certainly somebody ought to go back and look at the previous six ah\nInquiries that he's been through\nWell according to the Washington Post the president was not happy according to his advisers Kevin a talk show which tentatively about drinking with his last hearing a and at the news conference Trump was somewhat under cut cabinet when he said this ah he did Kevin acknowledged difficulty with alcohol let's listen\nI watched him I was surprised at how\nA book was about the fact that he likes beer\nAnd he's had a little bit of difficulty I mean he talked about things that happened when he drank I mean this is not a man that said that alcohol was ... that he was perfect with

great so judge spelled out from a year and Mitch McConnell we're going to get a vote by friday is he\nWell he said this week or so Mitch McConnell the Senate majority leader is on the floor right now and I've been listening to his remarks to see if he gives us any clue as to how this was going to play out now I was told yesterday we could get this FBI report\nAs early as today now that was a ... you know one very senior center Republican stores\nAnd the what's unclear is if they get the report today whether or not Susan Collins of Maine and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska that allows them to say OK let's forge ahead with this vote whether they're yes or no you know they had asked for this delay and and that's what they got if you listen to the language from Jeff Flake and the committee hearing friday he said\nIt would be hearing as early as today the FBI it's done which I'm sure Democrats would be up in arms if a then Mitch McConnell would make a move on cloture at which time we have to wait how many hours before we get to the point where he could have a vote\nWell even for the procedural yeah well again if he files at any point in the day Wednesday any point in the day one o'clock in the morning or even fifty nine at night you still got to wait a day for Thursday which means then friday you would have the procedural vote\nAnd then thirty hours after you take that proceeds will vote if you have successfully cut off the filibuster is if you've got to have college Murkowski gotta get fifty one then thirty hours later you would have the confirmation vote and that's why we tend to think that happens you know earlier than sadder\nMen that Doug Jones the means a lot doesn't it and now you look at the fact that you know the no Democrats go any confirmed Brett Kavanaugh they

staff feel as though you treat them as their favorite and others feel as though they're being under appreciated I'm going to go and do some investigative work and now the feel underappreciated what they want you to you because they feel\nTheir head or stop already\nPeople on the panel that you like better than other people that have pointed out to your favorites and then they have the authors soon you because they're being treated unfairly welcome to life\nMa'am on life has not grow up I mean the story teen style that been your mommy do your battles and getting a lawyer retain your credit the rest of your life\nBy the way the judge threw out the sued over it and I I did my one day you may or may not be back next year [laughter] I have had our eyes that by it All right\nAll right and feel better now by Joe is let's say Los Angeles Joe got some brand new stations out there will tell you mine\nWell some great stuff just I mean this this trade agreement as revolution it's on the media is not even talking about two\nThings one the Chinese to no longer import cars into Canada could both on it and say it's a Canadian car\nThose cars have to be Seventy five percent in North America and that's it one that's going for all of those American workers to\nKnow the ... the rest of them have to repay the living wage you're sixteen dollars on those carts forty four percent of the car to have to be made until ... people have to be clear this stuff all the ways of sixteen dollars ... anywhere\nIn the Americas anywhere in North America to know this was almost like a ... from burning ... quitting the miracle fruit for the living wage for the last question for them so you Mexico now why hasn't\nThe media wasn't really creating this big labor coming out and praising Donald Trump who you know why her don't hop obviously cares more about the Mexicans than the previous Mexican governments have\nKnow you've got the first deal with Mexico it shows he's not biased but people don't want to emphasize that they show the wall has nothing to do with Hispanics that's everything to do with a secure border north is better off in the south\nIt's not Hispanics or we don't want to keep a Spanish out we just want to keep all eagles out because we have a legal process you and I get that because we're saying\nOther people just want to marginalizing vilify but Donald Trump rebalance this when we start looking at this I Can't imagine a Democrat fighting this because do you know that in Mexico he basically fortified Mexican workers unions\nDo you know that he is going to help every ... lower middle class person get to middle class status because the wages go up now we might pay a little extra for cars but the average American be willing to do that knowing that we're bringing some control back\nTo auto manufacturing and some plants back here where at least made it close but what about the dairy farmers to put this president in office\nThey now or getting access to the Canadian market\nAnd not having the ridiculous tariffs and the only thing that Canadians got that I could tell him\nSo this the outside court to do to solve trade dispute just still\nIt's still a factor the Canadians wanted that we didn't we gave in there But Justin Trudeau gave in at the eleventh hour so those people who say the president's just fighting with the world are not noticing that the world is coming to agreement and with the president said yesterday about Justin Trudeau is true\nYou know he was tough negotiator uh we were going at it for a while but there's no hard feelings\nSo here's what the president said about uh Justin Trudeau and the NAFTA thing because I should give it a I should give it proper us dead um\nHe's a professional I'm a professional we had very strong tensions that it was just an unfair deal whether it was Mexico or Canada and now it's a fair deal for everybody it's a much different deal to brand new deal it's not NAFTA re done it's a brand new deal I just spoke with him we have a great relationship but we're going to work as a partner\nAnd I was keeping the steel and aluminum tariffs then I'm not sure why we're doing that when I asked a when I asked a Peter Navarro why you're leaving that and he says it's apples and oranges I don't get it I thought we did that to bring them to the table so ... about this the only take so much for the call Peter Morici was on Fox in print search this morning round for Fifteen that quickly or emailed\nA Eric to see if we could pull this off this is a bigger message to bigger message beyond North America cut forty\nTo enter the Europeans said and this was important that you know the Mexicans agreeing was one thing but don't think we're going to roll over like the Mexicans 'cause you know you you've got a lot of leverage their\nWhich is really squarely in the European camps got a free trade agreements with Europe and Britain won't have this is a clear message to China and Europe that this president is serious\nAbout not putting America above all other countries are really America First but by putting America on an equal footing and giving American workers a fair and decent chance at competing in the world\nYeah so it was a mess because we are dealing with them on on some level by the way this just in march judge good friend of Brett Kavanaugh when he was in high school has a had an interview yesterday it wasn't done it's finished\nSo mark judge would definitely be on the on the hit list you have or the woman friend of a doctor Ford she's on the hit list Dr Ford might be I'm not sure they have hours of testimony with her and might not be necessary\nOr ... might uh with the one we saw yesterday I don't think she should be I think she's an absolute travesty of justice and if I'm a Democrat\nI tell him ... Michael ... and his client you muddy the waters on the farcical claims from Brett Kavanaugh and you try it almost de legitimize is the other two the Debbie were mirrors the students and that's why\nAlan Dershowitz at one of the FBI investigation and I would have started with Julie not with the doctor for\nA NATO why because it's such a joke or Steve listening in Indiana Hey Steve\nHow're you doing great will tell you mine well I listen to your diatribe regarding the soccer kid that his mind is now suing because he didn't make JV and it was thrown out and I\nYeah I'm listening to you on the radio so I didn't see what was going on but I just wanted to point out I agree with you a hundred percent unless I find out you through ice\nThrough I I'm Sorry I I'm leaving on your own\nHey Steve I might have done worse in ... in high school I think I might have done something I regret in high school and college do you think anyone listening right now has done things in high school and college they regret\nI can be perfectly honest with you that I Walk the fence mostly through high school and college and I was fortunate enough to fall on the good side I turned out to be a pretty good guy a but\nWell let's see now I'm not as if people say well what about sexual okay it's an accusation that Brett Kavanaugh vehemently denies and he has a thirty year plus professional record which is the envy of almost every professional who is often the justice system on any level legal system on any level that I Know off\nSo you have to get him by going back to Nineteen eighty five while acknowledging from Nineteen eighty five to president which is a lotta years\nNothing went wrong so if\nShe was assaulted at a party that she doesn't remember where she was how she got there how she left\nAnd who invited her and he doesn't remember her and mark judge doesn't recall any of this and her best friend doesn't remember anything why should we ruin somebody's life because Debbie were mirrors drank so much as a freshman she blacked out and has claims\nThat did that a judge Kavanaugh now did something exposing himself to her and now she has ten witnesses to it even though it's a New Yorker magazine ruining fatter oh couldn't find these ten witnesses the\nNew York times couldn't find any witnesses now she's got ten [noise] it's amazing what can happen if the whole Democratic Party comes out in force for you [noise] thank Steve please I Hope you do an undercover an ice scandal in my ... and my background on next to let's go out to Thomas listened W.

that's I mean it really hurts it how do you beat that yeah it's really hard to ... to the story that's not even a story there's talk of the accusation year it's just the yeah they're they're just sort of mixing up words it's like a word salad with some accusations and some\nSpiked punch in mark Kavanaugh was my my favorite part is Marc Kevin Hall\nReally are you sure you're not confused yeah I mean\nWell it's a she was a she had a lot of a lot of fun last night got thirty one\nWas very aggressive a very sloppy John ... uh I saw him\nA go up to a girl so\nLittle Hansi touching them all\nParts I saw him\nTry to shift clothing\nClothing shifting and it's been there forever or every kid love to closing shift and by the way getting Hansi whatever what\nAre you talking about you just can't throw this stuff out there when the when the accused and even know who you are well what do you refer to notice mark judge Joe you're\nYou know what I Wonder if that makes NBC thinking or when they do this ... yeah exactly but what so are are they are are they sending her up to go out and embarrass yourself or are they trying to sort of roof or to somehow work her way out of this\nKind of what is wrong I didn't play the big the here's the smoking as the cuts are due to [noise]\nOkay I got I got one to ever yeah let's listen to this one\nI was physically assaulted in every way you could possibly physically assault I Wanna hit with horrible\nEveryone is wondering if one of those people was broadcast [noise]\nI cannot specifically say he was one of the ones who assaulted me\n[noise] if you can't rule him out you know what you eat healthy yeah he's guilty if you can't rule out he can't be on the spring quite well\nI agree we have no choice guilty as you have is number ... ... this is horrible if this happened to her and I don't believe anything she says because none of it seems credible but if this happened to urge terrible why she went to a party with a with groups ... going on ten times is also worthy of a question\nYou know I just started something also where was he a the days that ah OJ Simpson didn't kill his wife right exactly you're right I think I think I mean I think you know ... and what about all the times he didn't try to kill her [laughter] you know what why did he get credit for that if the glove doesn't fit you must acquit right\nSo if as long as there's nobody in her life that knows her well the thing she might be up to something I'm willing to believe Julie sweat Nick so what you see what her ex boyfriend thinks cut thirty three\nIf you ask me personally I Believe for a I don't believe in you know personally I don't believe her I really don't believe her no one knows better I mean nobody knows June is with ... with me and uh you know he can say that the ones but the fact that I Know and that's what I came here to tell the truth I mean I Know how she is\nYeah okay uh as you have any more to say Richard ... thirty four\nYou know she was always wanted to be the center of attention on the show and it was way to do some major show us when to practically wherever she received wisdom that she was exaggerating everything if anybody knows Julie on the person I mean I Know because I knew what her\nAnd everything that came out of her mouth was just exaggerations and that she never mentioned that to me at all and it's something that the I was surprised to hear this is actually it was very surprised elections the are making these concessions because you have never ever mentioned that to me at all\n[laughter] I go I have an oddity autistic with district to porn stars\nThis is this is going to hurt him he was not been hurt by the storm and Daniel staying at all it actually can of fall down and you think\nYou think it will hurt him hope it does but I I I mean I think we're in a post fact post evidence world where there's not a single Democrat out there or\nDo you think any lawmakers going to say that you said were made a lot of sense what are you kidding me Chuck Schumer on the phone today just eat auditor name he turn you around ... referred to he could he didn't know the name of somebody had to put it put it in his ear buddy he mentioned Chuck Schumer\nUnbelievable he's Charlie her Shelly thanks [noise] I've never I don't know if\nIt's going to be the target of a town we saw\nIs the chances went up that Brett Kavanaugh would be cute and the Trump would have to pick Amy Coney Barrett or ... or another of the twenty four\nAh judges who are on his short list\nNot a very short list uh so the chances of that happening went up but what also went up where the chances that a cabin on would be confirmed with fifty five or fifty six votes with a bipartisan vote\nAnd that went up because if the FBI comes back and says look we looked into everything here we can't find corroboration to prove or disprove this yes and ... and and that's what they get if if we get back to\nAh there's no evidence there is no way to corroborate this story in any way then we're back to the chance that Kevin I'll get to a bunch of democratic votes I looked at a poll out of North Dakota that was yesterday\nA Heidi Heitkamp to the poll said two things uh Heidi Heitkamp is not going to be a U.S senator for a lot longer but it also said that um the issue this is a galvanizing focusing issue\nFor a Republican and independent voters in red states watching this happen has put a Joe Manchin has put Claire McCaskill has put Joe Donnelly in a very difficult positions\n[noise] interesting because Joe Donnelly came out right before Jeff Flake to reverse course instead not voting for him\nSo he took a bit of a political risk now now they're back and play that well I might change my mind they might change his mind but Chris but Chris you should know this I I always think I can and guys like Chris Coons to be sober and in ... but Chris Coons was a no before it turns out\nBy now that he yelled at him\nKnow that uh if flake so here's the thing about good well\nUm if people are are preferred belief about politics and our preferred believe about Washington and our preferred belief about the Senate\nHis ... has been informed by a deep deep cynicism and I mean rank but Chris Coons is a guy who he got through ... he he was worried about having a primary challenge this year but he represents a state that's very moderate\nDelaware is has a strong preference for moderation no no extreme is a a prosper in Delaware politics and I I Would say this\nIs Jeff Flake extends to good well to Chris Coons to say you know what you're right and by the way Coons inflate for right\nIf the Republicans would have tried to jam through a and start a votes of falling\nOff the side as you get down to decision time Murkowski Collins or maybe others say I can't do it that's a real catastrophe I'm also a catastrophe for Republicans would have been grinding it through with all the doubt still in the air grinding it through with Mike Pence casting the deciding vote\nThis was a good this was a good compromise for the Republicans\nWhat somebody like Coons wants to do is generate goodwill so you go from a no vote to uh maybe vote to potentially really a yes vote if the FBI investigation comes back and their background check and they say now we got nothing\n[noise] uh you know what I think you're right in and Jeff Flake if he is or if he is a conservative he might not be but I think he is a conservative who doesn't like Donald Trump which happens to people like George Will and others I get it\nIf he if he's a conservative Brett Kavanaugh hits hits it out of the park\nIf you were like George Bush and John McCain Brett Kavanaugh hits out of the park if you like Lindsey Graham all off it goes against his party Brett Kavanaugh is not Donald Trump junior so don't worry about it so if he alleviate legitimately just wants to make sure he didn't insult the woman in high school\nThen I think capital is fine but listen to a Newt Gingrich\nA concluded and he knows how to make deals\nThey talking about this deal comes comes cannot nothing I mean Republicans sometimes have this passion for being stupid Frank gotten nothing out of ... nothing so can play this game really bipartisan let me see how Henry people off again ... would you please help me off a little bit because I feel so much better when you take advantage of\nPeople think that there's a reason people get fed up with this stuff\nLindsey Graham leave that on a while ago\nIs the most affecting the Judiciary Committee told the truth and I think we ever did come Eric and people got to stand up and say they don't want a country that has dominated by these kinds of people and I think it's a really serious threat\nThought that was new to that that's what I said I didn't see the you know and and I think Scott Palys great but I just wanted one question if he turned out to pass this FBI background report over the next seven days would you vote for him would your colleagues vote for him because the answer is no\nThat's the honest answer Blumenthal changing his mind nice size that changing your mind you know and I\n... but can I call can I call a little malarkey call here so and um when\nUh people in and people in both parties do this and they say if only everyone would just do what I say then we will win if if only everyone would simply follow what their follow the the instructions and do what they're supposed to do then we will just went well guess what\nThat's not the system that's not how that goes yes obviously if the Republican there are fifty four I told you we talked before about the fifty for for this was really surprising to me um and it tells you something about our politics fifty four percent of Republicans said even if Brett Kavanaugh tried to rape but girl when he was in high school that he should still be confirmed to the Supreme Court\nOr just winning just smashing them in the mouth now the overwhelming majority of Americans say no no no no no we have three hundred and twenty five million people we don't need a guy who tried to rape or grow in high school or on the Supreme Court there are other options at hand\nAnd but the fact that we're at a point here where both sides embrace this concept of right or wrong just do it for your team and smashed the other guy in the mouth is ridiculous because that's not in Lisa Murkowski's interest that's not in Jeff Flake centrist that's not in Susan Collins interest nor Joe mansions nor Dean Heller urged nor a bunch of members\nSo one of the fiction that frequently get sold to members of both parties is that the answer here is that everybody just quit sinking lash themselves together and go ... like a wrecking ball into the other side whatever the issue that's not how the Senate supposed to work\nOr I Want you to hear a I Want you to hear what we heard yesterday let's listen\nTo Senator Flake you've announced which are not running for reelection and I wonder could you who have done this\nIf you were running no [laughter] no not ... not a chance\nBecause politics has become too sharp to ... there's no value to reaching across the aisle there's no currency for that anymore there's no incentive\nEvery bit of moral fiber a more you know I Want to say well he acted morally what was his conscience he couldn't do it any

ago\nCredit freezes and cause of a credit freeze are now free\nSo the credit bureaus having this be kind of a backwater to a major part of their activity\nWere really wanting a simpler way that has upset a lot of people\nUp to last week that procedure was that you would file a request for credit freeze with a credit bureau and they would issue you a unique secret code\nCode was somewhere like ten to twelve digits I guess depending on the bureau\nAnd so your credit would be frozen you decide you wanted a new cell phone plan or you wanted to shop for auto insurance or you wanted to apply for a loan or whatever so you had to thaw get a new credit card you had to thaw your file\nSo you'd go onto the website of the credit bureau you'd put in your secret code to thaw\nAnd then bam you'd have access to your credit more important somebody that was pulling your credit to decide whether or not to do business whether you would be able to do so were they were blocked otherwise sole purpose

twelve dollars a year to administer your account is that right um\nI didn't get that far [laughter] [noise] um\nIt it is absolutely I okay for you to use acorns and have it as a path to start building up some money for you\nFor four years and it is it's where money that might just kind of go in the ether instead goes into an investment account at very low cost\n'cause I was like it makes more sense and it's going to go into a cookie jar like I Do\nYeah and you know ... investing investing for the long haul and you know in the shorter term you might put money in and lose some of that at least temporarily but\nOver time you can end up with a substantial amount of money a dollar here a dollar there through your week three year year\nAnd it's money that becomes painless you don't even realize

that great Ashley's with us on the Clark Howard show hello actually how're you doing I'm doing great care Ashley you've got a question for me let's see if I can help you with\nYes I'm I'm hiring a virtual assistant she helped me with the nine mundane task touches paint dry laundry maybe groceries and things like that but it's through up Oregon I Know that they're qualified people but I Want to be able to get her ... and ... to pay for something without risking credit score it's\nFiling their credit card and ... and things like that while minimizing my risk cue\nSo you're going to give this person the ability to make payments but you want to make sure they don't destroy your credit and at the same time limit access that this individual would have to you or funds\nAbsolutely okay I've got something I like for that and I've only one other time of I suggested it in a situation something like yours but it seemed to fit and it's called\nBlue bird have you ever heard of bird now if you look at ... dot com\nTheater is a payment system that is a joint venture of American Express and Walmart\nAnd so you're able to issue a bluebird account\nTo this individual and they can do a bill payment for you they can do transactions on the card you can see every transaction this happening and here's the best part you control the flow of money into the blue bird account\nSo that you have any did you put in it only the money that you need this assistant to have to do the transactions that you need them to pay for and take care of\nGreat that's exactly what I Need significantly my requirements I thank you\nAnd the other thing with blue bird read through all the all the way it works as long as you jump through all the right hoops with blue bird\nTo have this isn't that count for this assistant perfect\nNow you're only risk is let's say you do run into a problem with this individual and you have let's just say for argument's sake you've got three hundred dollars and the blue bird account at that time\n... and so you decide you got to let this person go 'cause they're not performing well or they have not proven to be trustworthy or whatever they'll last amount of money you have on deposit they have access to may well be at risk\nAbsolutely so but you know\nYou will know the amount and it would be kept by the amount that you put in there that you've trusted him with\nYes and that's a risk and willing to take out to a certain dollar value\nOkay so it is a the possibilities it's number one for what you're trying to accomplish and I hope that you find that it works well for you if it turns out that blue birds a bust I Need to know that so I can take that information into account next time I might talk about it\nDarren is with us on the Clark Howard show Hi Darren how are you today\nEric thanks for the political certainly you want to talk about your child or children\n[noise] yeah I had a question I all of a at a test with credit freeze a you are\nAnd [noise] my wife and I asked a counter frozen than we are as our daughter's\nA best way soon as we got a Social Security number on her but my question is why do they even have a credit files on minors or ... why do they even permit activity if they're not you know legally able to sign for any you know anger build a new accounts\nSo criminals are exploiting a loophole and how the three major credit bureaus do business so the credit bureaus what they do is they ... they make money collecting data they make money selling data and so they build ... on\nOn anybody who anyone reports credit activity on so they didn't start off with a file on your young daughter\nBut what happens with a dinner you theft in childhood entity theft is far more likely to occur than for an adult\nIs someone will assume your child Social Security number and they'll do it for many different reasons their favorite is it there's no history there so they'll start applying for things as if\nThey are not necessarily your daughter but using her number\nAnd so that's what creates the file with the credit bureaus and voila suddenly the cook has\nTaken over your daughter's Social Security number and potentially created a whole new entity because remember there was no pre existing record for your daughter\nSo what child credit freeze does is the credit bureau actually creates an empty file for your daughter\nBased on her name and her Social Security number and then freezes it which prevents anybody from applying for credit or doing things is if they are the holder of that Social Security number\nGotcha kind of a credit bureaus are at cross checking the Social Security number against day birth date\nAbsolutely not\nBecause that would like to watch that\nNo that would cost them money to the credit bureaus\nOr even desire of the credit bureaus to be very accurate they're happy play on horse shoes clothes for them as good enough because accuracy would be expensive and it would reduce their net profits\nSo everybody understands and the lending business the credit bureaus are an approximation of information not accurate information\nYou're listening to the Clark Howard show\nYour quest and answered mixed

with us here in Philadelphia Hi Jim how are you\nGood Dave thanks for having me on sure what's up [noise]\nUm my wife and I work currently in baby steps to uh we started this time last year with about a hundred and fifty thousand dollars and that we've been on tenth and pay off our thousand dollars while as of this small yes a\nSold my brand new pickup truck sold a race car I'm wild everything though we um we have an an interesting situation a we have one child and we're looking to expand our family however we're going to need to um did they do I've I'm always go out and other\nSixty six thousand dollars to pay off and whatever else hold into a were making about a hundred and forty thousand dollars a year right now\nSo you did a hundred and a year but a lot of that was from selling stuff up pretty much a large ... which outlets the math telling you\nThat it's got how long is he going to take you do this or the sixty\nUm [noise] if we if we continue on this course where how are you from literally sold everything so the rest of it's just going to be working really are I think it's going to be probably about another year maybe a little bit more\nThat's what I was thinking what is what I Would ask him when I saw that OK cool and so what is the pricing model of Avielle for that you guys are looking at\nAh well we actually met with a doctor a few months ago and got it\nUh just you know we haven't found anything or start any any processes yeah we're just still shopping around but ... what we're looking at a we spoke with other couples and all the cricket who's got around there\nUm let me give me a little inside okay this comes like a lot because babies are important\nBut I mean having kids is a big deal it's an emotional thing and it causes people to uh you know to to change their financial directions and the to violate things and everything else so let me tell you I I absolutely know nothing\nAbout medical things I Am a medical idiot okay [laughter] but uh I have actually been involved in about this decision probably a hundred times over the years and what I Am hearing\nEven as late as last week a with couples that we are coaching on this is that when they press in they find several different pricing models and prices\nYou don't just accept the first opinion you get on how you go about this okay right in other words I heard the other day I thirty five thousand for one pricing model but that was like a guarantee as many times as you need to do it till you get a baby right mhm okay uh well that's not one we're going to do [laughter]\nAnd then I heard the other end of the spectrum I'm hearing a you know a single tries as low as Seventy five hundred a try\nWorse because right now you don't\nI don't I don't know I don't know ... it's\nOh well I live on their lowest say there was a it's a hundred and thirty thousand but I don't know if that's even ... they're not\nOr nothing like it was not always that accurate but it's probably not that far off we could use that for discussion purposes okay if you if you found a house that was worth a hundred thousand and you could buy it for Ninety five thousand that really wouldn't be that great a by\nThat is being okay by it's not like you're getting ... great deals are where you just went wow that's the best deal ever ride this is I'm\nNot sure if I'm like they even get kicked out 'cause someone gated or should I leave or should I should I go back ran over\nWell where do I want to be long term or that you want to own um\nWell my wife she we kind of didn't want to own because we are I got a daughter she's four and my wife she's in school and now so we just trying to kind of settled down right now mhm have you got every angle area it's like I say my wife great grandma's house and she'd been here her whole life so she likes it it's like about two and a half three acres\nMhm and um it's kind of in a country what part of Atlanta gotcha okay and how old are you to\nMy wife she turned twenty yesterday and and I'll be Twenty one and a couple of days but we both twenty now\n... and you got a one child you said and how much debt to your house\nOr we don't have any debt okay and what's your household income I make about\nEvery ... here but I'm trying to get in school but I had to kind of work with the answer to that was\nThat I don't watch I don't know what else um I pay about six hundred and Seventeen dollars a month and your wife doesn't work [noise]\nOkay that's pretty that's all right on your budget\nIs is very tight on your budget\nAnd we just found out about you not too long ago one of my friends from church he recommended me start listening to you so now we actually kind of made a budget and stuff on how to eat and we're already kind of you know trying to start it off a little better and you\nDo it good for you okay well here's the thing if you wanted to buy the house the only way you can buy it is the uh the relatives that are involved that would be the air's a this would be great grandmothers children or grandchildren\nThat would be the air since there was no will someone would have to petition the court will get a lawyer and go to probe a court in probate court would have to rule that the house could be sold hand would assign someone to sign the deed as the cellar\nTo be able to give it to you you're going to have to have a court action to do that that's going to cost three two or three thousand bucks to get all that done\nOkay I don't think you need that expense right now\nYeah don't with all the with the numbers you gave me in the situation you're in um now is anybody going to throw you out as long as that mortgages paid I doubt they are going to get thrown out\nYeah 'cause that's what I was thinking should I because I feel kind of want to actually start even going into real estate 'cause I Do construction and that's what I Do know I kind of this house is kinda is not beat a it's kind of beat up and fight the last few years she yeah here's like other relatives staying there kind of beaten it up so I I mean I don't know if it's like\nMaybe work more maybe you know what I'm saying they Lincoln flipping and get another house\nOr Lipitor unless you become the owner of it\nYeah and and that's why I'm saying like I Do I Need to you'd had I see in a statement learning anything they just hurry up and I'll take my answer machine where should I wait until you what I Would\nDo if I were you I Would be willing to walk away from this house some day when you get I I Would treat it\nYou're probably not gonna ever bother to own it and if you do you're going to go through a lot of hassle to become the owner going through this court action that I'm Talking about okay\nSo uh what I Would do is pay the rent or pay that payment as rent I Would not spend any money on this and I wouldn't fret about becoming the owner today\nIt's inexpensive rent in the Atlanta area it's a place you like living any money you spend on it just say to fix it up is money you're probably gonna lose you're probably not ever going to become the owner of this thing\nYeah it's going to be and it's going to be a really strenuous process with the courts to become the owner of this because we don't even know who the errors are\nYeah well I don't I Know a couple of the day is it's not that many um\nOr that they actually even know about it like I said we we been here for a year so I don't know like should I I I'm not like should I be worried that if they are paying the oil and I just keep paying it\nIn because that's not that you shouldn't be worried because it's not bad rent\nIt this way like nobody command me out because it's not in my name\nYeah they can get you out the people that own it can there are the heirs but they'd have to all get their crap together and they're far from doing that\nAnd they're they're they're far away they're like in another state and\nYou know but they're not they're not worried about this is what I'm saying yeah they're not worried about this at all it's not bothering them one way or the other they're not going to get any money out of it when it sells 'cause it's not worth much more than his vote on it\nIf it was valuable now there'll be some sharks in the water circling right but it's not got any ... because it's not worth any more so you're not going to get kicked out but some day you're going to want to move on so don't spend a bunch of money on it 'cause some day you're just gonna walk off and leave it\nYeah 'cause 'cause I've already done paying eight and ... before they need some something you know and I met in my life had because\nLike whatever money whatever money you spend and make her happy is money is gone\nWhen you leave because there's going to come a day two years from now that you guys are going to stand up and walk away or you're going to go to the trouble to get the heirs to take the thing the probate court\nAnd get the deed transferred to your name and you can probably do that but again it's going to cost you a couple of thousand dollars and you'd want to make very sure that the property was worth more than the mortgage before you did that and um\nAnd you don't want to spend a bunch of money renovating his house because you're going to very likely move on in about two years but in the meantime I just looked at it as cheap rent\nThe place you kinda like living\nAnd uh you know six hundred bucks rent in line is not a bad gig on two and a half acres\nSo I'm sitting there in front of you for now\nA snow hurting anything no one's you're not stealing anything you're not doing any more harm the mortgage companies getting paid they're happy the relatives that aren't going to get any money anyways still aren't getting any money everybody's happy but just look at it like you're a renter and some day you're just going to move on\n... worried about being the owner and then if you really want to be the owner then get ready to spend three or four thousand dollars and six months of pain in the bud court actions and you probably can work this through if you can gather up all the people you need to sign on it\nAnd that's what you're facing so it's an interesting situation but my guess is it's not worth any more than his vote on it\nMy guess is ill as probably fairly close on this\nIf we thought it was worth two hundred thousand bucks is a relative thought is worth two hundred thousand bucks and Ninety thousand was old and they were going to get a hundred thousand their pocket when is old no sharks would already been circling they'd have been trying to figure out some way to get that thing sold and get the courts do it when you die without a wheel and you have to\nThe ... the sale of the asset and it has to go into a pool to be dispersed too the heirs\nAre just like it would in a will but it's just a lot bigger mess\nAnd do you can't get cleaned title to this thing unless you do all that and you do not want to become aware of it any other way than doing it properly and getting clean titled 'cause you won't be able to sell it if you don't get clean title so that's how you do it if you decide to do it later but for today I Would treat it as cheap rent\nIt's a rental house how much money would you spend on a rental house that you're going to move off and you don't home not not any as what you would do hope that helps my aunt's thanks for calling in this is the Dave Ramsey shower\n\n[noise]\nAn angel peace now man has easy wars of max Paul find bombs coming up in the news or Ninety four point

rolled up our sleeves we can ...\nThat's it had an a ha moment huh\nYup and we're we're a good team we bounce ideas off each other and we always came to the same conclusion as to what we were going to do and and here\nWe are now you don't have a payment in the world not that and the grass does do better when you walk on it I'm telling you it's not an exaggeration it's a great metaphor but it's also

out to a meal we share an entree that is like no I mean every single time so things like that um I don't I'm I'm not a big shopper so all my clothes come from discount stores I never buy anything unless it's on sale\nThat's just how and I and I don't see that changing ever so\n... if you want it to I mean you you don't have your payments\nNow and then my DNA I'd I'd go straight to the sale ...

I mean there are various an outright everything else that you know it's funny call you go to a straight ball games like him issue has\nAnd they get that transcended player in that press guy they spend a bunch of money on the stadium in the program\nAnd they get used to it they don't want to go backwards and then they lose to Kentucky team that they they're favored ten points in Florida seven and a half point favorite so it's not playing well is that typical knee jerk reaction you have the overboard crew that warning that already feel like he's not the guy\nAnd then you have some that have a little bit more perspective and want to see if he can work through it\nThe ... you can't give up games in football you can lose games and basketball and SEC baseball and you can still have an amazing season and you can really get them back because the season is so long and you play thirty five basketball games fifty six baseball\nAnd football you can't do that so you're not going to get these games back and you had yet to play an FCC west again and again Kentucky in Florida I don't think they really scare anybody I mean Kentucky's doing so cool things it's a nice story\nBut I don't think they're really special or anything close to a top fifteenth team so you lost the two teams that are not dynamic and that are not loaded so to speak so I think Joe ... Joe and Jon Cohen have\nYou know to fight through some things and try to find some when did they still have six SEC west games to go\nSo let's say for instance Bo uh I mean your plane Arbor Newsweek into top ten team to team is struggling by the way but it's still a top ten team this game goes goes haywire er and from there you know the schedule is not easy it's very difficult\nSo we're well Joe Morehead be at the end of the season if a if you can't get a this on ... on track and and with or without my shoe remaining a ... a and M.\nBam out I mean there's there's no reason to think it's going to get much better if you can't be ... says\nHis office doesn't start scoring points I'm and I'm Talking about you know you've got to get up into twenty twenty five points in the ass in some night shift scoreboard if they don't they're looking at I mean they could go for de Paul yeah you're right you got the whole SEC west\nYou got a terrible schedule from here on out your first five games really set up nicely and you're only non conferences lot jak who scored points so\nA bit says you know his completion percentages in the forties ball he's he's got a gory past or so to speak a super accurate guy but he's uh fifty five percent guy the last couple of years so that the odd fence looks discombobulated\nIt doesn't look like they know what they want to do or play their strengths which is run into football they're trying to throw the ball down field to go vertical at all this kinda stuff and that's not going to work with the personnel that he has so it's going to be interesting to see if they can get this\nUh find the remedy in the solution here the next five or six days or they'll\nIt's high season and then you're talking about a massive yet in season tickets and so on next spring\nOkay on that pose a notice moved oh mess [laughter] things are not much better things were not expected to be great but uh I think fans expected the games will be closer didn't they\nOh yeah I mean I thought that they would score against LSU with the opposite ... that they have all that they've got four or five NFL guys on the opposite side of the football at least on this was losing the top five teams but\nStill the fan bases is frustrated\nUh I mean you could lose the Alabama but I think you want to break the a little bit better showing the math at LSU I think they thought they would put up a better\nJob or and and again I don't think el issue is dynamic or special Onassis they are on defense that we'll see what job or oh does how he develops that skew weeks and if they really make a ride\nAt this thing but yeah they're pretty frustrated right now there's either fan base thinks that they have well old\nMiss I don't think they believe that Luke is the future I think all of a sudden Mississippi State was one hundred percent by going into Lexington\nThen probably took a good thirty forty percent hit and then you lose ... mall and in Florida which was ... to the fan base and took another twenty thirty percent hit so I Would think right now neither fan base is overly\nConfident that either one of these guys are going to take them back in that a non and maybe\nSpecial you know season every now and then all where you go down and three ten in ten and two\nNow I realize we're ah we're fairly new into both careers and I'm not suggesting anything but uh you you know that stay better than anyone what's libel to happen in ... case with someone who's no longer an interim coach although maybe some stole look at him\nI'm ... and they haven't gotten that job because of circumstances\nYeah no I I I Do believe that I mean I'm Around almost people every day they I don't think they really look at math Luke as permanent head coach\nI think he still has that interim deal about it um you know I don't think if he wins the well I don't know because I don't know how many guys I don't know how many coaches were interested last\nYear because the sanctions had not been handed down then they want the ball so I don't know exactly what was in play over that five to seven day stretch but they're not excited you could tell by the last time game ball\nAnd then this weekend nobody will be there for law and row now obviously there will be an up tick attendance wise for SEC home games but they took a massive hidden in season ticket sales there's all kinds of rumors on the donation side\nThere you go and and even more so now that the betting is becoming legal you know it was a place you exactly like up to still stay you'll see more ...\nI mean I remember a game I Can't remember what year it was a Alabama was a forty one\nPoint favorite over Vanderbilt and with about thirty seconds to go into the game I saw bear Bryant run it in from the two yard line instead of just taking a knee which most coaches would have done but he he knew he knew his buddies had a put a few dimes down on Alabama pay\nThere was a nice article it just came out on

at the same ensure Georgia standpoint you know um what are the odds bats\nIf Jay continues to struggle with the office that justice will take over as well just on the field it's like a sport arises in Bronx at the end zone the athletic he has\nChris I I wouldn't have thought so earlier but I Do a Georgia needs are jolted energy right now\nAnd yeah he just he may be the answer\nYeah lie down like

you're my guest\nYou got it\nAnd not only am I your gift shop near where I better watch where say oh here's a bike and you know got so many ... let me ask you this what I miss the ocean\nI already heard you before my first call heard you talking about Jay Leno urged\nAnd to make some statement I missed what to say\nTo adjust gave an interview today uh he uh he was made available by the powers that be a you were university and he just complimented you until\nAh we are joined next by Jordan Rogers Roger your biology expressed be the radius and they'll tell you what Jordan knows about being the right is Jordan I did a commercial ... show in Philadelphia of all places and I didn't know you were such a food kind of sewer\nHow is the host of a food concepts that you want but I did yeah I mean\nBreakfast is my thing was when you throw everything possible at a buffet into one sandwich you can't go wrong it was pretty remarkable\nOr the contestants for the for the most the title the\nThe radius food already is breakfast challenge Maria Taylor and in in\n... which stole my ... my idea he did a little salt beta with them and I talked\nAbout or you want to do that we had three judges those American Idol back off and congratulations\nI figured there'd be ... like some book offers and you know like speaking tours maybe another spin off cooking show none of that yeah\nThey're always going to a well you you see too much of South Carolina but which we want to start with we just heard from my ship and then to go this program or needs a turnaround that Missouri this week and what have you seen lately from them\nNot just the fence a kicking going in and when you look at this I think\nWhat Dave changes there's more temple a Jake Bentley has more responsibility to maybe anybody at the line of scrimmage was what he's able to do but they haven't consistently random full bombing ... forty forty four you are a little over forty yards against Kentucky and they left\nSome plays on the field I mean Jake belly twice had guys wide open down field and for one ...\nThose the touchdown to debo Samuel really should have been the interception of me just look at the game is a whole their opportunities but even the good wasn't that good I'm not sure if this South Carolina team\nKinda ... is one hundred percent on board with this transition of we're going to go up temperament a throw the ball over the place you got to be able to establish the run and they they haven't done that show the pass game of suffered as is\nYou've also got a heavy dose of Kentucky layer which means you seen that team plays spectacularly well what do you say\nI mean it's unbelievable I I think even last week I myself and I watch all the the film and I'm as impressed with the ex his nose and what they're doing it the scrimmage on both sides of all than anybody I still had a little bit of reservation like is this for real\nBig blue nation is absolutely for real I mean what they are doing at the line of scrimmage running the ... now has I Believe more yards after contacting anybody in the entire country through four games more than anybody in the U.S you see in the first four games he's been unbelievable and really the guy that maybe the ... column won't say it\nBut Terry Wilson has been the ex X factor\nEven just the threat of what he's able to do with his legs has absolutely changed how teams scheme against the run some they're read options some of their niche kinda gadget option plays that they run he's absolutely changed things I think he's only going to get better throwing the football which means that team's only gonna get more dangerous\nI I realize you're you're an allergy or not an ... dog again\nAh I don't think any of them I don't see that I really don't know if I'm just watching the film and I've had a couple of times already this year are they more talented maybe from rosters standpoint top to bottom you could argue maybe but killing Monde as think really has struggled and decision making I saw that against Clinton yeah he drew for three hundred and thirty yards and the second half\nBut there were some decision making issues I think he's still growing in that rides you better than he was last year yes\nBut you've got a team in Kentucky that my biggest question mark going into the game against South Carolina was could they guard on the outside could they match up on the outside 'cause Kentucky is long their physical and the outset don't have burners out there they're not for five star the bees out their their coverage\nWas as good as anything and tired and Jake that we didn't have anywhere to go with the ball primarily every snap\nSo I think that creates a lot of problems protect CNN because Kentucky has been good stop in the run because ... has had some decision making issues in Kentucky was varied in their coverage of the way more too high then I've seen in a really long time out of that team so they're kind of\nJust only ... the right word they're getting more complex and more efficient on the defensive side of the ball and that's scary I think against a team like Texas a and M. that it's still struggling to find their footing and often\nSo let's assume uh the Kentucky get over this aren't they still have Missouri over the mystery team before that I mean their fans are already ready for Georgia\nUm I wouldn't sleep on Missouri\nAnd I think Missouri showed against Georgia\nThat score at the end of the game did not dictate how that game was Missouri had you know the formal for a touchdown has a special team touchdown they gave up had the interception on a drop that sort of put Georgia down to three yard line Missouri\nDominate I won't say dominated Missouri was the better team for about two and a half three quarters that game they really were I think it's a line of scrimmage they were better they hurt themselves\nThat's a scary team if I'm Kentucky because drew lock on any given Saturday can throw it around as good as anybody they're dangerous when you look forward in Georgia\nI actually have more questions about Georgia then I Do about Kentucky right now\nWhat we hear a lot of excitement or in in terms of just some fields are we going to see more of and\nWas interesting Paul in it and obviously I take special aim at the quarterbacks I watch film every week I Am not under crediting Jake from from what he does the command has what he does in the run past option what he does changing run plays that the normal fan would have no idea what he's doing exceptional\nHe's a good quarterback I don't know if he's a game changer at least yeah we haven't seen a ton of him in four quarters in tight games when everything's on his shoulders having to throw the football he's average on third down only complete fifty two percent of his passes two touchdowns two interceptions on third down but really\nTwice in that game against tendency\nOnce right before half when it was ten nothing before minutes left and you're only touched on was the Isaac not a fumble pick up run for fifty yards they brought Justin Fields in for an entire drive\nTo me that's not a wearing the red zone I Want to mix it up with little quarterback run that we need a spark right let's see what this kid can do and again when it's only a twelve point game in the fourth quarter they do that again not for a few plays but they bring them in at the beginning of a drive in opposite field position to say hey I think we need a spark\nI think we're going to see a lot more Justin Fields and I think if he can limit some of the mistakes we saw the ball in the ground if he could not do that he's going to prove that he has a role in this off it's not that he's going to overtake from right now\nBut there is a little bit of this office needed a spark Jake from wasn't given it to us let's see what let's see what the kid can do\nIs there a before you go let's talk about a critical game or Mississippi State dire straits Auburn struggling a little\nBit we know anything about either of the teams\nAnd we'll find out it Saturday Night it's unbelievable perplexing it really is when I when I flip on the Mississippi State film I see a quarterback and Nick Fitzgerald\nThat can't run the ball right now um but let alone can't get off his first read I mean he he is staring at a guy if it's not there he is a throwing it out I'm into double coverage or he's trying to run and scramble and it's not working this off and\nThey got to figure something out ... and in a hurry on the Auburn side I've been outspoken about this fall I think right now just miles on a chip Lindsey are really hurting Jerry ...\nAnd I really do and here's here's what I see when I flip on the film\nThis often says no who wants to be what it wants to run the football Chandler Cox's in there tight end in there and a heavy set and they try to run the football the problem is they don't have any past plays off of those formations are personnel so when they have\nThat in a team's going to bulk up they're going to know they're not going to pass the ball and are going to stop the run and win Auburn decides we want to throw the football they bring for wide receivers and and the team drops into coverage get this fall\nAgain southern miss the team that they frankly have a lot more talent and\nState um had zero completion from ten yards to fifty yards that section of the field that should be exploited when you have a talented quarterback they had to attempt\nTo zero completion in that area of the field they don't know what they do want to do an often they don't attack the middle of the field they don't ... them up for easy completion it's either behind the line of scrimmage as was eleven of his Nineteen completion behind the line of scrimmage or it's a fifty yard bomb this off ants has an identity crisis right now and I think\nState I'm Lindsay and mouths on all need to figure out what they can do to make this product the best don't\nLeave but they have it if you if you could take it over for a game what would you do\nI I Would spread the football out and I would have what we call more horizontal stretch plays which means more concepts in between that five Fifteen yard range that are putting stress on line backers are right now that means putting three or four guys in each past concept when right now it's it's like two guys\nState um if the first two guys are covered has nowhere to go with the ball I Would lean more towards what we've seen from chip Lindsay in the air raid and throwing the football when you have a quarterback\nAnd that can do so instead of a let's run and let's play action off that they don't run well enough or block well enough up front to open up the windows down field that they need to and right now they don't have a guy that could wind down field so I Would spread it out\nPut everything in front of your quarterback the smart that's accurate with the football and let him thinking dunk to set up the run or set up the play action right now they're running into a brick wall trying to set up a play action I don't think it's working while\nGreat stuff or Jordan Rogers you'll see more of him\nYou should know or Jordan thank you very much for Christ up we are going to take a break more to come a more gas a little bit of a big picture on the national scene for Bill bender more of your
