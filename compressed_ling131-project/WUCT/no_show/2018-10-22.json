HD video crystal clear audio and instant wireless sharing it'll even work with your existing hardware\nAnd I want to get everybody's reaction to the story that we know or believe we know right now and then we're going to delve deeper into that subject let me start with you a ... um\nIs there anything about what you know now based on public knowledge is there anything that you know now that you are questioning\nBunch of things it's a really hard question to answer but I Will say that the key take away that his public knowledge um is that the Saudis\nMay just get away with this and it goes beyond Trump hum when people say the world should show more outrage was going to show more outrage if not are present in our president has already given all kinds of explanations or down the Asians are\nAll kinds of ... alibi if you will and all kinds of coverage to the Saudis the Turks started doing that because they have a special relationship we have a special relationship with Saudi Arabia but we also have a special relationship with the truth\nWith our values right that all men are created equal that they shouldn't be denied you know life liberty and pursuit of happiness about due process I Will say that I Will say that the key takeaway here that's publicly available as well played Saudi Arabia while played\nCome share I Want to hear from our Democrats first tonight\nYeah well when I hear the Saudi Government or whoever is in the government saying that this was an interrogation gone bad I don't believe it so you asked what do we don't believe I don't believe that I think it was a planned effort a targeted\nIndividual and I have no question about that in my mind uh what I Do a tremendous be bothered by is the ridiculous comments of president Donald Trump\nOr either don't say anything or be a little more careful and a real statesmen someone with what I call an Oval Office intelligence which he completely lacks knows that you don't say certain things it's just not a smart he's he's wishy washy three times on this in less than a week since ... and it's inappropriate so\nAre Democrats are embarrassed by the president and I'm not a Democrat and I know\nYou were not a Republican or you know [laughter] I don't know\nI I don't you know I don't know what to do Baron I don't know what to say about this I don't trust the Saudis I don't trust\n'em I mean every nation in the middle east I think is is somewhat compromise relative to western values including possibly Israel in in some of the things that they've done um or what they are doing to defend themselves and you're referring to civil liberties ah I'm I'm referring\nTo the fact that there is no\nPristine players over there okay and I'm and I'm also it I guess that you know this is just I I the reason I'm not apoplectic about whatever the president did or didn't say and the reason I'm not apoplectic about\nMessage that Ryan is talking about that Ryan a second thing that\nPostcard you was giving and that as we need to push this further we need to take liberalism to natural conclusion when he had more rights we need to have a state that respect that the rights of its citizens I mean\nFounding father died on that but I'm going to come back why do you come back and then I Want to go to get that everybody's ... why do you come back and do it in such a ham handed way I mean they're certainly had their message\nBut I don't think you can send a message in in other ways I Know the less specific that oh no I mean and what about involving what about involving it uh with the Turks\nI don't think they thought that it hurts would expose them so effectively actually they did they ever say look if we're talking about you know all all bets are off\nRight I mean the truth is you have you have a Turkish leader or the one who wants to silence journalists as well right so the fact that he would come forward with this impeccably right and the fact that we would have an American\nMinister by the way I don't say it is I don't say this or not really I'm not being sarcastic I think I'm a little naive but I get it now I hear what you're saying that the Turks want to silence the opposition as much as the Saudis new\n... it's it's also about it it is possible like the one of the things I read and I don't know what all this means but apparently they've taken the crown prince and put them in the back seat and then the now the king is back in on on the forefront\nAnd he's firing some people that happened today or at least that was reported today he's he's fired this guy he's fired that guy he's sent the crown prince to the woodshed um you know and so and again that could all be for show\nI think it's fair to say that no one you know maybe some of our CIA people ah because we all know they're super confident and they're never make a mistake maybe some of our investigators maybe some of our top NSA people know what's going on behind the scenes but I think most of us American citizens have no clue\nAnd I I think there's a again a similar to my whole point with the caravan it is amazing to me the speed at which all of this became the most important issue in the world right away as\nYou get that gets the timing right and what about it\nFrom planning the timing of it I don't think it's beneficial for us domestic politics or it could be more towards a international regional politics in the Arab crescent and particularly\nA ... said in Saudi Arabia itself Exxon you're you're a conspiracy theory that you outlined um\nDon't discount it but you follow what the facts are what we have right now though is a ... a ... right to known facts because this started on October second and uh you know the news media didn't know how to report it except to say we believe he's been killed we believe he's been abducted we don't know\n... and there's a lot that we don't know about what happened to him\nIf it's true you know if it's true as has been reported that the Turks have audio tape of the murder\nIs it possible is it possible at all\nThat might ... the secretary of state former head of the CIA who goes to ... to investigate is it possible that if he had asked to hear the tapes he would have been rejected no\nDoes anybody believe that the palm pay Pompeo has heard these tapes no I don't believe he has I don't think you have to do it and so what he told the president was totally based on conversations that he had with Saudi officials and and the family\nAnd and the and it's not living in ...\nAnd again this is a government Saudi Arabia which has changed his story three or four times already said this\nAnd this is the Turkish government that until recently a heads knows very much to join with the United states in Saudi Arabia is right and there are a lot of conflicting national motives in actors in this um\nWe may never know the truth we\nMay never know the truth and so the big question now is\nWith what we know based on reporting because the intelligence information and intelligence information has not yet come out\nYou have the rest of the United states being somewhat of a of a Lone Ranger out there saying that you know it could have been somebody else\nWho said it's really bad and we are going to get to the end we're going to get to the bottom of it yeah\nSo he he is responding not in a way that a lot of Americans and certainly these are all journalists over the world wouldn't like to respond but\nHe's the president that we have whether you like 'em run out that's what he said so my question to you is next okay the Democrats the Republicans the ... the world press what do you want the president to have this government do\nNext let me who did have let me just say this is going to say this is the same president that called your profession journalism the people that work in your profession enemies of the people\nThat's who we are depending on to basically fairly adjudicate the truth I think nevermind a trace brilliantly tonight that you despise president ... despite the man I I had nothing against that shouldn't have\nDone ... let's just put you despise President Trump you keep coming back to the bashing Trump I asked you a specific question professor what are we doing that I Love my president look at the river on mine are in the forward mirror and tell us what you see all the ... going off the deep end well blah blah blah blah blah but what about it\nI Want to ask the professor to give me a specific look into look in the front of the mayor what do you want to do look in the front look forward with all that\nCall it what it is which is what\nYou have a state that murdered\nA person that was highly critical of that state call it what it is what ... what does he do the right or the president goes on there and says that then where\nIt specially two weeks or three weeks after you call them enemies that people again and again the journalists right at least put ten day as if you have a conflict of interest here as if as if you can't really talk about a journalist anywhere in the world now that you've Saudi Arabia\nDid not commit a crime against the United states has a dead it committed a crime against what we stand for ... ... ... that's one viewpoint Saudi Arabia you there\nThis guy to death that ... that we don't know that that we that well we don't know who trained the Saudis and tells us drug shortages maybe I Am I I'm started mission what what what I I'm not I'm not defined by ... from what color defending was already did that Trump did not say\nThat the United states paid for the equipment that shop this guy out now let let's be honest okay well I'm pretty conscious that throw things out there for going to have an intelligent I'm confident CIA works\nWith our allies in all countries when they're looking to you build relationships I I'm not going to discount that possibility I and I and I'm not defending God Knows what Saudi Arabia did I'm simply saying there are certain ways to proceed this was done this is what you do\nDo you recall you like what you call your diplomats\nI'm asking a simple question you recall you watch Tom that's what I'm saying or get money back and you're giving back restaurant what do we do now okay next regarding your last recall your diplomats are ... reduce foreign aid and all those things you do jeopardizes the flow of oil it's a it's a very delicate balance is it worth it\nI Would I had a case of Republicans ... ... I think a case can be made that\nIt is worth it under the right circumstances and we don't know what the circumstance where yes we're reasonably sure that elements of the Saudi leadership had one of their own citizens killed in the Saudi embassy of a foreign country we're reasonably sure of that and that is that is worse denunciation\nI'm beyond that uh I you know DEA cancel the arms deal do you uh do you do something that might interrupt the flow of oil um you know I think it's very easy for people to pound their chests and say yes we should do all that and it's also very easy for people to say\nUm you know well let's keep a cooler head about this and see what's happening so I don't pretend to know the answer I Would I think that the world right now is unstable enough that we don't need to foment more instability\nI don't know what the right as I Am the answer is\nIn the one group that we haven't talked about and their potential for action is Congress and within Congress both houses are there is fairly significant bipartisan engagement\nSo that they are unhappy with the what they've seen happen by actors from Saudi Arabia in the ... of their country in Turkey they won explanations and they want actions to be taken so Mr Trump's the president he's not to dictator\nHe has to work for the other branches of government but back to Tom's point there wasn't a violation of US law we had a foreign national Mr ... who is in his own consulate in Turkey and he was dealt with\nBadly by the people who are the Saudi Government um they have to answer in their own way as well um\nWe don't the donor what do you in\nGermany and now an editor's was finding out much influence the Saudi Arabia you have a\nGreat a great deal I I I wrote the book on the topic at the bottom a great deal only insofar as it comes to Saudi interests not when it comes to have both sides of ah to give them both sides [noise]\nMore of a sudden we see both sides you guys have got nestled bipartisan my heart persuasion Mumbai harder than\nI Do my back shortly for Chicago when we come back we're going to talk about\nThey're trying to come to the United states illegally and kind of you know rush the border and overwhelm\nThe border patrol to come in illegally so I don't think those images help the Democrats I don't think that they're persuasive to most voters I think most lawyers think we should have the border that we should have control of our immigration system\nOr doesn't mean we should deport everyone who's you're legally today that's an extreme position that most people don't I think agree with but the question is can we and should we control who can come into this country illegally that's a pretty basic concepts and I think it's one two thirds of three quarters of voters agree with\nOne thing that I learned from MSNBC a reporter and I I keep saying it's an NBC report because frequently on this program we're talking about the ... the mainstream media and how they're planting a story\nA in this particular case it was a story that really was delving into the numbers and I don't know whether a Chuck Todd is put in his data download or not but again it get caught my air that while you're on the program this evening but my uh another question I I Would ask because there are other factors\nAre the Democrats also rely on the younger voters\nAnd if you put younger voters and Hispanic voters or isn't that sort of a double whammy because neither one of those groups has a great track record of turnout\nExactly right um and you know look the Democratic party in Texas has been miserable failure for Fifteen Years for a lot of reasons I haven't won a statewide election in Texas since Nineteen Ninety four\nAnd every two years somebody trucks out you know there are new strategy but how they're going to turn Texas blue and they fool liberal donors small around the country or to fund their projects but one of the reasons that they fail is that they do count on the Spanish voter turnout like white votes turnout and they just don't\nI'm I'm sure there are reasons for that um I I'd be interested to know what they are and learn about them we obviously one voter turnout to be as high as possible among legal voters uh but but\nBroadly uh for for decades or the millennial though is is probably even more unreliable right most\nYoung people don't think politics matters to them other transients ah they're very focused on their own lives and and what doing what they want to do politics doesn't seem to matter too much\nI Do think Democrats are are expecting and hoping that they'll have very high in test turnout among African Americans Hispanics and millennials are this midterm election cycle and if they do builders are great credit because that will be a change from national intern right I just haven't seen ...\nKnow that and that I think it's going to be one of the ... one of the significant takeaways a of the midterms there that turn out and how that's going to affect the presidential election then twenty twenty Ryan ... says here he has a question for you\nKnow it's more of his statement but ah I see the the weakness in the Democratic approach is they treat Hispanics as one identity and from my experience in working in a very multi cultural military\nYou know the Puerto Ricans are different than the Cubans are different from the Mexicans are different from and to lump them altogether is a big risk\nThere are generational differences or you get more voter turnout from the uh establishments Hispanics or as a group or as a cohort but then within those unique communities that are out there there's not a whole lot of consistency\nGood that's a good point and and certainly if you look at South Florida um you know that point is is always well taken in in an area of the country like South Florida where are your issues related to Cuba have been very hot politically for decades or am certainly no one would compare a you know Mexican citizen\nA who who either legally or illegally immigrated taxes\nAnd consider them to be an essay or an immigrant from Cuba came to Florida right there are very different very different life experience very different views\nI think the one thing we can say about the Hispanic community is that uh there there are socially conservative broadly speaking there are disproportionately Catholic um they are disproportionately pro life\nUm they are disproportionately interested in legal immigration and\nTribes fan of streets republic it's\nGot to get to do with a higher percentage that\nWe get a little drop out on your single but again if you can sit with us we want to do another segment if that's okay with you\nJob we're talking with Matt ... he is a a with a company called Potomac strategy and he's talking about not only Texas politics but also uh what is happening with the Hispanic vote on whether or not they're going to beat the that they could be\nThe

she's Indian two questions I Want to ask Terry stalkers here I think America Elizabeth Warren releasing her DNA results\nAnd apparently she has quote Native American Indian from her great great great grandmother who's records show that she was white only because it was the safer Joyce she describes herself as a ... as white\nRather than record yourself as Native American since Indians at the time we're being attacked here's the question Jennifer for you I'll start with you\nNative American American indian but the DNA\nWas contrast it against Mexican native how does that all square I'm so confused and that\nDoes that square with me and I can tell you I'm more Native American that she is um my great great grandmother was a Cherokee Indian and I've got the evidence to show that are listed in the sense it but\nI think this is ridiculous I think she tried to to prove something that may not be provable and earlier this week I understand that the Cherokee Nation has said\nThere's no evidence that she can't affiliate with the tribe or that she can claim that she's Native American particularly if the DNA does not show\nWhich a tribe affiliation exam and curious to see if she actually check the Native American box on any of her a records for employment to see if she got a special event here at least so\nThe diversified faculty at Harvard that's why she got into this in the first place\nYeah I I just I forgot where it matters I mean so I I'm I'm more interested in what our thoughts are water policy\nUm thoughts are a conceptually where she stands on a lot of different political issues as it relates to society at large I could care less I mean I'm if she if it makes her feel more prouder of you know to have an understanding of what our heritage is that's that's all well and good I forgot where that mattered\nTo anybody other than her and her family um so I don't\nI don't get where where this was even newsworthy to be honest with you because it it has nothing to do what she going to move the needle on the vote because she has some Native American heritage last time I checked it you know if you're here you're American the American represent Americans and and go fight the good fight you know on the little\nHere to your point aren't we all mutts\nAbsolutely I I I could not tell you\nWhere my great great great grandmother was from because a a you know I'm I don't go to the ancestry dot coms of the world and all this kind of stuff and try to try to figure it out but be\nReally genuinely has nothing to do with me I was brought up in this country a I'm a proud American I always will be and where I came from has nothing to do with my ability to be a pride full American and do what I Need to do to be a great um contributing member of society\nBuddy in the world of politics Jennifer in does matter\nAnd politics in news are in bed together so she and she knows this she purposely put this out there right before the midterms chances are after the midterm she will announce she thinks that is helpful\nIt creates an attack against President Trump to pony up his million dollars because ah he challenged her to a DNA test the problem is I think it's got a boomerang honor because right now there's ten generations back she's one\nOne thousand twenty four percent Native American and more to the point it's it's Mexican native so I don't get it but\nPolitics are are ah are omnipresent in America\nIn this age of identity politics I think it makes a difference in two ways first of all it would illustrate if she game the system in other words if she's barely Native American but she checked the box for employment that tells us that she game the system\nThe other thing that tells us is that\nMaybe she wants to become the first Native American female president of the United states I mean that's really where we're going it's all about identity politics and and her history of gaming the system did she in fact check those boxes to get employment and I would suggest that she did\nWell I think she did I I think your suggestion a will prove to be a true\nUh it it will show that she did this to a game this game the system however this is sort of a badge of honor right now for her it's look at me look at me look at me I'm right I'm truthful and President Trump is not Jennifer I mean it ... the political\nOver ... that's over all of this is very strange to me\nIt is very odd and I think it to your point she was trying to prove president ... a truck wrong but she hasn't really proven anything how she I mean it just shows that she has a Mexican Indian blood in her um and this is why the the Cherokee Nation earlier this week has been so vocal\nAbout it a ... [laughter] finally in Christ to your point you you say well it doesn't even matter in politics everything matters and certainly now before the midterms\n[noise] maybe I mean it it again I'm I'm trying to ...\nHe doesn't already identified with I'm trying to figure out how this makes her\nPolitical agenda more clear or or more fruitful for her as she may fight the good fight and try to go be the first uh Jennifer ... you know female ended Native American president in the United states um\nBut again I mean there there's a huge disconnect I think there's a partisan disconnect between who you are and what you believe 'em and I and it shouldn't have anything to do with heritage I mean again if this is an American fight the good fight we're not ... if you're running for that office\nThe highest in the way in your number one priority your very first thing that you should be thinking of is the fact that you're American yeah and you must be agree with Trump when he says who cares I that's all we have time for on that segment straight ahead you were a Halloween costume at\nTo the office I'm Terry be right back\nOver in a news talk Ninety four point one special event\nThat actually happened I'm somebody dress it was the year that Michael Vick was released from prison and somebody a dress up as Michael Vick with like a a dog on a leash just like a stuffed animal dog\nBut it was then who painted their face black and he wasn't painting is said and black to pretend to be a any black\nPerson he was a black to be Michael Nick but\nThat didn't matter you you there was an explosion\nAnd where a large group of African American students that in our largest cafeteria and painted their faith white [noise] and\nYou know there will always be people that want to per protests and people who will get offended at the slightest thing and what have you but I think the the professional and responsible thing to do in this case is ask yourself like could be offensive to somebody even though maybe\nI don't intend it that way and even if maybe that person and being overly sensitive\nBut well you raise a good point on that but it's hard to jumping side somebody else's head\nI just wonder I'm a to your point about adding a little ... you know humor is a funny thing sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn't um we're down to about two minutes Tracy so let me go in this direction and get it give us your thoughts on that using the whole me too movement\nWith this girl wearing this about sexual behavior in the office has just put like Bosch\nOn fun particularly Halloween fun\nWow that's a great question um I think it's certainly heightened awareness\nOf people are just in the workplace in general and in professional settings what isn't is it appropriate and rightfully so right and the good conversation to be having added important for women to be having to comment on it as well um\nBut I I Do think you're right I think that it can get to a point where we are\nSo serious that we we forget\nAbout the Lebanese and we forget to have fun I think the biggest concern here is that the you know Halloween marks the beginning of the holiday season\nOr company is right and you have something like a Thanksgiving party in any of the Christmas Party or yet a New Year's party doesn't really the first opportunity to have something like that and to have that led the workplace and what's going on this year I mean\nIf you're a woman you dressing up things you know scantily clad her Halloween it's like what are you asking for\nA while as it sounds to me like I'm going to a child is a ... thing to do ahead of time precinct him double A.

Tim interview what'd you think Jennifer I thought it\nWas very helpful for people that work in the private sector here at the university I we've been getting given guidance that they should be very cautious meaning the students and faculty and deciding what they dress ads for Halloween because of the political correct that Chris and wealth management ...\nDairy I Love how you juxtaposed appropriateness um you said you've got to have a very nice figured woman wearing a Wonder Woman caught a costume and then you've got to have a a woman who may not be quite squeeze into that same same costume and in both cases it can be appropriate and I love that the response was use common sense [laughter] to\nMove on guys Americans are generally open and positive about seeking help from counselors and therapists and in fact\nForty two percent of adults have seen a counselor some time in their life\nWhile thirty six percent are in fact open to it and that by the way is barred on group research uh you can look them up on line burn up group research on with that\nChris is not really a stretch I think for parents should be open to taking their kids to mental health professionals if they see them struggling with certain issues\nAnd then you add to that horrific shootings in America that brought\nParents together to acknowledge the need for mental health care for young people um but\nWith that then has come there at some schools that child mental health history becomes part of the school records\nI worry about this because the fact that a kid could see a therapist either outside the school setting or within the school setting now is our record that this kid has a mental health issue\nThat's problematic to me you\nWell it's yeah it's a privacy issue I mean we we can't be infringing upon people's privacy rights although I Will say this\nIf we're not keeping good records of what is\nHappening with the child's behavior maybe which is a result of some mental health issue if there is not good documentation with respect to the behavior we're not doing everything that we can to prevent catastrophic\nEvent from happening so while I'm not a huge fan of just having an electronic medical record system that when you blow up a client or a client record a child's record 'em\nTo to view that child's history having a fleet of it the their mental health history I think we can hedge this a little bit if we have really good note and really get documentation about the behavior which could open up a conversation in the future and then maybe you do have to die to sell you know situation and that's\nWhy also like the title psychology rather than mental health Jennifer because mental health always sounds like a pejorative\n... is privacy and then what are we talking about with respect to a child let's say that we're talking about elementary or high school\nAnd the child Sikhs care for depression because their parents got a divorce or something else occurred I mean can you imagine if Brett Kavanaugh would have had mental health and his high school record they would have used that against him so I think there is a privacy concerns but on the other hand as a college instructor I've seen\nIndividuals in my classroom that clearly have some type of mental health issue and that would have been helpful to know in advance of teaching that course to have a better understanding of the students and their behavior within the classroom [noise] so\nDo you think Jennifer do you think it's more of a positive\nOr more of a negative if the mental health history and again I liked the psychological history I like the word cycle because it is much more broad and and it's not my understanding\nOf Jerry pejorative or the way mental health is pejorative or can be in today's parlance or do you think it is a help or hurt or can be when you put it in the history that they have been to an outside psychologist or outside I'd try your trip as opposed to a therapist\nWithin the school confines\nI think it's more of a negative all the way around because there are varying degrees of psychology and mental health issues so you have that in the record without any context or understanding just a disservice to\nThe uh Chris your final thought again I think we're we're going the line of disclosure and privacy\nOh let me talk to you you see all good

I never picked up a golf club once you know am I going to me now does not want my goodness have not even swung a golf and I got a big argument coming up yeah the independent Bob\n... all by the way and it was sort of an independent Bob just called me a few times just ranting I think he knew was vacation he just ranting and raving ... Elizabeth Warren thing just sending them into outer space yeah he's just like this is just\n... they they they believe that's a good thing to do\nThat they believe that this is a good tactic you and I just kind of just in general if you just look at the tactics right now the left as using I mean politically we're not talking about the moms in restaurants\nWe're not talking about you know the the the rank and file of the protesters talking about the people holding office yeah their political tactics I mean there are many this is their mainstream political tactic and they believe\nStuff like this is going to work and and that's and you and I made sure that before it went on vacation when we were talking about cabinet to understand this is the mainstream now as the Democrat leadership in this country because we'll always get calls from people saying well\nThis isn't the average Democrat it's the average Democrat now representing new sure in Congress and in the Senate\nRight\nThis is the standard and we'll get to Elizabeth Warren too and uh the the three big problems that she by the way they want to narrow it down just to three [laughter] one one of the things I I Love was uh I I never believed in white privilege until Elizabeth Warren\nA white person makes the claim yes she's Native American you all white privilege that's white privilege fried rice on cultural appropriation\nYeah right and and again they believe they're on the right track\nI Know it's just it's just unbelievable so we'll get to that the polls everything else you've got a great show up for cobra electronics here's your forecast\nSet to receive more rain today there's a couple of systems that will be providing moisture to the region in the Gulf of Mexico there's a low pressure systems and in the Pacific there's a low pressure area both of those systems funneling moisture right into southern Texas and the four corners region\nAnd if you get up into the higher reaches of the\nSouthern Sierra is an southern Rockies you could pick up some snow fall as a result of that pretty sick at the end of last week the winter weather forecast from the climate Prediction Center was issued couple regional highlights it will be warmer in the west no change in the chances for snow in the Northern Rockies it will be drier and warmer\nThe great lake region is expected to be drier\nKnow parts of the country are expected to see it\nTwenty five percent chance of an El Nino developing which means wetter conditions are possible across the country for winter bears or look at your national forecast from red eye radio meteorologist John trout\nThank you John eight six six Ninety red eye if you want to join his big six six Ninety but I sure I was busy St from family yeah [noise]\n\nThe beauty and the autumn leaves is waiting for you I'm center hill late Saturday October twenty seven this will be the sixteenth and you'll fall color crews from\nAnd it's it's it's crazy and then\nI guess the the other point was so Elizabeth Warren than does DNA matter [laughter] right right does this does this destroy transgender isn't mhm if DNA matters because remember the the the next thing is as as we all know\nUh we we've gone through the whole trans racial thing than the left just starting to embrace ... remember you're talking about Elizabeth Warren who was [laughter]\nBefore this one of the leading liberal icons [noise]\nYou know socialist icons social justice warrior ... who broke a ton of social justice warrior rules and regulations [laughter] number one you were saying the DNA matters does it does so DNA matters across the board that ... that it matters for uh your your sexuality it matters for your gender huh\nThat writers for your race huh right is is that the is that the whole point or or does it not in okay what's the determining factor of what you are then what is the what is the ...\nYou go what is the what is the fraction that indicates that you are a particular ethnicity just great stop well and\nIf I were doing a debate with her on stage I Would say a former President Obama said race is just a social construct yes do you agree\n[laughter]\nAnd people forget about that because again what you know it that when a president\nObama ... just before he left office I Believe that was the was the lead for New Yorker I forgot what I think it was the Atlantic he did a a an interview with\nAnd they asked him you know why do you say that you're black when you know your members right next mixed race soon and he said because I've come to know I come to realize that race is a social construct ... it's what you think you are ...\nSo is that it now is that done now has the left moved on because when when you look at it\nThere were so many rules of the social justice warrior that Elizabeth Warren broke and they were completely quiet mhm totally silent mhm everything from cultural appropriation\nTo the fact that race apparently is no longer a social construct it has something to do with DNA that's\nWhy are you using science [laughter] since the war [laughter]\nRemember when Ben Shapiro brought up science on a on the doctor drew show he was threatened with violence\nSo you can't bring up science that's wrong but see this is this is the madness of the left because there are so many different directions how do you know which one is the ...\nHere's here's the thing when Trump says something the majority what Trump says that they criticize in fact check this off the cuff mhm right it's it's an opinion or just the thought that he just boom Roberts out right and and and the insanity of the left\nWhich is I'm going to call them the whole my beer party from now on cars whatever Trump does like ... hold my beer I think that I Will watch what I'm going to say it's actually premeditated and thought out yes no planets\nThat they were trying they're trying to prove them wrong on something that he didn't give a half a second to he didn't give one one hundred and twenty fourth of a second\n[laughter] my my favorite was the [laughter] water over one hundred and twenty fourth yeah maybe seal and it was a huge ad I with a gun [laughter]\n... in a swimming pool it's you know that that's it it really is the that's the madness because they believe that something\nThat's going to win for them look in her state in terms of you know her Senate seat\nYeah she's pretty safe like Dick Durbin he can get away with saying and doing a lot of crazy things he's safe as long as he wants that seat but at least for the time being you want to enter the arena and twenty twenty\nFor the big house well but by the way not present the White House I mean yeah but [laughter]\nAlthough although Hillary was a contender for both um [laughter] we ... do you have to get up on that stage and you have to bring down out look again\nYou know those um those blue states where they're safe they can they can do the crazier things they can do the protester type attitude but do that up on stage you know we talked about this was a few months ago when we were talking about what the the the pool of contenders in the primary season and twenty twenty will look like right there each going to happen\nTrump that will be gold number one you've got to show your anger and you've got to show how much you so the person who hates Trump more\nIn terms of the perception by the voter or the rank and file Democrats might get the nomination because that's the goal number one for them so but in order to do that they have to get up on that debate stage during the primary season\nAnd that's what they have to do they have to do the crazier and crazier and crazier because no longer can you have\nA debate no longer can you have a real discussion ... what are they going to say well the economy is suffering ... as long as it holds between now and twenty twenty no a jobs we need more jobs ...\nWe haven't ... finding enough people right now [noise] um so the what are you going to do well do you have it has to be about the hatred for Trump's so you're going to have to display\nYou know the one who hates them most is gonna win ...\nOr where it's going that we thought the only way that they could go if they were going to go more or less which is we're offering you everything for free yeah yeah and I mean ... ... ... and that we are other game we yeah we do we we do have a fascist mindset and we do is to control\nA lot a lot of things we do believe in the intimidation uh uh uh the tactics out there we don't believe in the constitution of the United states would I by the way has become clear and we brought this up a few years ago and we were amazed\nAt the very little response so we got from Democrats on this front where we said look they don't really believe in the constitution we now know that they don't they don't believe in the Senate\nThey don't believe in the cars that by the way that gain ground over their vacation and you know the Senate has to go to the electoral college the electoral college just to go to the Senate has to go and what they what they may not realize it but that's when you get into not caring that belief get you to the point of\nNot caring about individual rights because that's why the Senate as exists that's why the electoral college or you know it exists\nBecause we're not a direct democracy were republic where constitutional Republican or a public why to protect individual rights that the Democrats and the ACLU use to care about right now as we know they don't write and so you know that's where you've got to we really don't believe in America\nAnd so in order to get you to vote for us we'll give you as much free stuff as possible to me that's actually what the Democrats where I don't know\nI I you're you're spot on and but the problem there is what\nCNN Jake Tapper and Chris Cuomo asking tough questions from oh Casio Cortez and Gillum you know separate interview okay well how do you pay for it how do you pay for it but but but beyond that forget about the media asking him wasn't so tough but they did ask the question\nIf you're Hillary and you get back in and twenty twenty\nThe it used to be the boiling the frogs slowly right okay we'll give you a little more free stuff and then we'll a little more free stuff you've got to go full on because you have Gillum and Florida promising the world will Casio Cortez promising to world Bernie's been promising the world\nCan all Harris now over the last couple of days yeah you know saying okay let's give everybody right now let's let's give people six thousand dollars a year that's the starting bright right let's just get cash to people and and so uh so we're to the the the the free cash free health care and free college\nYeah sand and they know they can't pay for it and the American voter knows they can't pay for it but how how do you do it if you're Hillary and you try and put up a plan of a little more free stuff no you've got to go full on like the rest of 'em that somebody will get to the point where we talked about before the twenty sixteen election\nOr one ticket to the mega

now the economy right the economy is doing the uh the economy's doing good\nUh and that is a huge you have the cabinet hearings where America has seen that there are major major things that are important to many Americans\nThat they now understand that the Democrats do not believe in and we talked about the cabinet forget about the Supreme Court ... what it showed was that depending on their politics\nThat the Democrats do not believe in a presumption of innocence right or the mindset of due process and we set up back at that and you know at that time a few weeks ago said look we understand\nThat when it comes to a lot of things out there on the for example on the the ... of separation of powers and the three branches of government and the rights that are included in the first

got you're going to have a field that is going to be greater than it was what did they have three three and a half candidates go up\nAgainst Trump no but if you in their primary or a ... well build me a heck of a lot more I I I well I don't know I I I'm not going to you know you you have to and you said this earlier it's going to be either who hates Trump more than a combination of\nWho hates Trump more and we're going to give you everything right and so right now the base level for the Democrats bend and Kamala Harris headed over the weekend ... last week\nWhen she came up again with her guaranteed in or any of them and yeah of six thousand dollars was one of the figures that was thrown out so now it's\n... well on the price of income yeah first is get rid of the the tax cuts right they act taxes would have to go up there in order to pay for it even though they ... it wouldn't pay for the six thousand dollars and but six thousand dollars what any American the mix under a hundred thousand something like that what it was I\nI'm a but a ... six thousand they're\nFree healthcare completely Medicare for all where you pay nothing\n... there's no deductible there is nothing ... which uh by the way uh I thought the president had the best response for that before we went on vacation when he said\nOh good screw people than that right because what's going to happen right you you you you think you're going to Medicare for all you can just going to enter a screen old people because not enough money for the old people that have put in for Medicare that we can't pay for Medicaid for them right\nAh but ah you know so you have you have that and free college free college free health care free money mhm and we hate Trump and really if you want to look at it there was nowhere else for them to do it we already know what twenty twenty is going to be\nYeah yep I age because there has to be again that that battle on stage to you know who hates Trump more poor or now will just kind of usher in this this thought and entertain this for a moment\nOkay\nIt is Hillary or maybe it is Joe just anyone that can beat Trump\nExcept there has to be more than that that really has to be more than that because what you're looking at at the end of the day or on election day\nIs on what's going on with the economy and and what are they really promising and and do I hate Trump I Know a lot of people have trumpet I didn't vote for the guy I may not ever vote for the guy but\nAm I motivated to go out and vote for this person what are they going to do for me you're talking about other sports were just talking about rank and file voters rank and file voters right because what did you see Wall Street journal\nGoing through Harlem and then then the day after the election and twenty sixteen why do you think he was just you know random participants on the street interviews\nAnd the the one common thread in those and those responses from those respondents was when he was talking about problems we have here at all\nSees somewhere outside of this country as we said the reason the Trump one was not because he had all the solutions but because he simply identified what the problem was what the problems were ... and the fact is you haven't had presidential candidates sort of looked at the topics that people have cared about\nAnd even point out these are the problems that we have to solve them that's how bad it had gotten by twenty six team as we said the Democrats were talking about instill our climate change and race are two major problem mhm well they're not right Americans didn't view it that way right ... is president because\nHe identified what the problems were and now we can debate all day long whether all of the solutions\nThat he has come up with or that he has promoted or the correct way to go or not ... but the fact is he came up with the problems and identified the problems and politics are so bad in America today\nWhere if you just identified the problem in twenty sixteen that got you elected president of the United states right\n\nAnd then what you have now is two years later you've got a ton of people looking at the same and you know something a lot of the solutions are the correct solution some\nYeah I mean that's in in that's it because what you have to deliver in order to be reelected for a second term as a result\nSo if we're still looking at low unemployment and we're still looking at you know the people taking more money home because taxes are lower if we're still looking at a situation where the economy is getting better\n\nThan where do you go you can offer free stuff what's that going to look like ultimately you're going to have to spell out how it's going to work\nAlternately you're gonna have to you know I mean\nWe say what you will about Herman Cain's nine nine nine plan\nBut guess what people still said the the name of the plan now we torn apart and it didn't work and ultimately didn't work for him but the point is is that you come out with something very simple here's how my plan is going to work here's what I Want to do while\nYou're up against potentially a president in twenty twenty\nWho has delivered some pretty stellar results on the economy\nSo you're gonna do what promised a lot of free stuff to people still buy the hype in the free stuff if they believe that will never be delivered ultimately\nBanned because here's what changed after the great recession and we saw this\nIt was well the banks got the bail out so I should get mine even people that otherwise might be conservative you know we're like okay we want we do want more free stuff we got a ton of those calls ... and so there is that affect their but the concern is too is that\nAmongst the you know just the generic voter population out their rank and file voter they're looking at as a this big promise oh free health care for everybody free whatever it's going to be the big free package\nAnd they say to themselves you know what it will be free for somebody else and it won't be free from me they they compare themselves to\nTheir neighbor or somebody else and it's like now I just got to end this good economy I just got to making this amount of money and guess what they're promising something to somebody else I'm not going to get any of that [noise] your\nAnd comments coming up eight six six Ninety\nSix Ninety red on red on

I still believe that it wouldn't have back then because in taxes remembering twenty sixteen in the primary he won the state he won Texas\nOr he also won Iowa or but but there may be may be could have been something where a Ted Cruz would have lost to a ...\nA back then and and again we don't make predictions would just look at the polls right now and and Ted Cruz has a fairly comfortable lead\nAnd is over fifty in the most recent polls and worked what two weeks in a day out so something would have to happen between now and then change those falls not saying it couldn't\nBut it would have to be a pretty decent shift to make up for that lost ground which would mean typically get outside that margin of error that's going to have to be\nA a seven to ten points swing in favor of that to work and there's nothing working in that direction but but I but you just ask yourself the question here based on what the rock star based on what\nUh I you know I I I don't know and I and I look at I look at a ... if you just if I was due to cook analysis of the\nThe new the\nNew up and coming Democrat and I'm not going to include a ... because she's been around for a little bit or even to Cory Booker because he's been around for a little bit even though you can say that they're ... they would still be new to a significant portion of America if you want to look at the new breed\nBecause we are not a direct democracy we are a constitutional republic and the reason we are as to protect the rights of the minority this to protect the individual rights and the rights of the minority exactly what they claim that they believe the Democrats claimed that they they think about\nSo we look at all that and that's all part of loving America so when you hear when I say that I've always gotten response or it's above the thing that he loves American we don't know based on\nThe actual specifics of what the Democratic Party is promoting ... what we're calling for which is anti constitutional mindset and an anti constitution ... yeah and we can make that point and you and I've spent for the longest time\nBut it's the last that doesn't believe in the first amendment oh for them yeah mhm but for others they don't and we have broken that down before they don't believe in the second amendment and now they don't believe in due process under the law when it's inconvenient for them there was not a presumption of innocence that mindset is wrong\nAnd we've talked about that you know the support of the judges when the judge has become activists judges\nAnd how that is on American and unconstitutional and how they promote that mhm and so the average person I think she's at and Trump is anything they look at ... and I look at Trump and you look at Trump is anything but an authoritarian and a fascist\nEven at times though his words we like it don't say that\nYeah I ... when you look at what he actually doesn't what he promotes in the long run it's all constitutional yes it's all part of the\nProcess that was put in place hundreds of years ago I mean it it's but this is this is what we have to this is what it has to come down to if we're not going to win the Senate when did you get rid of it\nThat we're not going to win the electoral college vote than to really get rid of it we need to get rid of the constitution wanted Dustin when it does me when we don't win the White House we need to get rid of ... that's anti American yes\nIt's not America where they don't like it when the constitution if we don't have the form of government that we have that it's no longer America\nWhat do you believe it besides the Fifth Amendment [laughter]\nBesides exactly an eight six six Ninety right I [noise]\nWas a widow ready to do with a record ...

was important\nTo bring that up because that's more of the the emotion of what drives an election and I and I don't think I don't think we should discount how important that is in the ... election that reason the Trump is drawing the crowds that he is is drawing\nA especially from a Republican Party that you'd think two years afterwards that he's going in and doing these rallies and he is drawing these people and we had mentioned the the uh the the story that came out over the weekend that Beto O'Rourke a small little theater\nHe couldn't fill that here in the state of Texas just a couple of weeks out as was reported over the weekend that the real rock star even though we hate that term for politicians to begin with\nBut the real rock star still is Trump and why because there was an emotional attachment to him that is based on the substance of what he's doing\nIt and that's what that's what it comes down to and also how the left is behaving in reaction to how the left is behaving in and that type of threat that that poses if you think of the what happened during the cabin a confirmation process you know so that's that's what it comes down to what's the greater motivator on each side\nAnd will seat and a couple of weeks for radio road logging here's your forecast\nTexas set to receive more rain today there's a couple of systems that will be providing

early voting started this week yeah here in Texas is are they [noise]\nTell\nA friend a news talk Ninety four point one special event\nHas has been like this so to even question that to me uh shows ignorance and that doesn't mean stupidity it means\nA lack of knowledge ah on on history and that's why we brought up and said that didn't happen was sort of more on that didn't happen with Kagan there were people that disagree with that because we we believe that sort of my or and Kagan many times not all the time\nOn the with\nThe cell tower right to cell tower case of the cell tower that they agreed with ... a day you know that ah they used the in their writings they used\nUm the prior judgment or by opinion written by ... majority opinion written by Scalia is ... exactly that was the press and the right they use\nBut in many of their many of their answers and many of their their decisions we believe they legislate\nWhich is not their role which is why we were against their nomination but it was based on traditionally what they would do not by what we want each and every day mhm mhm but what the job of the\nAnd that's the difference and that's something that we brought up with the whole Kavanaugh hearings that we should look ... you know conservatism Republican stop have to stop arguing\nThe same premise that Democrats are arguing right Republicans keep arguing most conservative versus liberal justice no it's not ... I'm not voting for a conservative judge I'm voting for a construction is an originalist I'm voting\nThat were meant to be each and every day understand\nThat their role is not to make law either left or right there their job under the constitution is to interpret what the law says you know it's interesting to as ... as we got to the uh the the closer to the the ultimate vote on\nOn a cabin on you know I made the point that even the liberal justices respect the process in my opinion based on experience and I think one thing you can look at one judgment you can look at from ...\nWas recess appointments which was ... yeah against Obama against Obama yeah because if you look at that that really was something that was very clear on what the process yes and so\nRespecting not only the process of how you know the confirmation process of of of how that's done but also again the process\nAt the highest court I Do believe and you know you can say what you will about the opinions written by a Ginsburg or or whether they're dissenting or majority opinion\nYou can we can tear those apart and say well they're wrong about this or the wrong about that or we disagree with this or that but in terms of the process I think\nAh by and large I have seen them display consistently respect for the actual process and I can point to that one example but there are others\nA recess appointments was that unanimous decision where ... you can't do that and and and that is that is the difference\nWhen the left no longer respects the process when you don't respect to process what is left because what is left is shouting people out of restaurants do away with the Senate do away with this do away with the President's Day do away with the electoral college do away with parts of the

election shows the chances of a blue wave are far from a slam dunk for the Democrats the NBC Wall Street Journal poll released a Sunday shows forty eight percent of registered voters\nWould prefer having Democrats in control of Congress compared to forty one percent supporting the GOP these seven point gap is narrowing from a ... point gap the Democrats had in September I don't know if that tells you anything though\nWell and and again I mean registered voters ... we've got to talk about likely voters and then again what the motivation is on election day and it's we've been talking about this it has changed since the Kavanaugh's confirmation leading up to and since\nI don't know to what extent I Can't tell you what motivated the left or the right more we do know there's no doubt the right is motivated Republicans are motivated right now are they more motivated than Democrats I Can't tell you that\nI I watch it on the Mike called before we started talking about you know the the whole Russian collusion at the top of the hour and I say that because Mike was not driven to call based on what we had said and therefore he you know became passionate about giving his point of view across my called with that passion\nAbout the Russian collusion investigation and his anger and his feeling that this could possibly changed the election you know and and move it to the Republicans before we ever started talking about I think that's important because I don't find many people like Mike mhm I don't think honestly\nNow we've covered everything when it comes to the whole Russian collusion from day one and we've asked every question known to man kind of we do think that we have looked at more or as investigators in partisan\nAnd we believe that hey that with everything going on and with the Pfizer warranted and and everything there that we are going to find out\nThat probably the Democrats were up to a lot more ... than the Republicans ever dreamed of actually doing it as we know already the only evidence including with the Russians in any way directly or indirectly would be the DNC and the Hillary campaign to\nGiving the money to a ... way the gave it to a fusion GPS and gave it to the former spy Christopher Steele who said he got his information his salacious on verified information\nOr I or against Donald Trump from people close to the Kremlin ... so the only people that colluded in any way with the Russians were the Democrats from the information that we have at this particular point but I don't think right now that's driving anybody to go to the post\nUm ... it could it is it an underlying factor as a part of the larger I guess scenario with Republicans or conservatives\nAre based on following you know the work of of many really great reporters who really brought to light so many things in this thing if you really followed it but it could it be there again is that underlying motivator\nThat's I don't think that's the big push right now I don't think that's the big emotion nothing right now um I Do think there's something to the the the fact that\nThey then alleging all of this sense you know a after the election and since certainly he's become president uh and they never showed anything for it and and it's really been this media circus and it's really based on nothing\nI think that's a motivator but it's not what I don't think it's the here and now I don't I don't see it\nI look I I think that there are some people that have looked over the last couple of years and what the Democrats have done and they have included\nA ... in its in its contacts the whole Russian collusion thinking how unfair they believe it is and maybe that's partly what's driving them to the polls but the difference that we've seen over the last month in the energy level or what are they called the excitement level and upper Republican voters to come out\nWhich would make the difference\nIn keeping the house and increasing the number in the Senate none of that has to do with Russian collusion right or the mall or investigation at All right not\nAnd see I don't know what a of a more report does the if the if the report from last week is true that says the that Mueller would would uh issue the core of his report after the midterm right after the mid term\nI I don't know what that does politically because first of all how can it be an actor report without including the fact that of how all this information was obtained and what you just spelled out now does that direct line that we know\nThat no one has disputed between the DNC and the Hillary campaign and ultimately Christopher Steele\nYou can't you can't debate you and you can't ... you might get that out a report I don't they do it's it's incomplete\nUm what I Know the report right now it's not going to even talk about that in in that that's the whole point it's like a ... but it's not even going to talk about the possibility of Trump looting with the Russians\nI I just because where where it would be the evidence if there's not going to be in the movement on indict\nIf it is just to report a chrysalis over at CNN or former Washington Post I write it you know where he said you know I think it's ... it's ultimately going to be just a just a report he's been saying that for a while\nIt's it's ultimately just going to be a reporter is really not going to be any more indictments unless maybe there's a you know lying to investigators charge somewhere else along the lines\nAnd and we've got what are the Michael Flynn hearing\nAnd everything else of us probably will never see this ... right\nBecause in and that'll be a complete does that it'll just happening right it's it's something I noticed the landing on the last two years you had accusations don't just it's just as an owner except for the fact\nThat you have the I. G. working on some information of what was going on at the department of justice during that time based on what the president and the White House sent to Mr Horwitz and we've been asking this way I still haven't seen anybody else\nAsked what what we asked why would the White House sent it to the inspector general\nThat is the most interesting mystery that exist right now in Washington DC and nobody is talking is asking the question what do you start out by the way on vacation I owed everywhere nobody is talking about talking about and we said it when it happened we said why is your son into the ... the only reason the ideas because\nYou suspect corruption why are there no leaks on this why is nothing coming out on the story at All right\nWhen rent and people have just a refresher when rubber when President Trump says he's going to declassify\nThe Pfizer application and other emails that were sent between the FBI and the department of justice rules of Twenty one different pages but uh and then it came out well he\nUh uh we have some allies or don't want us to ah you know released it there it might be some sensitive information so we're going to send it to the inspector general\nTo look at it and expedite whatever that I'm In court yeah expedite a report out of and we said well why would you give it to the I. G.\nI. G. years nothing to do with whether you should release it oh corruption and how how to our allies know what would be how our allies know what's in it and what's not in it how could they object either way because they don't\nSo why are you studying at the G because one region you started the id is that you believe you because you declassified have spotted a criminal event and you know that as\nThe the role of the I G and because of the power that they have the gene you can go in and get the documents that even oversight committees haven't been able to get within the department of justice and the White House\nWouldn't be able to get it I mean that would be a political move right and there's also takes it out of the political realm you give it to the idea you go to war with and see what Horwitz can find in which has access to every corner milk and cranny and the de OJ\nAnd and since that happened what almost three weeks ago McGregor maybe you and I said what are we missing here ...

maybe where do I listed my education that's usually a big question\nThat is a great question Greg and there is a big difference as to where you should put your education if you're a recent graduate it doesn't matter if you return to school later or your traditional learner you should put your education\nAt the top of your resume\nIf you're also a person who has high level degrees like a master's degree or a doctorate you should lead off with your education however if you had been in the workforce for a while and have had a couple of different types of employment\nOr employers you should lift your education towards the bottom it's not forgotten\nBut it has less emphasis\nOn education is clearly important especially as to where you included but that also begs the question if you're putting your education the top and changing where your work might be ... what about your prior work what should you include in previous employment how much\nWell if you're going with a functional or hybrid resume you want to list the employer the city state the employment dates and your job title there's no reason to list anything more if you're going with a chronological traditional resume\nThen you may want to include a job description underneath that\nWhere you could have quantifiable a bullet points underneath the job description\nI've been working for about twenty some years have had several different jobs should include all those jobs\nOnly if you're using a hybrid resume you should include the last ten years of employment\nWhat if I have gaps in that ten year period\nGreat question Greg gaps unemployment are not addressed on the resume gaps of employment are addressed in an online application where they ask you what you've done in between those times of employment\nThey don't ask the question should you all for that information\nIf they don't ask you the question I Would say no don't offer the information\nSo don't feel like you have to fill in the blanks that they didn't ask you to\nOnly on an online application if they ask you for gaps of employment you will lead to\nThat question this was in motion we're speaking with Bill Ruben tutors information an inspiration to help you and your plane career there's what she provides the oh we've covered a lot of things for your resume from types and what to include for work history qualification we've previously talked about ... skills education and employment obviously important\nWhat about volunteer work I see that sometimes on a resume\nAbsolutely Greg volunteer work can be a deciding factor on your resume because let's say for example\nThat you want to work with children and you have had\nVolunteer work with children in the past but no actual work experience that might be the thing that actually get to the interview and even the job for that matter\nSo volunteer work is very important it's also a great way to get references if you don't have very many references you're a recent graduate\nVolunteer work is a great way to work with people for them to get to know you and your work ethic and for you to get preference as\nWe've covered including so many things on a resume and hopefully given people a better understanding of what they do want to include in there one question that I Would have\nYou list all of your accomplishments you bust your qualifications you lift your skills is there a line that you might cross when it comes about trying to make yourself look inflated should you worry about that I'm running a resume\nIn today's world where there's a lot of competition the importance is to be ethical truthful um but you have to tell your credentials no one else is going to blow your own horn so you have to be the one to do that\nAnd your personality is going to actually come across in the interview so that's really what's going to clinch the job for you\nIn other words a nice display of self confidence or soaps absolutely\nLocal people counted hosted daily news talk Ninety four point

you care about that's why I Believe if we are fortunate enough\nHouse for him to worry about\nThat claim that lady can start a dark\nRarely is that the those are the words of a leader is that somebody who wants to matter again Hillary Clinton giving a series of interviews trying to steal the headlines before the midterms Michael good ones here my corroded of that\nFront page right now and on the New York post Michael why do you believe what you're hearing now is somebody who's preparing for for a rematch\nWhat Ryan just a clip you played as is one of many examples of\nI've been writing for months and often you know people say you're crazy but I've been writing for months that she wants to run and that the each of these things as another little sign another little step into the arena\nAnd I think you're seeing more and more uh once the midterms turn she and her husband are going on this speaking tour for six months seven hundred bucks at the high end too yeah\nBut that's true but to me I think the main thing is she's going to be out there the two of them are going to be out there this is a way of keeping her name front and center at while all the other candidates scramble to put together their teams instructor raise money\nShe's going to be ahead of them again and I think she's been sitting here thinking who can beat me who among the Democrats can beat me uh in primaries and you think\nThat President Obama could step up and say step aside Hillary you're you're too old and you lost\nHe could but still who is the alternative I think that's the question and until somebody emerges\nShe is something of the default incumbent in that position of being the nominee I look at us Brian who can lead the party who couldn't unite them around them a message look how divided the Democrats are there may be twenty people running in twenty twenty\nOr justice President Trump or in sixteen had all of those are Republican opponents\nLittle by little he started with a small base a little by little\nHe gained traction he got his base up to twenty twenty five thirty thirty five as everybody dropped out he gained more and more I think you could see something like that with Hillary Clinton a war of attrition where she starts with the biggest base and grows it as they all drop out\nSo you know you do point out some things that I read the New York times editorial section essentially was critical of her to Vanity Fair wrote an article saying that she didn't learn the lessons of me too because when I did kill us answer\nAbout did your husband should your husband have resigned after his affair lying about his affair with Monica Lewinsky so her answer was she was an adult must do terrible answered that is\nWhat is technically legal but that's but that's the Clintons they're never going to change I mean that is the thing they never really changed show would you a\nChronically needs to push back on the left nuts on the right the right would be high fiving if she ran again here's Marie ... worked for John Kerry said\nI think that she has become a distraction\nI had a nice respect for many of the things she done in her life and her career\nBut as her goal is to help the Democratic party immediate chore that comments particularly about me kill in sexual assault it's just not helping it is a distraction at a time white Nineteen days out from the terms when Ghana credit candidates are looking to the future\nNot the past and she is the path\nI think that's a that's a very good point that Maria ... but she's also talking about the limit terms that\nShe is a distraction to the midterms and I think that is all of those all of those women who wrote those articles that you cited two or three of them\nThey also basically are complaining that she's a distraction against the party's candidates in the midterms that'll be over soon enough then we'll turn to twenty twenty almost immediately the field will start to take shape\nAt that point she will not be a distraction she will be one of many people I think speaking it but she's going to do it in her own way look she may have health problems that surface\nAt some point I spoke to President Trump but my interview with him or two weeks ago\nHe said he thought that she did not have the mental or physical stamina to do it um I don't know if she does or doesn't but I think she's ...\nOr in herself she's positioning herself and I think she was a we know Brian she wants to more than anybody alive\nRight mortars Bob Dole Al Gore John Kerry John McCain have in common and Mitt Romney's they lost the show's great difference and they stepped aside the something else she is capable of showing any class absolutely it's selfish my great Boise one me over\n\n... center adoption and family services is a local nonprofit Christian adoption agency serving birth mothers and adoptive families in the upper Cumberland\nUh was kind enough to come on with us friday and she says this dates back to two thousand nine listen what happened then made the ... ah they they made politicians think central and south Americans were more important than Mexicans\n[noise] it's a kid that than eight law written by Dianne Feinstein that tree in Canada Canada and Mexico different than a treat and Central Americans because back in two thousand eight\nMost of our apprehension for all that they can now they're all predominantly\nCentral American it's a shocking that when you look at it at the hundred thousand family in at apprehended last year from El Salvador Guatemala and Honduras\nNearly Ninety nine percent of them remain in the country today so at that time it's all pretty much that's four hundred thousand apprehension is we cannot repatriate on their way once they enter put a cow in the United states we cannot just send them right back\nSo that's the reality you your country is not the problem\n[noise] ... I I think I you know listening to what you just played my comments\nMexico into the United states coke convene a conference here in Washington a including the ... northern triangle concrete seven side of our own Buddhist and walk them out and ... was very clear about that meeting and which Mexico and the U.S participated work ... was that we need to work\nOn a you know regionally on a two track approach\nOne we most assured that development is better on those countries\nAre so people are not forcing the immigration decision and that also LOL loss mostly in fourth that was the main conclusion Indian you only need long term solution to this is making sure that there's development in this country and the United states is work it stores that goal as well as Mexico and central\nAmerican countries but at the same time we cannot obviously um look the other way to the fact that a ... most the ... and ... that is a ... in my view that approach that will change things I guess everything that is going on is just a um you know ... it really a\nCall ... ... to a step up the pace to find long term structural solutions to this phenomena and that is precisely what we're working for\n... so you're saying if they want to stay in Mexico they can stay in Mexico but they just want to come here do you guys have laws and rules when it comes to refugee status or gas workers status or\nYes we do we do have both things we do have gas workers styles and we do have\nA a refugee status according to our own immigration laws on the international law and in fact Brian about at least around a thousand people a had a self\nYesterday had already requested refugee status in Mexico and I was the intent\nA and we will continue to do so and that's why we call on the\nHigh office or the high commissioner of the United nations on refugees to help Mexico in this process so which transparent it's clear it respects human rights and you don't hold that role and it's an important challenge August but I think we wouldn't be able to handle that\nCorrect yeah I Know you don't want to comment but there's some message that we're giving to Central Americans in those tribal countries\nTo make them think now more than ever now over the last eight years more than ever did they feel as though they can come in and not to beat the system and can stay you heard that that that to an American executive American a federal government worker\nOr the spokesperson for homeland security who said that Ninety nine percent of the people coming in or not Mexican\nSo there's some message that we're giving that's being misinterpreted were they know our laws better than anybody else now let me ask you a quick question about the war when I look at what happened when I see the wall being effective in Israel when I see the well being effective in hungry\nWhen I saw how effective the Berlin Wall was a because for the wrong reasons when the iron curtain dropped\nThey controlled movement we have seven million open jobs here nobody wants to shut down immigration we just want to control our borders why does Mexico take that personally\nBut first of all Mexico understood in some respects the right over the United States I've thought of any concrete to protect its borders centered and force of law and I want to make that very clear and where in fact have a\nVery strong corporation agenda with the chest and all the authority to us\nWe don't see eye to eye on everything and you know the United states has the right to protect\nIts borders that we don't question that if you ask 'cause we were you know you're friendly neighbor we would say perhaps that's not the best way to go and we have made that very clear and I think that's several analysts have pointed out to the fact that there are you know perhaps better ways to a secure our\nEnd up with the United states that required um so that's that's pretty much where we are we you know we are as as neighbors ... some friends who you know it was on an issue\n... and I understand that but it is it there's something about a wall that bothers you I mean there are communities that don't want fences with my community everybody's got a fence but you don't take it personal if we could control our borders it'll make your southern border more defensible\nBrian ... again we're not against\nAny country and forcing and protecting its borders are and the fact that it was personal because uh you know white what Mexico in general does not appreciate this postseason he's ... is because it has been in some instances\nA couple with a narrative that is very offensive to Mexicans uh Mexicans are hardworking people\nAbsolutely fine you know have\nValues of you know there's live up to be\nA bad people in a big group that's obvious okay but um if you do it generally station in that regard you will go on to offend all of Mexico and let me give you an example but you know being born to the previous administrations more than you know\nFive hundred miles of fence says we're built\nYeah but they were not coupled\nWith the narrative that was offensive to our country and that it's important so we go we have a good dialogue with the Trump Administration says yes we do have differences but we believe that through corporation on ballot we saw those differences as we just eat on that that that is precisely what we're going to eat it too\nYeah a pride matters so I understand that um and hopefully people will get that point across but when you see how many jobs we had when you talk to farmers and not not not saying all Mexicans are Central American should be working on a farm I'm not generalizing but a lot of them do\nAnd seven million jobs are open farmers are desperate for a guest worker program it seems like we just can't get out of the blocks and we're and we will have some simple problems\nBy agree wholeheartedly with you I I think for example and we have had discussions with us from ... in that regard that for example the age to a beach a program which allows temporary work ... to come to your\nShould probably be reviewed an updated in a way that it's more a it's more simple\nAnd more effective uh let me tell you something Mexicans don't have a cheap being planned that heat them that you know goes to ... go and you know break the law and entered the United states um if there are sufficient and simple legal avenues I think that\nPeople will choose those alive and that's what I Hope and I understand I understand\nThat this is a very sensitive on devices Easter politically the United states and we're extremely respectful of rod buddy vehicle\nYou know a thoughtful discussion about how to fix the immigration system including you know discussion with Mexico will end up\nHelping India both contract our demographics are complimentary and as you just said I had sat down with the act sector people for you know I Believe in the last month Sunday feel that they need a lot of people in order\nTo you have all the jobs in the same happened with the uh for example um construction business so these can be a window we absolutely old countries yeah and and we should work on that I'm Glad I see it right the ship Brian\nAmbassador of the you know the story of our country you know when the Irish first came over and they were building the railroads and when the Italians first came over they were they were working their way up but you know up the ladder it happens it through that's the history of America you have your own history as well but I got to get back I before I let you go and you know you're busy\nJust on this four thousand to seven thousand\nThe Mexican authorities have one last stand before they get to Texas Arizona New Mexico or or California\nWhat I Will let you know it's a Mexican authorities will make sure that everybody is ... is complying with Mexican immigration law and that it's only a ... through that way that they can come in\nAnd we will continue to follow this equation are words that they've not to have anybody to break the law of the United states are much\nRight uh that means there's really no way to stop him a ambassador get like you know I I

written a brand new book along with Jeff Eggers and Jason men Jones I say is Enron\nGo men go home or in a leader's he's called leaders Mitt and reality and you went back in history to make sure you had it right and you had a confession earlier he didn't have everything right in your first two weeks to leadership books or you learn more\nWell we certainly didn't have some things right now I thought about leadership and so we went back to look at these Thirteen leaders in history and to see what about them we didn't really understand that so we did these pairs of genre we did geniuses and reformers founders\nPower brokers and we tried to look at Thirteen fairly diverse leadership experience just by people and see what it is leadership really is\nGoing to throw it was so mad at you please silos who could Walt Disney what did we learn from Walt Disney struck down with cancer early probably would have been even bigger in greater but man his legacy lives on in his name has never been stronger what did he do\nWell it was extraordinary is a very talented animator in his early years she created this studio they created Mickey Mouse and really technological breakthroughs\nBut then from Nineteen thirty ... thirty seven he drove his team to produce Snow White the first full linked animated feature and it was extraordinarily successful even though we had to mortgage the company and mortgage the eye Peter Mickey Mouse to fund the picture\nWhen it was hugely successful\nFor years later we as a bitter strike for many of those same animators because the company had grown as got more corporate the structure and the bureaucracy had changed and suddenly the kind of leader he'd been at a smaller more family like company\nShe couldn't do here and he couldn't grow we couldn't adapt to that new reality show what really happened is just brother Roy ran the corporate side of the Disney studios from then on Walt Disney focused on things like Disneyland so he was great in imagining things and focusing on ... projects\nHis brother became great at running a big empires\nSo if Stanley McChrystal was looking at Walt Disney in his forties thirties and forties do you try to get more do you try to broaden out Walt Disney or you just try to get somebody with a skill set to match the problem\n... that's a great question I think the first thing you do is try to get Walt Disney to adapt but there's some people who can't or just are not interested in adapting and then what you've got to realize is he's not the right\nAnd then you bring somebody anyway\nBut we'll be like apple and virtually was Steve Jobs see there was basically an insurgency at a company that he created when he came back he even said he was better suited for that job\nWell that gets ... so he grew the leader is all in context the followers and the situation determined to leaders effectiveness Margaret Thatcher\nShe was strong convictions believe very strongly and certainly conservative ideas because she was so unwavering and that she became very very appealing to the British you went through the very difficult Nineteen seventies she became a very popular prime minister and then after about eleven years\nThe arc of her leadership she became more autocratic the very firm competed style she had before began to wear fan on people and she was essentially politically assassinated now it wasn't that she had lost that it was that the times had changed\nThe context it changed her followers had gotten wary of her style and they essentially pushed aside\nI hate to boil everything down to sports but how many great coaches hit the ten year mark coach in the same team and just all of a sudden they don't listen they stop listening need a change and the next person you bring in is totally different Bob Lenin replaces Billy Martin you know or\nYou have um um you have um the\nPittsburgh coach who are who is now out who is a Bill Keller is now out do end up as a broadcaster when he had all that suggests he says the guy stop listening to me ... cell seems to move on the year before he asked to cause he senses they hurt my act before\nI think that's true plus there's always the danger that the leaders starts to think they've got all the right answers they've had the success that here the press they start to believe there's really smart they lose their humility and I think that makes you less adaptable\nI Will never use my ... my ... a general have a couple more questions for I catch up there and the other side they would the book as leaders go grab it while you can it's a great idea for Thanksgiving leading up to Christmas or whatever holiday you celebrate\n\nAnd you are not a fan of the president is that safe to say\nWell I think I think we as Americans have got to decide what kind of person we want in the presidency and not argue about who it is now or who it's gonna be next we're to go back ... first principles and say what do we want our president to be how much integrity\nHow much forthrightness help how smart we want and what kind of experience and I think if we did that if we had a conversation on that in America we might come to a different appraisal of our current president but also who we need for the\nFuture and how do you explain forty seven percent a popularity\nWell I think it's not very difficult to put people's emotions to play to people's emotions on different issues and so I'm a little bit of a skeptic on some of the polls either way but I Would say that we need to make sure that we don't\nConfuse popularity with what we need to think of the best teacher your coach you had in high school it may not have been the one you enjoy the most at the time or you love the most part you're sort of look and say you know that person made me better ... and I think that\nLeaders are supposed to make us better they're not supposed to take the pennies side of us and played to it they're supposed to pull us up right and you

is a mistake this is a criminal acts of responsible for it will be punished\nListen ... bear dizzy acknowledging the fact that just came out today and I don't think Turkey's innocent and if they have nothing to do with the killing but man the fact that they're observing it and and letting out this information little by little and we still have not heard the tapes they claimed to have\nTo keep in mind whatever you do don't exonerate turkey is about the brutal way they treat a members of the press\nOr every body so uh what they said now is they actually got a guy that looked like ... or so

me Joe the Saudi assassination that story next\nBeauty and the autumn leaves is waiting for you I'm center hail light\nI Would want to the\nSaudi Arabia has a very long memory as does the United states and Saudi Arabia is the leading patron of Islamic ideology for most of the Brotherhood along with Qatar from him we've heard very little but will show only be relishing the scene I'm so this is a very very troubling in\nMany ways that that that will power like cookie\nWouldn't risk making was critical alliances at this time in history\nI Want you to\nMe that ... that doesn't mean Brian that I that I sanction the killing of this journalist I think that the ... is that so I did was ever rendition he didn't deserve the debt but this has been made not similarly was by Turkey's decisions\nWell yeah but I mean it's still fundamentally it's Saturday decision the turkeys making the most of it might have a heads up and it was happening so the Saudi foreign minister who is a long time about ... to the United states a bill ... friends who\nAre very capable diplomatic very capable ... guy very highly educated women wrote them and\nSo I Want you to hear what he said here's were ... when I asked him what would you just said going to you\nAnd you're saying that the crown prince wrong with them so long to not know about this\nWe individuals to distance himself from his office there was tremendous mystic moved in with components the mistake was to try to cover up\nSo to speak of these things unfortunately up and who wants to mature the social response will punish them we was mature than we have to use a place to go\nI mean\nOh gee ... stature which would be\nEnormously informed about the critical stakes is the relationship not just in general but now Saudi Arabia his face and die investment of international dollars and twenty sixteen I'm twenty Seventeen before they happen oil revenue is down by sixty seven percent\nIt used to be over three hundred billion dollars annually now it's barely scraping by a hundred and ten billion dollars annually as gay youth population Bulger's modem Seventy cars tend to under the age of thirty unemployment is up to twenty five percent of men and double that in\nWomen they cannot afford this so I I I have activity\nI understand crown prince Mohammed bin ... rounded up the most powerful figures in the Saudi royal family I understand he did that I guess what\nWe want not making an outcry of not even when I was very good Saudi friends were involved people the whole shows in your employer twenty first century Fox or in Twitter orange ... we did not complain about the apprehension of prints all where he'd been to love\nBut he said but to think that he would have conducted such a botched operation on a journalist if such relatively normal stature it's just not conceivable and I do agree\nThat seems to be a lot of bad decisions and they start ... a lot of bad cover up a lot of bad exit this is not how extraordinary rendition or targeted assassination is commonly carried out but the key is I feel almost as if\nIf there's a lot of history and the United states to try and an economic sanctions Saudi Arabia to pull back from the U.S Saudi relationship with the shooting ourselves in the foot and I can't help the United\nStates than kingdom is walking into a trap laid albeit maybe by Saudi stupidity but we just don't want to get into that kind of crisis on some of the loudest calls the economic sanctions have come from the very members of Congress and Senate who I Am most benefiting not only by Saudi\nFunded Washington lobbyists to invested last year alone twenty seven million dollars\nInto lobbying campaigns and political action campaign for the St politicians who are now calling for economic sanctions but also um the the the the the the enormous economic and political full that what happened to our country with a combination of certain um a contract\nI remember that this is the entire lens of what's\nGoing on between the United states and Saudi Arabia\nIn our political space here in America is always plays through the prism of President Trump and Jared Christian and it's been a huge attempt to vilify President Trump and Jared Kushner\nEven more I make this all about them and not his activity on that an accurate any other time in history and we will be thrilled that we have an orthodox Jewish men on\nA Saudi Arabian Muslim print so closely allied that they're planning to economic future of of the region that would be a course his celebration today this tremendous political capital in making this worse than it is\nOnly as a modern so basically we have never have your we will never knew that this is a friendship is is missing from the civil war four will be punished\nBedroom or he says you'd ever being involved in this we'll find out who it is really a fall guy out there but are there are other American politicians who believe\nThat nothing is done without the crown prince and he's shown diseases showed a ham had in this in the way has conducted some operations in Yemen where he ... the Lebanese leader or and even what happened at the Ritz Carlton so may be right ... ... what about people see there is somewhat of a pattern wellbeing\nTheir troops\nAnd its allies power in in a speaker of a Saudi royal the white crown prince Mohammed ... has now\nHe's deputy prime minister is chief of economic developments on his chief of the royal court and now he's also head of the private investment fund which was a solving wealth fund that that that they front loaded but they want us to really build in order to help with the diversification of the Saudi economy he has more power\nThan confide in Nineteen Seventy five who foot centralized power in Saudi Arabia so this guy is beyond imagination and to have the power he signed as most of his opposition I agree I agree with\nThat too and I still does your almost thinking out loud to you know so much about and so many objectives in which in everybody's personal interest you still have doubts you're almost thinking and her son to shout out loud so much of this makes no sense to you\nThat that is number one of the journalists to have known that he was the topic rendition when he Celtic styled himself and he's still even people that were giving economic advice conflict with the\nThe opinion of from print a crown prince ... the film on\nA were put in jail for him to know if each state in the ... and he was going to go to jail he had to know that they could be a ... like story rendition that tissue all extraordinary rendition the United states we do a lot of it unfortunately post nine eleven in that era era and as a physician maybe they use today should any stopped\nBreathing quite possible looking at his failed now these knuckleheads so well during this operation thought that they would not be saying I wanted to do it and nobody would do you know I could understand the logic and I could understand the crown prince not getting involved in those\n... and Dr dark dark but he also brought a corner with them to carve the two who does autopsy who's going to get me to call them up we saw\nYeah this is absolutely festival it's absolutely troubling decorative all the tapes the Turkish security what's already been released I haven't listened to them but they've been described in a ... it's like a scene out of reservoir dogs I mean really terrible so this is troubling but again\nI don't know that that proves crown prince Mohammed said do that with the boats or dismiss him while he's alive and make sure that you create a global political incident while you're doing I just cannot believe that\nCrown prince ... bin ... is so powerful\nThat I think he could still be doing extraordinary rendition of troublesome individuals as we're speaking I think he is enormously\nPower or don't want you to do great which he was Senator Dick Durbin wants to do ...\nWe want to do and we're going to do more and more than we are expo former ... from the United states\nUntil there is a completion of a third party investigation into this ... the murder and God Knows what followed that occurred in Istanbul and we should call or was to do the same amongst the Saudi kingdom understands civilized countries around the world are going to reject this conduct and make sure that they pay a price for the companies are doing it\n[laughter] okay so I think nuts reckless to say that and in fact I was a Russian writer yesterday and the rush into\nThinking for hypocrisy look at the accusations of the nova choke or a fascination in London and dozens of\nRussian diplomats wake spelled why isn't that happening totally reckless we must have been the side of the fact that Saudi Arabia is our ally even though we do believe this journalist was terribly treated as human rights were violated international law was broken we agree with that but we're not going to make a crisis worse than frankly nobody said\nWhat the United States has been doing post nine eleven do you know President Obama ordered many targeted assassinations with thickness of strikes with drones including of an American citizen I Believe they deserve the death penalty and while walking but why didn't we cause of democracy extradite him and put him in the electric chair\nInstead of drugging him with a hellfire missile in Yemen\nIt was also American so you know we had it both ways I Know I Would be I mean he gave\nAn address elation of a diplomatic crisis it would make it more difficult to resolve this and the other thing that deeply angers me I'm really angers me it's a show the okay he was making important idea it was an important voice but we did not terminate

Howard show hello Grayson how you doing\nHow's it going Mr Howard oh great but please call me Clark\nAlright clerk I'm I have a question for you I Am in high school I'm about to go to college and I just wanted to know what I should invest in because I'm thinking about investing about a hundred dollars a month and I want to start investing mhm\nOkay so\nMost people going to college you're only spending money how are you in a position you're going to be able to invest you working while you're going to school\nYes sir I have a part time job right now and when I'm In college I uh I Hope to get into another part time job\nWow so for example you so you're like Seventeen Eighteen Nineteen somewhere in there\nYes sir wow okay we're not related are we [laughter] no I don't think so\nBecause I started my first IRA when I was Nineteen years old\nBecause I really was working while I was in school and so the beauty is that when you put money aside as a late teens or in your twenties that money has a chance to grow and grow and grow because time is your friend your ally\nAnd because you're working there something called a Roth IRA which would be my favorite place for you to look at stashing you're a hundred dollars a month\nIf you've ever heard of ... you know what that is\nI'm not sure what the differences between a rock and a regular IRA\nA without your age you don't want to do a regular IRA because you're not going to bring in a high tax bracket\nOr Ross IRA works backwards from a regular IRA regular IRA you get our current benefit on your taxes but everything that the money would accumulate over the decades for the next gosh forty years\nWould grow tax free but then every penny you'd end up with would be taxed with a raw that's the opposite you get no current tax benefit but everything that that money grows to be over the years becomes yours\nWhen you're young doing the Roth is a vastly superior option\nThis or that Clark dot com I have information Grayson\nBon choices and like you to look at to put that raw money and you can put in up to what you earn in a year but never more than fifty five hundred so you're a hundred dollars a month as long as you're earning more than that you're good to go do the Ross\nAnd once you have a thousand dollars is really easy for you to open one of the really great Ross IRA investment choices [noise]\nOkay so Grayson if you go to my investment guy to Clark dot com I'll take you through how to set up the raw\nAnd then what you should invest in in that raw you know where you could do the raw and then based on where you go what to invest in and you're off to a great head start and I think that's really exciting\nYes or I Want to start early just you know so I can have the money for retirement\nWealth you start as early as you're starting you may be able to retire significantly earlier than most people are going to be able to do so good for you David with us on the Clark Howard show hello David\nHey car payment you are getting married I Am well congratulations to you that\nThey get so much a June third oh [laughter]\nRight well you are now they're June wedding you know the people in the wedding business get overwhelmed every June\nAll of that [laughter]\nWell how can that be of service to you\nWell as the advice of any marriage counselor I think they tell us that you know it's important that we\nEnjoying bank accounts and I currently bank with a lot of the biggest banks and so basically\nYou know we both used direct deposit we use a debit cards and credit cards for I Would say Ninety nine percent of all of our purchases and then you know what what we do put on a credit card we'd be able to pay off but\nRight now since we are going to be enjoying a bank shall we want to find the best and banks that's going to be for us whether it is with a major bank or something small you know we want to add that online banking option we\nStill want to have the option to be able to write checks if need be still be able to get cash from an a an ATM that's not gonna you know hurt us with the ATM costs and those sorts of things as we're we're overlooking for\nSo I got several things to say number one I normally don't recommend that you merge all your finances right away\nBut what I tend to white for a couple to do and I should ask first how old are you and your bride to be\nI'm thirty and she's twenty nine\nOkay so you been out in the world for a while that's especially when I don't like for a couple to merge everything especially not at the very beginning I think there's an enormous advantage and having his accounts her accounts and their account that you have a household account\nWhere you take care of the household expenses like rent or mortgage or utilities anything that is a obviously and expense of life living together\nAnd then that you eat to continue to have your own separate accounts as well and you agree\nBut the joint operating account because people come into a marriage with different ideas about money\nAnd I don't want you to be in a position where you assume one thing about her she assume something about you and then it becomes a flashpoint for disagreement about how each of you set your values with money and priorities\nOkay over time you may find that becomes necessary and you completely merge everything\nBut I think at first it's best to have his hers there's okay\nAs far as as where I like for you to look at putting money do either of you do much investing\nA I Believe or you know we uh those work for the state so we uh we uh we invest in the retirement system and\nRichard they'll have like an investment account with the stock brokerage or anything like that and you know okay 'cause that's my first go to is usually the best um accounts for checking and for ATMs and all that are with the stockbrokers but if that's not part of\nYour life and your state employees I Would like you to look at doing your joint household account with the credit union available to you in your state to state employees\nOkay 'cause credit unions are owned by if you open an account it'll be owned by you and your bride to be\nYou know you're you're an owner of the place so they're not trying to rip you off they're not trying to con you and they're going to offer you a ... straight up deals at the credit union and you may have an office or offices right near the state facilities you work out\nOK\nSo that would be my favorite and over time you'll know when it's the right time for you to um jettisoned having any separate account of yours for having any separate account of hers\nAnd it's usually really advise that you keep each keep your own account if you have really different ideas about consumption\nYou know what I mean if you want to be really loves to shop and the other we'd be happy never to walk in the store is that right either of your deals\nOh absolutely I mean we uh I'm more of a saver she's more of the ... there's\nSo then I Would say for longer than you might imagine it will make sense for you to have the separate accounts but congratulations on your wife starting together on June third you're

three\nAnd his score is six fifty to he has the money to pay those in Seoul now but what's the best course of action um to positively impact his credit score should be paid off in full or overtime\nAnd allow law so you said he says it's six fifty two\nYes which may be enough of a score for him to get a loan limit a traditional visa and MasterCard or discover card so I'd like him to do that regardless of where we talk next about these three subsidized student loans Penn\nAnd I wished\nHere you would have called me before he graduated 'cause then it's really easy to get a credit card okay but it is he a member of any credit union is All right I'd like him to go to the credit union\nAnd instead of applying straight on line for a credit card talk face to face on the loan officers and see what the likelihood is he'll be approved for a small limit these or MasterCard\nAnd if that doesn't get it done if they are like not quite there the six fifty where you are\nThe next thing would be to potentially try a ... card with discover and give\nPaul traditional channels fail and like him to try something called pedal card P.

now that he's going to be paying him when he would have graduated from school those loans are pretty low rates aren't they\nYes about corporate fell off\nSo that's really lucky\nYou subsidize or an subsidize are paying higher rates interest rates have gone up to his timing was good and the ... represents his entire student loan debt\nYes that's fantastic I get scared that well that is\nGreat so it'd be has cache\nHe could pay them off but ah at the interest rates they have there may be other priorities like what kinds of things\nIs he having to do right now like his he I mean to go rent an apartment or is he needing transportation like what's going on in his life let's say in the next Eighteen months to two years\nHe's killing him so he's enjoying and being rent train for right now I'm

think is good for somebody to be paying\nWho's now graduated it has a job yeah yeah so um I think that's that's good and I hope you sat ground rules for him [laughter] okay All right you can tell I'm a parent of of kids who've been through this right [laughter] yes\nSo if there's nothing specifically that he's trying to save up for anything like that and he's got the fines eat four percent even\nJust go ahead and and I encourage him to wipe out the student loan debt and be you know starting off in a new job finishing college being totally debt free will be wonderful to shop at the time off for he pays them off\nI wanted to make sure he can get one of these credit cards Alameda and then follow through the student loans and he'll be good\nMostly is with us on the car coward show Hi

you I somehow the fact that I had wrapped do my closest is just reemerged I don't know if if it popped up did you see it on the Web or something because several people have mentioned it again just

recently and you're you're above me right now\nFor me to get through the revenue there where you're at so\nAbout a\nYear okay um what my question is this um I have about twenty thousand dollars left on a car loan\nUm uh some credit cards are putting limits on one of them will take care of most of that low solves considering doing a balance transfer to get the interest down to zero up paying it off and I want to get their life on that\nSo you can do is zero balance transfer no four percent fee for doing the balance transfer\nThere like a three percent transfer fee but no interest for a certain amount of time out to them\nSo you get like Eighteen months zero percent worse for would you be able to wipe out twenty grand in Eighteen months\n[noise] ...\n... percent [noise] um [noise] if you are just transferred in\nHow long do you think it would take you to take out the twenty thousand\nUm is a ... it's ... it will be four years so I Would say less sued for two\nOkay 'cause I'm trying to gauge what's the best idea of what is the interest rate you have on the car at one\nPoint\nWhich is not a terrible rate is that issued by a car dealer a bank or a credit union\nBank\nOkay are you a member of a credit union with your credit score a credit union may take that loan out at two point something percent\nAnd that would be better than you doing the zero percent transfer paying the three percent fee up front and knowing that\nOf clocks ticking it whenever the zero percent runs out you've got to try to figure out how to do something else again I'd rather it be simple and if you were to take\nThe twenty thousand on the car alone and go into let's say a two or three year car loan ... with a credit union you may get a rate low enough that that'll just work for you\nTo consider the\nCredit unions do a big business\nAnd refined car loans because they're roughly I'm somewhere and three quarters eighty percent of people finance a vehicle at the dealer and with dealers mark 'em up and stuff so and credit unions pretty easily can re fi somebody into significantly lower rate usually\nThan what they've got in the loan they originally took out by the vehicle\n[noise] sauce alone you know the answer though that's what my credit union\nAnd see since you've got this what's known as a golden credit score once you're above eight hundred known as a golden store you probably you'll have people at the credit union saying hey how about we borrow money from you mostly\n[laughter] it's like it always is because you got it so together that is a nominal\nThat's

the show you know I've gone on record bought off saying I've got a bunch of millennials you in the building and we weren't you millennials that come on the show ended their debt free scream\nAnd so I've become a big fan of millennials um because the millennials who get it get it at a completely different level than other generations have they get on fire for something there on fire for something\nOnce they attach themselves to a calls they will run through a brick wall and so the sharp millennials are the sharpest obscene and I don't know when the dog millennials are the dumbest humans obscene and I don't know when the\nMost shiftless participation trophy living in your mother's basement group I've ever seen and the good news about millennials is they're really only two kinds fabulous and socks\nAnd there is a bunch of 'em that are fabulous\nAnd so I don't know why I decided to take up the cause of bragging on millennials I think it's because there's a group of people my age and in the media and in some of these stupid books magazines and stuff that say all kinds of negative things about them as if the entire generation is living in their mother's basement collecting participation trophy is it's just not true\nThere is a group of them that are but there is a group of them that are freaking rock stars too and so you know I I guess that's why and so I just kind of ... and when I pick up one of these articles now I don't know why I get mad about it I don't like it\nAnd CNN Money is a become a ridiculous publication it's just a ridiculous publication the reason it's ridiculous publication is they will print anything\nI don't know if they have an editor or not that actually looks over the stuff and goes this is bull crap we're not putting this on our publication\nBecause they will print anything one article will make a lot of sense and be very good and the next article you would think the guy's parents are cousins that wrote it I mean dumb human beings writing articles and published in the CNN Money\nAnd so I've seen everything and CNN Money so I you know occasionally I'll quote something out of their positive but this one just burned me up\nMillennials aren't opening credit cards and that's a mistake\nFrom CNN Money\nDon't use credit cards like their parents or ... or their grandparents less than a third of millennials say they have a credit card well more than half the people age thirty to forty nine owned one and nearly Seventy percent of people over sixty five do according to a bank right survey financial experts\nIt's the fear of debt well yeah that makes sense you stupid people that explains why young people are shying away from credit\nThe fear of debt is is like I don't want to go in debt because they don't think that's good yeah that would be a good reason not to go in debt and that's really where where you needed a financial expert to figure that out did you okay I'm Glad you found one to quote their ... we have no idea what the drugs wary of\nHad been stigmatized by dad explains Douglas bone parse president of bona fide wealth in New York and co author of the millennial money fix\nAnd with a new promos

Alabama I'm forty six years old and married but we do not have any children should we get long term care at fifty since we don't have any kids to help us or wait until sixty wait until\nSixty the probability of staying in a nursing home prior to age sixty is less than one percent show much less than one percent it approaches zero\nBut once you're sixty it goes up every single minute [laughter] it's very weird show I highly recommend long term care insurance or nursing home insurance or in home care insurance once you're sixty because Seventy five percent of the ladies will outlive your husband's show the typical scenario is\nThat papa goes in the nursing home [noise]\nFifty Seventy five thousand bucks a year corrections scrambles a three hundred thousand dollar mistake dies leave mama broke that's normal scenario at a decent retirement going into the scenario little\nThey're just have to be paid to operate the people that work there actually want to feed their kids so they need money called payroll so they're not evil and they're not ripping people off at home mom wanted to go to New Jersey whom selection and I want my money to go to a restaurant even though I eat there\nWell that's dumb don't eat there then okay so but if you're going to need in home care or care in a nursing home you need to pay for it and long term care insurance is absolutely a vital part of financial planning but not until you're sixty when you have kids or not\nJ. D. is with us in Sacramento, California Hi J. D. how are you\nDave I'm good how are you\nBetter than I deserve what's up in your world\nThanks for taking my call and I'm calling with a question about mortgages my um my wife and I are debt free and we got a B that three eight I'm working on three B. and we just went through at the you know we coordinated it thank you and\nAnd my ... ... we in there and said ten percent but I hear you on your show the twenty percent prefer a hundred percent but if we can't get there than them one of those too so I'm just wondering what\nWhat makes the difference between ten and twenty percent\nOkay a good really really good question well like you said obviously a hundred percent down is our favorite mortgage okay not one All right uh uh the in when somebody's buying a second home\nI pretty much slap my fist on the table and so I don't buy a house unless you can put down twenty percent on your second um 'cause you got the equity coming out of the first of all\nRight in a normal scenario on a first home it's okay to whatever you can put down and get into the house okay here's the reason twenty percent is advantageous\nIf you put twenty percent down you have what's called an eighty percent loan than or eighty percent loan to value ratio that allows you where the standard Fannie Mae conventional loan or for that matter with an F. ha loan to have no P. M. I. P. M. I. stands for private mortgage insurance\nWhich basically is insurance that pays the mortgage company money if they foreclose on you and lose money on the foreclosure\nThose rules for so it hasn't zero benefit to you under any circumstance it's only because they are taking more risk because they don't have good asset protection on the ratio you see what I'm saying\nOkay ... pm my insurance is about Seventy five dollars plus or minus a month per one hundred thousand borrowed\nSo you write a couple of hundred thousand dollar mortgage you got a hundred and fifty to two hundred bucks a month NPR mile alone\nIf you don't put down twenty percent so that's why we push people towards twenty percent but if you're on your first time home twenty percent can be a big difference versus ten percent\nAnd so if you buy a Fifteen year fixed rate where the payments no more than a fourth of your take home pay with ten percent down and you get ... on your first time that's not the end of the world and you can get rid of the ... when you pay the loans down to eighty percent of value\nBy buying an appraisal that the mortgage from an appraiser that the mortgage company approves of and then they will drop the P. M. I. later after you get it pay down\nThe fact that we're in fact in California where home prices are no fairly high compared to this country make any difference\nIt doesn't make a difference is still the same situation you don't get a pass on mathematics just 'cause you're in California they don't like okay you're on your lap doesn't count\nYou know we don't do that so you still gotta use common sense but uh but you know again you're anytime you're at the higher the ... market you're in the more difficult this discussion because when you get all the way down to ... percent I'm not requiring twenty percent but you get you get J. D. how it's much to your advantage\nTo not have that stay that way I Am I yeah I mean because you are talking\nTalk about some money per month to going out the window for insurance that's worth absolutely zero to you right\nSo that's what I'm trying to avoid here but it's not but so if you buy and you don't put down twenty percent than keep choking on that mortgage keep working your baby steps four five six simultaneous get that mortgage pay down and get that loan reset with an appraiser plant that's approved and then get that PMS drop so you're not doing enough for Twenty years\n'cause it just sucks it's just a horrible you know it's just but it's part of the race and it's a it's a logical reason that they require it but it's just super expensive\nAnd it just as bad so you want to get out of it as soon as you can 'cause then you get to the business are really paying on your mortgage and not just wasted money but yeah I I you know we don't beat up on a first time homebuyer doing baby step three B. for not putting down twenty percent\nUh the goal always is to become a hundred percent that free as fast as we can and not waste any money we don't have to waste that's what we that's the goal we'll ask well those of us that are in tune with being smart anyway\nNick is with us in Chattanooga Hi Nick welcome to the Dave Ramsey show\nHey Dave it's good to talk to you you too man what's up [noise] okay so I'm twenty five I ah I have done pretty well for myself\nUh I have a dilemma though my ... he'll as cars have a car it's a a a two thousand nine Chrysler three hundred bucks to ask thirty eight model what the big game in it and it's up to the top yes I paid well below Kelley Blue book value and I have\nAbout five to six thousand dollars worth of equity in the car mhm and I've been listening you like going through your baby steps if he won't be tough for me but I think I Need to sell the car I Know you're going to tell me to sell the car and use the money to finish my largest based on\nWhat is your ... your car worth\nA private market is twenty three too I think\nAnd and you said you're twenty five and you're doing pretty well for yourself tell me what that means\nThat means I have a good job of got Twenty one thousand dollars invested retirement or have no credit card debt\nMhm the higher and what are you single\nI'm Single and what's your income\nBy income is about forty five fifty thousand dollars a year give or take a little bit with overtime\nIs this your only dead on the car that's my only debt and how much do you owe on it\nOh sixteen thousand two hundred and fifty two dollars and Twenty one steps\nAs a single guy can't you pay that in a year [noise] I mean if you have no life but you get to keep the car no life you don't see the inside of a freaking restaurant unless you're working there\nI've been doing that day by the ... yeah I Do I get I mean I've been doing everything and that but\nCan't I mean can you can probably pay sixteen thousand an ear making fifty grand if you're single\n...

we every time he has said okay I Need to find a job than there it's like that door closes and the business [noise] door stays open and um [noise]\nBusiness doors not open it's not making enough to support your family\n\nAnd so we need to sit down on this business and give it a deadline that in the next six months it's going to start supporting our family after all these years and making enough to start getting rid of some of this debt or we're going to close it and I get a job because I don't think you're making any money\n[noise] um am I wrong [noise] well\nI mean we pay ourselves and the business and when I was bringing home about a hundred thousand a year\nBringing out you're you're taking a hundred thousand dollars out of business yep well that'd be called profit okay you can't live on a hundred thousand dollars\nWell we can we had a lot of how much does it have you done with the business as the guy said about fifty two K. and we personally have about um Ninety six K\nWere you in the business doesn't have any debt you son personally for it OK so at all as she got a lot of our dollars in debt and you have a hundred a hundred and forty thousand dollars in debt and you make a hundred thousand dollars a year is that all you makes a hundred thousand or the that's what you're pulling out and then you make a profit too\nSo that's all we make that's what I mean we are happening all\nIncome when you do your taxes is a right\nTo pay it has banned that were made with an accountant to adjust something there that were taken distribution instead all profit and that doesn't change it right but that's how much we're ... we're paying ourselves from the business okay year so you need to find out what the president if you don't know what can\nYou get back you give me three different answers so you need to find out if it if you make if your business is making a hundred thousand dollars a year and you guys can't live on her that was one of your you got other problems\n[laughter] right yeah\nAnd you can pay off that making a hundred thousand dollars a year and work your way through it and know the twenty nine thousand dollars does not need to go the kids' college fund it needs to go clean up his dad gummed ... what made\nOkay but it don't you the only way that makes sense is if you have a system in a plan where you actually know if the business is making a profit and if it is making a profit what the property is and it's all coming home to pay off these debts\nMhm or if you want to pay off if it's two thousand at the business and call that business that I don't care but we need to be reducing debt\nRight quickly and aggressively and if you're making a hundred thousand dollars a year younger people do that but you guys aren't living on a plan the business is not on a plan on your personal lives on a plane I can tell by talking to you\nYeah I Know and we just got F the in the mail today and we started [laughter] okay\nThat's a good start ... and I'm going to send your company the contrary leadership on the business side so uh but because here's the thing you need to be going I'm going to quit making a hundred thousand dollars a year that's a great business you know I'm not going to quit\nThat's when you did fine tune in give\nI think you're good at making money I don't think you're as good at managing it and so we need to fine tune our systems at the business the profit and loss statements the budget set the business and so we know exactly\nWhere every dollar at the business is going and exactly where it's coming from and then exactly what's coming home and what is taxable income\nAnd then lay out a game plan to pay off a hundred and forty two thousand dollars worth of that\nBetween these two different sets of that\nAnd work your way through it you can do both and use the twenty nine thousand towards that go if you don't do that and you throw the twenty nine thousand that the goal and then you never pay off the debt it was kind of wasted wasn't it so I'm not asking you to blindly throw it at the ... they're still at that and I thought of the ... and throwing a system at your business in a system\nIn a detailed budget at your home and all of that applied directly on this problem so the problem goes away\nAnd the twenty nine thousand is part of the solution to that but the biggest part of the solution is really getting detailed and organized with the money at home and at work pulled on I'm going to give me a copy of the book entree leadership and this is the Ramsey show\n[noise]\n[noise]\n\nWay or the number of Cumberland talks with Dave Ramsey news talk Matty for boys one am sixteen hundred [noise]\n[noise] okay things are getting ... where it out there I

are OK with with being in debt and banking on that and I'm like\nWhy you know like when\nWe got to the store and get it in the beginning but people kept saying oh no just just go by that you know you

you\n[noise] fun it's like it's called the sure what's up [noise] [noise] well I'm Wondering if I Need more life insurance but I don't care how much do you have a have a two hundred and fifty thousand okay what's your household income\nSorry what's your household income a hundred and eighty what do you make a hundred and fifty\nOkay and you have two hundred and fifty in life insurance and how much in your nest egg do you have in wealth um and invest much\nOr more debt free other than home and land mhm and that's worth about one point eight\nAbout four hundred thousand and four ones and Ross\nOkay good and uh what do you owe on the land and home a five hundred and twenty okay All right well the income produced off\nOf six hundred and fifty thousand dollars let's just use it that's the two fifty and the four hundred you got those two numbers if those two were invested in just rent round numbers just to make this easy if it was ten percent that'd be sixty five thousand dollars a year she doesn't get to keep the land in the house in that scenario does she\nNo\nShe can't for service for half a million dollar debt with a sixty five thousand our income and raise kids right\nYes sir okay so you're under insured if your goal was for her to stay in that property upon your death now if she'd liquidated input seven hundred thousand\nThe equity of that buys a two hundred thousand dollar house has five hundred in her hand plus has two fifty plus has four hundred now she's got over a million dollar she's got paid for two hundred thousand dollar house and she can live on a hundred thousand dollars a year and then coming off of a million one\nDoes that make sense so if that your plan you're okay but if you want her to stay on that property and continued to live there you don't have enough insurance to see how I'm doing that\nOr are there okay so what's the goal which one [noise]\nUh\nWould you want her to stay a little and I want her to stay on the land and she wants to stay on the land but I Would rather she live close with us from family okay\nAnd then if you if you if you want the ability to do that we need um [noise]\nYou know you need about a million five in insurance should use five hundred of that to pay off the property she'd have a million dollars from change that way to live off the income from so somewhere a million million five in life insurance or

to\nAsk you to bear with me and I'm make district short and sweet as I can [noise] I I Want to say that it is one thing about your show you is that you have a little bit you were willing to uh\nTo let anybody and everybody on the voice their opinion and I and I really applaud you for that horrible\nUh I I Do want to say I never thought I was a legal get fly a bill to to make such accusations she knows that the FCC or as you so eloquently put it\nA A R I couldn't have been asked any questions or you did and and uh you know I commend you for that\nThey say you say one thing about the and you know ... as you grow older and experience in a position\nOr you go through a lot of hoops and I'm now I'm at some point right now where I I think that needed to be heard whether I agreed with or disagreed and I certainly don't agree with some of the accusations I tried very gently\nAnd respectfully to point out that this is not under the purview of the commissioner he has no alternative and and and\nTo um [noise] he is a fan or he's also one of the most brilliant political strategist of uh of any generation and he did on this program what he has done so many times in running political campaigns here he took her a a kernel of truth\nAnd may have made a mountain out of it where uh you know he just you know I don't care what the the facts are that many I'm going to argue or you know there there's a great line I I think it's by a\nSenator Monaghan Monaghan where you can everyone's in entitled to their own opinion but they're not entitled to their own facts\nAnd carnival decided to make up his own facts\nI agree with people and that's what I'm concerned about I just hope and ... and I don't know enough about\n[noise] what are they gaining NCA football rules but I just hope that this band of brothers from Baton Rouge you don't do anything that's going to\nCause any delay any controversy to the extent that protected the court I just think we need to let the commissioner of the SEC doing his job and not\nAll of the allegations one of the accusations in there that ah ... involve LSU in Florida that that's an old debate you know that ah LSU and Florida both get the short end of the sick um yes most years both those athletic director\nAs a have complained about that but that's not under Greg think he's a dome may I mean you see like take a long time to work outside the commission has only been the commissioner for three years\nAnd I I felt like I Know Greg thank you very well he he is a man of higher uh integrity and honesty and he ... in fact\nUm if there is a coach and the SEC who who may have his head on a a dart board it would be it would be Nick Saban because the commission has gone against them several times you've run against some I think in the Maurice Smith case uh the the the defensive player who went to Georgia\nOr he went against them and trying to hire you freeze a Greg psyche has stood up to Nick Saban Alabama's several times and for James Carville that to insinuate that because that officers in Birmingham, Alabama\nIs they are playing favorites it's it's it's really a specious argument and and carnival knows it uh but uh unfortunately\nCarnival has become a ... a in his letter years when she's in title to base it certainly earned it uh but when you start making accusations comparing the Saudi Government\nHanging out at the bar there and work on all their their collusion searches are forcing el issue that played Florida every year while they play a Alabama plays Tennessee it seemed to go even deeper than that he talked about other calls it had nothing to do\nWith this particular case a you cover the SEC ... and I brought up the uh the the Smith situation and and the huge free situation there's two reasons why Alabama fans in recent years had been hopping mad at Greg thinking\nEveryone stays Madame ... unless and if those guys are eating in Ireland what is there for ...\nOkay [laughter] well I by the way a joke the SEC doing okay we're we're we're we're we're we're we can attest to it over here the SEC Network [laughter]\nBook\nLeads the SEC in opponent penalty or is this year they leave the SEC right well I mean I feel like I don't even need to make this argument but I'll go ahead and make okay please\nShe got bailed out like a hundred times against all\nIn that game they would not have beaten overrun with all those pass interference call I mean there is practically put them in field goal range to win the game\nLSU opponent penalties this season Seventy to Alabama opponents penalties a season fifty three in the discussion Florida had eleven penalties for a hundred and sixteen yards you can do is use\nI mean that's more yard ... percent even rush for great thank you was practically giving you the game and it was you had to penalties thing is Georgia to Texas a and M. gets more telling these before the game even start\nOkay so there's carnival\nI Love him we all know what he's doing explains tongue in cheek he's trying to get arrested but come on let's be real\nIt by the way uh I mean why why why has a tremendous impact on the game but regardless of all that I just heard from a Danny sure know checked with him about the opening line it has all been Sunday night it's going to be right now Fifteen and a half sixteen points that's\nThat's Alabama on the road of course that's probably the closest ally and we've seen all year a that's an enormous line with or without Devon White and the first half\nYeah Fifteen and a half points\nIt seems like too much to me

I'm going to we're really is important to be when it comes to football after I Do my job it makes you look weak to make excuses about why certain things to point the gaming even been played you know\nAnd we we all of this conversation going on but if I have a plan and beat them\nIt's a defense mechanism let's get let's get to the the issue here though and you're right about everything you said the the the call and you know you were\nYeah I was calling but I'll let me let me just address the conspiracy theory quickly\nLet's just think about this All right so the SEC is in bed with al ... and by the way Alabama needs will help okay first and foremost alright secondly he's doing okay they're doing just fine secondly\nWhat do you think would be in the best interest of the SEC who who need to win that game because if she wins that game than the FCC has two legitimate teams that can get to the college football playoff Alabama wins that game that essentially becomes one\nUnless Georgia beats Alabama and he has to the championship game it only has one most like the best chance for the SEC to get two teams in like\nThey did a year ago as when it's for LSU to win the game so you can squash that narrative a medium or you're you're a wrote almost thoroughly [laughter]\nBut I'm just saying like what I think it might have spent wherever they were talking about a ... and and you're doing the game so you know how quickly it's all developing or yeah let's talk about the play yeah what what we all saw what you were broadcasting the time it took to to look at it and take us through the whole\n... as soon as it happened I I went immediately on we have a little button that says talk back at three can communicate with trucks as targeting on forty like I saw it as soon as he threw it unlike targeting a foreign target for it and we had already enrolled and\nHonestly the call on the field was correct\nBecause what targeting rule is\nIs for civil contacted the head and neck area of a defensive player and a defensive player\nIs any player that's an up throwing posture and receiving posture and he played that given themself up with the ball in their hands are going down on the field slide Nick Fitzgerald in that particular case was in a throwing posture in relation to football therefore he is under the defenseless umbrella\nSo what people are having a hard time with it's not about how hard the contact is because people were sending me videos all the time oh look at how violent this it's not about how violent they hit us\nIt's about where on the body the hit takes place and in this particular case Devon White is making contact with his helmet and with forcible contact to the head or neck area the neck areas a little bit of a gray area\nBut it was very obvious with how he hit next Fitzgerald it fell under that umbrella for the call was correct I hate it I don't like it because I Wish that there was a way that we could evaluated\nAfter the fact after the play happens hey you're out of this game there's nothing we can do about it but\nAfter the fact can we reevaluated maybe he doesn't miss the first half of next week's game that's the ...\nFirst half of the next game if you are called with the tap targeting fell in the second half how the game in the booth to to look at it and start to finish show it it takes a matter of thirty forty five seconds quick very quick but it was very obvious to because like I Know people are going to but\nYou were to Ballmer though because I have to see that video thousand times now we're going out to eat it said it was the right call\nCritical look we sent into we sit in the ... most of them into our before every season starts\nFor two to three hours we referees from every conference\nAnd they explained their seasons don't you think that that room that get emotional as well to calls in touchdowns and this is not the first time that we've talked about the penalty is too harsh ... writes targeted targeted and I get it we trying to make the game safer owner that once I got a combination\nOf good combination for the penalty is more Fifteen yours all you ... I I Would I Would think you would do it like the NBA flavor want flavor too\nBecause you can feel ... and you can tell malicious\nOr action on the football field when it comes to a hit in ... with\nThat type of situation where you is just two guys alone in the middle about militias yeah yeah yeah sure they I mean it's totally different you can ... of some show you so [laughter] I Would say though is I Would\nSay what I Wish there's okay hey if you get tired you get a targeting call on game day you're out there's nothing we can do about it because you don't have enough time to evaluate it fully they don't have third parties coming in like ... ... it's it's unfortunate you're out for the rest of this game may be smarter hit them lower like hit him right here at you know that's the way to solve the problem you hit it right here we're not having this discussion\nSo what I Do wish that we would put in place and this is going to be up to the rules committee which divides the coaches and things like that like we don't want to ever make it feel as though we're making the game less safe\nAnd we don't ever want to feel like we're pulling back\nOn a player safety issue but what I Do wish we could Institute would be an appeals process that you could implement\nIn the week after the fact\nSo right now there's about a hundred and sixty targeting calls right now that have been enforced in college football so far two dozen Eighteen\nAlright so divide that attend conferences this is just a generic Matt ... is about sixteen a conference there's been about eight weeks there's about two weeks ago All right so there's about two weeks in a conference that's just doing crude elementary math there might be more in some ways there might be less in some ways I'm not sure exactly how it all figures itself out\nBut I Wish that there were a group and independent committee\nThat is made up of three or four or five however many independent referees maybe one from each power five conference\nThat would actually look at each targeting ... from the week before and determine whether or not it was agree just enough\nTo enforce an additional penalty and the following week I just wish there was a review process because they had been white was wrong and the hit was illegal but was it bad enough to warrant missing you know the first half of the next game in my opinion it was not\nWas now here's the thing too that people have to remember the term in the year two thousand they the football is not the same as it was five ten years ago I in in fans I Believe we're still having a hard time accepting the fact\nThat the game has already changed we always talk about let's see let's make the game safer it's evolving\nI talked about this last week on get up the NFL has changed\nIt is already Chinese people talking about what do you have like these is no more you write you can't play defense the way you play defense when I first game it's a great McIlroy in the head and neck area every time I got back to him when I was playing in the NFL in ...\nTry to hit in the SEC championship against David Greene while literally jumped over is back that that's below the in today's football so\nI did it I Am happy about that\nAh I'm ... I'm happy to get her trying to hit us on that but it's a necessary and that's you know you have to wait for it and I tell you how do you want but it's not this that's what I'm trying to get people to understand you not watching the same\nGame anymore right and they can make you as mad as you want to be or you can you can say All right this is the new football\nWell a ... he used to the quality positives ...\n[noise] uh no it was canceled for being too positive\nWhile I was going to say you don't I look at the time to urban I think he's got me on the sofa and\nI've offered any any any count

honor to running into the honor can't wait to the same lines is targeting\nGood\nIt's a fair point a murder that I think I think mark has said that the best one of her in a long time the game is
