Beast North Korea\nWe welcome our colleague\nGregory Scott ... the executive director of the committee for human rights and North Korea riding most recently in the wall Street Journal about the diplomacy the dad between the president of South Korea Moon Jae in\nAnd the undistinguished dictator the failed state of North Korea ... uh and the question here\nBad and I'll ask him to help us understand it can you imagine Greg what it looks like for president moon to move from a man who is obese in an ... to an undistinguished dictator who is learning over human\nHuman Savage tree can you imagine that same moon dealing with the facts in North Korea in the imaginary future of reuniting the peninsula good evening to\n[noise] good evening to you John and Gordon a that would be a very serious stress of the imagination president Moon Jae in of South Korea has had three slum at meetings with Kim Jong un the sheer human rights was not raised ones not once\nI'm moreover we all remember that um while a president Moon Jae in was chief of staff to the late ... than normal here on a he was the one who consulted with the north Koreans and advised that South Korea should abstain on a\nU.N General assembly resolution on North Korean human rights condemning North Korea as human rights record so up presumably this is Don in order to appease the north Koreans she noted to\nPress ahead with this so called national re constantly Asians process\nBut the question that I ... I Would like to ask is um at at what point\nDoes appeasement at what point does neglecting North Korea's crimes against humanity\nTurn into endorsement of the egregious human rights violations being perpetrated in North Korea pursuant to policies established at the highest level of the state\nSo Gregg we could put that question perhaps in a different way you know people point out as you've just mentioned that to Moon Jae in a was a human rights lawyer and that's how he came to prominence um many people say well you know it's a course ironic now that he's not raising the issue of human rights\nSo maybe the question is was he never a human rights lawyer all along that he was just using that to um basically gain power in the south\nTo pose a people who he um didn't like the military leaders and actually that he was very much in favor of North Korea and the first place that he was like his senior advisors now I'm very much sympathizers for North Korea\nWe don't know the answer the question we don't know what's the moon's head\nBut the point is he may not be naive he may be complicit all along in North Korea is human rights violations [noise]\nUh he has certainly I'm invested tremendously in this process of engaging the north Koreans the south Korean economy's not doing too well\nThe unemployment rate amongst young uh college graduates is high and still on the ice remember that during the important part of president Moon Jae in support base so he's basically laying 'em most of his bed so all of his bets on this inter Korean rapper Sean process\nWell we'll see a human rights lawyer yes and he was famous for having defended some um democracy activists who are basically working against the military dictatorship\nUp until the late Nineteen eighties uh of course she was a a lawyer on several Robin ... says that involved a mock says a Marxist material of course\nBad so uh actually being a human rights lawyer in South Korea does not necessarily imply that ah that that one would be equally active on North Korea Kim writes but then again\nBeing a human rights lawyer by formation a president Moon Jae in does understand the gravity of crimes against humanity and ... go ahead please you\nIn on that point let's talk about Amanda's letter I'm Amanda ... as a human rights lawyer she wrote a letter in the ... the south Korean newspaper um tell her audience what amended asked a Moon Jae Amanda ... oh go ahead Gregory\nMind more widow as my colleague she's our human rights attorney or a chart gate human rights attorney currently base things so ah there was a terrific letter she published in the ... the very basic question that she asks from a human rights lawyer\nTo another human rights lawyer she tells him look I have witnessed\nUm I have a atrocities myself elsewhere in the world we both on the stand up basically when are you going to take these violations seriously Mr President when at what point are we going to see your administration getting serious\nAbout the the the the human rights violations being perpetrated in the north\nIt's a good question so let me come back to moon does he have a plan to your knowledge to transition from this ah generosity that he's demonstrating towards a man who has no capability as a as a as a transparent leader of people\nThat is a component to ... ... is there any significant body of literature that says that moon is going to move to another phase when ... when North Korea is engaged\n[noise] ah well of course this is the argument that engages will make that engagement will bring about exposure to the outside world and implicitly\n'em a chance to improve the human rights record of North Korea but on the other hand if South Korea focuses on infrastructure projects tourism projects\nEnergy projects pipelines do not talk to people Powell lives to not talk to people tourism projects can be tightly contained with few if any social side effects so these are not necessarily projects that will help\nThe people of North Korea so far I have not seen any sign\nThat the moon Jae in administration actually has a North Korea human rights policy I haven't seen any encouraging well eight eight when encouraging statement and I would be very very very cautiously optimistic that statement by that\nSouth Korea and permanent representative to the United nations who said something along the lines that

at this point to replace John however there is migration underway to Vietnam\nAnd Indonesia those are the two countries the economists mentioned\nAnd that going forward as the supply chain altered you know devices are getting smaller we're getting rid of chords we're getting more mobile devices and less of the desktop so they are the tablets and other electronics bigger ... the big box servers become little bitty boxer as\nIt is possible that China\nCan be augmented with other countries but not yet\nKnow John that's not an unreasonable view but the point I think the economists tends to gloss over\nIs that you know first of all there are the terrorists that Trump is putting on and it's making life miserable for manufacturing and trying to but you know the more important story is that the jumping the Chinese ruler is making life miserable for foreign companies in China and I think what he's doing it for ...\nAnd China an unreliable member of the global supply chain so companies for that reason alone are gonna lessen their um exposure to China's geopolitical risks\nAnd therefore as they can move their supply chain um vulnerabilities and get out of China Allen you are Mr supply chain what say you\n... I hate to say it but Gordon's got it right I Would\nGo my lord oh my lord let me fall off my chair for a moment in your leadership Allen they got it to their\nThank you so much um let me just make two quick points first of all what what free trade extremists uh publications like the economist ignore constantly is the fact that national governments much smaller and less powerful then with the U.S government insurance around\nMultinational supply chains all the time in countries like Malaysia and Singapore and Thailand are constantly imposing conditions on inbound foreign investment that for all of this talk the multinationals rule the world the company's\nAlways wind wind up complying with so if Malaysia can do this certainly the United states can and secondly there's a great deal of that reshoring ... or I should say of\n... of shifting production outside China that's either already taking place or that's being contemplated because these companies know that we're only at the very beginning of Trump's China trade policies and they want to be prepared and PS\nThey are not panic and all they have have repeatedly said that you know weight of course rather not do this won't be the easiest thing in the world but we think that within several years we can shift a lot of electronics in information\nTechnology hardware production outside China to other low wage countries I oh by the way that that includes Mexico because that would really help this country is southern neighbor which which\nDesperately needs it and what an would by extension help the United states tremendously and I think that that that is far from implausible forum\nGarden apple and apple most apple can move but it's going to be extremely painful because apple hasn't stuff manufactured by Foxconn Foxconn of course is deeply embedded in China but we got to remember John and Allen that socks on once was in Taiwan I moved to\nChina yes the economist reminds all of it that many of the factories were talking about in China are owned by the Taiwanese or Taiwanese investors have created them in a dish and that means that whatever we regard as the difficulties the portability has happened already\nAnd it's gonna it's gonna they can move again and also the other thing when you talk about automation and robots\nThat makes it a lot easier to move because that limit doesn't eliminate but it's certainly reduces substantially China's labor cost advantage because a robot in the U.S as we've discussed on this show before is just about the same cost is a robot in China\nAnd in fact the economists did make one good point and that is that\nThat as electronics products become more sophisticated or for the reasons that that Gordon mentioned because of their production so highly automated there's no more China costs advantages and Foxconn and factors in the process\nOf making a very considerable investment in advance electronics reduction in Wisconsin so we could very well have the\nThe result that China still winds up making the vast majority of the world's walk them in perhaps but the more advanced office increasingly made\nI like that that that's a severe use of walkman I was thinking about you know that\nYeah okay one more detailed ... one more detail of concern here that I've had for some time there's a new phone from Wall way and I've seen it advertised in the United states what the heck is going on and why are we allowing that to happen in the United states\nWell thanks in large part to the massive transfer of advanced technology by us telecommunications companies to China has become a global leader in the latest generation that telecommunications technology which was called five\nAnd and certainly wall where he wants to be a big player in this you what\nYou want when you when you we don't allow packs of cigarettes for thirty cents on the street in Manhattan I Would say why don't we allowing a wall way phone in our borders for that is poised to well\nYou're absolutely right and it's weird also because the U.S government and the intelligence community has already label called way as a threat to US\nGarden news to people I mean I saw the phone being advertised the latest from Wall way it's that there is no privacy was Huawei it can't last\nLong Ken of course I don't think it'll last look I mean not only does one way but also the ... the Chinese

I guess in in general terms I guess two things are at stake in Vietnam first of all there is just the need for a for partners in Southeast Asia or if he wants to do things to uphold the freedom of the seat in the Southeast Asia we need we need help\nWhich goes directly to the second broad point which would be just location I mean we were here for real estate people all the time but it's all about location well Vietnam has location the United states\nIt affect how so strategic position in Southeast Asia unless it has a allies who are willing to to provide us access to their bases so that we can do things like roads freedom of navigation operations and so forth [noise]\nAh we used to we used to having a good relations with the Philippines than the president was brought it offers a couple of

it seems\nAlmost to making in South central in terms of the coalition to protect the region from the Chinese\n[noise] yeah there's a there's a running debate we have with our students are Newport about whether small states have strategies I mean we think about strategy as being something for big power says it ourselves such as Russia such as China Germany or whoever the case may be\nA and I I think it is unquestionably a fact that a small state like Vietnam or the Philippines have strategies and in fact I Would say there's even a greater is a premium on having a good strategy if you can't afford to throw resources at things like the United states does not a wealthy nations like increasingly China does so\nIt only makes sense for for Vietnam to make common cause with strong outsiders in order to counterbalance China so the United states are obviously would like to be known as the balance or a first resort in this case a that would help explain a general masses trip over ... for for

successfully tested it since there was an unhappy event or in a previous launched sequence they've now scheduled it a little delight to January twenty Nineteen they need the booster for their\nSpace station plans and for their plans for a lender on the far side of the moon what is your best information about the long march five have they solve their problems or do we hold our breath and see if it works good evening to you Brandon\nWell good even John and thank you again for having me on and hello Gordon and to answer your question\nI'm back home in Florida we have a saying even apply pay confided ... once in a while the Chinese yes it's true they're having some technical difficulties but to be fair we here in the United states in the sixties and seventies had our share of technical difficulties\nWith our space program if you give them enough time though they will adapt and the Chinese are heavily invested\nAnd they're heavily committed to achieving a what we know in the national security policy arena as space dominance\nAnd are they are they are effort that so whether or not the next launch\nAnd the next few months we'll work uh I think it probably will but even if it doesn't they're going to keep trying until they get one right and we hear in the United states unfortunately are not competing the way we should be the way we did against the Soviets in space\nAnd so they basically in China have a lot of time to perfect a the technology they're trying to create and you\nWant to translate quickly there's a moon writes on and there's only one contestant is that is\nThat's that is one hundred percent correct yes Gordon\nFriend and I'd like to just choose the topic a little bit because I heard you speak yesterday and I was absolutely flabbergasted it's something that you said\nWhich I think is critically important which I think every American needs to hear and that is um we all know that Google has declined to participate in a Pentagon contract to develop the cloud some ten billion dollars\nA lot of people in Google or upset that this does not fit in with the Google philosophy of don't be evil\nBut I heard you say and and I just was completely astounded\nThat Google is about to participate in a technology contract in China were effectively the partner on the other side is the ...\nThere are a lot more details on that but I think everyone needs to hear this\nYeah so basically a quantum computing is it's the next revolution I'm that's that is the thing is is the next industrial revolution whoever can figure out quantum computing first\nIt's basically like having the cotton gin you know of the laughing duster revolution ... it will completely change the way the world works uh the Chinese presently have what's known as quantum Internet basically it plays upon string theory and basically without getting into the mechanics of it\nIt's a physics has shown that to put up a particle could exist in the same place to different places at the same time and the Chinese have figured out a way to manipulate that particle to transfer encrypted data between the two particles\nI and it's worked they've been asking says twenty sixteen\nFrom that technology that initial investment they spun off technologies like the quantum radar which can be a it's believed can see through the F thirty five a multi trillion dollar\nA program of ours to build the great stealth fighter they can see through it and there are marrying that to the S. four hundred Russian built defense system\nAs well they are now investing heavily in an actual quantum computing center and on and we and they have reached out to Google about a year ago and Google has expressed interest in not only sending over talent\nTo this massive new center there building which would be probably operational around twenty twenty twenty Twenty one\nBut Google also wants to infuse cash this is under the umbrella of a state owned enterprises in China which happens to be basically reporting to the People's Liberation army the Chinese have actually not been very secretive about the fact that the quantum computing center that they're building that Google could potentially be helping with\nA is actually not only for civilian purposes but also for military and in the same way that Google and Apple's investment into a I research artificial intelligence\nResearch in China is also going to be used for Chinese military purposes\nLet me set the formula here if I understand this correctly Google as evidenced interest in participating in the ...\nAnd Vance\nAdvanced work on AOL and quantum Kim ... corner and quantum computing at the same time\nGoogle's employees have raised a Raul when Google was looking to compete with Amazon and now with Microsoft for the super secret cloud contract ten billion dollars a year at the Pentagon\nI lay out this task very clearly Gordon\nThis looks like Google is siding with the non transparent dictatorship and disdain the transparent military that protects Google's copyright\nYeah I mean that's the only interpretation I can think of John and this is something that I think the first of all the president needs to think about and we need to start thinking about whether\nYou know in a company which is headquarters in the United states which does business in in our country is permitted to help the Chinese develop their military which is considering to kill Americans\nAnd brand and have you seen Google addressed this paradox in any fashion\nWell no and if anything there's you know they they're they're continuing to seek to do business in China I Will say though are in both cases of the the AI on the quantum computing\nOr the Senate they not actually going forward with it this is all you know starting the groundwork right now but I have with less awareness has risen I think\nI I think that things will go on without the American people knowing\nI Hope is to raise awareness among the American people to say hey maybe we shouldn't have some of our best companies going overseas investing in the centers that could be used to orderly defeat\nThe United states in a you know whether it's economic or military competition and there's something very interesting that there is a a man by the last few months later way of twenty second spread oh go ahead or basically\nThe there was the English language men is the reason why we won the industrial revolution against Britain it was a British expatriate name Slater they called him slate of a traitor and England and so the same thing might be happening with American companies going over to China building up our our rivals\nUh somehow that phrase that they liked early on and Google garden that don't evil thing to be but I think a

critical of China\nOr to send a chill or into the ranks of those students and it it really cuts against everything that we say that well when they come here to this country they're going to experience academic freedom and intellectual freedom and therefore they'll go back and change China and the fact is is that they feel probably even more under observation and more under surveillance here\nWhen they're studying abroad than they do in China\nYou know Michael what'd you say is absolutely one hundred percent correct about Chinese students here\nThey are under surveillance by the Chinese government by the Chinese students and scholars association or embassy personnel but you know some of them actually do express discontent like those who started that a hashtag not my president movement in California\nThose Chinese students were very clear that he didn't like the idea that ... was eliminating term limits for himself and for the vice presidents or this is a real indication but Chinese students to actually think and have views that are very different from the Communist Party\nSure and we and what we want to do is encourage that we want them to be able to number one be here and feel the freedom to speak their minds but\nBut even perhaps more importantly than that be exposed to different views be exposed to a a critical set of um discussions about China China's role

Christian aspect of that\nSure I I don't consider myself a really talented person but when I heard on Wisconsin Public radio I listen to public radio a lot uh-huh it they were talking about George Washington when he became president he did not want to ... them and I just think to myself\nWhat a shame they take it out because\nYou know if it got people that I don't care who's name there whatever letter or name out of the base it on that and that way I see it we don't need any act with other white\nUp but that cap in our case or whatever something happened to the poor woman and I can't imagine a traumatic experience like that but up to me is not an issue right here in the fact that Obama when he killed somebody for the first day we got to wait till after the election\nIssue it on the other for how to get it before the election\nWell you've covered a number of the issues of the day but I'm not sure that's directly relates to uh the topic at hand I Would just make one note before it deferring to Dr Creighton\nA it was very naive of George Washington or anybody else to suggest that there would not be factions factions are almost proof that we have a free government if you have a genuinely free society you will have differences of opinion\nAnd like minded people will get together and organize to try and convince others of their point of view it is an essential part of society Malcolm faction lives will be carried do far well yes it certainly can and perhaps we're seeing a manifestation of that\nBut the notion that you can have a free society without different factions is an impossibility indicted for to Dr Creighton\nI Would have to agree with you entirely about that I think there's a psychological motivation and the whole to leave for a\nUnified groups to ultimately ... to smaller divisions so I I think there's no way of recording connections or what you do want to avoid as you mentioned is the extremes polarity between\nTwo factions soon that there's no workable solution to the system\nNo a call from Steve in Chatham county North Carolina good evening Steve\nThat landed on always enjoy your show in a shake your says thank you ... ... when it gets to a point when you go to a restaurant\nOr or you go out and I I don't know if the person or the establishment is the last ... whatever the hell or I don't understand this really wants to know\nThat when it gets to a point where you can't go out and have reasoned debate without someone screaming at you spin on the ... and you send things\nCan't I really don't care of your disposition\nJust let's say let's have a reason debate I mean if we can talk without screaming at each other ... the ... which I don't do\nAnd yet I'm the I called the Clinton machine the machine has his just you can use to give up the fact that two years ago two years in the ...\nYou know you lost the election of ... I guess what if you love this country if you if you're being honest and then you're going to try to build it up not tear down\nWell again I'm not sure of the extent although certainly I've had my differences over the years with the both Clintons ah especially in regard to uh honesty and and corruption I don't know that we can say that they are personally responsible for the uh the outbreak that we've seen a ... across the country\nUh I Do a Dr Creighton find one thing that I find tragically ironic\nAnd that is that much of of what we're talking about here is conducted by groups that roughly call themselves and ... that is to say anti fascist\nAnd the tragic irony is of course that those tactics\nOf a silencing your opponents by intimidation and violence would have been understood by any of Hitler's brown shirts a reference that I'm sure would go right over the limited intellect of most of these people [laughter] but that is that that is is the sad a problem\nAnd that cannot be tolerated when you try to do that from whatever political perspective but you are so fewer\nAnd you are so virtuous that you don't have to listen to anybody else than the only answer in my book\nAnd you can certainly agree or disagree as you choose the only as in my book is do arrest\nProsecute and if convicted incarcerate such people that is out of bounds you cannot let society be reduced to ... to the level of ... who can put together more of violence in the street\nYou know I I think you're several important points or whatever the points that I Try to make in the book has to do again with the underlying psychology of what's taking place at least a large portion of society and it's been said for some time now that there's an increasing degree\nOf of the offices within the society and the judge to increasing decree of moral perfectionism obsession all thinking is in society\nAs a result when when one morning counted as those types of psychological structuring individual uh those individuals are very prone to what we call projection and that is that they tend to uh take aspects of the the denied a self\nMakeup and to place them on people around them [noise] ah so you have a group like a anti five\nAre claiming that the anti fascist and you look at their behavior\nOne would expect from a fascist group and so you see this constant accusation coming from the left projecting on the ride for everything that they're doing\nA and denying claiming that it's the rights to doing it so that I think the motivation for some of this behavior in terms of how to deal with it I agree with you entirely I think one of the creators problems that we're encountering in society today\nIs that you lack of enforcement of the laws that are ... that are currently on the\nBooks a from a place like Portland for for the mayor of port to sit by and have people rioting\nOn the streets and refusing to have the police intervened this is a breakdown of the necessary a legal sanctions and boundaries that are a free society must have and if that's gone that it's going to be just a free for all\nYeah ah again it it it is not something that ah that that can that can possibly be tolerated and and I see things like that and there have been other examples some time ago when there was a a police shooting that brought a rioting to Baltimore and the mayor of Baltimore told the authorities to let it burn\nA as if to say if people feel aggrieved enough that they get a free pass or behaving like civilized beings and that is\nAs as you say it I I think I'm not putting words in your about that is is pointing us in the direction of anarchy and that is not an acceptable outcome nobody is so aggrieved that they have a right to break the law with impunity nobody\nWho's teaching yeah go ahead\n... again ... ... it's the role of the Gulf than a both at the local level in the federal law enforce the laws of the country and if they fail to do that then you can expect a increasing outburst from these groups because there is centrally enabled to behave badly\nExactly are we are you telling them yes you're tactic at intimidation is working and ah people responded positively when they are told that their tactic\nIs uh is going to be tolerated stay with us more to come as a doctor Richard Creighton takes a look at just what is that work here what is the psychology involved in the the way we are currently conducting a business in this country at the public policy level and it's a\nIt's disturbing but again it's a knowledge and the knowledge is power maybe we can learn

feminism wide\nI Do because this was a star chamber preceding the allegation was enough to lead to a conviction I\nThe whole process was absolutely wrong\nAnd as someone who really cares about sexual violence and has been studying it for nearly fifty years I don't like to see it use for partisan political purposes and especially if you have one witness who is totally credible as well as the judge one witness who doesn't have good enough memory\nDoesn't have witnesses\nAnd doesn't have the facts to back up a credible presentation\nWe asked the when I'm afraid that the next serious\nRape victims

air a number of times since the\nKavanaugh hearings but if someone comes to me and they say they have been the victim of sexual assault than I Am full of sympathy and I am saying I Hope very much to the person who did this is a apprehended than charged prosecuted under convicted given a severe punishment\nHowever when you go beyond just the statement I've been sexually assaulted and you start making accusations either in a court of law or in this very public forum of the the Senate Judiciary committee\nAt that point I think you have to deliver the goods as you say you need to know the specifics in fact I Am I've talked to people on the air who who have different with me on this and I said it is very important I Know that there's a tendency to try and the blank out of your mind such

look at almost any given issue and if you are a veteran Supreme Court watcher\nYou could pretty much call the outcome but within a vote because the court has become so completely illogical that there

ideologically and not as part of our herd mentality of any kind that's a God given genius that we can be different and one of my sorrow says that the intellectual life with the academic life has turned into\nThe sound of one left hand clapping and no tolerance for diversity intellectual diversity there's a lot of desire to have ethnic and racial diversity but what about thinking to

casually I think these days but the the call you a legendary feminist leader would be accurate and now you've written this a politically incorrect feminist my guess is you've taken a fair amount of heat for this book\nWell I think I Will but I have written other books and I've taken hates them I wrote the new anti Semitism when I saw the ethnic hatred of the Jewish people rising and coming to us from the left him from the Islamic world not merely from the white right wing neo Nazi world\nAnd I took heat and that I wrote a book called the death of them is where I look at the failure of women's studies which became\nGay and lesbian studies but no women the women would disappear and all of our civil rights issues which are still burning issues will forgotten and our feminist knowledge was not systematically passed on to next generations and that's why the me too movement arose\nAs a way of reinventing the feminist we'll we\nIn the early Nineteen seventies and speak out on rape condemned it

parts of the world\nThe predominant viewpoint is all the we've just describe it is not a crime or even a problem the way it is women are as very or their property to be treated that way I mean and there are people who will\nNot only defend that we would but with righteous indignation now I don't I don't think there's any hope for people in those societies for the foreseeable future am I just a

six to six we're talking with attorney simply Powell about the apparent murder\nOn the Saudi Government property a consulate in Turkey a dissident journalist and we're at one eight six six by boat jumbo to offer thoughts about this let's start with the Casey in the great falls Montana and the Casey good evening\nHi assist thinking that there seemed to in my memory there was a strong linkage to nine eleven with the Saudi regime or at least a portion of the population in\nThat well a lot of the people involved in the plots were from Saudi Arabia to my knowledge there has never been any evidence to get him to the Saudi Government was in any way involved\nLet me let me expand upon that point\nI'm not saying that there was any linkage directly but I think that there is a ideology that is exhibited by the Saudis have disdain and disrespect and I don't think the president should go to war or get carried away but he has to\nWalk a tightrope you should send a strong message that they can't just in his uh\nUh presidents and his in our nation's hill in there a dilemma mostly that we're helping them with so that's my opinion\nWell All right very good any ah any thoughts or the ... to the caller\nTemp in trying to think about different things that might can be done hall so and one might be to significantly limit the number of a diplomatic passes that any of the family has to come into this country at all\nMaybe reduce the number of people at their embassies here I Am not let them by as much land and property as they would like to buy I mean you know we've got to consider all the potential options that we have to make some sort of statement about this\nUm but yeah so I mean I I see your point there's this gym and I were talking at the beginning of the show this is an extremely complicated\nIssue there are good and bad and nobody to knock us how horrible the Saudi regime is but it's better than it used to be in some ways\nYes in some ways and better than almost any conceivable alternative on that peninsula of Luke in Madison, Wisconsin good evening\nEvening I'm\nI appreciate both of your pragmatic approach to the situation but I don't think you should give a fair pass to a group of people that intentionally paralyzed someone and tortured them over seven minutes by all accounts for\nI'm not giving the mass either I just ... there's no a lot we can do about it\nAnd that that is what makes this complicated\nAct for the apparent brutality again what we have so far or stories don't pass it off no no no no we're just supposed to be clear about this loop we at this juncture does not have a definitive answer on what happened we have what is looking more and more like a probable outcome if that is true then you would be right but we haven't got that\nName when you look at the Saudi response where they first said we weren't involved and now they say it was the interrogation that went wrong no one could be headed during the terrorist here so I agree\nAs soon as I heard that what that means they tortured him and then\nI thoroughly agree on it have you\nHas it as if this has never happened anywhere else on the planet I Am I'm not saying what do you do about it do you cut off our nose despite our face\nAt some point when you have people who have sponsored the nine eleven attacks\nBut not wait just a minute here we do not know that the Saudi Government had anything to do with the nine eleven attacks\nWon't feel the information that the FBI report said and you know that too but that's neither here nor there no it certainly is when you have a ... when you have a group of people that are basically scaring the world to act you have to do something and\nAnd even even ... even to the exclusion of our own best interests let's say that al ... to ... this hour in ... just finished by state but before we get your answer a let's say al ... took control of the Saudi peninsula how does that improve things either for the people there or for this country\nDo you think it's good to have a government that will take someone ... poetry\nObviously not and I I repeat my question to you in fact I'm going to pose the question now without interruption and then let you respond to it let's assume\nThat the al ... or ISIS forces took control of the Saudi peninsula every bit as brutalization ... regime maybe more so and very ethnical anesthetic go to the interests of the United states how is that an improvement Luke\nHow is butchering someone that kind of\nObviously you just don't care to deal with reality okay I understand your outrage but like so many people in this country today your outrage does not have any logical conclusion the answer of course what IPOs was it wouldn't be better and until you come up with some kind of a better answer other than just were outraged and we're going to do something that will be\nHarmful to the United states and the Saudi people because it'll make us feel better I don't consider that a responsible answer a ... and he thought for music needs to go to the next call here\nYeah we do have to be very practical about it and we have to put the interests of American citizens first both whether they be in the region or in this country right now in our in our strategic military interests around the globe and everything else\nIt'd be a little different if this would be the only time in history that any regime is ever acted in a brutal way well guess what it is it that I'm so sorry that the human condition is as bad as it is but it is and the notion that never happened before and all of human history I Would say\nHow outrageous unfortunately it has happened in countless times Chris in east Texas Zillow\nLets just calm down a second and then there's a little bit of logic here because

in Durham North Carolina Hello Charlotte and welcome\nThank you very much appreciate it real hot button for me and has been for many years that failed to comprehend it somebody could enlighten me I Would love to know why in the world\nWe give billions of dollars every year to the Saudis Christiana poor reportage she went in undercover in several places but uh you know really she could have lost her life that she showed where\nThe Saudis have fourteen carriages go five states in their account Barnes why are we sending money\nOr there's no question about the fact that they are not shall we say a poor and uh certainly uh although as I noted to suddenly Powell\nThey may be useful on occasion is hardly a usefulness that would demand or that they get our money that part I must confess or is it is a little hard to understand\nI don't understand it all I don't I have absolutely no appreciation for any reason why we should give them a time\nYeah again as I say uh if uh they were someone useful to us who needed money that might be different\nBut they are someone who can be useful to his who doesn't need a penny and in that regard I think Charlotte sport is extremely well taken a one eight six six five oh jumbo what eight six six five oh five or six to six Rick in Tucson now and the good evening Rick\nHey Jim just calling to suggest uh I'm trying to find out of the reason why the ... uh wouldn't just but when they've got this guy on the consulate\nWouldn't just for ... for a certain level for it and they were told to do show\nA quaint and that he's violated multiple Saudi law extradite him back to Saudi Arabia he goes into a jail in Saudi Arabia and is a story on a stick in the New York times [noise]\nAgain he would be just as out of the way the and I think that the again we have a a very rational thought process from Rick uh\nAnd the power that the Saudis deliberately felt that only through a show of big screen brutality or could they send their message out I mean I Would think that what Rick just described would end up itself be shall we say an unpleasant ... fate to send a message to dissidents\nWell it certainly should have been but this is as you mentioned earlier gentleman and evil sort of regime\nAnd they are barbaric against women and all kinds of citizens of their country so I that's what makes me think this was a deliberate message\nThat they are are barbaric again a is a given a that they were stupid and dealing with the United states this would be a level of stupidity beyond anything that I've ever seen that's the part I think that amazes me\nThat they have generally been pretty adept at quote dealing with the United states and this uh this kind of arrogance or maybe\nThat's why they're calling it an accidental death during interrogation that we're supposed to do everything but killing\nYou know you know the ... that ended up ... this is a regime so brutal that they might very well I think that that would somehow pass oh okay you were only tried to make me a little bit ah maybe that maybe I'm maybe I'm wrong maybe they are the stupid Linda in Champaign, Illinois hello\nHi Jim I'm not saying that the Saudi Government are nice people or anything like that they aren't\nAh certainly not at that and this this fellow um I Believe I'm came from a family of arms dealers have within the Saudi Government at one time I think a very close to some of these\nHe's a Muslim Brotherhood supporter he is the way they talk about this or that hardly makes him a savory character that's very true in\nLike a journalist in in Saudi Arabia having the freedom to write in favor of Israel he thought that shouldn't have been allowed and now ... says that\nUm and I don't honestly think that the Saudi Government would have been so stupid it's just pull a stand like that because they know it would come back on them and I wonder if there was a rogue elements of course we don't even really know what happened\nNo no we don't but the thing about this rogue elements in a consulate consulates these are not just places like boutiques on the shopping center where you just wander in\nNow but people can decide to do something that's\nNot smart and I think that the fellow called in about John rented maybe on something and it may have been done and partly make Trump look bad and go and make a wedge between ... you know because\nI ... that that is the level of Machiavellian thought you will have to explain to me I don't understand and I certainly make no apologies about John Brennan who's been a negative influence in this country for years and years and years but I fail to see\nHow any of this benefits anybody on the American left especially given the fact that if in fact he is somehow implicated that this would rebound on the everybody on the left in the United states I mean I don't see any game here for the risk involved\nBut I'm saying that right before the election this isn't you know causing the administration is a huge headache\nWell it's going to be administration a minor league headache I mean let's face it this is not this is not the Iranian nuclear deal is not a a jobs and everything else I mean although we're we're making a big deal out of it because people get all upset about it but I cannot believe frankly Linda [noise] that ah that\nOne tenth of one percent of the voters in this country are going to change their vote because of this\nWell I think that the ...\nBeing blown way out of proportion I Believe that we've been talking about it for many days I mean you know\nLike a okay sit me or take [noise]\nI really don't have anything to add to that [laughter] but I\nI just can't wait to find out whatever we can find out about it for our own at a vacation and use and going forward in any sort of dealings with any of the parties involved at something we need to know and factor into everything that we do the Sufi whoever the actors were\nAnd it may be extremely difficult to pin down exactly who ordered this done\nBut it you know it was certainly people in the Saudi regime that were high up with the Saudi regime I think the lead person that was sent in to the\nConflict was one of the very closest persons to the king and and to his son\nYeah I mean ... ... again it let's say hang these people out to dry and say that it was it was a totally a\nAn operation that people who just all suddenly went crazy and and again that in a regime where people are going off on their own without any kind of approval from above I Can't think of a better way to get yourself

was talking about this yesterday Henry this wasn't some reporter who wrote a bad\nReview of the prince a visiting L. this guy is has a deep deep background in the royal family and also with the Muslim Brotherhood there is much more about this man than just the fact that he wrote some op eds for the Washington Post he\nWas\nHe was doing something much bigger than than than a a newspaper column something else\nThat has caused him to be killed but at the same time the the idea that you that your leader in your country can kill you is so foreign to was but I I presume in that part of the world\nThey've seen it before they probably know people have disappeared it's like the mob they know that you know the mobs in charge you just don't mess with them this guy messed with the L cross\nThe line yeah ... ... what happened and you know you say we don't kill anybody none that we know a good point I don't believe it or that literally like well I think\nI I I Do say I thought Donald Trump less smarter than to get involved with it I think he should have said well I I'm not happy about it but I'm semi rodeo yeah and I got a ... a site I\nThink he's tried to say that but the but the media won't let go yeah I look at a ... you know we picked people um that are our enemies off of the battlefield and a imprisoned them have you ever heard of ... of course we do yes\nWhen you know this guy this guy has heated something more than writer bad ...\nAll all I could say I'm as a a at a bus with a whole bunch of media people ... and ... and the British sad\nIf oil or that class because it's it's so hypocritical on both sides of the media right now it just makes you want to get sick\nAnd I don't care if you're a Democrat or Republican their boss at each other's throats yeah raised a\nWhile and the problem here as we got two allies that are strategically very important to was that are at each other's throats here and and we're in the middle of it and and we need to back out of that middle somehow I don't know how we do it but just\nJust like Charles said four hundred and fifty thousand jobs I'm All right and the newsman wasn't that important to me well I'm Sorry that makes the ... human being I can live with it\nI think he was a spy I don't think he was a newsman ... by\nThat and when you spy against their government uh there are severe consequences we used to put people to death for doing that in this country um that's I guess that's why I say I think there was something that similar paragraph of the show was\nWas not a news man he was he was a spy was an inside guy was doing things for Muslim Brotherhood even doing things for the royal family\nOr he cross somebody's path and and uh that was all it took so\nAlright Henry thank you I appreciate the call

probably a grade level above\nHer uh her grade right now and my wife and I are actually talking about taking her out of out of a public school because it's failing because they ... it just in her class alone they have to teach the common core curriculum in two different languages Spanish and English\nAnd living her into a private school or private charter school where we can pay probably I think we've looked at it was three or four hundred dollars dollars you know a month\nAnd she can excel and you get the the education that I think that she deserves it something that I'm willing to do I'm willing to pay\nAll that amount of money because I listen she is highly intelligent\nI I mean you take you take the basics you know you put a roof over your children's head you put food on the table for the your clothes them but I I put right in that same category of mandatory minimum\nIt's a life long investment is to educate your child the more you can educate them the better life they will have\nIt just ... but it's a bit of a high probability and I can't think of race so anything I Would rather do that in any case my children for\nThat one of the things that my wife and I do we have three kids uh ... uh our oldest is a middle school and then we have our two youngest is that are are are in grade school and you know while they're friends get to go outside and play after school

they're really in their head\nThey ... the how many miles at what rate of speed they have to start their dissent in order to be at a certain altitude ten miles from the airport they know I mean it's just what they teach and what they applied so I Know these pilots that are whizzes at mathematical computations but it's not what was in the textbook when they were in school\n\nThat's exactly right

Jews\nI Know many people don't realize it but there's a big difference between conservative reformed Jews that don't like Israel and don't like really being Jewish between Orthodox Jews the love Israel and of course the old on shop any personal have common sense knows that Obama is the biggest uh is all hate or in Jew hater and how are you going to be a fool not to believe that\nAnd went down so there is no president ever ever did and Israel which is why does everybody to bridges in Israel and the end after Donald Trump and even a train station did you know that\nI Do know that but but just to the point is Seventy five percent of American Jews don't like him I absolutely get your point about the uh twenty five percent that do I know a lot of them to do I'm just talking about collectively Seventy five percent can't stand them I don't plan on voting for for him again ... when he runs again and twenty twenty\nThat's because those Jew that's going to say what do you think Jews ...

for the kiss that woke her I don't know where we\nGo I have no shot but let's say let's talk about this I mean right now I I Know what the administration saying we have a lot on the line here and the president plays all his cards in front of you which we're not used to well but it is overwhelming what's coming out now isn't it\nAh I mean it really is it ... there's there's there's no question that something is is going on here and it's going on if not at the highest levels\nAt least in an orbit that is very close to the highest levels I mean if you look at the Fifteen people that turkey has said we're responsible for the disappearance of the alleged murder of democracy ...\nA number of those people up to nine or ten of them\nAre a very much involved with the Saudi royal family in terms of security than this one fell off a ...\nA is said to be an intelligence agency for the Saudi intelligence services so this this is getting very close to the orbit of Mohammed bin selmont and as you pointed out there's this contradiction here because\nHe has liberalize some of the policies in Saudi Arabia but at the same time he has a you know I take it a lot of people who he said in the royal family who were corrupt and imprisoned them\nAt a hotel in downtown Riyadh so he has built a lot of enemies as well and\nIf he is in any way involved\nWith the disappearance and alleged murder of democracy Yogi that is going to be a serious blow to us Saudi relations particularly since NBS as he's known is expected to take over from king saw him on in the not too distant future\nSue the word is they're trying to find a way forward here let alone the has the details come out that it ... if this is all true and the audio reveals\nHe was tortured interrogated fingers cut off while alive and there was a reporter did a to chop up his body he urged everybody to put on music while they did it\n[noise] yeah and and the fact that the ah ah the Saudi console\nUh Mohammed ... is a allegedly a herd on on tape saying\nDon't do this here take it outside you're going to get me in trouble in another voice on this alleged audio recording says shut up if you want to make it back to Saudi Arabia alive I made it definitely seems like like something\nVery horrific took place inside the Saudi consulate and then there's this idea that cleaning crew was in there just before forensic experts came in there were walls that were re painted but you know if you're if you're a good forensic expert and and this is not just from watching\nUh you know and see I as a but if you're a good forensic expert you can you can find traces of of blood in places where you would think that you would be able to it's very very difficult to clean it up if you know what you're doing\nJohn how you explain this type of miscalculation if all this is true with ... I think that they think they could get away with this\nI think it's I mean have you know you're dealing with the society that for years has disappeared enemies and it's not just not just Saudi Arabia it's just so many other places ah you know I I I I think I think Louisiana Senator John Kennedy\nWho is it is is known for his colorful language a set of quite accurately when he said the other day on the other than Israel I trust a Middle Eastern countries about as much as I trust gas station sushi\nYou know there are there is a a long\nOf dealing with your enemies in in various met evil waves and uh I I think that this may be another case of that I I don't know who or why they thought that they could get away with it but but somebody clearly thought that they could\nSo what's the way forward here in the revolution prove current revolutions proved correct there's not going to be much time for the White House or for Saudi Arabia\nAnd then this is why many people are saying that this is one of the most important decisions how he handles this will be one of the most important decisions that President Trump makes because\nYou can can you just let it ... if if this was involved with the highest levels\nHow do you just let them get away with it and if you have to do something what is it that you do because you've got in the overall a hundred and ten billion dollars worth of a military arms deals are going with Saudi Arabia that means tens of thousands of jobs for companies like Lockheed and Northrop Grumman and racy on and and Boeing\nAnd then there is no greater trade relationship between the United states and Saudi Arabia the president said the overall value of the deals that they signed last year was four hundred and fifty billion dollars and then you have to have Saudi Arabia is cooperation and the war on terror you've got to have them standing as a bulwark against the Iranian\nExpansionist um I'd ideas\nAnd and then you've got this idea of oil everybody says well you know America's become the number one oil producer in the world\nYou know that's that may be all well and good but you shut down the Saudi oil supply and you watch how fast the price of gas a gallon that Britain how fast the price a gallon of\nGasoline job so it's a very very important relationship\nAnd uh how the president deals with this he's he's going to have a very very difficult needle to thread\nRight I mean if he came out and say hey by the way we're bringing up relations and no one would push back I mean Republicans are upset Democrats are upset Corker came out right away

could I could do that and it probably be pretty safe ground\nOr you could say it's impossible at this point a to a John what's on the agenda today\nWhat can the president woke up this morning and drove the news cycle by saying then you might put the U.S military on the southern border to close that if\nA right go doesn't do something about this Honduran care what he's going to Montana right ho that he has he's going to Montana\nAnd then he's going to Arizona [noise] ah and then after that he's going to Nevada so I you know he's he's got to be away from the White House for three days but

internationally\nIn on CBS or talking a little bit about the president and his assessment of how he's dealing with this disaster this political disaster over in Saudi Arabia and turkey regarding the missing Washington Post columnist\nOr the president loves these autocrats so what's it going to do is it going to crack down on Saudi Arabia let's deal in rich Lowry he is the editor of National Review a friend of this program a friend of mine and a friend of yours rich the morning to you\nHey Steve I ah how's it going it it must be a lot of pressure big big shoes\nTo fill ... kill need out yea it couldn't like left\nI was just hoping you know what am I going to do for the first twenty four minutes and tell a rich Lowry comes on to\n... yeah okay All right I'll bail you out of the radio magic now I I\nThink so far so good uh what do you think about the president in how we said you know let's not be too fast to blame the Saudis regarding the missing guy\nSo I I don't mind the an attitude let let's wait and see all the facts what I Do think a president has seemed\nTo be too eager to accept\n'em a cover story from the Saudis yep so I don't I don't think that's the appropriate public posture\nAnd uh apparently Pam ... reporting in which was quite tough than his private meetings with the Saudis so I mean this is the difficulty it it seems clear they deliberately set out to murder this guy and the most hideous way you know out of the Quentin Tarantino\nMovies yeah and he said condemn them there should be some sort of consequence but you don't want to destabilize the regime because this although I think the Saudis are bastards is is probably the best we can help or\nUm in terms of the government and Saudi Arabia and to their an important ally and you know forced to choose between the Iranians in ... which we are you know on a daily basis you go with the ...\nEven though they're imperfect and repressive and murderous but I I just this is such an addition to being a crime is such a blunder I Know you figure\nI can come into your consulate and not leave and no one's going to notice well\nAnd and it makes you wonder has this ever happened before it does it's happened to guys who simply aren't where an apple watches and and somebody's ...\nYeah I mean well they they killed dissidents all the time they just usually don't do it and there's a brazen a man or a overseas so it's bad you know the the reputation\nThe crown prince will never be the same um but you know where we can't overthrow the Saudi Government ... deliver liberal government\nThey're just sick conditions aren't there for that I don't really have to deal with reality as it is and that's where I think you know Trump has represented a correction to an over emphasis\nOn idealism you know in the Bush years he just has to guard against going out swinging too far in the other direction\nSure and of course everybody's hanging on everything he says because we are less than three weeks away from the midterms and you know the Republicans are terrified that they're going to lose the house there's certain it looks like they could actually pick up some seats in the Senate but that's another story\nRegarding the midterms what is on your radar as something that could break a either way for either side and the next three weeks\n[noise] I I don't know it would would be inherently you know some sort of surprised what about the Caribbean\nIt it could yet could could help energize the Republican voters hum and it was the question is clearly that the gap in the cabinet fight was galvanizing Republicans increase their energy which is hugely important and transformed um\nAlmost impossible to me now that Republicans could lose nominal\nControl I think they would at least you know the worst cases that ... ... tie breaker um but the question is does that energy\nYou know last that the next three weeks so there's something like you know crisis over the care of and maybe that helps the problem in the house is just the these districts that Clinton won that are occupied\nBy Republicans are really endangered the ones where they're Republican incumbent has retired about eight of them are basically gone even Republicans admit they're they're gone and that gets you you know eight eight seats towards just twenty three they need that that's holding the house will be the Republican somehow managed that it'll be near a miracle and I'll do it you know by Syria to\nWrite a we had Eric Trump on Fox in front of this morning and he said look if the Democrats when they're going to be a lot of investigations into you know\nThe Trump Administration the Trump family everybody he said\nUp but then again when you look at what the Republicans have been able to achieve with the Republican president\nTheir record his body you know the president really wanted to build the wall the you know they're barely building the fence or you want to get rid of Obamacare So it's not like a Republican led Congress is really helping him\n[laughter] yeah so they did a tax cut which is which which is a big deal but otherwise most of the important things to have happen through executive action and through\nRegulatory actions so that the downside of Democrats taking the houses were on you you you know what the other party to take power period but um as Eric I'm pointed out they'll\nYou know ... spent all the times of painting the president and they ... and investigating and try to make everyone's life miserable it's possible that just that they have a one\nMajority in if there's any kind of majority if they get you know Fifteen it's like a way and if the boats they're going to\nEach other to yeah you're probably right hey rich Lowry thank you very much for joining us today here on the Brian ... radio show\n\n\nNews talk Ninety four point one they are the early riser so hard working neighbors planting the seeds raising the crops getting ready for the next\nThe only time it's been happening they need to watch it\nYeah there's a lot going on or who knows it could be just one of those darn grim ones that technological stuff can help him one of my kids were kind of a key choices right now he or she is in a Clinton, Massachusetts Keith thanks for joining us on the brink kill me radio show hey how's it going\nIt's going okay what what do you make of one of the other things we were talking with a rich Lowry about a little while ago is uh what's going on in Saudi Arabia and it looks as if\nThey could be covering up the fact that uh the crown prince of Saudi Arabia ordered that his hit men decapitated and take the fingers off of and then just chill or this Washington Post correspondent a rather a columnist in Turkey\n... what do you think about what is going on with that dynamic because so many people here in the United states Keith are asking the president in the United states get tough and do something about Saudi Arabia\nWell and what happens unfortunate if it happened we need to get to the facts of course however I think a plane sanctioned in this situation would be rather inconsistent\nI mean if we're going to do it the one we can do it at all I mean just this past August we at Iran order seven journalist to be jailed and fog in the wake of their coverage\nChina just in February detain the relatives of three United States and journalists Andy you ask a green card holder for their coverage a serene a sham she was an American journalist who in twenty fourteen was killed by the Turkish government the drug and regime after the two days after they accuse her of being a spy\nOn I mean in fact turkey under their drone regime they've been one of the worst offenders when it comes to journalism direction\nNow are we supposed to really expect an honest investigation from the like the turkey if so that would be akin to giving credibility to Russia's investigation into the poisoning of Sergei scrape\nOff when you make an interesting point do you know the president's in a pickle it's it's a damned if you do damned if you don't we're gonna have to see what he does he think he very much for joining us here in the brain kill me jump\nRight meanwhile over on the news maker line we've got congressman Rodney Davis he served proudly the thirteenth district of the great state of Illinois Republican and he's on the house committee on agriculture and the chair of the subcommittee on biotechnology congressmen or thanks for joining us here on the brand kill me Joe\nHey Steve thanks for having me are\nIt's a real pleasure hey listen ah I hear that the vice president was out at a rally for you ah what about a week ago right\nYou know he was he came out to Springfield, Illinois to land of Lincoln it just did a great shot rally the troops and really I mean you can't made a nicer guy that vice president Pence caged wants to help every Republican get elected but we got to get everybody the polls and he knows\nHe does know it and that's why he said this about you listen\nIs a choice vision the people of Illinois are okay\nTo make no mistake about it it's not just a choice between your congressman and his phone but also it's a it's a choice between two futures in Congress itself I mean the truth of the matter is that the Illinois Thirteen may be the district that decides whether or not we have a Republican majority or whether\nNancy Pelosi speaker of the house and the next Congress and I just knowing\nThe results you're going to choose more prosperity and I know in my heart the people's central Illinois are going to support Rodney Davis [noise] whether\nYou've got the vice president seeing some very nice things you know congressman so many people think oh Illinois a that's a completely blue state that is not the case there\nTo absolutely not downstate Illinois decorative many states throughout this nation where Republicans are are winning re air winning seats in areas that that even Democrats or legislators drew to a lot of Democrats than we've got to get those voters to the cold and it's humbling to hear\nA vice president Pence say those words you can't I was there when he hid it of course but here again a kind of you know tears me up a little bit but it also it puts a perspective on the fight reinstate and we're fighting to make sure Nancy closer than ever gets set speakers dabble with that\nAnd I know that is one of the things you're seeing out on the stump what when you talk to people I Know you've shaken a thousands of hands over the last couple of weeks trying to get out the vote\nFor November the six what is the is there one motivating factor for Republicans or independent to lean your way who are Democrats even who who may vote for you on the first Tuesday in

Saudis you know he just returned from Saudi Arabia you said you've got Seventy two hours to figure out exactly how this guy wound up dead and uh if any Saudis are involved\nHe gave an ultimatum to the royals he told the U.S media we should not rush to judgment and he told the prince Mohammed to own the situation and wrap up the investigation and\nOur secretary of state said this\nTitle President

well\n[noise] okay so uh it's pretty clear from what the secretary of state said right there the direction this is going\nIt sounds like it sounds like according to what we've heard so far the crown prince uh was involved in order to take out this could show you a Saudi citizen or us resident who worked at the Washington Post as a columnist very critical of the Saudi regime\nIt sounds like by the fact that Mr ... said he told the president to give the Saudis a few more days to investigate\nOr they're trying to figure a way out of this but it has been suggested that sense of the crown prince who it sounds like order the hit on Mr ... uh the current print print has a number of other brothers in the royal family and if they\nPush him aside and ah although he probably wouldn't be prosecuted in Saudi Arabia they need somebody else to take over and it would probably be one of his brothers and they're just trying to figure out the best way to do that\nBecause uh the virtue of of what Mr

the twenty twenty election that's coming up in the not too distant future isn't that incredible that were already talking about that but I'm going to end the Mendez enthusiasm for that\n[noise] there you got the president of the United states are speaking on Fox Business about the importance of mid terms and that's one of the big things we're talking about here on the brink kill me radio show today we're talking about the midterms we are talking about the the pickle that the president Gen regarding\nSaudi Arabia because it looks like part of the royal family might I ordered the hit on that

while and rub you you were worried that the Republican voters are going to stay home in November right\nI'm I'm worried because you know it takes money to run and it's hard to raise money out here whether it be in such a a a blue state you know people think it's a winnable district but it is so you know ... you or or Bryant come out and support mark Callahan you know a helping raise the money ... ... it's a winnable district\nThere you go All right Rob thank you very much now let's go to Larry he's retired military Larry what do you make of the president's suggesting today that if the country of mix\nThe president should use the military and close our southern border\nWell thanks for taking my call you bet well first of all I'm we know that first of all we know that he has the authority to so I'm as commander in chief that's an article to the constitution a section one I Believe based on his oh\nA particle to section and a three\nSays he'll uh take care of that the laws are faithfully executed punter under under the tenth amendment he also a there was also written decision concerning Arizona if you recall the business of immigration to belong to the federal government\nAbsolutely and that's why that's why it's so important that the president United States enact and enforce the laws on the books unfortunately and you know this Larry past presidents simply have not done that\nExactly yeah so I think well I think under Obama with a cold or something to do with his discretion in in in forcing the laws\nRape and President Trump is using his discretion to enforce them or are you so you're a hundred percent okay with the military going down on their southern border\nCertainly certainly and and that individual who made a comment about really throwing more money in in in in the Central America you know that brings back all the\nFederal saying that one that won the premise is false everything follows that must be false and believing anything that that individual or any of the Democrats for politicians say about immigration is really a like put shoes on a dead horse\nFlu or you go All right Larry thank you very much for the call and thank you for your service now is going to ah Columbia South Carolina Rick joins is he lives in ... W cue X. L. Rick thanks for joining us right now you feel the same way about the president using military at the border right\nTotally I'm totally in favor of that as President Trump's number one job is to protect the borders of the United states\nProtect our country and with regard to the ... incident um\nThe bottom line is to show he was not an American citizen and that a crime that alleged crime did not even take place on American soil so I don't even see what we have any legal standing to get involved with that sure it's an outrage and a terrible thing has happened\nBut ... not an American citizen and I don't believe in a slap and sanctions on\nA country like Saudi Arabia and hurting the American economy I don't like going to the gas pump and having to pay three or four more dollars per gallon of gasoline\nYou walk into that conflict of his own volition it was a stupid thing to do well was not an American citizen I don't\nThink he was a count on getting murdered in there but uh it it is a quandary for the administration to figure out what to do Rick thank you very much and let's go to Jerry in Nashville Jerry um you you feel the same way what what what's the deal with the show the right\nExactly I feel the same way you know Russia to the ... by shooting of a reporter over there and we didn't have to\nPut on a bunch of sanctions will stop Kim Jong il and kills his own relatives and and you know we didn't have to get involved with that China is actually currently chili CIA operative some it was supposed to know this isn't your spirits theory look it up on the Internet\nFor me it is quite a situation and it'll be interesting to see what the president does Mike Pompeo told the president give the Saudis a few more days to investigate because they are one of our most important now lies which is kind of what you guys are saying All right I'm Suzie\nFilling in for Brian ... we will return to a couple of minutes right here on the radio\nOff your Saturday here coast to coast\nWhy would they stopped coming so this is Congress\nUltimate failure and and that's why it's so important that you know Republicans maintain control both houses of Congress because if if if they don't it's only going to get worse because I think there are a majority Republican support Donald Trump in his immigration policies in a border wall another thing\nCongress needs to address the asylum of black people come and claim asylum and uh that they're coached by their quota organizations say a few key phrases which gets an approved at the border\nBut once they show up in court if they show up at court eighty percent of the lose your cases so what Congress needs to do is raise that asylum bart or so it can't easily meant so much thought\nYeah Tom we're speaking at a time home in the former acting I stricter about this Caribbean ... the president of Honduras said that there are unnamed political groups that have organized if they say other sectors that want to destabilize the country but we will\nBe decisive and we will not allow it he's suggesting politics are involved to make a Honduras look bad but at the same time people doing the political calculations here in the United states and they're going\nLet's see there about a thousand miles away they maybe they could be and our southern border around time of the midterms and then we've got that whole ... separating families thing all over again\n... ... I I knew a story for years I certainly don't believe in coincidence I think I Can't there's certain ... a political\nThings went that far out of immune from American people are paying attention this isn't Trump's a President Trump's failure this isn't Republican Congress scarier this is the Democrat show you're so you know bottom line that\nPresident Trump he wants to do the right thing\nHe wants to close to the polls you've heard him say it many times are speeches each\nSpecies eighth back Congress to close loopholes you said many times worse immigration laws on the world's log that's true so there's a ... I think it's going back for I think the American people paying attention or Puerto right now is not secure and I think if you if you listen to those on the hill you know that\nWe do a polish ice a\nYou know it's all about in the family separation let me let me tell you about St family separation\nNo one likes to see families separated I get it\nBut because of what's going on right now if Congress don't make the change of these people do get sharp border either we just open the border up a little keep coming back in ... in the hundreds of thousands in the past year full or we what we do prosecute those enter the country legally\nAnd separate of just like we separate American families when their parents get arrested sure I mean that in ... and let me tell you that during the family separation only a couple of weeks to tap the numbers on the border dropped twenty two percent\nSo you know it it does work it shows a consequence of deterrent to illegal activity works and the third thing when you talk about\nIs Congress hasn't funded by the proper levels they needed Fifteen thousand beds right now the proposes forty thousand ... give an ice ten thousand less ... which means the people that you do get a recipe book Joe allowed not going to be released so there's no place to put them you know so Congress has failed on all sides\nWill you know because he is a political issue the Republicans are saying look a\nCome midterms it's a binary choice either a if you want open borders both for the Democrats if you want a strong security at the southern border both for Republicans and I think Democrats Tom realize that because they've been telling their members whenever you do\nLet's not talk about immigration because uh you know we don't have a a really good story on there to counter the Republicans saying do you want a strong border or not\nI I I don't think the American public's going to be fooled by this they want to abolish ice or not talking about right now\n'cause I Know it's gonna hurt but bottom line is abolishing the ice you could open borders because you're lucky to get by the border patrol and you get into nine states no one's looking for you to there is no ice so you know I I think that the current who's been pulled back on them they're open border Canada\nAnd they can talk about it but they're they're actually speak louder than words or the let me say it's better or not action speaks louder than words it's American people are secure border and American people want to know this is a A R summer to remain didn't they cut the right parts of the office\nAnd they need to make sure that like parties and offers to maintain the president suggested [noise]\nYou know the president does have a lot of discretion when it comes to immigration as we've learned over the last two years\nGoing forward in the last two years of this first term of Donald Trump or Tom Homan what else can the president do to a perhaps tighten up some of those loopholes or get rid of him or or just make the seat the our southern border a little more secure than it is right now\n[noise] well I think we I think uh the wall to wall as necessary every place\nThey look I'd been around a long time I was in a bar to like sit back in eighty four eighty five and six and we used to wrestle thousand aliens night\nOn the same she'd go down the soccer field once it put a border barrier up those numbers draft where decreased [noise] they put a barrier in El Paso at but wanted to sign that don't want to know central every place it build a barrier that illegal immigration has decreased so that you know\nWorks his photo illegal immigration responsible to grow up close and like I said this morning I don't care who Republican or Democrat every one of them have a responsibility to protect just ... protects us citizens there's no downside unless trucks and trailers country there's no downside unless it was ...\nAfter truly for low level boat low level low skilled labor big Congress she's a fix for last night's toward a worker visa but to keep growing the criminal organizations to smuggle these people in the United states is what we're doing that that's something we don't talk about\nThis isn't just illegal immigration problem Steve this when when when it was\nImmigrants are a criminal organization to smuggle them to work thanks very cool organization that will smoke John this is talk of the aisle trying to pay a tax where they worked two cartels plaza when when a criminal organization which most people to the plaza cartel owns that area\nYou gotta pay the cartel taxes so this this is not just yeah it was immigration issue this national security as\nWell and the other thing is and this is something that we don't pay enough attention to because it's like it's a political thing they tighten the border you don't\nBut this is a ... about the tens of thousands of men and women in our southern border who put their lives on the line each and every day when they go to do their job and you know if there's a cartel trying to smuggle people across maybe they don't mind killing a border patrol agent\nDoll and matter of fact you know the um ah ah last night or the night before last August\nActually had a ball drop out ... dinner in Washington DC because I still are bought let them twenty thousand American patriot says she set a stand on the line that protect protect this country ... and I met a lot of families have fallen bought choice\nAnd so like I said last night that people don't want to build his wall close loopholes for president than certainly do it for the men and women who died of defining destination yeah there's there's over there there's a couple hundred names on that\nNational law memorial Wall Street won't we work and if anybody questions the integrity in the ... men and women a poor job simply walked at Wall Street and in this or this is about protect this country and and and taking care of the board to just get so much as\nThey know that wall works they know what they gotta southern border they want these loopholes closed and one thing I'll add why these ... are tied up changing diapers taking care of these families the cartels will will push a large population of families across one sector of the border ... tied up\nWith them they're pushing drugs to an area where they know

much more pleasant\nBuying a mattress on line where there's no pressure no confusion and you have typically three months to decide if he liked the mattress or not if you don't like it no questions asked you get all your money back\nIs so much better than the old way of going in a store having a high pressure I'm self consciously laying down on a bad for a few seconds to say oh no that one doesn't work let's try this out going oh I like that when maybe but then you got the thing\nIt happened to my mother in law and father in law that they bought a mattress in a mattress store and hated it so much but uh you know all sales final there were stuck with the thing\nAnd they'd been next round bought one of the mattresses in a box and got a great one will now the traditional\nMattress

mattress down your wallet that you don't really want because the Chinese\nI mean they're almost none of the market at all so you just have all your fine\nPutting tariffs on the Chinese mattress makers 'cause it's not gonna make any difference is car courageous that you're trying to use political influence to keep yourselves operating and you just know as a consumer\nWhen you're looking for a

that area great how can I serve you\n[laughter] well I'm I have a lot of big life changes happening in the upcoming lands and I'm trying to figure out what the best smartest timeline wouldn't be\nWe are um can say opening up a new business and getting an SBA loan and also purchasing our first home\nBottle yo\nWe shouldn't do all of it and maybe we should read [laughter] wow\nWell yes [laughter] you just have fired me advice or what I what I heard as I heard cash flow knocking out the door starting a business moving\nBuying a house starting a business always in short order yeah how and the world would you sleep at night you must they must feel no anxiety at all or what\nIt comes and goes a specially during this [laughter]\n'cause I Would I Will tell you you know I don't know if you've ever heard me talk about and I should do the sometime soon talk about my past to where I Am today but [noise] when\nWhen I started my own business and I was twenty five at the time\nI had so much anxiety I Would wake up in the middle of the night just anxious couldn't go back to sleep you know worried about how you were all worried about something went wrong in the day before whatever\nAnd if I had piled on top of that lying a house at the same time I mean I I think my head would've exploded\nSo oh my goodness maybe your ... who can handle the dual 'cause you gotta do suck there on cash flow by home and starting a business so which is more important to you right now\nI'm starting a business is is more important if we have to rent temporarily that's okay um we\nHave that that matched me stop shallow breathing man saying hey\n[laughter]\nSee some kind of entrepreneurial P. T. as Steve said that I like [laughter]\nOkay [laughter] okay [laughter] um\nIt's going to go how how quickly is going to be profitable how much it's going to grow how slow is going to grow and I want you to be careful because you buy a home you got a fixed overhead there you rent you know it gives you more flexibility\nOkay\nHow ... for the business\nI'm a combination of a sudden some cash and some some alone time so we wouldn't be investing in a franchise is is there out we're going to go and then uh we have a twenty percent down\nSaved away for the home if we can\nYeah I Would really I'm I'm really asking you to put that just on the shelf for now\nBecause when you start a new business you don't know what your cash flow needs are going to be you know you know the franchise people are going to promise you that oh yeah our trend line is you're going to be a cash flow positive and how many months do they tell you\nI promise anything they show is their best guy there were gay and their average guy and and I and even their worst guy would be okay with us\nOkay All right well that's good I I and have either you you say we as you and your husband are going to own this heavy either of you worked in the industry before that you're going to have this franchise\n[noise] we have a lot so\nI'm just all a stop signs and red lights right now I'm a big fan of one of you going to work for one of the franchise\nIs doing anything and everything for at least three months mhm\nBecause she got the rest of your life you can own the franchise but I really like for you to uh experience to one or both of you to experience the business before you're all in\nOkay\nAnd I don't know if that something you've considered but with any business whether it's a franchise or not having some experience when your money's not at risk\nYou there's so much you learn in a relatively short period of time that eliminates a issues concerns mistakes you might make once you're owning it not parading it\nYeah that makes sense\nSo I put your whole life on hold but you wanted to talk to about\n... okay [laughter] well you know I respect your opinion and I thank you so much for your advice\nSure and I wanted to ask you one thing before you go the borrowing you're gonna do you said SPA maybe\nThat's what we were thinking\nThat he would ... small local bank that you can go talk about your plans with\nFor a local and not yet no dad are a recommendation\nWell that's just what I Want you to be about as I Want you out there talking to the there aren't as many small local banks there used to be a lot of them look like they're local really are just pretending and there are parts of bigger operations you want to a bank that you can grow with\nAnd that specializes has people on

the Sam's Club and Costco Wholesale excellent and you know both of them have institutional supplies are you familiar with how Cosco has the business centres\nYes and they approached me as a likely candidate for their wholesale club and I just did not know what to think of that\nBecause the business centres specifically deal with um a owner operators of small motels they sell 'em you know a facial tissue\nAnd private label and huge box quantities you know where do you have the the size of the individual boxes are smaller but they sell you a big quantities one time huge amounts of toilet paper all those kinds of things Sam's Club if you joined their premium membership\nHas a delivery service where you won't won't even have to go get it they deliver for free\nRight and when they have a

Daniels with us on the Clark Howard show hello Daniel so how can I be of service do you\nYeah so I was approached a with a co worker who has a great reputation in my book and he was talking about eight to me he was starting to work part time for and so forth\nSo he set up a schedule time than him in a representative from this company came on over to sell kind of ... life insurance and uh besides life insurance mutual funds and getting out of that stuff that sort of and of course at the end uh\nKinda pitched a little bit about how they were taught fifty in a way by forms a New York stock exchange that they are on and how I can work for them so far with that\nThey were going to have I was not about necessarily buying the products although they'd like that but you selling for them as well\nCorrect Monday the catch was it seemed like was you'd have to pay nine dollars\nFor a background check of what they stated a and from there are a twenty five dollar technology see if he chose to use the technology for now this company said that they are trying to help only middle class families\nA man that David also send you to licensing or for the state to satellites life insurance mutual fund et cetera with that my my question was is if it was a legitimate company if it was a legitimate potential side income or is it just a regular\nMLM or a multi level marketing\nNo no this is a legitimate cell or a mutual funds and insurance movies they were talking about those are completely normal there's nothing okay rip off or weird about them what you should know is that when people call me\nAnd the other side where there are saying hey I've had the salesperson offer me these mutual fund should I buy them and on that score I've said they're very very high cost funds so if you were coming to me as a customer for the product\nI Would tell you why is not a product I'm excited about it all that but as far as selling it's not a scam it's not a rip off\nUm it's just an expensive way for someone to start to build up investments for the future and to buy insurance\nSo okay does that help at all\nThat's all it does what does that make you think he wanted to do\nI Do like my normal job right now I if it's a if it's not the best product that I don't want to and you're supposed to be helping families out I don't feel comfortable maybe selling a product that's not the best product out there for them\nGot it okay good for you and is is I'm Glad you have a specific reason that you're able to give them other than say will Clark said I shouldn't do it [laughter] I'm not a bad okay [laughter] I got enough of that going on [laughter] Andrews with us on the car coward show hello Andrew\nHello Clark how are you great thank you you have your retirement plan with tea uh uh that's correct yes are you a teacher a college professor or work for a nonprofit how'd you end up with them\nI was a teacher for fourteen years in public schools but I'm a college professor of seven years at this point so\nAnd so the the University You're at offers to your retirement plans\nCorrect and they're very generous to they contribute to eight percent a year\nIn addition to that I haven't been contributing roughly seven percent to that same retirement and the question I had for you as if that is really the best thing for me to do because the eight percent is really not match it gets contributed whether I contribute or not\nAnd I also have to credit card debt or that my family has a built up over the past couple years because of some health issues and medical bills as well as some damage that occurred to our house to water damage that we had to have repaired\nA while I'm Sorry yeah we've had a lot to deal with haven't you\nWell yeah but I mean life necessities you know you take care of them out at any chairs so uh so we have five but now we're I'm I'm sort of at the point where I I Need to sort of figure out the best way to eliminate that credit card debt and I was wondering\nIf I were best be served to pull that seven percent that I put into my retirement and use it to help pay that credit card debt off and I guess the overarching question is would I be better to even be putting any money into this ... or would I be better with Iraq once this credit card\nKnow you know the the plan that you were in with the uh is so low cost\nDid and it comes automatically out of your check 'em really comfortable with doing that and at some point she may offer some form of a Roth for three be\nInstead of a traditional and you could consider at that time going into the Roth version but going from the seven percent you're putting in to zero and just picking up with the employer puts in with the university puts in there to concerns I have that I'll just lay out to you\nOne is that\nOnce you reduce it to zero it's hard to get back to putting that money aside for your future and all the time you have that you're not putting money and you're losing the opportunity for that money to grow for you\nThe second thing is that and I'm Sorry both of these are so negative what I'm saying I just got away I'm Out the other is a lot of times if somebody does let's say take it down to zero and then you have that seven percent now added to your check\nWould be a little less than seven 'cause it would be pretty tax money going and now the net effect team maybe like five percent more bump into your take home is does that five percent actually make it to the credit card bills are not a\nLot of times the money will somehow vanish before it goes to pay those bills\nSo you got to know yourself shore a compromise would be what if you cut your contribution to let's say three percent from seven\nSo you're still contributing to your retirement and you use the difference to go towards the credit card debt\nOkay and that's a thought 'cause you'd still be saving roughly eleven cents out of each dollar with the employer money put in in what ... what you're putting in\nAnd then you can put your focus on getting that credit card debt pay down and I wish you the best with the uh with the medical situations and with the house\nAnd you're able to get this debt wiped clean\nYou know it's so important to me that you have access to the information that we provide on the show at your fingertips and that's why we have a number of newsletters now that you can get on a

H. D. and D. U. N.

surgeries coming up a no okay well good well I'm Glad you're I'm Glad you're doing so good that's awesome okay same so uh what what are you are thinking of putting the money on [noise] so\nMe and my wife have agreed that we want to use this money to buy a house mhm but she\nUm [noise] well we were not agree on is that she wants to put the majority of the money all the down payment and save about twenty thousand for emergencies mhm and I have the perfect time to get rid of all like that and we'll still have a good amount for a down payment on a house ...\nAnd still have some leftover but she's not agreeing with me with that mhm and I just want to hear\nYour opinion on the way you think would be the better move\nInto well she's not agreeing with you I don't know why she would agree with me [laughter]\nBut anyway the uh uh we tell people not to buy a home unless your debt free how much debt do you have\nTo get it we have about forty five thousand dollars in ...\nI Would pay that off and I would hold twenty back for an emergency but the rest is your down payment\nIf I were in your shoes I Would not buy a house with that still laying around\nI think that's dangerous you're asking for trouble\nAnd so on and so my vote is going on your side of this argument I'm afraid but I don't know I honestly I don't know why she would answer to listen to make now let me tell you this I Will tell you that I Would not do any of this unless you guys get on a budget and you agree to never borrow money again\nOkay yes that I have a track to talk to her about that and actually a new economic trying to get her on board ... she's not really to come ... also having trouble getting her on board with the plan and his well\nYeah I can imagine so um I I highly recommend you don't do anything until you can come into agreement okay\nBecause you're going to make a mistake when you Shannon I when we have an argument like this we uh we have to we have a rule we have to do nothing until we can come in agreement\nOn large purchases large gifts large decisions we decide nothing is the only thing we can do until we're in agreement\nAnd uh so I I recommend you do nothing until the two of you can get on the same page um do you think that she would go to financial piece university if I gave you a one year membership\nI honestly do think I've been talking to her mother trying to help me out just because she's so stubborn about this and her mother is on my side as well\nUh I don't want to ask me what I asked was can you get your wife to go to financial base university to the nine lessons and if I give you the one year membership yes there you think so why she pressure\nI think that me and my me and her mind would sit down with her and explain to her um\nGo to the clients is free okay I'm going to give it to you but I'm only going to give it to you on the condition that she attends with you OK because if you go by yourself or the cause of divorce\nDoes you're going to get more and more and more and more excited about getting out of debt and living with a plan and ... it's going to drive a wedge further between you own I don't want to do that\nSo I just if you can talk her into just attending one or two classes with you I think she'll go on and go to the others I'm pretty persuasive but ah but don't\nI'll have to pick up I'll give you the financial ... membership for a year and that includes the nine lessons that you can attend and you can watch them on line and everything else but do not do this without her it's a it's contingent upon that my gift is All right Dave is with us in Stockton, California Hi Dave how are you\nOh good afternoon Dave how you doing today\nBetter than I deserve what's up\nWell that that's good faith um both my wife and I are few coordinators had were dead tree debt free\nAnd we need your wisdom and guided something where we also have a little disagreement um last you soon after our son gotten very loaded with money to help them out really I'd knowing knowing that we would never probably see the money again okay [noise] um\nWhy would you do that you're ...\nYou know what that's a good question that's a good question I maybe it's because I haven't talked for about a year I\nTouch with every I live with that aspect of it but um we volunteered to pay for the material that they take a class which they did\nBut in the end they didn't discipline Metallica fall into the principles and or building a ... at all mhm well after six months we decided that they weren't trying to make the U.S back anything we kind of let them you know we weren't alone in the more money because they had made no effort to to reimburse anything of it\nAnd and there was no communication to indicate me ordered payments back\nWell you know life goes several months later they're only vehicle broke down and um then they could not be repaired and my son had no way to get to work this is where it gets sticky let 'em knowing that my wife has a good picture of her parents trustworthy dispersing funds to all the fisheries\nIncluding him we both agreed to Frank about Ninety percent of what the what we see with the understanding the would immediately pay us back when the checks or in\nSome of the logical is it they were born ... find that they were already keep them by her her parents trash\n'em as it today we have not distributed that money but it's getting it's getting a little stick here here is going to be just to be the next couple of weeks\nWhen we when do you do in the meantime they've they took out I'm a five or a eight thousand dollar loans to pay off for them and said well we'll do rent the otherwise they'd be I'm addicted in our daughter live just does not want to work to help out [laughter]\nSo my angle is interested in ... mirrors and because they have not given restricted responsibility of pain backyard alone I have strongly suggested and I think that's about as far as that goes into my wife's side that my wife write the check to they had them come over and sided or just\nAnd we would write them a check for the balance of what they didn't borrow much of it we didn't we didn't print them and it seems simple and we know that if we approach it that way that would be successful\nAnd lemonade the temptation that using the hundreds and they're not paying us back as agreed and be in my opinion be more proactive to solving this\nShow from a non thousand dollars right the eight hundred right now what's your network out what what's that what's your net worth\nA ...

I work for the postal service they have a ... a student loan debt of like um about Fifteen thousand dollars [laughter]\nAnd um I have two friends one of them as I'm\nAsking me to go for business\nOr like a friend um subway business so I was thinking about taking a loan for that and my other friend is I'm all for me like to go buy a house with him to the share like a two family house so I take one apartment he thinks other\nThan it's going to be of course with a mortgage loan to so I wanted to know what should I Do\n... okay well we tell folks not to borrow money around here if you listen to the show very much the shortest\nPath to wells and peace in your finances is to avoid that and on top of that I Would tell you to avoid partnerships as the only ship that won't sale\nShow 'em what that means is that if you still want to remain friends with both these guys I Would suggest to say no because at the end of these stories are nightmare\nMillion partners with somebody in debt to go into the restaurant business would you do know squat about is a good way to end up bankrupt and lose your friendship forever going in partners or somebody to buy a house\nAnd then he doesn't pay is half or can't pay his math where you don't pay your ever came by your half is a\nPrecursor to the ending of a friendship and a foreclosure shown no I wouldn't do either one of those\nAnd that's my reasoning I think you'll have a lot better life have you avoid both of those paths and you can you can develop a career path that does not involve you're going into debt to start a business it's a matter of fact most businesses start without bet\nThey just start small we started this one without the card table my living room we didn't have a big fancy studio we went down to the local radio station drove over there and they let us use their stuff because we work for free there\nNow is figure out a way to get going and you what we call bootstrap it and it works but you don't have to go get an SBA loan and go deeply indebted about subway franchise in order to be in business that some mythology\nThomas is with us in Philadelphia Hi Thomas how're you\nDave thank you very much for taking my call sure what's up I'm I just graduated with a degree in actuarial science back in may wow and I'm working at McDonald's making nine dollars an hour why\nI I've been applying and applying and I just I Can't find a job and I don't know what to do\n...

hired a hundred and fifty to two hundred last year\nWe had Fifteen thousand the applications\nFor those honored hires you get lost in that ... and ... there's not that I don't wanna answer and talk to every one of those Fifteen thousand people it's just a logistical not reasonable\nAnd so what ends up happening is you get lost in the stack of that stuff unless you know someone that works there and you don't have to be best friends with them you just 'cause I got to tell you we don't ever hire somebody because somebody called me and says are ever [noise] but we would give them an interview\nAnd pull their pull the resume out of the stack\nYou got to get out of the pile you know and so some of these places you're trying to get on with you need to figure out if your sister that's married a kid play soccer where the guy that works over there or something like that where you can find someone that will put in a little bit of a word for you\nTo at least get the door open\nAnd that'll get you in the door again you're you're not going to get hired because of that kind of a reference matter of fact there are very few references where you just calls up somebody and I get your hired at almost never happens that'll decent job anyway\nI mean if they're hiring just bodies you can get off something like that but at a good job they're really going to want to interview you and learn about you and that will be true here so we don't guarantee anybody a fire but we will at least talk to them\nAnd you know what might be a very short conversation no you don't qualify investment or looking for but at least we'll talk to them and get the resume out of the file [noise]\nIf somebody knows I'm Sorry go download that and listen to the kids home and show he'll help you and all this stuff is very

look into because they knew I had a lot of student loans\nYeah yeah so I mean you went from\nBeing completely crushed by student loan debt to completely owning it\nYeah I felt like I was suffocating under the day I remember being so scared when I was sitting there and actually looking at the balance is and I didn't know if it was even going to be possible to get out but I didn't really have\nAnother plan and so I figured I'm just going to go with you know Dave Ramsey and stick with it and just commit to it and see what happens in twenty two months later in the final payment\nYeah she paid off almost two hundred thousand a year for two years mhm Minnesota ray you're on which is pretty incredible but you're making four Fifteen modest taxes which takes a big chunk of and so you weren't living you weren't you weren't splurging on anything now are you weren't starving to death but you weren't splurging\nAnd just completely lean to show as you're going along you're you're hitting this thing when you're hitting it almost twenty thousand bucks a month yeah a Fifteen to twenty month only given month\nAt what point when you started doing that did you go wait a minute this is actually going to work how far in war you before the before kind of the switch kind of flip for you\nI paid off all the smallest ones first I had a total of twenty different states\nFirst and then once I saw how easy it was to do that and then I started to have some more hope that I Would be at what a pay off the largest ones I think my largest individual alone was right around fifty thousand dollars and prior to that I just looked at it and it was like there is no way like there's I'm not going to be able to do this\nSo your trunk and some of these like one or two a month yeah knocking 'em all the little baby ones when you first started yeah and that yeah but I had to give you a lot of emotional ... definitely debt snowball really kicked in for you than they did what he was supposed to do it let you know that this was going to work\nMhm wow wow wow wow wow wow\nAll right so what is the big takeaway when someone says oh\nI'm I'm a ... year hundreds of thousands I Can't get out of debt you say yes you can here's what you do you do this\nI think the most important thing is just to stop running from it stop trying to hide from it like I was trying to do um I was I just felt crushed and it was you know so afraid that I Would never get to that and I once I faced it and once I took personal responsibility for it\nAnd you realize that I'm the one who signed the papers ... you know I Need to get myself out uh then I just made a plan and stuck with it and made the commitment to change or your parents' good with money\nAnd they are their income as much less Sher didn't know what mine is but I learned most\nPeople's [laughter]\nYeah I definitely learned how to live on a budget for my parents and also um they had been in quite a bit of a credit card debt in the past they always told me you know don't be stupid with credit card ... I'm ... smart purchases and so I think I learned a lot of those principles and then\nYou know there was a there was a sense a character that came from them that they cause you'll be able to do this

Jones and I said I thought to Kentucky was going to win the SEC ease the way that I saw the rest of the schedule breaking our ... where am I wrong man what are you concerned about\nI think you I think you could be right I mean it all is going to require seriously flawed and they got it makes her Georgia beats Florida just in case although Kentucky does hold the tie breaker against Florida if you were about to lose again\nAnd then the cats got to find a way to be Georgia a Kroger Field if that happens in Kentucky and even slip up against Missouri\nOr Tennessee and still uh when it all come down to that game November second in a ... or don't ever third and Lexington in Kentucky plays Georgia and I think Peter it might be the biggest Kentucky gave\nConsidering the implications ... in football game maybe of my lifetime coming up is that ends up being the\n... you know I'm trying to think I go back to the season two thousand several was crazy here in this conference ride to LSU ends up winning the national championship they have to losses it gets nuts that year Kentucky that you that you're what they were six in one and that and that's the last time the Kentucky started at six in one you spend it forward to this week against the Vanderbilt team at home\nComing off the by you never know what some of these teams are going to get you what is the one thing you hope that they worked on\nThat that mark students team worked on this week during the ...\nThe biggest question for the same really the only question is the quarterback but against tax and say any of that was the dominant defense I mean Peter that game I don't want to tell you that came with overtime you know in Kentucky\nNever had the ball wouldn't play on the side of the the the one hand you could go well that's an apt office and that means you played a heck of a great defensive game so\nI think it's all about the quarterback play into bladders good they lost straight Jackson against a a male but I think that hurt him he'll be back\nBeneath sales excellent but Terry Wilson the quarterback just he just look we add all sorts of that game and that's got to get better\nBecause except for really except for the Florida game Kentucky's not looked great quarterback all year and yet they're still playing the way they do and other like you know seven when they were six or\nSeven when they were six and they still have to play T. Bo in Florida they started to play of Tennessee team that you know really good day here I mean they still had a really hard sketch this year you look at the schedule\nAnd they can win every game left and so there's no reason not to be optimistic if Kentucky plays where they're capable\nOf there's so much optimism right now because listen I'm here in Birmingham ribbon FCC media days to these women's hoops yesterday was ... and obviously around big blue nation coach Cal comes in here with arguably what a top two ranked team so my question is are more people interested in I mean what what what's the percentage breakdown right now of Kentucky wildcat fans\nThey leaning towards football is number one on their priority or they're still rolling with basketball\nLast me after I mean there is a table and I mean it's going to be football because the excitement around football is at\nThe moment\nThat they're not in contention that they don't drop back to that so so so I'll give you an example that November third game against Georgia\nI really believe if it's for the SEC switch it could be will be the most important game played Lexington in my lifetime but\nLet's say you're lost you know what\nDon't get me started on how great fall as you said in a warm\nDays to any reasons and one leaves on the ground and about a million things to make me sneeze\nRagweed and they're a little something over by the garage that sounds like what animal that about ... as he remains\nAggravate my allergies sometimes the over the counter says helped but never in my eyes turn Eighteen read science has\nLong running and I'll wind up with a sore throat and that turned into a car before you know I'd be sidelined if it weren't for highlands health care I don't have time to lead allergy slow me down especially this time of year\nFall allergies are a problem for you you can depend on islands healthcare and physician's assistant Kimberly Logan to help you keep them under control three Fifteen north Washington avenue sweet one Seventy five and\nViolence healthcare is a primary care provider was pediatric care urgent care VA services and they can even help with your seasonal allergies the islands healthcare T.

television you worked for prima donnas sometime dog right there [laughter]\nI'm Sorry but [laughter]\n...\nCoach and we talked about ... you you can't you can't creep up on anybody when you when twenty six games last year while you're on everybody's radar how big of a difference as a kind of coming into the season and having the challenge\nFor us it's about the expectations we have for our program and when you walk down our hallways and look at our law for and then see those pictures in the statues of what\nFormer players have done when our student athletes come to Georgia there's already an expectation and what we tell them as we're not asking you to do anything that has already been done at Georgia other than the national championship or everything's been done so\nTalk about and not focus on what people say on the outside and I think that's why every year we have exceeded expectations um and that's what our focus has been we obviously didn't in the season the way they want it to last year so our conversation the summer's been\nWorking harder closing the gap to compete against those really elite teams and so that's what we really focused on\nOkay I've got to ask ... you know I really enjoy watching you play you're such a tremendous athletes along with a tremendous basketball player but you've got to keep yourself on the floor\nFor a long time again can you again and again okay you've got to keep yourself on the floor for longer periods of time because you tend to get into foul trouble early and a ball game and that really puts your teammates in a in a bad predicament\nHow the war time maybe the mental aspect of that and and how to use shore that end of your game up\nI was definitely the stretching practice 'cause they keep up with the\nAnd every day I just try to lure them off our car trying not to sound at all I just tried to weigh best events that I can and just to stay on the foot up my ... you know\nOkay I'm going to be on the lookout for that this year too\nSoft and needs to be the ring tone when milk called how to like stay all\nOur listeners going ...\nYou mentioned this season demand last year what you wanted it to ... needs to change in ... for what happens that allows you to finish it in a better way\nWay without shoot the ball better when you look at our losses there is a tremendous difference in our scoring you know the scoring margin and so we've got to shoot the basketball better we've got to put it in the hole that means taking the right shots that means getting in the gym and working on shots against speed and\nAnd knowing what we're looking for in those particular nights and the other thing that really hurt us is when you're playing the league teams\nYou can't have two or three positions where you have you mess up if you mess up defensively and then you come down and don't execute on off and you look up and commit fighters that Fifteen point game and so we've got to clean those things up in order to not allow that to happen\nWho's a player practiced so many times you know go on\nRight now ... who's a lawyer in practice ... prose Jew or impressed you\nOr I was ...\nShe said that the law and the difference between her ... year LSU has been tremendous she's definitely been in a gym more she's worked on getting ourselves into shape she's first one in the first ones come across the lungs during condition and I just ... because she stepped up so much\nThat it's it has Americanized and I just wanna recognize her for that\nSounds like your sophomore year [laughter]\nYou know what I mean\nHow would you agree I think she really took it upon herself to be aggressive um you can see there's there was a change the white\nCame on for her I think last year she came in and just it\nI don't want to say was passing but she accepted coming off the bench in her limited role and I think this year she's especially this fall she has proven that she's fighting for a spot and she wants to be someone that we can count on gay men and came out\nOkay so we're always talked about she's impressed with what they should give the dream the dream doesn't\nCan I answer that sure of\nShe can for the basketball I mean she is a shooter that can for she's tall she's got that links but you also can get to the rams she finishes well around the room and um she's got really really good energy I'm Glad you asked for\nPromotion answer Johnny I'm running\nFor you to drink\nI think it shows you anything goes three coaches [noise]\nI think the players or get a little more insure on certain things\nWhat am I going to be a good thing I mean where is it you know the\nCollege football is\nLike let me jump in here and what I what I mean by that is in in in in taking this from you is what I think you're trying to say is that when you have these one percenters and the coaches they're comfortable of making their decisions right I mean I don't think you have to look at new for the Knicks saving has done over the last couple of years and realized that Nick is so comfortable in his shoes that he continues to grow\nDabbled when he has done the same thing that comes in but specifically for Nick Nichols built on defensive minded football\nAnd the office was almost an afterthought the all officers almost succeeded as a byproduct of how good the defense was flipping the field\nAnd we've seen Nick\nI Would argue is the greatest coach in the history of college football change in a vault view of all when he hired link given a ... a year or so and it's\nGoing to say but I agree with that yeah I just want to make it [noise]\nI think for the phone call my end but I think that the other part of that too is I think that he went to more of out of his comfort zone and saying hey listen to what can pass the ball\nWhy are we going to try to do anything different than other than what they've done this year and I think that's been a monster thing any time you see a business leader whether it's in in business is in politics or it's in sports and especially in college football\nYou know what I could learn something from butch Jones being on my staff I can learn something from an office of analysts coming in and helping me even if it just one play right\nIf a coach is going to put his ego aside and say I can change that is one of the reasons why Nick Saban continues to evolve and one reason why they continue to have success down there ... Nick are joining us here on the show what's happened in ... Nick how you doing man\nI'm going to have been a while so that do\nIndeed hope the better half as well\nShe is she sat on the porch watching the show [laughter] I don't understand or actor and I was there and I'm Glad you got better comprehension than I Do but I Want to ... ... ... uh the last call your joke before my\nWhich is in Columbus ohio\nTook all my boys over there and ask you about two or if he was gonna say view of the coach wouldn't use him against us and he told me all that are all that [noise] why should I or as you get them to Missouri where does the low so\nI'm Glad you said that in ... Nick before we get into the middle east situation I didn't want to rehash if just in case you you're just joining us he didn't get a chance to hear what I had to say\nI wouldn't play to against Tennessee and even if I did play to uh I play um almost like a starting quarterback would play the second preseason game and what I mean by that as you put them out there you have a work throughout the whole week if he's healthy enough\nUm and you run them out for a couple of series make sure he feels good in the flow of the game and at that point you pull them because the only way\nThe only way that they don't win the national championship in my mind right now is if two was not a hundred percent he did not look a hundred percent in that game toilet twenty five did not look comfortable with the Braves I Know they changed it in collectively I think dealing hertz is good enough to do it as far as Milly making that Missouri game\nWho better to ask then ms Milly right now she joins us here

their experience when they needed to\nGet into the gang when he needed to rest is starters or whatever he had been experience with the minutes looking jazz homes he's going into that starting point

[noise]\nWe're we're the we're the tears in women's hopes this year in this call for\nIt I think it's I think it's a pretty wide open conference but do you have to get the nod to Mississippi State first and foremost because of tear Macau and the six seven inside player that just cleans up so much offensively and did defensively for the bulldogs\nBut you've got a lot of of unknowns because we lost some big time players last year agent Wilson gone from South Carolina you've got\nOn the for seniors gone from Mississippi State that has to be replaced he got um the Mercedes Russell and Jamie ... gone so you've got you got some real question marks so that really does open up the bank\nFor other teams to really make some noise and for some other players had become stars and this late\nI Would I Would think that there there's an up or half full or half\nA going there seven better change\nAh and I'm just saying that regardless of which seven teams a pit then put them there\nI'm I'm a believer that one of those and the lower level could work their way in to the upper seven I I just think that that there is a difference I think that there are seven teams that have something my particularly talent more to do\nThat are dangerous at some point or ... them those\nA little bit more talent and that and that's the difference\nWe've heard this from ... a little bit we heard this from Robin ... Missouri\nPosition list basketball that seems to be the buzz word this week\nWhat do you make of that\nIs what I make of it I think that big kids in this game to shoot threes and they want to be told that they can go outside and put the ball on the floor and be a player that doesn't have to just get banged on in the in the paint\nThat's what I think a lot of where position with basketball comes from because we're seeing it in the NBA\nFive out we're seeing big no and seven foot or shooting three pointers\nAnd that would just trickled down to our games there right now and it's fair it's fair we got six we got six to six three six four kids can put the ball on the phone looking ... Wilson lateral here we have those\nPlayers in our game that they're in their position was basketball\nBut let me ask you this going forward about ... so that's what it is\nA coach can that work\nIt yeah it absolutely\nCan work it is working on the men's side it is working in the NBA the WNBA and in some places\nA Connecticut is a team that you could say plays position was basketball ... what it really means is you to me is you have versatile players who can move around the perimeter and do multiple things now\nMake no mistake about it I don't think position list basket ball\nCan work if you do not have players with multiple skills to be able dribble yet be able to pass and you have to be able to shoot the three with some range you must be able to do those three things if you can do that then you ... simply spread out\nQuestion to to talk about is just replacing ... we know you lost her to grad transfer but that's a double double the last two years for you how do you replace that player who fill those shoes\nIndia Jones from Atlanta back to her up last year ... brought into that role in a way sad or fear player out of Maryland who had been her most of our career Asia Allison perverse Allison's daughter\nHe was number one MBA player when he came out of ... back in the day and then we send a Jew co kid at a Miami, Florida show would put you try to do by committee yeah\nI went back and do a little research before I came in two thousand eight elite my five player average four point six the game and bought for player average a rabbit six point seven\nShow there's different ways to win instead of just building up but the stats those positions of four and five or a place in twenty eight points ... rebounds out of our four or five that just to point average last year yeah\nSo I've got to do a little coach and and there's heroes\nWe'll get they see that in mind score and she does it at a quick pace so it's really a fun player to watch\nFor sure you have a player a transfer from Louisville gear Johnson I\nRecruited her from Duncan real high school one of the great high school basketball programs in the country uh shoot gives you a presence and ... plans for her and how she\nAdjusted to Texas and employees\nShe set out last year and learned a lot playing behind ... college more bus strike power player this was a kid that can face a basket coming out of duck and bill you know there will coach that's a\nNature it hinders aerial Adkins or to make a kitchen you just go to ... ...\nShe's going to do a great job she's one of our captains because of her maturity and she's going go ride in a position and then we've got a couple of other kids back in her a\nKennedy last year you were for the people who are watching that don't know this national freshman year and one of the reasons last year ... score you know the ball in your hand you have moved he got ... bank you got it all you got the three and getting to the basket\nThis year what have you added to your games can wait what can we expect to see that in a different than what we saw last year\nI'm really I'm just trying to get better at all aspects of a game you know defensively\nTrying to become a better defense beach has a plan to be the goats and player when we need to stop and things like that um as far as office I'm trying to elevate any way I can but the biggest thing with me it's just trying to\nMake my teammates better and make sure that they're on the same page is mean when I'm Out there on the court and friendly lift them up and let them know that we're in this together and stuff just being a leader from I think\nI'd argue that you're the most exciting player in college basketball in almost even in both sides and men and women because when we watch it last year it was nothing short of fantastic especially going into the tournament will you let it up for those who haven't had a chance to to to really consume them women's hoops who's who's game do you have I mean who who do you get the game\n\nThat was something that most people don't know about me is I'm really passionate about the game of basketball and I really love it and that simply why play I Do it because you know I Love playing and I shall emotion as you've seen in the tournament in there but um as far as playing like anybody I just like to be to to myself and ... and cuts but let me play so\nOkay now you know that defense it's hard work ride of course\nThat is one of the things that college players done so well his whole career is is is the fans and that's something you demand and but it is different and I'm really learning how to stay in his dancing and clothes out and do all this kind of thing and it's something that is an area that you have to improve and how is that part of your game improved\nI mean this summer I've got a little time off and I was really spending time in the gym playing against men and boys and I learned how to guard you know people who are six five and I'm only five nine so I think that I can say that I'm from off the court and come right at the college basketball and just try to defend the best way I can and get cuts valuable minutes when I'm Out there\nReal quick how how often do somebody come up in the gym there'd be like hey you want to play and you're like you know our own or with you guys are always the boys are a little bit or do you ever do that and this and and and get them\nEvery day pretty much everybody wants to play with me and try to be me but it also makes me mad is on that side of it like that\nGary ... you've been\nCoach basketball time you've been around this league in and other major leagues in the country we were talking a little bit earlier about the concept of position almost by asking\nHow is the game change but more importantly how's the game changing now that you see\nWell back when now for dinner plate the first big keep it in this is you know this is Cheryl\nMiller was the one the first started a six three they don't play five positions okay and I think everybody is wanting to be that type of player since they're tendencies had some of those players and obviously Connecticut his hair or trying to do is recruit versatility\nA kid that can play one two three you going to see her at the to guard position a lot this year because we brought in a junior college player who's pretty good very good defensively and that's going to put her and Leah Wilson mover slide down to the three ... her at the two I've got firepower\nTo my bike up for a lot of his own so we're going to see so position Lance basketball is is good for the game you're seeing it in the NBA the WMBA right now the skill level is very very good\nIt's not how many games or play and during the summer I think the tea chin is better now they still need to do more skilled work than drill work\nImprove that part of the game ending proved the basketball IQ on the back you\nAnd I get on my players a lot they need to be watching more on television to watch in some other stuff I'm watching them which stars all of that they need to be watching a lot of basketball on TV to get better\nAnd it's like if it's not basketball if not basketball you're watching what are you watching\nA lot of empire but I'm really a basketball than a big basketball fan but Fischer empire that's why go to show
