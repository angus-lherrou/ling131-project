so this is a finding that was just reported in nature medicine yes that that that's correct so maybe I can tell you a little bit of background on this so\nAbout four years ago that the Reggie accurate ten and I try to see how come I had 'em published a paper very interesting paper where they implanted patients at that time about four patients where\n... simulation below the level of the spinal cord injury could cause voluntary movement back in the lower extremities\nSorry epidural means ah above the Dora soda so then the jury is the outer coating around the spinal\nThat's correct yeah so this is technology that is essentially the same as what we use for our pain patients under the skin but outside of the spinal cord outside of the spinal cord but just outside of the covering up the spinal cord okay\nSo these are actually surgical implants and what's been demonstrated with these devices and pain patients\nIs that they can help with pain so this is already approved by the FDA for pain that what Dr ... and ... group did was to now apply this technology in spinal cord injury patients who've been paralyzed for example with a thoracic were\nUm child has level complete motor and censoring meaning they can't move their legs or sense there is no sensation\nSo when that paper came out that you can get movements we were very excited about it because this really changes our whole view of what we can do for our spinal cord injury patients\nSo we teamed up with Dr Reggie ... group and decided can we replicate those studies and so initially the all of this study which is male I ought to be approved investigation all of review board approved as well as the U.S FDA to do this study\nAnd so we've implanted now to patients under this study and this paper that has um ... being reported in nature medicine\nDemonstrates that indeed what was found was true but we actually went beyond that replication\nSo the replication portion of it we actually already published in male clinic proceedings last year and this was really exciting because our results come from the findings of that go to Susie ... and ...\nSo that was exciting the low we discovered is that we could actually go beyond that finding and in this paper what would demonstrate is that the patient it now is able to stand\nAnd take independence steps now he's still requires a Walker because he has no sensation still but he is strong enough now to to control his legs and make movements are stepping movements\nAt is an incredible story you know when the word gets out as an every paraplegic in the country going to want this well\nKnow this is still very early stage research like I said this is only one patient that we have reported in nature and medicine\nAnd so what I Would say is this one study really challenges what we used to think what is possible for treatment of patients with spinal cord injury\nBut you know as a neurosurgeon I often see these patients and emergency room after the trauma and you can imagine how devastating such an injury is but I think what our study shows is that there is this tremendous hope\nOh you're regaining function but you're not able to cure\nOr fix the fact that they are a\nParaplegic yes now what is really interesting about this study is that the patient is actually able to control his legs again\nWow and that's why this is such a powerful study and I believe why the reviewers and nature medicine which is one of the top journals in medicine I'm accepted this publication\nSo let me ask you if if someone comes into the emergency room and they have cut an or in the armor their leg we can show it back together and they get at least some return to function why is it that the spinal cord seemed to have no ability whatever to repair\nSo you know that's an excellent question and we believe the reason is because while the nerves those are peripheral nerves and we know that those pro foreigners can wreak world but the spinal cord is our central nervous system and unfortunately with central nervous system when that system is caught them those nerves to not ...\nWhat we believe in this case though is that the question then is how does the information from the brain that wants to move the leg\nRegained that function mhm we do not believe that the nurse has ... I Do we do not think that's how this works but rather that during the trauma there's probably enough connections that are not functioning enough\nBut that epidural stimulation allows the south that's dormant\nTo be able to once again we gain its ability to get the command from the brain\nIncredible ... you hope and suspect that some day people who are paraplegic or even quadrupled don't skip a paraplegic right now the lower extremities paralyzed will someday be able to walk\nThat's precisely what this patient did\nThat we have reported in um in nature medicine\nWhere his research headed you know I I think now this is opening up a whole new direction and research for spinal cord injury you know before\nThere's been tremendous amount of research effort and funding that went into trying to re grow those axons now what I think will happen is that the research will be and these type of new devices how do we now take this finding which used a device that wasn't even intended for this purpose\nNow all of the things that we have discovered in this study how then can we take that\nTake a step back and we engineer the device specifically for this purpose of ... animation in spinal cord injured patients because there have to be a different type of approval by the FDA for this absolutely and the\n... and that's why I think we are indeed very early infant stages of this technology\nIncredible story ... ... he is a neurosurgeon and director of Mayo collects neural engineering laboratory thanks so much for being with us thank you citing exciting stuff thanks a lot\nStill to come on male clinic radio will learn more about the spinal cord injury research from the rehabilitation point of view and later on in the program we'll hear about the important role

therapy itself wasn't cancer so we had the implant and we added the therapy and assimilation together and we got these miraculous results\nUm what goes on from here is a little tricky\nBecause number one like I said this is not the standard of care for someone who has a completely I'm a severe spinal cord injury so to be able to send this individual out to the clinic now without the standard of care will be tricky because our clinicians don't know how to manage to me later in conjunction with a therapy which we feel is really really valuable\nSo we're at the point with this trial where we're really trying to integrate the home exercise program by identifying activities have been really proven safe impossible for the individual to do on their own at home with some minimal assistive devices\nAnd then let them do that stuff at home on their own um and then and then it it's our job to figure out you know who is this appropriate when is it appropriate if it is appropriate and how to implement into standard of care\nHow many patients who have had to stimulate her do it are presently going through to therapy and ... what are the things that they're actually able to do that they couldn't do before\nSo we're on our second subject right now are patients so even wrote to 'em we have some research funding to hopefully continue into a new protocol that will be very similar but will allow us to enroll additional subjects [noise]\nUm right now the subject I'm the first subject is able to um [noise] you know stand alone for a long period of time he's able to um in wheelchair bound before yes um\nHe's able to walk 'em or independently step on a treadmill and also over ground with a Walker [noise] so\nYou know their weight on his legs but he's able to um as Meghan describe volition only move his legs when he wants so on command so that's really the exciting part is is where ... where we can go from here now to improve bladder and ball function for him\nWe've had some anecdotal improvements although um we didn't measured those things directly so I'm at this point um our next studies were going to do more um\nData collections which we hope will help inform whether there's actual return of of bowing bladder um but they do report I'm kind of a shorter\nBell on time so that's a good thing\nAnd we just don't have evidence yet you were working with a second patient is it's very similar to what the first patient was or a note to patients the same [laughter] you know ... or\nSo how do we go from one or two individuals to millions because we know there's a war between five and six million people out there who have spinal cord injuries maybe not complete but partial ... ... how do we where we go from here how can we get\nThis technology to marry for five million\nYeah [laughter] so I think Megan alluded to this earlier and we've probably both alluded to you know one thing we need is obviously\nTo gain additional research support money to do this work and to keep this team moving forward I think one of the other critical questions is you know which patients will respond to this therapy and which ones will not so can we come up with a way\nOf saying you know out of the millions of patience you know the these people will respond in these won't so that we don't try to deliver a therapy that's not going to be a successful\nFinally do you believe that some day paralysis won't be permanent for all patients\nWell we're definitely making a term because we used to just talk about how do we compensate for the deficits that are existing for this population and now we're talking about how to recover and how do we make narrow parts of the occur in the central nervous system so\nWe're definitely making a change in the progress of how we're managing and giving and spinal cord injuries but they're still a lot of work to be done\nFor you made so much progress sold so far and there's like citing technology and you both on such great work

of the things that I hear from our volunteers and interestingly enough we really don't have to recruit volunteers we have a really full pipeline view of a waiting list for our young volunteer program we do have a weightless but when I talk to other areas in Rochester they say how do you get people how do you get people\nAnd they asked me what my recruitment strategy has and I say well we don't I mean knock on wood we don't have a strong recruitment strategy because we just have so many people that want to be part of this culture and\nYou remember that were treated here or they were an

I Love today's topic is about taking control like polar disorder we got a special guest coming on with us Michael pitch he\nHas a book owning bipolar and that you know this book and it's just been released and it's something you definitely want to pick up owning bipolar it's great for the patients and families but it's also good for practitioners\nBut before I bring him on Larry I thought we talk a little bit amongst ourselves about our own experience with people with bipolar\nWell I've been pretty open about my upbringing and your suicide so high I mean it's a tragedy I I've had two friends whose children have taken their own lives there were ... adult children early twenties yeah\nMy both my parents had attempted suicide on multiple occasions so it was in and then it occurred to me as I was in my twenties and thirties am I going to get this semi depressed am I going to have bipolar\nI'm pretty sure my father was bipolar and I think that we we encounter certain people who had a gambling addiction to write he had a gambling addiction but he had a personality\nWhen I think the doctor comes on he'll talk about the mood swings so er visits a track he's in a good mood is gambling her by her dad or my dad but then when the losses come or he's broker he has to do something to get money\nAnd the anger and the behavior was pretty rough\nBut also I think in our daily lives we can ... there's probably people that that I've grown up with that were my childhood friends and they're my friends I Love them\nBut I've noticed some shifts as I've gotten older some negative attitudes and behaviors that I didn't notice when I was maybe a kid or ... or maybe you recognize it made any harder than they do to recognize how about yourself\nYou know I have a I have a family member with bipolar and then that this particular family member also struggled with alcohol addiction and she says that when he called a recovering alcoholic I don't want to call her on their recovering\nAnd um she would call me like in the middle of the night and go on these rants and I'd have to go to work the next day and so I had to you know it's tough because it was the ... block her number but then I always had in the back of my head what if something happens to her and I need to go there and I've lost her number\nSo I was always a I'm afraid to walk her number on now she's so much better she ... she's she's not drinking and and life is so much better than we have a really good relationship but it was really rocky\nFor a long time for the simple fact of life when you have a family member has bipolar disorder life is really hard for everyone in the family is not just that particular butter yeah it affects everybody and oh my gosh you know ramen king\nUm okay so if you don't know right in the ... should know and I'm going to have to make an action so Raymond king is one of these like over ... he's an MD he's a judge and now he's a\nUm or he was a judge has these attorneys an empty he's a movie producer renaissance man he's also like a magician like Oh yes well he like made its way through medical school by being a magician at the magic castle\nI don't know if you've been there and that's pretty cool place but anyway he did he produced this this show called dont event and it with a with a ... have you seen or love yes adjacent be is the writer of the show and he's also\nFurniture and cook the\nUpper Cumberland morning that to happen to morning\nTalk Ninety four point one [noise]\nWe'll come back to young they're young America dot com or called for for well one hundred\nWhat we want to first gave a shout out to all our affiliates coast to coast where I'm fifty nine stations around the country and it wasn't for our stations\nWe definitely wouldn't have a show so if you love listening to the seeing young show at your local station now to keep us on and that you love the show and if you want to come on and play medical mania trivia with us we love having our guest from all across the states come on and play with us the number is eight for for well one hundred [noise]\nGoing into the surgery for the secret of immortality probably first grass concept of time for the more hard\nThis is usually Dr Anderson's territory but I think about something a little interesting the way we aged perhaps the first thing to go is our vascular system and researchers\nOut of Georgia State university discovered why fasting is the best anti aging tool but it turns out that a compound\nV I D Roxy berate which is produced when we fast promote cell division I keep in mind that the lack of cell division\nIs what causes the aging process to start in to continue to basically you're not making a new cells the old ones are dying off but now that we know that this ...\nIs the link between vaccines cell division they can look at compounds that mimic it and now you know we know what that means right the pharmaceutical companies are gonna take it over and create something that's going to be like the fasting bill fasting without\nGoing through with us in it I don't always tell people people asked me do I felt so so yeah I go to sleep you know nine or ten in our past employer wake up in the morning me my breakfast right [laughter]\nSo we've got a great guess on with us Michael pitch he actually hold the master of science degree in clinical community psychology from California State University and he has a bachelor of science and psychology from Layla\nMarymount University and he's a great book owning bipolar how patients and families can take control of bipolar disorder and you know if you are a listener and you either have bipolar a family member of bipolar or maybe work with somebody bipolar oh my gosh this is the guy you want to talk to because he\nHas such great stuff in in a Michael thank you for coming on and and talking to us about your book owning bipolar\nSo much for\nIt and you're Thirty years you you know light done like marriage counseling and family therapy so why bipolar why did you pick this focus\nFor over Thirty years and during the course of a number of technical problem relationship issues for adults to go for whatever reason I started to\nGet patients from all these sort of a flood of people\nAround uh the concepts of bipolar disorder and provide the patients and families\nAre some good information and a good uh kinda formula to expect going forward for treatment but in particular I notice that with family members that might accompany patients particularly young patients are teenagers and so forth who came in ah their parents would often remark about how little\nInformation and support a was available for them at least what they could find locally and and maybe on line and a broader scale and\nAnd I mentioned this in owning bipolar in in the preface of the book there was one particular parent um who just made a very to me I'm studying sort of um a proclamation to me and and repeated that actually a couple of times of how little is available\nUm to somebody like herself are who\nAre searching for you know where does bipolar come from what\nCould a parents expect going forward for their children and for that matter spouses caregivers um family members of all kinds of expect and what to do with that individual as they go forward struggling with their disorder either in treatment or prior to treatment\nSo um it was something of a clarion call for me to adult further into the research can begin to come up with a concepts in ideas to help people specifically and not just the sort of a transitional a professional in their lives but really help them\nA Guided through that entire process and as I went through the research I found some what I found to be very interesting and and\nIn fact disturbing statistics about bipolar and that is that about two thirds of all people with bipolar disorder or misdiagnosed\nAnd among those about two thirds of that group the misdiagnosis group\nOf those people are usually diagnosed with major depression alone and not the kind of depression that we see and bipolar disorder and that's and that's a very important distinction that we can talk about if you'd like even a more to the point of people usually wait\nAn average about ten years before they're treated properly that is from the beginning of a their first symptoms of bipolar disorder to when they're treated properly for bipolar disorder they waited an average of nearly ... years and so you can imagine not only is\nMy years when he was running a red line and oftentimes they refuse treatment term\nThere's there's actually several reasons for that um when you talk about a refusing treatment I'm certainly\nDenial and fear of treatment when a bipolar diagnosis is um provided or at least suspected and um the idea is introduced to an individual we can expect that there is some element of denial not on like\nHow people with substance abuse disorders me at first denied that they have a problem it's very similar and bipolar disorder in that sense perhaps for slightly different reasons here and there but um it can look very similar to that so if you have any experience\nWith addiction recovery you probably know that that kind of looks like Michael ... a lot of fear attached to it as well\nAnd I also think that because bipolar disorder over the years has I'm frankly not been um a plot to a therapist like myself\nI'm that ... with respect to uh it's it's very unique kind of characteristics of what to look for diagnostic Leon how to treat it differently\nUm I think a lot of people\nEven when they're searching for answers searching\nMy Michael let me ask you a question because I find a lot of people throw the term around rather loosely that are going to do that don't even know like at the water cooler at work or someone gets out of a relationship or has a famous guy pull you sure that a lot and so\nSo so I think some people are probably labeled incorrectly where others might be labeled correctly but what is bipolar and we don't know what I Do\nBecause we I go to break I'm going to I Want to end on on that and I want you to to be ready to answer that when we come back\nI'm Michael I you know what is it and how do we know because I think that's real important but I got to let everybody know your Facebook as bipolar network and you also have a website bipolar network dot com all great stuff\nGot to give a shout out to our military we love you guys and gals thanks for listening we can see those downloads on the

say and because they were on the wrong combination of manager or whatever they go they go down the wrong road but it's it's kind of a trial and error with some patients wouldn't you say\nAbsolutely trial and error is is a big part of stabilization a few people will get it right the first time so to speak but very often it's a struggle and particularly when bipolar hasn't been identified and like you said they may receive a depressing alone\nWhich can induce mania and sometimes it is not always happy kind of made it very irritable a agitated and all too often when bipolar loved identified what happened and they get more of the depression medication because they are not getting\nAny better let me double it yeah and then and then we have real problems yeah and then you get the medic I'm Sorry go ahead\nI'll just say when we get the medications correct so sort of complete that phase and then you can move into the third and hopefully very large days which is close stabilization and that's really when you treat the whole person beyond the bipolar itself and and when to integrate the family work as well\nOne thing that ... that we found it you know executive medicine in Texas where people flying from all over the globe to see us where these half day physicals and sometimes we find people\nThat um it really they're doing a little bit better or somewhat better and they're

the thing that if they know they have the votes they want to go home\nYeah so they do it at ten thirty on friday if the culture road is ten thirty on friday right then thirty hours would be for thirty on Saturday afternoon and that's that's when they could and as you mentioned it's up actually the rule was up to thirty hours so if they ... they don't go thirty I don't go to ... you know they go

have no argument there making arguments yet but they're eat so\nNow mistakes happen in the justice system or we don't have we have the DNA technology now or that can prove that it wasn't a you know or their DNA at the scene or whatever it is\nBut you think about you know the\nThe label that goes with being falsely accused and there's a great burden that comes with that for a reason now sometimes it's that the work done in the investigation wasn't wasn't right sometimes it's an overzealous prosecutor on the ... in the legal setting looking to get a political win\nBut sometimes witnesses get it wrong well and and in one case in in the murder case it was it was a couple of jailhouse witnesses that helped to seal the deal\nAnd you you look at that and and you you think to yourself we often jump to that conclusion even in a legal setting\nPolitics can come in and if you've got an overzealous prosecutor that sits on getting their way of getting the when Duke lacrosse team yeah exactly you

Ford or to the FBI to have her therapy notes from two thousand twelve and\nNo no no no she didn't know she did she was telling you well she did and I mean not all of that is what she did not want back she was holding back the notes from that there is from the FBI\nNo no she was holding them back to the Senate not from\nThe offer her from the Senate yes at the same thing there's no difference\nNo no there's a big difference in other words the Senate is listed as part of the FBI it's a separate branch what are you talking about\nWell no you can give it to the Democrats then\nYou give it to the Democrats them and they and they present it and the people get to see it the FBI or what you forget about is the FBI is not investigating anything on the ground with all manner once in a criminal matter it was a background check they in fact what the FBI would do with it\nWould be put it into the three oh two right which then the Democrats and the Republicans would both have\nThat's how that works right that's the only role of the FBI in this entire equation I just to give the Senate the information you're making the FBI would then do an investigation on it no it would end up in the partisan body anyway that's in fact the only purpose the FBI served in this scenario\nIs to deliver that information to the White House in the Senate\nIf I mean she would officially be ... putting it into the three oh two had she'd done that during the process and the way I agreed to take it out of the way they they tried to put it in the process would chairman Grassley twice his call for it\nAnd uh it's a Feinstein of Feinstein would have gone right to the FBI at that point they could have done it that way she could have given it to the absolute didn't do go that way no so it's a useless conversation\nAnd and anyone and if if that that would if\nForwards if that's accurate the report that they tried to do that a and forge assuming Ford's lawyers were telling the truth again they're

communications with me and my staff member\nMy step in preparation for the September twenty seventh hearing the alleged witnesses identified by Dr Ford Leland Kaiser mark judge and Patrick Smith and a deadly re mirrors Julie sweat Nick or their representatives sincerely Chuck Grassley that letter said yesterday\nSo it was like I said in the last caller brought up Jewish she was willing to turn them over to the FBI\nAnd our and our point was ... when I'm when I said no it's like because our point is to go directly to the Senate to begin with yeah there is no investigation they wouldn't be in that they simply take it and give it to the Senate Judiciary committee\nKind of ended up in the report we wouldn't see it that the the only senators would set\nThe only the centers would see it and there for a goal is if she has this slam dunk evidence ... and she wants to people was that she wants to\nGive it to Grassley directly outside of the three oh two because then the other members of the committee including Dianne Feinstein would get it and immediately leak\nExactly or\nGenerating legally for [laughter] just released the entire riser the to the Washington Post and let them printed completely sure\nBecause they're not political [laughter]\nOkay but I I'm not really ... the Washington Post and the wall street\nJournal [noise] no I mean from you know from the west point of view and and that was the the point well no the senators or political the FBI is not well neither is the Washington Post according to the liberals\nAre and that ... let me see that ah when was that sense here in front of you were okay 'cause that letter must have been late last night to Shannon Bream a pulse uh ten forty seven PM and then I'd seen the um uh Mollie Hemingway the last paragraph sure is interesting\nAbout please let us know your please give to us you know what you've shared with Feinstein in her own oh\nWhoa mhm yeah\nBecause of uncovered evidence so what do they have right and what what is what is that um what is that one about so again I'm we're getting into stupid area again we're getting into areas\nYou know with the lawyers state and they're going to do something that doesn't even make any sense yeah yeah it's a demand that doesn't even\nA demand that within a demand that would ensure if you went through it that way that the no ... would never become public right you would never know what was in the ...\nThey would not because of the Senate rule see the light of day if you want this public there's plenty of ways to do that\nOr a chick six Ninety right on let's

there are currently welcome good morning thanks for being here well all I got to say is you don't need a soap opera anymore my here's news from the last hour first off a little background remember the boyfriend\nOf doctor for a deal the ex boyfriend of Dr Ford\nSaid that uh that uh she had coached\nA remember a a former uh uh FBI employee Monica McLean right that she had coached her to take a polygraph test and then Monica Monica McLean came out the other day and said no that never happened right\nAn update to that story this year just to from the last hour ah I Believe from the wall Street Journal\nOr the headline is a\nFriend of Dr Ford felt pressure to revisit statements at issue a statement to the committee that she knew nothing about the alleged sexual assault my bread cabin up\nA friend up Christine up for told FBI investigators said she felt pressured by Dr Ford's allies to revisit her initial statement\nThat she knew nothing about an alleged sexual assault by the by a teenager Brett Kavanaugh\nWhich she later updated just say she believed to but couldn't cooperate Dr reports accounting according to people with the ... with the uh the matter for a million with the matter\nLeland Kaiser who Dr Ford has said it was president at the gathering where she was allegedly assaulted in the Nineteen eighties told investigators that\nMonica McClain\nRetired Federal Bureau of investigation agent and a friend of ...\nFire her statement like I said who needs a soap opera right the other people said the statement to the FBI offers a glimpse into how Dr Ford's allies\nUh and friends\nI'm working behind the scenes to lobby old classmates to bolster their versions of the alleged incident as we're judge Kavanaugh's\nJudge Kavanaugh's who Supreme Court nomination be debated in the Senate on friday has denied the allegations of sexual misconduct so on Thursday day after sending or to the White House to report on its investigation and the alleged a allegations are against or the allegations against judge Kavanaugh\nThe FBI sent the White House and the Senate an additional package\nOf information that included a text messages from\nMs ... to ms Kaiser according to a person per ... with the matter so apparently they've updated it Mr Clinton's lord a set in a statement any notion or claimed that ms McLean pressured\nMe Lynn Kaiser to alter ms Kaiser's account of what she recalled concerning the alleged incident between Dr Ford\nAnd Brett Kavanaugh is absolutely false\nSo the plot thickens yeah interesting\nThat it was Wall Street journal just had that here in the last hour right there's\nThere's where we stand a and as we told you a earlier\nA center of veins from uh South Dakota will be there for the vote he called judge Kavanaugh onset I Will be there

know ... do the more professional eating and and uh they were in a conversation and it was a ... a black man who was a huge fan of my show now I sort of knew her politics were more of\nThe liberal bent but she went absolutely insane we know we haven't talked since that point and she completely rejected me as a friend because in a conversation a black man said he loved our show right think about that and that was really my first taste of that type of sanity\nBecause that ... that you referred to as you described it before I\nWent from zero to you know basically right or just just a small talk with you have good to see a a they were stopping by that kind of thing to all of a sudden over the top rage by with could not believe that somebody of color\nWould be listening to and more so be a fan\nOf the ... right and you remember when it happened and I like I've sort of like laugh you know it's like well I I Can't ... this was it was so bizarre and so insane but maybe that was the early warning system\nFor me it leads right on ... on on a personal Wilson first right on our understanding that that and and that's exactly what we're we're we're facing because the rage and bitterness I Believe is probably still there today in this person yeah I have I mean it's just I Can't imagine that kind of mindset I have\nFriends that I still love dearly that listen to our show and I've known them since grade school\nAnd we still connect on a few times a week on Facebook but we see each other on a regular basis and everything else we love each other we tease each other about the politics

Obama ... but the fact is he knew\nHe could reject Obama publicly yet but but then the ... I didn't ask core yeah doesn't care yeah Obama means nothing to know any\nNo no that's that's exactly what I'm what I'm getting too is that\nIt does nothing for them and it only irritates someone who might be in the middle and tied right I mean it's it only works against that middle which might get you over it actually is the only thing that in this case especially\nBut he knows by essentially denouncing and saying you know turning down the Obama endorsement that it does not hurt his base right they don't care right we don't ah because Obama\nYesterday's news well\nListen I mean I'm liar Lanny Davis remembers he was going to be the hero\nYou know so he was the hero of the ... the point is is not that Lanny Davis is is a rock Obama but the point is is that there is a new hero for different reasons every day on the left am I the way that he was going to be the demon tomorrow that's the way it works because you could be someone who is a fellow victim\nOf whatever right now but tomorrow you're going to be the oppressor there's the person standing next to you will have a new reason to victim and will need a new oppressor and it's going to be you\nHere's an here's but my my uh again I could be wrong but here's my here's my got\nThat liberal Democrats the ones that would vote for you know a better work here in the state of Texas I\nLook at I Can't believe we're gonna use the word they look at Obama and say he was a poster right he really said he was going to do all this stuff and he didn't do a damn thing right he just sat up there any like being president but he really didn't believe and didn't push the leftist causes\nThat we believed in that he went from God to\nLight to pose or in ten years\nOr by the beginning of his his uh inauguration to the end\nOf his term as president of the United states that is how the modern day liberal looks at him they look at him and they just say\nWow okay I'll do eat him anymore he's not to think about this is all Obama is not the president like Kim cause you and I talked about this and that you know by the by the time we got to the terms that Obama would be the leader we ... on sale predicted it but I thought there was a great chance that Obama\nBecause there was nobody else in Feinstein you know or or or ... she's getting old and you know Schumer is to New York and so it would still be Obama that would be the leader for a while of the Democrat Party he's nothing anymore\nNow going back to the the tragic night here in Dallas\nIn July or twenty sixteen when five police officers were killed by Michael Johnson and the hours that led up to that horrific night it was just a few a couple of hours before it started I was online uh I follow the local media on Facebook\nAnd one of the local TV stations was live Facebooking\nThe protestors because it was a protest march and was peaceful up until that point of course\nBut they were talking to the leaders of the protest associated with a there were a couple of different groups that were represented there are including black lives matter but the leaders of the protests the ones who are speaking\nThis was about six forty five PM in the ... that was the reason that the television station was life Facebooking this because they're broadcast the six PM broadcast news broadcast was over so they went to like Facebook\nSo I'm watching\nThe thing I remember the most is them saying what does Obama done for us to remember this was the beginning or yeah twenty six ten months before the twenty sixteen election July twenty sixteen\nWaters Hillary done for us nothing what did Obama do for us nothing and I thought to myself you know there because that was one of those\nAh cracks in the foundation if you will\nBefore that for me it was telling\nBecause you had young activists\nAnd the two that were speaking were African American\nWhat does Obama done for us was Hillary done for us the left or the Democrats the Democratic party thinking they're going to get the when you don't get the win just because they may agree with you at the moment\nThe protestors are carrying the party the party doesn't have direction because there's no one single cause no it's multi directional right and it and it it always will be that's why the party\nHas no direct lines out that's what you get with identity politics yeah because there is no there are still there and I edited there is there is no general issue or goal ... goals that they actually want because when you split everybody yes when you when you continue to expand your pie of victims and therefore expand your pie of oppressors\nYou end up never being able to as a party happy in a particular political goal this is probably the closest you'll get to a political goal which is to defeat Kavanaugh\nYes if the activists are are are going in multiple directions then then the party has led by them they're going you're trying to separate direction and they have no direction at all except for

the Democratic enthusiasm edge for the election has a ... and it was a ten points just a but in July ... and now it's down to two which is in the margin of error which means it's a dead heat\nYeah yeah I I think it's interesting because I've been questioning the methodology a and I mean just not that I doubt the methodology I'd just have some questions about the methodology and what's going on with the way the bud five thirty eight dot com is putting together they're basically a composition\nType poll based on all the polls ah in all the districts are for the house seats it's interesting to look at it but I'm not so sure that I buy that well as of right now it's roughly Seventy five percent chance that the Democrats take the house\nUm that may be the case I'm just asking about I have\nActual questions about the methodology and how they're applying it to this big scale I'm very smart people at five thirty eight dot com\nOr so but I Do wonder about again the polls they're using

international really\nWith the Democratic party lawyers to talk about allegations of Donald Trump Russia collusion just weeks before the twenty sixteen election and right before the bureau secured a search warrant targeting Trump's campaign ...\nFormer FBI general counsel James Baker met\nDuring the twenty sixteen season with at least one attorney for ... the Democratic National Committee private law firm\nThat's the term used by the DNC and Hillary Clinton's campaign to secretly pay the research firm fusion GPS who then paid the former British spy Christopher Steele to compile the dos Ga\nOf uncorroborated man whenever we talk about the left it's always on cooperating cooperated raw intelligence alleging Trump and Moscow where colluding to hijack the presidential election\nThe revelation was confirmed a bite testimony and other evidence secured by a joint investigation of Republicans on the house just jury and government oversight committee the sources told a John Solomon\nOr the other thing is the Baker was interviewed just yesterday by lawmakers behind closed doors Wednesday and sources declined to divulge the testimony other other than\nAbout the contact between ... law firm\nAnd the FBI the sources also said bakers interview broke new ground about the FBI's use of news media\nIn twenty sixteen and twenty Seventeen to further the Trump case and about deputy attorney general Rod Rosenstein ... conversations in spring of twenty Seventeen regarding possible use of the body while you're to record Trump\nThe interview was one of the most productive\nWe've had and it opened up many new investigative leads one source said\nAnother said Baker could not answer some questions the FBI about FBI media contacts citing ongoing investigation\nBy the Justice Department inspector general into alleged illegal leaks during and after the election about the Trump collusion probe and other matters these revelations illustrate\nA new how much the FBI and Justice Department has withheld from the public about their collaboration in collusion with clearly partisan elements of the Clinton campaign the DNC\nFusion GPS and steel that we're trying to defeat Trump and so that is you know breaking news because what you have there you have you have the first person from the last administration the Obama administration\nThat worked in the FBI you have them now on the record yeah according to John Solomon test define the tie in we were ... there's no reason\nIf you were investigating Donald Trump to be talking to the ... lawyers private lawyers\nJust before you got the secured Warren right Internet your investigation going on and he apparently that's what the sources say he said they talked to they talked to ... the lawyer specifically about the allegations of Trump and collusion why why would that be why would that be\nSo that she was breaking news other news and we'll talk more about that I'm sure in the upcoming days or they just want to get in Saudi Arabia has increased crude production significantly to an air record level amid intense pressure from US President Donald Trump to reduce prices this from Bloomberg now\n... largest producer is currently pumping about ten point seven million barrels a day the energy minister told reporters on Wednesday that's just shy of the record set\nIn November of twenty sixteen before the kingdom and allies including Russia agreed to cut production to boost prices were meeting every single demand for barrels he said we've increased production quite significantly we just have to be responsive to demand because some would say that the market is currently over supplied he said\nAre the key insights distance from Bloomberg their analysis Saudi Arabia appears to be borrowing again to pressure from Trump now we talked about this 'cause we got we we got a couple of messages when we said that the United states now we're not we now are the leading producer of oil\nIn the war yep we beat started we'd be that every other country and somebody called up and they said well banal ... prices aren't really really low\nBecause there are other factors involved and there's been a ... a there's a sanctions against a a a a you know Iran there has been a growing economy so prices haven't gone to record lows we didn't expect them to go to record lows the whole point is\nThat when you produce your own oil here and we become a record producer of oil that's money that stays here\nAnd and you look at the again the mass of wealth expansion that we're seeing you had the fed chairman making the comments that the economy the future right now looks very\nThat's almost unbelievably good\nAt some level as well that comes from an expansion as you look at the number one I'm On the GDP and you look at the growth and everything else what's always the the number one category leading its mining which includes drilling and that oil export exploration and energy exploration and and and production\nIs key you don't have to have you don't have to be working in the oil fields to benefit from that and that's the whole point\nUh we've been saying this for years that once we realized that the regulations only the regulations were holding us back\nThat we would start seeing a wealth expansion and I'm convinced that's exactly what will start seeing more and more\nThan I get I give credit here to President Trump yet where he communicated the message to Saudi Arabia ... excuse me\nWe're there for you right we're there for you all you know are we why are we funding your military were were there for you all the time mhm er and whoever thought that the United states would be the leading producer of oil and could convince and OPEC member Saudi Arabia OPEC member I deal pact member [laughter] very good deal back at\nThe OPEC member right Saudi Arabia\nTo produce more oil if you don't think look we've criticized Trump in in in in ways\nBut we talked about when he does extremely good things we've talked about the fact that no other\nThere was no other Democrat courses nor the Democrats there is no other Republican that could have gotten\nThe cut in taxes that he got especially the Twenty one percent corporate tax break Nolan he deserves full credit for that and he deserves full credit\nFor that right there now one other point I just wanted to make real quickly because we talked about the new NAFTA agreement ... I'm ... wild stops it to be called NAFTA you know the new trade agreement ... and we had said look and we said this a long time ago we said one of the reasons that we are concerned\n[laughter] and we're ... babies\nAre one of the original chair of the original ... [laughter] you know one of one of the reasons that we were concerned who said look\nEventually when disagreement comes out it's not really going to be different\nThan the agreement that that we have now mhm\nUh Greg ... who is leading economists for the wall Street Journal the exact same thing yet in the end the new U.S Mexico Canada agreement looks like\nA lot like the old NAFTA mhm\nOnly significant concession was on automobiles and parks rules requiring more production in North America highway higher wages for workers\nAnd potential terrorists if its exports to the U. S. exceed two point six million vehicles that even though there's a cap because her way below that now\nA yet these auto rules may have little practical significance\nThey talked to Jeff Schuster of a a A L L M C automotive\nSaid some lower priced models now assembled by Volkswagen miles to in a few other manufacturers in Mexico may no longer qualify for duty free entry but they're not going to shift to the U.S production they may simply pay the the two point five percent tariff and will hurt us consumers especially low income consumers in the United states\nAnd so we have said and they've said the cap on exports may discourage manufacturers from sending expanding capacity in Mexico but it won't affect current shipments\nA they basically said it's exactly the kind of thing that we did with South Korea\n... that we set these limits but we're not even reaching the limits were not close to them now and that goes to the limits now so it really doesn't make a difference but he said really there's not much difference in the old NAFTA as there is the new NAFTA and you build a name has been changed by it and as we subtle along are we there's been a lot of us\nYou know industry that has suffered because of this and you end up if you end up basically with the same deal\nOr things that you claim are great things that can't be enforced or as we say the things that hurt the economy and will hurt lower income people will then was it all worthwhile and the former saying just days\nBut they don't want they that they really do because that's not going to you know be the end all be all for them that's not really helping to the degree that sales would help\nEight six six Ninety red eye the Detroit power train offers a fish and sea through innovation Detroit's Brad Williamson has all the details\nA lot of people industry even doing down speeding for a while this was really our first entry into that arena if you will so we've combined uh DD Fifteen with a D T twelve automated transmission and a six by two ... and you can also get a six by four but really\nGood news talk Ninety four point one am sixteen hundred [noise]\nHe's CBS News on the hour sponsored by the recruiter\nTom tom Foley months of political bitterness and anger over Brett Kavanaugh's nomination ended Saturday Night with his swearing in as a justice of the Supreme Court replaced by more political bitterness and anger about a month ahead of mid term elections President Trump held a political rally in Kansas\nIn the past few weeks every American is now seen the profound stakes in the upcoming election you know saying we have been energized around\nThem across opposed to both the president and Kevin also they are to CBS News congressional correspondent Nancy courted\nProtestors on both sides to simply [noise]\nAnd half at all [noise]\nSergeant at arm's will restore order and the gallery\nOfficiated on this vote the eyes or fifty the Naser forty eight\nTo ... days after\nKavanaugh was hit with sexual misconduct allegations dating back to high school and college\nHaiti which is no stranger to major earthquakes was hit by another one Saturday Night\nEarlier reports indicate at least eleven faith ... some damage as the magnitude five point nine quake knocked down buildings in the north of that impoverished country this is half a world away the death toll is now more than sixteen hundred following a devastating quake and tsunami in Indonesia\nIn this country it has been three weeks since Hurricane Florence had about a thousand Carolina residents are still staying in shelters CBS News correspondent Jim Crow civil\nDozens of Hurricane Florence evacuations Sheila bounced from a shelter to shelter in South Carolina has become an extended family they've learned to lean on what another Amanda Reagan\nAlone in thinking very [noise] it in and help out the window and it felt like a monetary\nAn estimated one thousand to displaced people were made in shelters in the Carolinas more than three weeks after Hurricane Florence hit Jim ... news ...

of a long delayed delayed delight\nWith the outside hope of having either Kavanaugh himself or the president withdraw the nomination\nAnd that wasn't going to happen I mean the the the the louder the less got the the greater or I guess the stronger or the foot hold got by the president and of course the nominee himself\nThis was a tactic by the left to delayed this nothing more nothing less put this off and hope that you can\nUh appeal to\nEither one party or the other other along the way uh whether it's Grassley or flake or anybody\nThat will help you delayed even for it and that's over it

we talk about the process\nYou know it's it's telling that we're at this point and still at this point in fact heightened your you'll likely see the chaos heightened today and tomorrow\nUp until the main vote on so late Saturday or early Sunday Morning whenever it happens but we're at this point but it is all of this chaos before the actual vote and what is it that that matters it's only about the vote\nI mean this is further proof\nThat this was only about the delay delay it as long as you can in hopes\nAn outside hope I guess that Kavanaugh would pull his own confirmation and withdraw his own confirmation and or the president would do it um that wasn't going to happen or the one wants to let got loud that wasn't going to happen but this president and and\nAnd by the nominee himself but you look at this entire process and it has been distorted greatly\nThere is no guarantee here that the cabinet we will be confirmed with the actual legitimate process of all of this in place well you know when you when you hear Dershowitz or talk about you know McCarthyism ... and and what happened at that time when\nYou know you someone who accuse you of being a communist and so you'd get enraged and they say well sorry you don't have the temperament the allegation itself meant you were blacklisted right the the the fact that you lost it at anything was used an a you know against you\nAre and I thought there's which you know really when he said he said so you are but a director forty years and now you're losing control because somebody's calling you a combination of the temperament for the job so you're on your blacklisted from the the ... you know from the industry and it's something that liberals used to have in their mind and I think the important\nThing is and it's obvious because you and I have been having this discussion a back and forth because it is the left it is you know ... we call it the supposed to be anti fascist yet what\nAre they promote what is their actual mindset it's authoritarianism and its fascism it's a you must live the life that that that we that that we wish you to live\nAnd what you see here what you see here from the Democrats the mindset that they're promoting everybody that you see Michael Moore and Amy Schumer and whoever whatever Hollywood people are down there screaming and yelling about you know a Brett Brett Kavanaugh and believe\nThe accuser that the the the defendant\nHas no rights at all the defendant is automatically guilty that is the mindset of a fascist\nYes that's not the mindset of somebody who believes in the American constitution in the spirit of America and the spirit of due process in the spirit of the bill of rights of the United states it is the mindset of a fascist\nWell and and what we call somebody when we say they have the mindset of the fascist we back it up with specifics not just oh he talks mean therefore he's a fascist know whatever's exact words and what does he actually wish to implement when we talk about President Trump\nAnd you know they started on that uh and now they've\nMoved on and this is a very very important thing for people to understand and I think that's what this is what maybe you're not in the Republican Party it started with Trump and enough people hated Trump where it stuck for a while\nAnd then they decided to move on from Trump and they moved on to Kavanaugh and all of a sudden the realization as we've said all along it was a bogus argument completely bogus and allies against Trump to begin with but then they moved to somebody else\nWho more people look at and say when all this is somebody who really really like\nThis is somebody who we really would like in that position as much as we don't like Trump this was a great great great great pick and then you see the same tactics used against Trump that might've been okay for some people because they despise them so much somehow hit somebody they like and then they realize\nOh no if it can hit him than it can hit him oh my God they can come after me next thing go after anybody and that's what you learn with the fascists mindset they'll pick out an attractive target to get people you know motivated behind them even people of you know well of goodwill and all of a sudden those people have good will wake up\nAnd say and sometimes they wake up in a society and it's too late it's not too late here in the United states and it's not too late in this instance and it looks like that because people have fought back are you now have\nBut remember it only goes so far because people are good will buy into it at times yes because it fits their political narrative but it is the mind what you're seeing is the mindset of a fascist\nAnd the fascist in this case is not the Republicans it is the Democrats and it's not debatable\nWell I mean it's very simple when you look at the group that says they're anti fascist and their name in fact this condensed down to those condense from those two words\nThere the group that's willing to go out and hurt people use violence against people they disagree with\nPunish people for thought\nThey're the ones who are acting on it they're the ones in California who create laws that if you don't talk the way we want you to talk we can send you to jail in New York we can find your business to the extent that\nYou will be out of business\n\nTell me that's not fascist you you don't create the ours that somebody wishes you to create we will destroy your business you wear a hat\nYou go to a restaurant and try and have a peaceful dinner we will come on to that private property and we will shout you out\nYou think like us you behave like us you reject the bill of rights and if you don't we will destroy your life\n\nRepublicans are finally coming around and you're not even realizing oh my God\nThat's what that party has become and it's not the fringe this is the important thing that this is not the fringe this is the mainstream yeah this is the Senate Judiciary committee it's dumb mainstream power of the republic or some of the Democrat Party and\nYou have a Maxine Waters who doesn't get any grief from the left for saying this is what we need you to do this is what we want you to do go out and get in their face\nEvery chance you get and all of a sudden you've got pushed back yeah right\nBecause the average American will put up or for a while until all of a sudden it's like whoa okay the lines been crossed and I believe many people believe now that this line has been cross I Hope they do mhm let me put it this way I'm not going to make the prediction

old boring and often told his piece on me President Trump has previously boasted of taking advantage of tax laws without breaking them\nI have really ugly use those laws tax investigators in New York state are now reviewing the allegations Kenneth Greg CBS News\nNew York it's not a good time to answer the phones on Capitol Hill Haley bird at the Weekly Standard knows why Hillary joins me on the line Haley has been an onslaught of calls to Congress what's going on and just so busy or the phone lines\nSo a lot of officers keep track of how many calls they get a per week usually depending on the topics that Congress has addressing so in the Senate right now predictably you have a lot of calls to key senators about a judge cabinet and uh it's it's just a lot of activism going on that\nIt it's questionable how effective it is but my colleague Tony ... and I recently wrote a story about a transfer calling and patch through college which is another form of advocacy that different groups he is\n... it's it's widespread on Capitol Hill and so some of these are also coming through this week\nIs that a new tactic can you explain that\nSo it's not new it's been around for a few years but a few staffers told us\nOn calls in general have gone up since Trump was elected and had health care\nWhich was really a tense time on Capitol Hill with a lot of activism so a lot of these issues and ... that sort of advocacy has become more widespread staffers take issue with it because they say that it doesn't represent constituents fairly\nUh because you know basically advocacy groups are recruiting constituents and then passing them through to the Congress men if they agree with them on a subject\nCan you give me a sense of how inundated Congress is right now with these calls and do you have a an idea of how well they're keeping up\nSo it's sort of tough to say because a lot of this data is a public I've heard from some staffers that it's very similar to health care which was just a very hectic time it's but putting a number on it it's really difficult\nAnd usually it's I I assume low level staffers are taking these these phone calls at first\nSo these are like twenty two to twenty four year olds most of them who take these phone calls\nI'm which can be stressful for them because you know you have his in colleges office saying that a lot of their female staffers have been threatened with rape and things like that and in light of the Capitol hearing a lot of\nViolent threats do happen on these phone calls and the staffers or just have to keep up the professional demeanor um when when speaking to you\nThe colors are living in the state or not um because senators don't really take into account if it's an out of state color because they want to cater to the people who actually live where they represent\nWhat you're seeing a more organized attempt at a uh these day Lucy is of phone calls for sure and\nOne thing that we noticed in reporting this story is but it really happens for a lot of leash political issues like I said not neutrality\nUm appropriations bills where basically an organization will tell them telemarketer situation happened where they will call up the constituent and say hey how you feel about duck you think that these immigrants should stay here\nOr what do you think and then the person on the other end of the line will say something usually they're confused I'm at which point the telemarketer well past them through the to their member of Congress\nAnd confusion I Would say is one of the key give away its for congressional backwards here because the constituent on the other end of the wind doesn't really know what's happening a lot of the time\nAll they know that they were called the the conversation oftentimes goes a little bit like hello\nAnd and the staff are on the other side is high you've reached the ... the congressman's office um do you need anything\nAnd then the constituent says no you called me and so that sort of ... that sort of confusion really gives the way to staffers that this is not as authentic as it was like like the advocacy groups would like for them to think it is a other times you know the constituents actually just outright say\nYou know I was told to tell you that\nAnd I actually think that uh one one staffer told me that they had gotten a call one of these pass through calls where a constituent had been told to tell them to oppose tax cuts back in the winter\nUp in the constituents said you know they told me to tell you I don't like tax cuts but I you sort of like tax cut so there there is some room for error and these calls\nTrial by fire trial by phone from Capitol Hill Weekly Standard reporter hilly bird or we can Ron thanks Haley thank

it didn't it was garbled and just had five stars and it was garbled and you knew that that would say that's not really true anymore they're not people hired you just write reviews and they're getting very good at it\nBut there was a survey that found that about eight and ten people say that they read a fake review in the past year I'm an eighty four percent of them say hey I don't even know if I can always spot fake review so I just thought you know this is an opportunity to really dig into what is a research show and what experts say\nAbout spotting fake reviews for the first one which I'm not ... but I'm examined the timing of her views if you see a lot you're looking at a product Amazon wherever you're looking at it you see a lot of reviews pop in a short amount of time that can be a sign that those are fake reviewers\nUm that's because there are a lot of times there's a targeted campaign to add a bunch of new review that often happens in a short amount of time so if you see a whole bunch clustered together that can be fake I mean of course if they're if the product just launched and it was a Black Friday or Christmas or something like that that might be why there's a lot of the same time but again just be suspicious about that\nOr how about the uh ... this accusation or the investigation of Amazon during the ... there were payoffs right to delete bad reviews All right\nSo that they are investigating that were not entirely sure if that actually happened they are investigating that they were on that some of its employees mostly in China um we're taking bribes\nTo delete negative reviews and share sales data on banned band account there was a bunch of that now they're investigating it we don't know\nIf it's true or not but you know I mean ... immediately when I read that I thought wow there's a lot of the reviews who knows what's going on here but it's a problem because you were people rely on reviews to to you know what they buy and\nIf they're fake I mean you're you're ... you're not going to like when you end up with it when it ended up in your house\nWhile we're speaking with Katie Hill editor at ... dot com or talking about how to spot fake reviews online or in another way ... you said over use of the words are you and me and lots of verbs\nYeah this was a huge study coming out of Cornell that found um that online reviews that frequently use eye and me are more likely to be fake they don't exactly know why\nBut it could be because when people are lying they try to make themselves to sound more credible by using personal pronouns so they're saying I Need to make it seem like they're they're real person doing this\nUm and then they are they also found that ... use more verbs and then um it it the more verbs in truth tellers and to tell her use more nouns\nThat's a little bit harder I think to parse out but the guy in the me if you see a whole bunch of that that's a a little bit of a red flag\nOr what's the scene setting you gotta watch out for\nThis is another thing from the Cornell study okay so this one was looking at a hotel reviewed in particular but I think it probably applies to everything so truthful hotel reviews are more likely to use concrete word so they'll say something like bathroom check and\nYou know very concrete things that people who were lying to fake reviews they were more

Jeff Davidson I started rising above out of the life of our own son who has profound special needs\nUm we were had raised him for about\nEight years nine years and we started realizing how isolated and alone we felt especially as parents we felt like there were no other special needs families in the community\nAnd so we thought if we're feeling this way then there's got to be other families who are feeling that way as well so do the ... and five we started rising about just out of our own need and our own life and it just started growing\nFrom there and we started doing events that were geared specifically the meat the unique needs if a special needs family and so we reached families not only here in the upper Cumberland but actually now all around the world\nThrough our Oman

and we're great with that\nYou believe the mood was lawyer how quickly did you see while well\nActually it was our very first event we started in October and our very first big event that we hosted

such amazing works in the upper Cumberland Becky Davidson crispy you're part of the team that works there I'm interested in how you became a ministry\nVersus an organization or an association\nWell we started off again like I said with with doing a worship service for families and um we our hope the only way\nThat I could make it on this journey of being especially when his mom is because of my face\nAnd so that is why we're ministry because that's where our hope lies it's not in the Easter egg hunts that we do is not an he Rose Bowl that we did those are great things that we bring in but it's because of the hope that we have in Christ and so\nThat is why we're ministry rather than just an organization because everything we do stay safe we do fun things and we do um you know all these events but everything circles back to that because\nWe could do those events all day long but if people don't have that hope they're not going to make it they're ... they're going to don't they'll\nStumbled along on this journey bet because of my faith and that's how I'm able to make it you know I Am a mom and my son just turned Twenty one uh he has profound special needs requires twenty four seven care and a year and a half ago I lost my husband and so I've been doing this now as a solo parent for the last sixteen months\nAnd you know the only way that I'm able to stand your had this conversation with you right now is because of that they that I have so that's why we're we're ... that's why we're more than just an organization that we truly like we minister to the families that hope that we have found um because we couldn't be able to do this\nYou're ... and you you help me out so I'm a mom or dad and I've just found out that my son or daughter is on the autistic spectrum if are called rising above ministries what kind of things could you put there for me to help me\nWell I think the first thing we were just there to listen ... that's one of the things a lot of times you just need somebody to listen to you you need somebody to here if you want to tell their story and they want to feel like they are seen into the herd and so a lot of times I'll sit down with a new mom who's got a new diagnosis and I'll just listen and I'll let them cry\nAnd you know I always tell moms you know what it is okay to grieve\nBecause you are grieving the loss of what you thought your life was going to look like you know before my son was born my husband and I had these big dreams in these big decisions of what we thought that our life was going to look like and so when we started realizing has special needs those dreams have to die\nBut there were replaced with other dreams and things that were better than we could ever imagine but I've learned through my own grief that you know I don't want people coming up and just going oh it's going to be okay\nYou need to let people feel what they feel and you need to be there to walk with them through that great and so I think that's a lot of what we do\nGroups want help can new use if someone is listening and says I Want to help\n'em well volunteers are always now it\nAnd we have events throughout the year uh on our website there's a link where you can click on volunteer now and it will have whatever events we have coming up where um volunteer skin can sign up typically one of our volunteers to be at least twelve\n... and older and if they're over fourteen they can volunteer on their own if they're twelve to fourteen than they need to either be with the church group or a book club or a parent\nUm but there's so many ways that they can they can help 'em we need volunteers all the time [laughter] we could use volunteers on a daily basis in the office just helping out with day to day things and\nThings were going to be due\nFor day to day like right now we're getting ready for big vision bank quit Andre ... which is our biggest fundraiser of the year a way of volunteers come in and they help us to put the labels and the stamps on all of our invitations and get those out\nI'm getting ready for the decorating for the vision banquet serving at the bank quit\nI'm answering phones would be really nice um just helping with normal everyday stuff that we we would do in the office doing copies putting things together\nI'm cleaning it may not be helpful we're so busy all the time that sometimes just cleaning the office is is a trick 'em the events or is it the event is something working with our families with our kids we always do background checks that's just\nTo keep

founder and executive director apart like ministries\nI'm Wade Shepard Martin do teams deserve privacy sure they do do they you know and this is one of the greatest challenges that I think that most parents and teens are having right now because they're scared to death that their child is getting involved in something that's\nAnd I'm watching their history on on the computers there they they are just invading the privacy of kids and I and I think what's interesting to me is that\nYou know Janet I my wife dated since we were in the ninth grade my parents never listen to one of our phone calls they never read one letter that we wrote back and forth to each other\nAnd when you look at it now and now parents are scared to death and then somebody says will mark it wasn't like it used to be I I get it it it's not like it used to be\nBut what's happened is we are violating privacy we're treating Seventeen and Eighteen year old young men and young ladies like their little eleven and twelve year olds and I think it's something that we got to address and parents\nNeed to learn how to win privacy is is is is so important and\nAnd when it's may be even more important later on in life so we will talk about privacy and teens here today if you'd like to read more about this mark as a book called when your team struggling that touches on this and many other issues and jak that book out online at ...\nA few minutes mark we'll be joined in conversation with the young lady named page now pages parents\nDidn't monitor what was going on her life and that led to some issues hitter really did I learn about that as you talk with patriot just a few moments but let's talk about I've heard you talk about a concept called the privilege of privacy what what is the privilege of privacy at you know I've always said that a violation of policy means a violation of privacy\nAnd the challenges when you're trying to create an atmosphere at home of independence with your teens as they age and their blunders force you to treat them like a child and then you go back and invade their privacy is kind of like you find that your child is looking at things on the Internet they shouldn't be at age Seventeen\nSo we start treating them like they're eleven years old what happens is we keep them there so privacy is something that every teen needs or they will feel a lack of respect and an unwelcome invasion and who they are but\nTo him how much is given much is required now so we must help our teens develop what I'd call this privilege a privacy mom and dad\nYou need to earn the right to privacy and this is the message to your teens here it is\nShown me that I don't need to invade yours\nI mean it is their role to prove to me that I don't need to invade their privacy by assuring me that that you are doing things well that you're staying on top of things that you're not doing what\nBut you don't need to be doing and I don't need to invade privacy but it's not the role of mom and dad to figure it's the role of the child as they age to prove to you that you don't need to invade their privacy interest in her right\nOr like so many other issues this is so dependent on the age of the chain I mean we actually get treated twelve year old the way we treat an Eighteen year old that's right and you can't treat an Eighteen year old like a tree a twelve year old daughter\nAt twelve years old mom and dad should look at everything I'm Talking about phone and I mean everything they're involving an open book value life every piece of paper in between the mattresses hidden and draw whatever you look at every day and age Eighteen\nMom and dad look at nothing and so the goal here is to get to a point where you're not having to search your child's room and be an investigative report or\nThat's going to come back and report everybody at dinner how you're Eighteen year old that's almost ready to get married working go into the service the armed services or you know has violated the family policy so it's what we do between those two ages that we need to concern ourselves that's where you have ... and gradually let the rope out\nBut you but let's look at some of those healthy boundaries when your teen's or young I mean when they're younger parents need to know all the passwords if they have a a what I Would call a blind\nWhich was rough I remember in the hospital that's that's when it hit me how much my family is standing behind me right because I had just put my life on the line and\nI I Know moment you know I woke up and my entire family was standing at the foot of the bad at the hospital\nAnd that's where I knew that like things she needed to get better you know that I actually did have a support system and I did have people I could talk to but I realize still after that happened I didn't use my family to my benefit and I still shut them out even more which was a big regret definitely\nOkay when you think about that uh do you ever think about what caused you to respond to this guy like you did I mean ... or one did you begin to realize what this guy was really asking interview\nAfter everything had gone down why would look at you and say hey send me some explicit pictures of yourself you look at me right now and go this guy is so out of line\nBut there's some reason why you responded to him you know when you did and you didn't jump to that conclusion mhm ... what do you think was going on that was causing some of that\nI think I was pretty scared you know I to do to use a very big dude you know football I didn't know he was going to hurt me or anything but I just knew that if I had said no I like I felt like things are just going to get rough and I I yeah I didn't know that I'm ... yeah definitely but\nSince I just wanted affirmation and I wanted someone to make me feel like beautiful you know and told me I'm actually at Thirteen Thirteen Thirteen and it's what I was raised\nBruce all the time [laughter] but I Know I just go that's what amazes me it's almost like\nIt's not that texting and cell phones and all this stuff is so wrong it's just convenient and it's added a new dimension or a new layer to relationships that most people didn't even think about yeah think would be happening\nI'd ever rely ON Technology a lot when it comes to relationships with friends\nFamily yeah definitely so did you get your cell phone back immediately [laughter] [noise]\nNo I didn't I didn't on my cell phone for a while I found a lot of restrictions and aftermath stuff go on my cell phone you know because\nAfter that it everything down to the guy I was really depressed but I was really trying to rebel against their parents like I said because I don't blame them for it even though it was completely on me all my actions you know I expected them to know what was going on even though I didn't help them yeah and so I didn't have my cell phone for a while\nBut then all of us went down summer was about to come up you know in about a month or two yeah and so for most of the summer I really didn't have my cell phone I ended up going on a Spanish service trip to Peru and I really didn't have any technology down there you're not part of it didn't really work very well and that was nice I must admit you know\nIt was I was able to get my mind off of the\nTechnology and everything going on and all the drama that goes on all the time and yeah and I was just really busy that summer and so I had my phone I had access to it but I just I wasn't using it yeah okay so how long you been a hard line I've caught like I'm In for about four months in like three days\nTo inform on ... you know you haven't had a cell phone are you better off or worse off and I'm not an anti cell phone guy no would you are you better off or worse off\nYou know maybe the picture perfect answer would say I'm Better off but that is true I you know it was really tough for me to come to light a I felt really blindsided by 'cause\nI just I never thought my parents would have the guts I guess I can say to me away I Know you're you're always argue and I always tell them like you love me too much to send me away but I realize sending me away was out of love and I'm definitely better off because I've been able to work on myself without having the distractions of\nInstagram you know Facebook and Twitter text messaging you know social media and ... yeah yeah and it also on a different level it's helped me realize who my real friends are because since I'm level three I'm able to write my friends you know and\nTo have to decide and pick and choose who I'm writing and then he also writes me back make me realize like who has actually been there for me at home you know I was just friends with whoever wanted to be friends you know I was just looking for attention and affirmation and so\nIt's nice to not have my phone and be like wow this person's really behind me and also to have that kind of relationship with my family cool\nThat's cool yeah it's always interesting I think what most people end up at art lied saying is that the relationships they form have given them a taste of something that they long for in the days ahead yeah hey thanks for being a part of the program I think you know this has been enlightening to folks thank you so much\nAnd thank you nice to hear\nAnything responsible seen as a tough assignment never more so than when you're when fire to do it alone\nIf you have a heart for single moms and their kids weren't they send us too when you got a donation to this ministry viewer investment is channeled directly into providing resources support to join us in the ministry of compassion the one line to parenting today seems dot org and click on donate now\nParents when they got a worried she\nQuestions from parents coming up in a moment mark but can we talk about that conversation with page just now\nYeah you know it's it's interesting that that over and over I hear kids saying this all the time that that I really don't miss my phone and I I don't think that I or many people quite understand\nThe pressure that our kids are under to engage with one another and to maintain that contact in connection\nWith people because they're desperate to have those relationship needs met and so I think what happens in in the midst of where we feel like we need to violate privacy is Wendy immaturity of teens is coupled with\nA a longing to um make an impression or to appear different\nWith kids and a and peers that I think that's where we realize that the pressure is so funny you know for so many kids and and so I I even I I Want to understand that more I Do want to understand it more\nBut at the same time I feel sorry for kids who are consumed in um in almost defined by their phone have to manage their image all the time that's right and I mean the the challenge of that has got to be just absolutely amazing so I think sometimes they make stupid decisions in the process\nHere's a question from a parent my Seventeen year old is posting things on social media that I think might hurt her later in life like college admission or job opportunities but I also want to respect her decisions what do you recommend it for boundaries in this area\nBut it's it's time to have a good discussion it's not where you go I'm gonna ground you from your phone I'm gonna take it away flushed down the toilet I'm an ... it's not that that's what you do it a twelve year old then I'm joking about the toilet but [laughter]\nBut I sometimes and sometimes but I think the other part of it is it's Seventeen this is a young lady who's almost ... ... you know what I I'm not saying your pictures wrong I'm just saying that you may want to think through\nPosting that no mom remember this has got to be a mom saying this I think\nThe definition of modesty is a little bit different\nThese days and so they may not agree with you totally on on what to post and what not to post some of those things are just going to have to learn on their own but you want them to see the long term consequences I Do but but I also know that teens don't think long term in a whole lot of things\nAnd so at age Seventeen when they're they can be Seventeen and three hundred and sixty four days and tomorrow they can go get married\nWell I I've I've got to engage in a discussion rather than a lecture and instead of correcting them about things I just maybe need to make suggestions and engage I I Love it when she says but I also want to respect her decisions I think that's important\nHere's another parent our son is a lot more digitally savvy than his father and I are he seems to be able to work around every limitation we put on him how do we monitor teens online presence if he knows how to maneuver us that have returned\nWell and there's a lot of kids that do that they even do that with us in a in our school that we have the boarding school and and uh\nThey get around on those computers no matter what firewall we put up and it just means that they know a lot more and and I do so that means I Need to know a little bit more than them or I Need to trust my instinct and go okay when somebody's being deceitful\nThen I feel it and I know it and I can sit down with a child and say you know what I don't have any proof of this but I just have a feeling that you're going around some of the\nSome of the restrictions that we may have placed on you know if the child's twelve years old I take the computer away turn off the Internet turn off the electricity to your home I'm joking\nOn a couple of those but but the other part of it isn't but Seventeen or Eighteen then maybe it's it's for them to resolve and uh I don't have a whole lot of saying that right well\nYou can send your questions through through our website parenting today's teens dot org marks books\nThere's new content get your copy by calling her going online or number's eight six six seven

learning more about this and your sermon the real question of job thank you for sharing it with us You're welcome [noise]\nAnd if you'd like to listen again to today's program or readers share

say winning in chapter one he loses all his material wealth his servants are killed by invaders his livestock are killed by fire and it ...\nAll of his children that's one terrible horrible no good very bad day [noise]\nBut bad days like that never seemed to come by themselves and job's not winning streak is not over\nHere in chapter two he wakes up with every inch of his body covered and painful sores and we find him understandably just sitting in ashes scraping his skin with a piece of pottery\nHis wife swings by to tell him to quit with all the integrity already and just cursed God and die than his brain show up to tell him it must be his own fault\nYou would think this tale of catastrophe and suffering would resonate with people more\nIf we live long enough many of us experience some version of this where through no fault of our own we suffer enormous painful loss and like job it comes in waves\nThe economy tanks and we lose our jobs are home or business or maybe all three I loved ones are taken by disaster violence or disease\nAnd those stresses take their toll on both our emotional and physical health until we end up depressed and sitting in the ashes wondering if God either seas or cares\nBut despite all of those points of connection a lot of people avoid the book of job some forget that this is a story that begins with the Hebrew equivalent of once upon a time\n[noise] those readers take the literary device at the beginning literally and think God actually is awful enough to bargain with Satan and do all those horrible things to a job for the sake of some grand lesson\nNot my God they think and move on\nOthers have entered the story and are right there with job wondering what God is going to say to a blameless man who's been absolutely pummeled with disaster for no good reason\nOkay God save those readers why do the innocence suffer the weight we'd Jo Berg dozens of chapters and then are furious when God's finally appears in response to job's pain with pages and pages of\nI'm God and you're not\nThose readers frequently site this as one more example of why they believe the God of the Old Testament doesn't measure up to the God portrayed in the New Testament\nIt's true that the question weighing most heavily on job and his friends is the question almost all of us have why does a supposedly benevolent God let wonderful good people hit the skids why doesn't God's step in and protect the righteous from harm\nIf God doesn't do that then what's the point\nIt seems to us that life ought to work that way\nDo good receive God's protection do evil ... God's wrath\nAnd it seems that way too a lot of people in the Bible also including joke job's friends and king David who calls to God and so I'm twenty six vindicate meal lord for I have walked in my integrity and I have trusted in the lord without wavering\nBut if there's one thing that's playing in this life it's that for whatever reason life doesn't work that way it's not a quid pro quo system\nSigning up for the faith journey is not an insurance policy it's something else entirely and that's something else is sitting right before our eyes in St opening salvo in the story of job the following its from chapter one versus eight through eleven\nMy servant job there is no one like him on the earth uh blameless an upright man who fears God and turns away from evil\nThen Satan answered the lord\nAnd joked fear God for nothing have you not put a fence around him and his house and all that he has on every side you have bless the work of his hands and his possessions have increased in the land\nBut stretch out your hand now and touch all that he has and he will curse you to your face\nThe reason the book of Joe never answers the question about why good people suffer is because the point of the book is to move us away from that question and toward a more fruitful won\nThe fundamental question behind the book of job is not why do bad things happen to good people but rather why are good people good in the first place\nSatan is claiming that goodness and integrity and human beings are commodities that can be bought and sold he doesn't believe there is any inherent goodness and the human spirit people are simply trading a set of behaviors in return for their own well being\nIt's all pay to play the whole test of the book of job is Satan trying to prove that integrity and faith in God will vanish even from a totally blameless and faithful man once you take away the reward of a happy and healthy life\nWhether or not Satan is right is the fundamental question of the book\nJob's wife seems to agree with ... assessment of the human condition [noise] do you still persist in your integrity she asks as job sits in the ashes curse God and die after\nAll she may not be covered in stores but she's also endured the loss of all her material wealth and the loss of all her children that was enough suffering for her and now she's ready to be done with religion and integrity [noise] it was a system that ultimately failed her and she wants out\n[noise] job's friends have also bought into Satan model is they tried to convince him that his suffering as a result of some kind of failed payment he wasn't really blameless they claim if he looks back in his integrity checkbook and really digs into the numbers he'll find a mistake\nSomewhere he must've paid only a hundred dollars when that should've been a thousand or something like that because that's how the system works pay good deeds received blessings if there are no blessings it's because you didn't pay\nAnd even jokes question and hours of why do good people suffer is rooted in the same assumption about how the system should work we think are good people should not suffer\nA loving God should reward the righteous and punished wicked not just ultimately in that way too long arc of justice but in the here and now every minute every year every life because why be good if you still land on the trash heap of life\nWe're baffled by the problem and many abandon their face because of it\nThe book of job offers of forty two chapters smackdown of that entire premise good behavior is not a commodity to be traded for protection righteousness is not fire insurance the\nUniverse is not built on a pay to play foundation God through job wins the challenge Satan is proven wrong and his uh\nBase that God tells them job will need to pray for them if they are to have any hope of redemption we're left unsatisfied by the book of job only if we persist in asking the wrong question\nOnce we shift the question away from wide to good people suffer too why are good people good the lessons of the book become clear\nOn the one hand we learned that God's promise has never been that we get to avoid tragedy pain and suffering in our lives [noise] no matter how righteous we are we still have to walk through the valley of the shadow faith doesn't get us a ticket to some kind of a zip line high above the valley floor\nAnd in case that wasn't abundantly clear from stories like job\nChristians are told to follow Jesus specifically were told to take up a cross and follow Jesus were invited to become disciples of this endless blameless man who was mocked beaten abandoned by his closest friends and brutally executed in his prime\nWith suffering [noise]\nI think overshadow\nWhat's right

perhaps now he is living in eternity with the ... in versus thirty three three fifty\nWe see the crucifixion\nOf the savior\nNotice a number of things in fact I Want to point out I think in the section first of all the place for thirty three and one day had come to a place called ... that is to say please\n[noise] now they had a specific place in mind it was random it was an haphazard\nA specific place it's ... interesting in math to that Jesus said told the disciples and especially in John fourteen\nI go to prepare a place for you Jesus at a specific place in mind and he couldn't get

had tasted he would not drink\nI Want you to underscore in your mind that Jesus could have had a sedative that would've made this easier it was bad enough with a sedative\nBut Jesus is dying for me and he ... his entire death\nHere so I don't have the eternal way\nAnd have bore must than on that tree inverse thirty five they parted\nIn Joe's is and the mother of sympathies sun ...\nThey were

songs twenty\nTwo Eighteen or prophecies that were full field and the death of Christ ...\nBut then in the remainder of our time today I Want to ask an answer this question\nWhy\nWe ask that question a lot about things\nFly did Christ have to die\nAnd the third chapter of the book of Romans beginning inverse Twenty one\nPolicy it this way\nBut now the righteousness of God apart from below is revealed main witness by the law and the profits\nEven the righteousness of God through faith then Jesus Christ\nTo all and on hall who believe for the area is no difference for all sand and fall

knowledge of good and evil\nAnd yet Adam violated the law and God is said in the day you eat dying you will die\nAnd he did\nIn genesis three we have the record of that law was violated and violated law demands punishment\nGod through the death of Jesus extended Marcy demand while executing punishment for the violation of Islam\nAnd the second place Jesus said that ah to manifest the love of God to the world to God's\nSoul of the world that he gave his only got one son who so ever believes in him\nShould not perish but have everlasting life John three sixty God commended\nHis own love toward

of their salvation perfect through suffering the gospel\nThe great story of the death barrel resurrection appearances ascension incarnation of Jesus\nWill save man from seeing that's God's power because Jesus that but the only inducement to get me to leave see an end to serve God is the death of Christ\nAnd then Jesus had the debt because his blood was necessary\nTo save man and Matthew twenties\nThe ... of the cabinet which has shed for money on to the mission\nOf San ... the six chapter of the book of Romans explain how that is done we were redeem not what corrupt double seed from

preached in his ... Luke twenty four verse forty seven and that was done on Pentecostal backs to verse forty seven\nAnd then Jesus had a that his church might be established his church was established upon him as the head\nAnd that was the head of Asians one twenty two twenty three he loves the church and gave himself up for her if Asians five twenty three to twenty seven twenty nine and thirty two\nYou see ladies and gentlemen Christ died because he cares whether or not we perish Christ we might say was heavens volunteer to die\nSo we could be saved John tin Seventeen and Eighteen\nBut that death does us no good if we do not appropriate the benefits\nBy believing in Jesus as God son John eight twenty four repenting OB sins act Seventeen thirty confessing I believed Jesus Christ as the son of God actually thirty seven and being baptized\nOnto the sending away remission of mice in X. two thirty eight\nAnd then by living fight fully until my death or to the point I'm willing to die for him revelation chapter to\nHe didn't\nIn fact once finally alone Jesus spend concentrated time in prayer with is heavenly father now perhaps you're wondering well why does Jesus need the ... what does he need to pray for these hours on end I mean isn't this got incarnate\nBut friends Jesus need the praying because of Jesus is really a man fully a human indeed his full humanity was was necessary it was essential part of of his role as mediator between between God and the human race\nShe because we were alienated all the way back in the garden when Adam and Eve sin\nWe need to do between don't we we need\nSomeone who can represent us the God as well as represent God's us well do you know who said that someone is\nPaul tells us in his letters Timothy where he writes there is one guy and there is one mediator between God and man the man Christ Jesus\nNow his success in this crucial role dependent apart upon his nature and then as we can ... this morning in our in our corporate confession the apostles creed I Believe in Jesus Christ the only son of God our lord\nWe believe he's got don't way but that's not always we also believe he was conceived by the power of the Holy Spirit and the woman the Virgin Mary we believe he suffered under punches foul he died\nAnd he was buried we believe that he was authentically that he was genuinely human too\nBut to have an authentic human life crisis could not constantly drawn is divine power and prerogative\nCody so the lord ate food like fishing read when he was hungry when he got tired you know what he did he slapped then when he needed to commune with his father and heaven he prayed what did he prayed\nAbout you asked I can think of a couple of different areas just this one time first knowing the dangers of they faced useful to pray for the safety the security of his apostles that is heavenly father would keep them protected would be their sanctuary in the storm\nRemember something below even even when we follow God's commands were not promise freedom from adversity our way\n\nAfter all who send them out of Lincoln the first place it was Jesus was in it\nAnd now they're in the piece of the storm I\nDon't think for one second to Jesus didn't know exactly what they'd be facing\nThe wind and waves will be against them and he knew what\nSee my friends if we follow Jesus faithfully we need to be constantly on watch looking out for those trials and tribulations those troubles that are sure to come our way second Jesus would have prayed for the strength of\nWhat temptation you ask for a minute the moms desire to set them up immediately is king would have been would have been tempting wouldn't it\nAfter all\nHe would have had the crown well having to go through the cross\nRemember Christ was tempted in every way as we are yeah he was without sin\nAnd as we see here when he was tempted he prayed\nThat's a great for minor for us isn't it not only the necessity of prayer but one of the importance of our surroundings one we pray\nFor were called the pray at all times aren't we that's just part of how this is our lives is supposed to work as we were in Christ but if the Lord Jesus himself sought out private times quiet times\nPlaces of solitude too to commune with God how much more than a week after\nAll we live in a day and age of easy distractions don't we they're not many many people out there without a cell phone in your pocket right now\nSo you have tax in emails\nAnd twitters and all those other things I Know nothing about\n\nAlways they're always on never alone never quiet for a second\nSaints we need to pursue solitude intentionally we need to seek out times of quiet and peace\nWhat does that look like I don't know for you that's something you're going to have to figure out on your own I Know what it looks like for me it was like hiking in the woods\nWith my phone at home\nWe all need situations where we can be still and know that Jesus as God so that we can pray with undivided hearts and minds summit God give us the strength to make time alone with him each day a priority\nWell having told us how the lord came to be alone mass email records the way in which Jesus surprises the apostles so we leave the mountain where he's praying and now our attention has drawn to the boat where the cycles are floundering\nThey've been battered by the wind in the waves are craft is driven far off course they've been pushed three or four miles in the wrong direction out into the center of like a church you gotta love these guys don't you\nThey're doing their very best to be obedient Jesus ... upon them we're going to burn them\nAnd they've been doing this for hours on end every time the wind\nPushes them sideways they turn that that bowl back to the back to the west\n\nFor by the time to lower finished printing it was late at night in fact it was during the fourth watch\nForce watches somewhere between three and six am believe it's mark who tells us it was closer to dawn than three am so these guys have been out there pulling on those orders\nFor twelve hours and they have gone for miles in the wrong direction\nCan you imagine their anxiety fear these are\nBut this is a storm that they can't do anything when they're fearful they're anxious how about exhausted anybody ever\nIt's a win for twelve hours\n\nSo Matthew now tells us how Jesus cross the distance for miles across the water and he merely records the event doesn't he he came to them walking on the sea I Love Matthews account for this reason there's no hoopla there is no drama\nThere's no attempt to hide that says there he's not trying to hide the miracle he just tells us that Jesus put one foot in front of the other and he walked across the sea\nYes instead of sailing or walking around the lake as you could have done Jesus shows that he has got in the flesh by walking out to the location where the twelve are battling against the wind in the waves and don't miss the fact he made them wait\n...\nHours up to twelve of them before he comes to them church that's a part of the lesson we've got to take away from this you know what if we never faced any storms in our lives then we'll never understand the power that we have in Christ will we\n\nYou know it's I'm absolutely convinced that if we we never really comprehend guys actions on our behalf until we come to the end of our own rope\nAnd see what we got left what do you think Marion Marcia had to wait for days until Jesus came after all as there is a dime\nThey waited for days because it had to be absolutely a parent's every one\nNo one Lazarus walked out of that too\nThat was something I might have got it done he wasn't just in the swoon passed out of the cool to tone come doing self later he was really truly fully dead\nSo sure Jesus could have ... the storm from the top of the mountain couldn't he he had that authority he could be made sure the storm ever happened to the scientists wouldn't have known beyond a shadow\nWho he was if he had one day\n\nAnd our lord knew what these men needed to learn\n\nJustice he knows what we need to learn today you see are save your nose us knows what we need to grow even as he knew the twelve\nGod there's nothing missing if you put this on you will be fully equipped to stand doing yourself a little exercise and just look at that Bible passages and see how many times the word stand comes up in the Bible passage uh I think I\nCounted six I think there may be even seven in there\nAnd remember that this armor is defensive most armor is defensive the shield the Roman shield and we're going to talk about the different kinds of shields in a minute or the Roman shield and the the Roman shorts or the ... was really more of a defensive weapon you could hide behind the shield and then sort of\nUh get the opponent to where you can be and then then stick them with the short sword a it's a different than the long broad sword that would be used to like nights and the medieval times okay so very different so this armor is defensive primarily\nAnd it is I'm given to you that you may be able to withstand uh you can still a underline that stand if if it's withstand underline that one that you may be able to withstand the schemes\nSchemes of the devil what are the schemes of the devil this scheme\nThat word schemes only used twice in the entire testament us used here and she's back in chapter four of the Asians and um it it gets used to talk about to a couple of different things\nUm interestingly this word gets used outside the Bible in Greek a literature to talk about processes to do something intently a building a permit would a process\nWould be kind of a scheme in that sense there's an element of bureaucracy to this word now are\nAll the ladies who just read screw tape letters\nUh I I think that that word scheme and devil and bureaucracy sort of go together because\nUh in that book Lewis sort of describes a this bureaucracy that screw tape and his protege worm order operating in rice a and a and it's a ... that is kind of a obviously it's a ... either daredevils junior devils and senior devils\nBut it's the kind of bureaucracy that we hate\nOr in one passage a worm a screw tapes to worm would um know worm\nWas the senior devil sorry screw tapes the younger level I says to the to his protege says either\nEither eat or be food\nLike characteristic of the bureaucracy that it was sort of gobbled up whatever comes\nIn contact with and so that's what's going on here the the devil has schemes\nThey are bureaucratic plotting things that continue on day after day every day that sort of a a a continue on against us in every way in shape and form in Lewis did this on purpose east in the preface\nOr to his book he wrote my symbol for hell if something like the bureaucracy of a police state or the offices of a thoroughly nasty business concern\n[noise]\nSo you get this idea that is the devil sort of just in cahoots with you know serious planning or something along those lines um but um so the so there's that\nElement to it that the devils is not coming up with something off the top of his head he's working very hard day after day or to try to keep these things going now I I Know that even the mission of the devil with some people it's kind of like oh well you know and I and\nI and I realize that that they mentioned the devil for a lot of people is to mention something that I'm a is falling out of favor and a lot of ways\nOf the idea of a devil or we perhaps don't need but um I Would agree with the characterization that we need to abandon the image of a a person in red tied to the pitch fork that's probably the person that you need to get out of your mind I mean that's a\nThat's a cartoon um that's a a gross characterization I think what we probably need to do is go back to what Paul says ah and talk about diabolical heavenly powers of\nEvil that is you know there is this this opposition to God that the devil seats in a has fostered from\nAlmost the very beginning he's created being a he subject to God as well but he he is set against us and he is set\nFor our destruction um and So Paul is talking about something that's very real he's talking about a spiritual forces that are arrayed against us and he's not telling us this uh I think another way people I think tried to use the\nDevil is a kind of as a boogie man and I don't think pose using the devil is a boogie man here I think he's telling us about the devil and the spiritual forces that are raised against us in order to equip bus in order to inform to let us know what we're really standing up against a\nI I Hope that if you've been someone who is a maybe set aside the devil for a while that you will you will come back and re investigate that idea\nBecause I I think it's very real and I think what Paul is trying to tell us is very real but remember the polls again not telling us this to try to scare us he's trying to tell us just to warn us to make us aware or because the devil has been conquered that is what the resurrection is all about when Jesus died on the cross\nA the devils power was was a fully forwarded was fully a conquered\nAnd so uh we stand already in the victory of Jesus um that opening up the opening lines with a great Easter him the strike is or the battle done now\nIs the victors triumph one right and that's why we sing the Allah Louis are so many times\nIn that Easter him or so the devil Israel don't be afraid of them but we do need to be equipped to stand against him to stand firm against him and so I think it would be helpful to sort of look at all the elements of the armor of God now again I've I've made a handout for the armor\nLooks you can pick up thank you you can pick up a handout that looks just like this is your station all the way out it's got a description of of all the pieces of Romans Romans voters armor was in prison when he wrote this and most scholars are ready to say that Paul was sort of inspired by this\nRiff I guess on Roman armor or and and and and this metaphorical placing the things that we're going to talk about based on this and um I'll make sure that they they definitely have kids in second service get this are so that they can even color on it while I'm Talking about it but it talks about all the pieces of the Roman armor and that's kind of what we're going to do a little bit right now\nI'm having fashioned on the ... the the belt of truth\nNow if you're if you're me and you pay attention to language a little bit you go what's all what's with this uh if you're going to put on the arm or a God why is all this having fashioned on the belt of truth it sounds like you've already done it a and I think that that's actually another one of the reasons why Paul is telling us that this has already been done for us\nUh in in baptism um ah the belt was something that most everybody wore normally or you wear a belt maybe a rope belt or a little bit of a leather belt or something along those lines and if you remember back\nIn the Old Testament the Israelites were supposed to eat the Passover with their skirt sort of tucked up in the belt and ready to go and staff in their hand\nOr that sort of thing So Paul is using sort of that kind of language harkening back to the Old Testament at the same time it's talking about the Roman soldiers uniform\nAnd apparently this bill that the Romans soldiers would wear\nWas something that was distinctively a that was something that would that would mark them out as distinctively Roman soldiers um they would even where it when they weren't in full\nA battle a dress they when they weren't wearing their full armor they would wear the belt to sort of mark them as as Roman or as Roman soldiers when they were out you know at the market or or doing whatever else they were doing when they were on a leave\nA ... and Paul Paul identifies this built with truth now you may think this is a little bit of a leap but I don't think it is Jesus we know identifies himself as a way the truth in life\nAnd I think that in some ways that this is our first indication that what Paul was trying to tell us is this armor is not just any old armor this armor that each of us has been given is actually Christ's armor it's given to us to be worn by him\nAnd if we if we if that's the case\nThen we know that the armor of heroes the armor of great warriors\nAre was kind of at least a in the mind was imbued with sort of the special power of that warrior if you go back to to Greek epics like I'm a Jackson a kill ease and\nUh you you get those kinds of folks are when they're armor or when they if they fell in battle their armor was taken away from them and that would be the trophy or for for the um for the person that conquered them well in this case Jesus war that armor a truth and righteousness and peace and all those kinds of things will get to them\nBut Jesus we're all this armor or but he was the Victor and now he gives you this armored aware and the first piece that you get is the belt of truth\nPassage as sort of a great celebratory\nA fight song kind of speech okay because I think that that's really what it is but already what you've begun to do is you begin to train with the word of God do you begin to understand how it gets used because when you read something and when you read it again and you begin to understand it and they begin to know how it's being\nUsed it has an effect on you and it becomes an extension of who you are um we\nHave all these organic metaphor we use all these agricultural metaphors that we use all shifted the metaphor a little bit and uh and turn this into\nA a kind of a a military a kind of um of speech\nBut that works too and Luther picks up on and he says Paul here acts like a pie and true field marshal who gives a battlefield speech to his people who are arranged in battle formation any encourages them to stand fast and to defend themselves\nBoldly confidently and that's really what Paul's doing here\nAs he wraps this word to the Asians wraps up this word for us he's encouraging us to stand fast to not be afraid to go full well who our enemy is yes but to be equipped with the victory that crisis already one for us and we're like armor\nAnd use it like the defensive and offensive weapons they are\nMay God's strengthen you got encourage you gotta quip you with everything that you need to stand firm in the faith in the name of Jesus I'm In the lord bless you and keep learning ... shine\nUpon you and just you just countenance upon you give you peace\nThey had been the weekly worship service I haven't rehearsed Lutheran Church seven Seventy seven south ... in Cookeville worship with the

six o'clock so please be here for that or um that's normally scheduled PM service I'm with a bonus what we call that\nSo we were um as we move into the final day we\nWho want to talk just one more thing about prayer and and and James for aids is drawing near to God and he'll draw on there to you\nAnd so how do we draw near to God\nHow do we build that relationship with God it's the same way that you would build a relationship with each other with your spouse your boyfriend girlfriend friends um anyone else you have communication you had the prayer um with job you have communication with your friends up\nGot expects the same type of relationship with him and the thing is he's God and to move forward in your life\nYour alignment with God determines your assignment for God and so it's important for us to get to know how to do this so how do we do this\nHow do we really begin to communicate how do we pray man so I I was asking the lord that as we started to dig into this and uh and he says already told you had a parade in St Matthew ...\nI was like oh man so I guess the Lord's Prayer and I got to be honest I'm I wasn't real thrilled about it I said you know what lord everybody knows the Lord's Prayer we've heard it a million times we probably said it a thousand in our lifetime um\nWe already know it and the ... was quick to convict and he says you know the words\nBut you haven't heard what I'm saying\nSo are really begin to question do I did I I've never broken his thing down I've just said it because everybody else as a matter of fact once you say it with me\nMatthew chapter six versus non two Thirteen Jesus said first you had to get away from everybody get alone is not about praying out in front of other people to yourself being sick replace 'em\nAnd say this prayer once you say with me please our father who art in heaven hallowed be thy name that kingdom come that will be done on earth as it is in heaven and give us this day our daily bread and forgive us our debts as we forgive our debtors\nElite is not in the ... for some evil [laughter] feed them and the power and the glory forever aim in so right there at the latest today should almost every rock and found that myself\nBecause that's made that so many ... many times that said that during the ... and then I hit me now I'm up here and I probably shouldn't do that\n[laughter] [laughter] so it really didn't want to manage their own there's so much um so it got started to deal with me on breaking this down this and you can\nCome up here for just a second\n[noise] so we started out with our father remember\nOur father\nAnd instantly the lord quicken me\nIf I come on ... pass two words\nAre fall he could use any phrase but he didn't\nSee because like most of you my view of God was based on my view of my father\nIt was it wasn't this\nThis is what got news for\nI didn't have a great relationship with my father my father was about rules my father was a hard man\nEnded up a good man but growing up was a hard man it was about rules and you just had to do everything right you've felt as a child I had to do everything right to please him and that's how my view of God was and that's how a lot of years is will\nWe've you've got is when we say our father do we mean our father because our fathers not looking for rules and hammering down on you he's looking for daddy\nHe's looking for dad not not our father when Jesus use that as an example\nUm he knew the relationship that he had with his father and in those days the ... the the young men grew up in the fields with their father they saw how their father worked in the field they saw how they handle situations how they dealt with\nOther people how they treated um other people so they learn these things and they had a relationship with their father because it was every day now my daughter here\nI Love my daughter\nNot because she does everything I told her to do 'cause lord knows she don't [noise]\n\nBut I Love her\nBecause I'm a dad I Love her that she calls me\nI Love her I Love it when she just touched me how the blue um or wants to just go have lunch or wants to build a relationship\nWith me as an adult 'cause you know they have five million things going on in their life and now I'm a new one um so I Love the fact that he said father and is not based on my relationship with my father he wants to know you want you to know that is when you say our fathers it's this\nIt's this [noise]\nHow're you doing with this think of any\n\nHow're you doing where your relationship with father with daddy you really call him\nDaddy with all the motions and everything that you have in your you really face in it as our father when you say listen he's all kinds of emotions he put them in you were made in his image he wants to laugh he wants to cut up and look if you're in a Walmart at two o'clock in the morning you know he wants to laugh [noise]\n\nOur father who art in heaven you know oftentimes\nI say that prayer and I say art in heaven we look at 'em in the sun will be so real today I Hope you still love me afterwards okay because then this prayer when I say my father who art in heaven literally my there have been so many times\nForgive ads I forgive the same way if I don't forgive somebody for offended me whatever you do or don't forgive me\nBut as I Do I think you that you're going to forgive me\n\nSome of us think we have a right to be made\nPreachy you don't know what they said to me you don't know what they did to me I'm going to tell you that all his though don't matter to gone when you pray that prayer you won't get forgiveness just as you're given\nJesus didn't deserve any any of the stuff that he yeah but he took it and ... and John ... Thirteen thirty four says a new command when given to you that you love one another as I have loved you love one another [noise]\n\nLatest on into temptation for I can find it myself [noise]\n\nBut the liver us from evil [noise]\n\nSo this land was trying to ah just drive to ten year old son [noise] who's getting in trouble getting a lot of trouble and he's he says he said son he said it wasn't getting anywhere in the conversation so he wants he says I'm just going to draw this out almost want to draw this out for you some\n[noise]\nHere's you you're doing great everything's going great and then you get to a point in your life where you need to make a decision am I going to do the right thing or I'm going to do the wrong thing and then there's ten year old mining showing them here\nBut for some reason you just make a left her and just keep going right down that path so the ten year old boy who probably grow up to be a lawyer says well dad you're partly right\nHe said but it's more like this [noise]\nSee I can be going along really well and then when I get to a point in my life where I've got to make a decision\nIt's always easier to go downhill\nThis good ways hard\nThis is easy way\nHow many times in your life and how many times in my life and we go into a face situation and we just take the wrong way just because it's easy [noise]\n\n[noise] it's always hard to go up who and once you get down here\nEven if you want to do right you realize that you're going to have to go all are back up here and then all the way back up here\nIs just too hard\nBack east you have to wonder it's Twenty one says she ... she will bear a son and you show called his name Jesus for he was famous people from their sins\nSo many times so many people say the word Jesus and don't even realize it means save save your\nThe beauty of this is he didn't just come to forgive you up here since he does that they're still consequences so you're saying\nHe also delivers you from that\nBut the thing is he doesn't doesn't just come to forgive you of those scenes the bottle says he comes to save you\nFrom those sins so as we make that left turn and we were struggling with this new or forgives he saves us from it it means he just reaching out and he's pulling us up out of this mess like we we don't have to deal with 'em there might be consequences but as far as the salvation he just he just coming to forgive and say hey it's over with\n[noise]\nSo when you get to hear and you come in here and you're gonna make a decision it starts out so small your decision making starts out so small so we're here we ask you one degree off track just a little\nHead a little bit further there were two degrees\nOff track and so you don't realize how big a thing it is before you know it you're ten degrees off track your ten degrees is chaos in your life but she wasn't planning on that but at this decision it was just a couple of beers\nBefore it got to hear it was just one website\nThis proud to hear\nRight here I was just a little bit upset with them but I'll get over it\n[noise] and before no we're stuck down in the bottom\n[noise]\nSo when we say this prayer pan\nYou say I'm angry\nYou are today you are you angry um are you angry at you still angry at your father so you can't look\n\n\nI've been so unholy and my wife\nAnd I can't even say the word how it would be that name in Maine and\nI've been so selfish that I Can't say that I came to him come\nWe can't make this about him I'm so greedy I Can't imagine being happy with just enough\n\nIt's not enough to forgive your enemy how do I love um here's the beauty of it\n... if you will come on\nYou know when you're I'm\nWith a computer in their history button you click on the history and there's a button at the top that says delete all\nYou know the but I'm Talking about\nSome of us do that but a little too will\nSome of us have been in some places\nSome of us would love to hide the past where are you being someone who's the loved to hide the history the beauty of it is\nJesus is the one with his hand on the delete all button\n\nAnd all it takes\nIs the push the button to completely delete\nEverything's you've been through so that you can actually pray the Lord's Prayer in Minot [noise]\nNot repeated yes but I mean it [noise]\n\nSo do you not only save you from that he not only deletes the history but he says you know I'm going to put my spirit in you and then my spirit is strong enough to get you here and all the way to hear\nIf you'll accept it\nYou might be here today and you said that prayer\nFive times ten pounds a hundred times thousand times I grew up in church I had a drug problem my mama drove me to church every time the door was open\n\nThank God he did but I'm telling you have said this prayer\nA lot\nWas forty four years old\nWhen I could say it\n\nStaying with me [noise]\nSo my challenge to you is this we all said that prayer when we first started could you say the prayer and maintenance for one\nIf you're here today and you look back many you just made you anything you would love to have Jesus just hit the delete all button and fill you with the spirit to take you from where you are right now to where he would have you to be\n[noise]\nThere are a lot of people make the same decision\nIf you're here today and you not acceptable or did you say we'll let me let me first do this if you are here today and you have accepted the lord is your saver in planning to put his spirit and you to take you to where you need to be bought round of applause how many of you have accepted Christ as your savior [noise]\n\nSee right now if you're not that that that would like to just excluded you can make you feel like you're the only person in the world every person in here has the story and it's just like yours and you're not going to know how much of that will try to tell you\n[noise] [noise] [noise] [noise]\n\n[noise]\n[noise]

feeling of accomplishment\n\nThat wouldn't be James and view of good\nWisdom well on the other hand\nWisdom can be used for evil purposes number of years ago\nI worked in the job or one of my responsibility as was the investigation of fraud\nOne of the fraud I became aware of concern to the young man who is really pretty smart\nAt some good was at the\nTime he worked as a computer programmer for a very large banks in New\nYork and he made a simple or something\nI think he assumed that the average person would not be able to compete with accurately how the monthly service charge on his monthly statement was computer\n\nHe also made me if someone can the large corporations did not fought a service charges or even if they did if they came within a\n... percent or to be close enough and they let it go\n\nWell it was at that time some of you may remember service charges are computer based on average monthly balance was and the volume of different kinds of transactions are floating through the bank account\nWell this creative program or just happened to be the programmer who was responsible for calculating service charges on a monthly payments\n\nSo he had it in a little routine into his program that added two percent of the amount of the service charge in addition on everybody's bank statements and then he transferred the collective the mountains in his personal accounts southern at the end of the day everything balanced out\n\nProgram work perfectly for months and that's the charges were accredited to his ... he wrote a check and transferred to an accountant another bank even if he was discover it\nThe money had going\nPlenty of time for him to make sure the Cape and take his money when well eventually his team was uncovered but in a very good fuel you're on the\nWay the vice president of marketing for this bank\nWas thinking of doing some really creative things with the service charge in order to attract new customers\nSo he decided to try to calculate the service charges on his own personal safety just for the fun of it\nWill result he kept getting robbers within a couple of percentage points\nOf what he thought they should be\nFrustrated\nHe decided to call a programmer and find out what he was missing in his calculations\nThe programmer responded to the phone call with the normal typical program or\nAnswer the computer was down I got my hands full right now I Can't be bothered to tell you what I'll come see you first thing in the\n\nLast I heard he was living large Weiner various with over a million dollars in Cayman Island makes family\n\nSo you say this young fella and a lot of wisdom a lot of smart and they actually used well\nHowever\nHe used it for personal gain driven by greed and\nSelf centered and is that the exact same James' point\nAccording to James evil wisdom is driven by our cravings that our war at war with interest if we don't know if you want something you don't have go stealing\n\nWhen you cut that something that you can't have you engage in this region argument conflicts until somebody sees you or what\n\nSometimes\nEvil wisdom can backfire\nOn those used\nI heard a story in a while back from a bank robber who walked into a bank pointed the gun at a feller\nPass to tell her in albums and she stopped all the money into a bag and handed to him and he liked the bank\nTrouble ... behind\nHe'd written a note on the back of a bank positive slip for his accounts in another main\n\nSome times evil wisdom Mike for your recognized as the complete lack of a couple of wisdom\n\nWhat James makes the observation that the good wisdom comes from\nGod\nIs the gift that God gives to each and every one of us\nAnd we all remember the story of kings oh on selfishly ask God for good and wisdom so that he couldn't control or is that he could govern wisely and for buying his people with the air and\nSome justice we remember the story to how to women arguing\nAnd Solomon's aside and maybe should be cut and a half and half human they each other mothers\nThe baby real mother immediately relinquish her claim on the baby while the other woman\nComplimented Solomon on his wisdom and told him no yeah it was a ... foot Solomon knew exactly who was a real mother what was the\nOne who gave up her claim in the interests of protecting the baby's\nLife Solomon's wisdom was\nPure peaceful righteous and with our anger\nBecause you see it came from God\nWe need to remember that our and wisdom what little of any one of us has\nIs truly a gift from God\nWe have the freedom to choose to use it\nFor our own personal gang as a young program or get into cheating the customers of the bank or\nWe can choose to use it to do good for others without taking any credit payments\nFor her efforts as the woman with the camel here\n\nWisdom is the application of all of our knowledge\nIn ways that will produce meaningful results in our lives\nWe can use our knowledge

with parents and families of special needs children\nBecky Davidson is the executive\nDirector and co founder of the organization ... is the community and outreach director\nBack in two thousand and five um my husband my late husband Jeff Davis and I started rising above out of the life of our own son who has profound special needs\nAnd we were had raised him for about eight years nine years and we started realizing\nHow isolated and alone we felt especially as parents we felt like there were no other special needs families in the community and so we thought if we're feeling this way then there's got to be other families who are feeling that way as well so two thousand five we started rising about just out of our own need and our own life and it just started growing\nFrom there and we started doing events that were geared specifically the meat the unique needs at the special needs family and so we reached families not only here in the upper Cumberland but actually now all around

of us and we expect that immigrate with that\nYou believe the mood was there how quickly did you see while\nActually it was our very first event we started in October and our very first big event that

recovering but you do some ... part of the team\nWho works there I'm interested in how you became a ministry\nVersus an organization or an association well we\nStarted off again like I said with with doing a worship service for families and um we our hope the only way that I could make it on this journey of being especially when his mom is because of my faith\nAnd so that is why we're ministry because that's where our hope lies it's not in the Easter egg hunts that we do is not an heroes ball that we did those are great things that we bring him but it's because of the hope that we have in Christ and so\nThat is while we were ministry rather than just an organization because everything we did was face we do fun things and we do um you know all these events but everything circles back to that because\nWe could do those events all day long but if people don't have that hope they're not going to make it they're ... they're going to don't they'll stumbled along on this journey bet because of my faith um that's how I'm able to make it you know I Am a mom and my son just turned Twenty one\nUh he has profound special needs requires twenty four seven care and a year and a half ago I lost my husband and so I've been doing this now as a solo parents for the last sixteen months\nAnd you know the only way that I'm able to stand your have this conversation with you right now is because of that faith that I have so that's why we're we're ... that's why we're more than just an organization that we truly like we minister to the families through that hope that we have found um because we couldn't be able to do this if we didn't have that hope\nTo let me give you an example and you you help me out so I'm a mom or a dead and I've just found out that my son or daughter is on the autistic spectrum if I called rising above ministries what kind of things could you put there for me to help me\nWell I think the first thing we were just there to listen ... that's one of the things a lot of times you just need somebody to listen to you you need somebody to here if you want to tell their story and they want to feel like they are seen and that they are heard and so a lot of times I'll sit down with a new mom who's got a new diagnosis and I'll just listen and I'll let them cry\nAnd you know I always tell moms you know what it is okay to grieve\nBecause you are grieving the loss of what you thought your life what's going to look like you know before my son was born my husband and I had these big dreams in these big decisions of what we thought that our life was going to look like and so when we started realizing has special needs those dreams had to die\nBut they were replaced with other dreams and things that were better than we could ever imagine but I've learned through my own grief that you know I don't want people coming up and just going oh it's going to be okay\nYou need to let people feel what they feel and you need to be there to walk with them through that great and so I think that's a lot of what we do\nChris what help can you use if someone is listening and says I Want to help\n'em well volunteers are always now it and we have events throughout the year uh on our website there's a link where you can click on volunteer now and it will have whatever events we have coming up\nWhere um ... you can sign up it greatly volunteers to be

I think accountants would be the first place I'd recommend in general terms because they're going to give you a financial overview of ... where you are and where you need to go and they make a recommendation about what form you take\nIt and at that point you know from my money the way I Would function I wouldn't take that to a lawyer and ask for either that they supported or if they disagree with the to explain that so that I can go back to the accountant or go on straight from there but it's no matter what it's a difficult subject\nJohnny during the break you brought up something a little more exciting about this than if you could shed some light on for so that would be useful\nWell back to your question of how to use select the first people our selectivity a cat and how would I select a cat and I would find that those ... who are primarily not exclusively but primarily dealing in the industry that I'm going to be in\nAnd it was just so amazing to me that I started to you know just even take notes for myself about all these amazing people and they grew [laughter]\nJust kept on growing I kept meeting more people and realizing that we have been sold a bill of goods that retirement is just sitting under a palm tree with a drink and our hand or\nCruising endlessly there's so much that people still have to give I don't want to get we feel so much more

retirees looking for new ways to enjoy their lives later on in life\nMost of us will spend a third of our life in retirement and some of us even longer it's going to be the new norm in no time if not already for people to spend as long in retirement as they did in their working life\nForty years if you work from the time you were twenty to the time you were sixty\nThen you're going to be sixty\nTwo hundred people are saying octogenarian and super seniors as they're called are growing astronomically thanks to modern medicine and better health care we know more about diet we know about the importance of exercise we know about the importance of socialization which you mentioned earlier\nAll of these factors\nAre entering into a new world for seniors and for people who are approaching retirement\nWilkes says she felt inspired by her retirement to try new things that's when she stumbled into an old box of letters and was struck by your new parents and the second career\nI retired partly I was taking care of my mother who was having some health issues at that point partly also I was wondering who I Am\nWhat was unfinished in my life and in that context I knew that my father had a box of letters that had come to him when I was a child and I knew of them and my mother had always kept them in a special box and when she came to live with me she brought the box\nAnd one day I decided to open the box and it simply turned my life around because I didn't realize who I was in\nMany ways those letters were from people in Europe who had been dying\nTo come to America or to any country that would have them but\nBecause they were Jews nobody wanted them and I suddenly realized that if I just put all these letters back in the box it would be as if all these people who would sprang to life through their writing\nWas killing them all over again so I wound up writing a book originally more just for me and for my family that people encouraged me to reach a wider audience and I was lucky that university\nRealize that I like the process of writing and if going within\nIn ways that I had never had an opportunity to do a when I was in the working world and so that writing has now become one of the things I Love doing\nReal says or experience of finding those new post retirement crafts for her so doesn't have to be the exception that can be the rule\nRetirement can be the beginning of a whole new way of life for you you want music great when was the last time you took a piano lessons you get that as a child so\nWhat could you do now and if you can't manage a piano maybe you could try something a little easier or some other way but everybody has something\nOf course some people may struggled to find that next great passion or bears Wilkes says that's no problem and she has a few brainstorming questions to help others explore their interests in New ways\nSome of my questions if you knew you couldn't fail what would you do\nIf you knew you could start something fresh without anybody laughing at you were making fun of you what would you do what voices are you hearing from your past that said ... who do you think you are you're too old for this or what are the voices and the tapes that are playing in your head\nThat are preventing you from living your life fully\nHand with those questions in mind Wilkes says it's time to take those passions in your own hands and said new aspirations\nI start with a piece of paper and pen [laughter] not even a device and I start writing things down and I make long long list of things that are practical and things that are completely off the wall\nAnd you may know where things are going to take you I recently encountered a retired gentleman\nAnd at sixty five year he retired he decided for the first time in his life that he was going to sing in public he had never done it he is now been offered contract as a student in and major Academy of music\nWhere he's going to go and develop his voice to sixty five\nHe's never sang a note in his life and yet there's a whole new avenue opening up for him\nSometimes retirement can be an isolating experience on our our specialties the jobs people if you give them meaning and gone to going to be the connections people make within their industries\nWilkes says she hopes people can see that as an opportunity instead of a curse an opportunity to make new friends and learn new things\nThere are all kinds of things that I have time to do now that we're impossible when I was raising children and working fulltime and and paying off a mortgage and and and\nAbsolutely I had you know when I say I have time now even for the little things like instead of rushing to to get to work on time I can walk up the street to buy a cup of coffee at the coffee

without those gassed you can't grow this kind a program\nWhich leads me to today's guest my place or cold call to Texas billionaire written combs read was the owner of the NFL's Minnesota Vikings and the co founder of Clear Channel communications and one of the top five Automobile Dealers in America\nAnd he had no clue who John Resnick was this man had absolutely nothing to gain by coming on my local radio show in central Pennsylvania but thank God he did because I credit Redmond comes as a critical factor in our continued growth\nLet's welcome are real taxes tycoon and cowboy and our dear friend read my columns read welcome back to alleges success\nWith John it's good to be back with you and I'm Glad to see that you've had such success and I think that uh you need to give yourself a pet owner bag because you're providing positive stories in positive programs for people that can affect their lives at the end of the day that's what counts\nWell read your your very humble when you say that because let's face it a a man of your stature and diversification is in life you didn't need to do it just out of curiosity why did you come on the program is certainly didn't need to read\nA came on because of the lead in that you're left with my secretary was that you wanted to do a radio show and talk about the positive things that that could affect people positively based on your own personal experience reading the added you were going to interview\nI found that interesting and ah if if if I have to say could benefit of the one I was happy to share it with you\nWell we appreciate it and I speak on behalf of each and every one of our listeners read you a great guy and before we get in your story a little bit ... I Need to congratulate you I understand you've had a pretty big payday why don't you tell us about that\n[noise] well I sold at Minnesota Vikings at all on them for seven years\nAnd it was one of the great joys of my life to be able to do that I've been a professional sports team owner for most of the past fifty years\nBut I had not been able to get an NFL team it was a great experience we had a great run a love Minnesota the fans in Minnesota everything uh couldn't quite turn the trick is getting a new stadium\nFor the team and I felt like it was time to let somebody else see if they could pull that off but any rate I'm going to miss it and uh uh a lot of successes there financially as well as as a\nNo not at all as a matter of fact uh I enjoy the environment that I was raised in I enjoyed the growing up in the in the wild garlic I have a perfect situation uh we realized that the countries in the depths of the depression a lot of people that they have jobs and that there were problems uh I always was a\nWas a just instilled in me with with every sense of the fiber in my family from mom and my dad was that education was a key to\nThat the benefits of of a good life for the benefits of your life would be that would benefit you and then you could pass on to the benefit of others\nSo education was always a big thing we're fortunate we had very good public schools in our little town that I was fortunate I got to go to college football scholarship and then the GI Bill from army service\nSo I was able to get an education and uh it uh it was very important and it's very important to all of us I talked to a lot of kids groups are these days and try to instill in them the importance of just staying in school another week whatever it is if you get out you know feel like you can\nSpend four or five years in college a spin one years she can't do that spin one semester\nBecause every day will pay off for you every day that you can get the\nMore formal education you get the better you be so Ah yes we add obstacles we really didn't see them as as much as I guess that they might have been and maybe that kind of positive outlook or play the good role and what we're able to do\nWell it's it's a it's obviously affected in some positive way and many positive ways you are as as a young man a young boy you are on tribute entrepreneurial almost from the beginning weren't you wreck\nI Am a hours I didn't even know how to spell the word was much less a a a understand what he was but I was always fascinated about how things work out as it how does the Gabby a bank or you get to how how does this happen\nOr whatever the business is I was always fascinated by it always tried to to watch him understand as much about it as I could but I still have that same fascination uh today is approach age uh Seventy eight or I'm fascinated about how things work I'm fascinated about how the ADL\nHow Mr del up Michael Dell up and often or a a\n... a building computers and found a way to out do everybody in the world it's fascinating and I still try to learn about all those things\nYou know it's interesting to read because a lot of people say here this all the time they say well you know what they did before you can duplicate or replicate today my my opinion is you can make a much bigger fortunes much faster in today's world do you agree\nTotally agree and and now there's another key element that\nThat he has such a such a premium these days are being young [noise] uh gives you an advantage not a disadvantage and that is just another thing I think that ... bells\nAre just so positively or for all of the young people that are that are coming in and tackling the various elements of of careers in one way or another because there is a premium on youth and\nAnd ah it shows so I think that I I think we're living in the very best of times we should understand that and uh we should we should see that we enjoy we enjoy a good share of it\nAbsolutely you know going back to when you were about age ten you had a very simple entrepreneurial jobs created I'm I'm selling peanuts but I think he learned a couple of valuable lessons side of that talk about\nThat I did I learn a lesson minute or if you put too many peanuts in the sack when you get you get a lot of Nichols but there's not enough to pay for all your peanuts [laughter] so what happened\nSo what happened was convinced my dad did go by me another hundred pounds sack of peanuts and he said you've already tried that and he said it didn't work very well but yeah I said well give me a chance of I'll make it work\nSo I have as many peanuts in the ... I never had any complaints from my customers and I made some money so I you know you learn a lot of lessons as you as you move through laugh I learned a lot of lessons early ages and I was still around today\n[laughter] you know you also said I mean from that experience I had a quote from your book called the red zone you said if you like he's he's in the first rule of private enterprise if you identify in need and you know where the buyers are\nBold it's missing is the product and I think that you you mentioned that's what you learned I guess from that peanut business that is correct your mom is quoted as also saying or your mother said I gave birth to them and raise them but I've never known what made bat boy check [laughter] [laughter] you you were on like the rest of the family I take it\nYeah well I I was a little bit more passionate about the about the the things that I wanted to do and and I'm a that was so\nThat that's just been a part of all I have always been passionate about the things I Do and I've always enjoyed the things that I Do not that there haven't been problems and issues that come up as they always do\nBut um [noise] uh the the the ... this is a God created all of us equal certainly in one respect and that is\nThat he gives all of us this twenty four hours of today it's a gift within our and it it's not that we deserve it it's God's Gift or so the issue is nobody else gets any more than twenty four hours today I get the same as you do everyone else gets the same issue is what do we do with it\nAnd that's that's what's kind of driven my life and uh it's it's\nPeople like you were saying to you know you there's a premium on youth because unfortunately many people don't realize how valuable that head start that advantage is that they have now until maybe it's too late or or they wasted a lot of that but that's just typical isn't it rest\nWhat it is you know we're always going to find people who are who you are more concerned about things than others and [noise]\nAnd uh they're always going to be some people it will finish the hand of others and that doesn't mean though that you can still do well in the race of the big thing is is to get in the race and to be a part of it\n[noise] ... originally going to be a lawyer one happened\nWell I found out and as as if finishing my second year in law school I found out that that the that profession in Nineteen fifty a really didn't pay much\nAnd uh I was I was working two or three jobs on the campus and ours are found out that I was making more money than than the starting lawyers or at that time of the old it discouraging anyone from the\nFrom the field of law it's a fantastic field and we all know that but in my world I was in a hurry and uh I I just felt like I needed to to move away from la and move over to the business side\nRed isn't that one of the um a common denominator ... most successful entrepreneur is what you really alluding to hear you in a sense of urgency to get out and earn a living to\n...\nThen and that made a big difference in other words you didn't at that point have the patience you said you know I can calculate going forward on this track or I can get out and get into business and what did you do you quit law school you left law school where did you go would you do rent\nWell like I got a corporate job through the University of

country in the world\nAs well as the north and south pole Lee I thought I was a traveler but man when I met you and heard about you I thought I Can't even compete\n[laughter] well ... it's not a competition but or the bus you know that so we'll we'll do our thing\nAbsolutely so I Would I'm really impressed with with us but I Want to talk to you about today is when it comes to traveling because it is the fall and despite people going back to school over sixty percent of Americans I said to be traveling in the fall whether it's a big trip or a small trip around the corner\nBut you really use your credit card point really well and that is something that I don't do as well and I know I Need to be better at so I Would love to just hear some help on how you use a credit card for your fault travel and if there are any specific ones that you recommend\nYeah absolutely and that's blasphemy by the way you need to maximize your points Michelle\nI now I keep putting them on that card but then I don't use them or my husband has them and I said let's use them for the ship and he's like now I Want to keep saving them I'm like well what's the point of having them\n[laughter] as you mentioned\nAccording to a bank of America survey a six out of ten American travelers say they spend most of their money on food and drink so\nWhat what should you do I basically would use the bank of America premium rewards credit card which will mean two points for dollar spent on all traveling dining purchases and if your preferred reward client\nThen you can earn even more\nPoints up to three point five points per dollar on all traveling dining purchases should that's the fastest way to really accumulated enough points to get free travel in the future and if you're going to be traveling you're going to be spending money you're going to be\nBuying gas you're going to be buying food you're going to be staying in hotels you're going to be spending this money any way you might as well be rewarded and maximize the points and that's where a grid credit card like the premium rewards card comes in handy\nYeah and that is true because you could sit in research a lot of the different credit cards and you really have to know what you're getting with each so what are your tips for researching and booking fall travel with or without the credit card and how do you primarily travel\nWell number one I mean you always want a book all travel\nWith credit card because all travel expenses will get you to points for dollar spent\nAnd ah you know if you do want to do research and it depends on you of course in your spending habits uh you know some cars have really high annual fees the bank of America premium or its ... has a very low annual fee so if you don't travel that much is a great card for you because you're maximize your points and you're not spending a ton\nOn the annual fee so for someone like someone like you I might recommend that but I mean you always want to um think about what you spend your money on and and figure out which card is great for you show for the for myself\nUm I only spend money on traveling dining so it's like perfect for me and if I'm booking an airline ticket or booking a hotel or you know spending money on a tour or whatever it might be\nA that's what I Do and there's no reason to pay for anything without a credit card because you're not being rewarded for anything of course if you're on the street and buy like a hotdog or something like that maybe that's one thing but if you're if you're at a restaurant and you spend you know a hundred dollars on dinner for a few people whatever\nYou want to be rewarded for that and you'll get like two hundred points just for eating dinner on something you'd be doing anyway\nExactly and then also some of these credit cards are really good because they have no foreign transaction fees so if you are traveling abroad than a card you know where you can save on that it's also beneficial while also earning points\nAbsolutely and uh you you know from traveling internationally\nThat's a huge tool and or something where you can really save money uh and and it's something to keep in mind\nYeah so I mean I always see the credit card for everything when I travel so I agree with you so let me ask you what are your favorite ... destinations where are you headed\n[noise] well I'm actually a and onto a Disneyland or later this week and then I had not to the middle East I'm going to Dubai and to Saudi Arabia so\nNot exactly the ideal or usual fall traveled ... are taking some trips around New York state and New England and ah checking out the fall foliage which is the best thing about living up here so uh you know taken road trips is one of my favorite things to do and that's what I'll be doing\nAwesome I just in Disney for only a day I Want it to be that much more but you'll have a great time I love it there actually now the Halloween themes and I'm very jealous that you're heading to the bai and Saudi Arabia Lee ... thank you so much for joining me today great and I hope we can talk against in\nMichele ...\nAt the lately they might be listening to

is is closed for business in fact uh the vast majority of even the big island this completely unaffected by killer whale but from ... from ...\nSort of a perception issue from a ... percent presenting standpoint Hawaii his talk is taking a little bit of a hit 'em on our website the travel is that we've seen searches for\nA wind destinations actually did um anywhere from\nTen to thirty percent year over year because I think as people may be second guessed the the idea of travelling to Hawaii they were looking at alternative tropical destinations and so now we're seeing Hawaii exit the summer season\nWith a bit of a need to bring travel numbers up so this has become all of a sudden a and especially combined with some of the airfare wars we're seeing especially out of California are in the bay area and how to San Diego I'm we're flights in the last couple of weeks have been under three hundred dollars round trip\nTo settle down ... ... yeah and you know what happened with nine eleven that Hawaii too is that if you are young parent maybe you're pregnant or thinking about the kind of kind of you don't have to worry about the guy in Hawaii right it's one of the the tropical destination it sounds like a free\nFree and as you know it it really sort of ranges of the gamut when it comes to budget so you could go very high end and some of these great ... you know four and five diamond resorts uh an in Hawaii that cater to families really really well\nI'm a we stayed on on Maui and white layer which southwestern choice of Maui with our three kids and the Fairmont Kayla honey there is the only all sweet property I'm In ... in the ... uh right next door the four seasons very celebrity friendly\nUh but this is a period where you're seeing some more affordability in fact if you go to the four seasons of Maui website they give you what they call their value dates they tell you the\nWeeks where you can you will find the lowest rates at that resort and that's a very family friend I mean they they you know they got the kids' clubs that got the week these lounges for kids that go babysitting services um but then you've also got the the vacation rentals I mean we're also stayed at like a one bedroom\nCondos where we are making her own meals in the kitchen every day or end just shopping for food and kind of doing ... doing a very very affordably so the beauty of all why is that it can it runs the gamut from\nBudget friendly to you know a ... you know white glove five star and no matter what ranger in\nThis happens to be because of the summer we see in there and the Hawaiian Islands\nUh to consider going um prices I'd say November or December nineteenth twentieth is your is when you'll see prices go up in earnest and probably the best window of all for who I Will be those couple of weeks\nBetween Thanksgiving and Christmas I got to be honest with you that's what we're going with our with our family were pulling the kids out of school for a couple of days because of the values were just so good that it's that little quiet periods between those two holidays Thanksgiving and Christmas where some of the best wind values exist\nRight and you know what and I'm also you know I Know a lot of families like to go away and get together for the holidays but what better idea than saving some money so get together at home for Thanksgiving and then go away in a week or two with everybody into now there because you know why not why not just that you know you have more than ... than when you're there on the on the line\nThey exactly right [noise] um [noise] you know these are the decisions that during Thanksgiving and Christmas will see prices go up but uh it right in between his offer some some great a value opportunity as well also internationally you know a crossing the border I think there's still some ... totally viable option ... Mexico\nEven during some of the more popular sees a season's still offers a lot of bang for your buck up against the dollar remains strong against the Mexican peso I'm In the news of the day a\nSafety concerns in Mexico has had an effect on travel south of the border um but that's been countered by a slew of new resorts in places like competition Lucas imported while you are to where\nYou know that many more hotel rooms means a value in just a number to believe will follow I was in ... in June um\nThey'll totally safe as well I mean it's it's really all about especially for those of us who are okay we're staying at a resort or staying you know sort of playing it smart I think they're still I mean there were no safety issues for me when I went but for but because there has been that sort of effect value Mexico continues to be strong and\nOn the other side of the ... on the other border and Canada we're still seeing some great um you know the the do still string a strong against the the ... up there and\nAnd therefore it either either border offer some some good some good values\nAre just by crossing a crossing a you know making of course\nExactly and depending on where you live in the U. S. candidate can be a really short ride and same for heading to the Caribbean\nOr connects the guy and I left cannon I Love many parts of Canada it is getting to the wintertime their side said now probably a good time to go right unless you don't mind the freezing cold weather which even now I was ... I have because you have all your snow activities\nThen I I always feel like I Know you're in California where you're black the beautiful weather all the time that here in New York you know it's called it's called right what's another and twenty degrees called\nOr or was it for me is as soon as we're coming from Southern California doing these are doing the\nThe colder destinations during the the sort of late fall winter season that's the only time of the year to get to where my long black coat closet\nThe rest of the year 'cause we don't use that stuff out here in Southern California um but you mentioned New York that's another one of these ... you know the the fall is when business travel starts to pick back up\nUm but uh you know these holidays that are coming up but Thanksgiving even even the end of the year uh holidays best when these big cities as business travel slows down or going to be offering some great value it's values as well as it were families looking for the\nFor these big city ways in New York or Chicago or San Francisco or you know Dallas um the the holidays offer some great\nBargain opportunity a especially on on the weekends will you'll see business travel

Tennessee when I first got to Tennessee it wasn't the first year of a new staff coach majors has already been there three years when I got there in Nineteen eighty [noise] um\nI'm sure that's different because this is a new staff\nThey now have an opportunity to evaluate five games and then kind of look at what's gonna happen going forward that's what we're going to take a look at today a lot of positive things can happen during an open date I'll give you the biggest example\nThat I can give you 'cause I was right in the middle of a Nineteen eighty eight Thirty years ago my gosh it seemed like a long time ago it was a long time ago\nNineteen eighty eight John majors made a change in the middle of the season right before an open date\nTo change shake things up on news off ... ... primarily on his defense the staff\nI was right in the middle of that no what happened on it and of course that worked out pretty well for the University of Tennessee a so as we look at these things I'm looking at today as a coach would look I'm gonna try to take inside on what happens\nIn an office even defensive staff room a\nDuring an open week you know you can see what we can make our own evaluation is what happened during ball games but that's that's what I'm going to really dig into today a and hopefully you will enjoy it I tell you this I really enjoyed doing it this week and that kind of brought back some memories are and what happened this past week\nWell on the field in practice will take a look at that off the field of course I mentioned recruiting we'll look bad also today I'm going to take a look today at the twenty Eighteen signing class that the twenty five young men who are on the team right now that includes eight transfers either grad transfers or junior college transfers whose plane\nUh who's not and why and evaluate so far just a little look at the type of player and the results that coach Jeremy ...\nBut we're just pretty good up their linebacker and area inside linebacker I thought we'd be pretty good at and ... and were decent there but for a ... for whatever reason Kirkland junior is not the players not effort\nBut he's not the player that he was a freshman I'm assuming is probably because of the injuries I don't know but if you just look he's a stamp or half a step\nFrom getting to make the play and he had about five or six missed tackles last week and all of them were because he just wasn't quite the couldn't quite get to that outside ball carrier any when he got there it was more of an arm tackle with his head behind instead of his head in front of\nA I don't know what you do about that obviously they think ... is a player and he's played well he's not the biggest guy but he\nCan run Ignacio getting playing time there I think but to Lee is a very solid football player but again it's just like with the upfront folks that's who we have we don't have a lot of choices\nGo to prove that does not have a lot of choices we got about twenty guys\nTotal on the defensive side of the ball who are really capable of playing a ... at any level\nOf a a team that were playing or the Southeastern Conference chamber teams that were playing so that's what we have\nAs I said and chopped up this like ah this past week I don't like the old saying that is what it is ... there have like that but quite honestly we are what we are who we have is we we have\nAnd that's what we're going to have to build with so that defensive or evaluation to me right now five games in would be this guy's we got to keep doing what we're doing\nWe got to get these young guys ready to play and they're playing along Tate Taylor\nFlowers the old Jackson they can run they don't know what they're doing right now they knew a lot more than what they're doing the getting much much better they they are all physical players they're not physically strong enough they're gonna be\nIn another year\nThey get an opportunity to have an outstanding all that great off season and they are strength coaches anything what out here he is they're going to get there but they had the talent to play right now and I I just uh you know again we we got to we got we got one\nReally really tough game coming up and in Alabama and the next two weeks ... going to be tough that obviously they're not as tough as as we thought they would be off talk more about bringing in a second\nBut anyway that that's that's kind of what we're looking at defensively right now you got to get flowers in their plan to get get the Jackson their Bryce Thompson ... are essentially started right now they have started every game but they've or a ... but they're essentially starters\nAnd then you got to get you can and I think for playing a bad as well as he can play he's a limited football player he is a zone football player cornerback\nHe is not a man demand press coverage as he can play a little but he can't play\nNinety percent man and be effective from a ... team playoff but when you play off they're going through all those little bubbles screens out there so that kind of that's kind of what the the a defensive evaluation is on this we're better on defense than we are in office we're a good bit better on defense in my opinion not nearly as talented\nAs we are on office now a couple of reasons for that number when he got paid coach over their coach them\nWhen the head coaches coaching a position and or a ... a side of the ball and he is doing that\nThen you got to be better of the head coaches the head coach I'm sure if he was on the offensive side of the ball they'd be doing a little bit better to\nAt least on the defensive side of the ball so that's kind of what the defenseless that's talking about the problem area right now as I look at this team is the officers' side of the ball if we took it if we look at the evaluation on this again these are these are our ah our lessons you've heard me talk so much about those this is the way\nI Would be talking if I was in the office he staffer him and I was running back coach or whatever I was coaching over there\nIf they gave me a voice to talk then I this is what I'd say this is what I'm seeing right now but we're we're not getting out of the uh the personnel or what we need to be getting out of the personnel so far\n... let's just let's just take a look at at some of the things I mean frankly quite frankly this this is what I'm saying so far and and again I I Am I'm saying this ... say this and that constructive way 'cause I made it into ... the way we simply have to get the ball\nTo our play makers and right now we got one that we're sure of a nice Chandler\nMission this last week to go down to Georgia and only get\nTied Chandler nine touches end a ball game is just wrong and I'm sure they've corrected that now we're kind of in an era I now I Know what they want to do off instantly they want to have full running backs\nThree running backs that they can rotate in there and that's a great topic you know in the past we've had a couple of former teams where we had three running back we had a one or two major stains we had the three rented back to most of the time we've had to the science we had one\nWay of ... and check way of my last year at Tennessee regimens there two years but check was there a one year Richard freshman I did I don't even remember who the thirteenth quarter of a third team running backwards because he didn't get in the bowl game unless we are so far ahead so quite frankly\nExpect to be anywhere near the type of ... that we want to be to me we got two running backs right now\nWe've got number right we've got number thirty three now I Know banks assembled some but if you really look at his found as he had one real fun to\nWrite the recent about across the Golan wasn't because about security that would just because he was trying to ... got to get him taught to touch that football because we got two players back they're eight and thirty three are good football players those other two guys quite frankly to me they're a dime a dozen\nThere okay they're good guys I'm sure they're good players I'd be more than happy if I was running back coach to put 'em in the ball game when we were up in the fourth quarter with about five minutes to play\nI'm sure they're working their butt off I'm sure they're they're doing a lot of things but\nYou got two guys back there that can win games for it and we got six conference football games that we better be getting the bald or play makers Callaway Jennings have to get the ball on fifty fifty miles down the field\n... if you're evaluating this often it's we're not doing that things are big physical guys and the one that we know can go up and get it\nJust you ...\nYou're playing against he's six three six for I don't know how tall he is I Know this he can jump\nWe gotta have times when we get ... out there on a five ten five eleven six foot defensive back that we take and he got a ball by\nThe getting down there and do get the ball up high and let him go up and get it ... he'll get one out of out of two of them got to do it if we're not if we don't get the pressure and defensive backs of hubs a secondary coach\nAgainst this tendency off and it's I don't know that play any deeper and ten twelve yard says we don't follow the ball any further than that\nI'm sure there's reasons why but bottom line is this you know there there's a there's a crew sane in defensive secondary play if they're not done so deep\nWere darn sure going to cover him short\nSo you got to throw the ball deep you look at I watch games yesterday even the best the best teams\nYou know ... Alabama is one of the best running themes that I've seen\nI bet you they throw the ball deep eight or ten times they hit on a couple of two or three of them are bogus so we simply after that I I fully expect that's going to happen that that has to be one of the biggest critiques that this head coaches made when he's stepped seven and all that often so we got to do that\nWe've got to be playing we got to get nastier on offense\nI mentioned last uh in in one of the talks chopped up\nWe had some pains in the years I was about Tennessee that were outstanding offensive line so he had others that were pretty good new as those weren't very good at all you know what all ten of them did they they ... how big you are how fast you are how strong you are how smart you are has nothing to do with getting down field\nAnd looking for someone or the other color Jersey and let him know year round\nMake make that defense keep their head on a swivel hey I I I you know I that defense is coming up knocking the crap out of our receivers and running backs when they're struggling to get ball and we got off into Byman quite frankly in my opinion that are just looking around get your butt down there\nAnd get your hat on somebody or at least let them know you come and again that it I don't care if you're a hundred and eighty pounds or four hundred and eighty pounds you can get an field and hit somebody I don't care if you knock somebody off the line if you know who to block enough there's eleven other color Jersey is out there go hit one up\nI think we'll probably see a little bit more of that\nHere's this here's just a mess on all fence we have to play more physical as players and we got to get the ... those are the two\nDo we you know some some structural things some maybe formations and other things that if we don't get the ball to her play makers and if we don't play more physical and the often see one and I'm not talking about knocking people off the ball sometimes that doesn't happen\nBut getting our hat on the right people and then getting down field and looking for someone to hit will cuddle up\nYou're going to be where the ball is anyway so you might as well get on down there and make somebody look for you I probably talked enough about that\nA really good group of players that are coming in and what what uh what what have we got an added that the Seventeen them our freshman\nGives us a little idea of of what a um of what the teacher's gonna gonna hold there as far as who coach fruit is gonna be recruiting\nNow let's talk a little bit about\nAnd what's going forward the commitment and I'm not going to get into the number and I want just want you to think about the plane position that the coach is bringing\nAre and how that will fit into the team that we have returning next year again this is an open wake\nYou don't have a whole lot to talk about so we're talking about this these are the twenty Nineteen commits out the little ... and there I don't believe there's any way I think we have plenty maybe Twenty one he's gonna sign twenty five you're gonna have to dip into next year\nUh I'm sure there's a good reason we did it last year to get to twenty five I think we have Twenty one scholarships this year about that that those numbers don't make and if we're going to end up I'm sure sign and twenty five players so\nUh if if we take a look at the end these these positions so what that means is of the twenty or Twenty one that we have committed right now some of those young men simply aren't going to\nBe signed for a couple of reasons\nNumber one we do not have a a enough players signed that some other positions that this ... what are the clear needs it hadn't been met yet for twenty Nineteen number one's wide receiver thing that we do not have on this team right now is a burner\nAnd wide receiver somebody that can absolutely fly you look at the teams in this league\nAlmost all of them have someone who can fly by we can't do that we don't have that play I guess Palmer's probably the closest and he is a fast player but he can't blow by people\nAre and uh he he's probably the fast and so the group\nSo we need we we got signed a lease too wide receivers and his group we got three juniors I think ah yeah three juniors or that you know heavy seniors we've got three juniors\nWe got signed a couple of burners and we also have to sign at least two line backers we got one line backer signed in this group are committed ... me in this group and that's a junior college player to year player so I don't know who's not going to be there in this group\nOr that the that they've committed but they're not all going to be there but let's take a look at it right now commitments they have ... six fence he'd Lyman commitments for three position\nWonderful I've seen one of them playing person ah I've seen the other foot four on tape or the one I've seen in person is here in Nashville and he is a big physical\nGuy that can movies fate and run so the six defensive line positions are are excellent that's all we need we need big people we need fast people those are big people were losing title we're losing Philips we're losing the Lexus Johnson who I think is is is the title playing really well right now\nAnd I think electric Johnson we're getting everything out of and we can get out of him\nAnd in Congo up front of a gang up on the defensive in position and they're so six defensive line for three positions\nWe got five defensive backs committed for five positions rolling losing one and that's Abernathy and quite frankly Abernathy is a good solid player he will be over recruited in a heartbeat by this uh by this defensive head coach\nI've seen all of the five or ... these five defensive backs one of them and they have a list as an athlete he will be a defensive back he comes up and nails your fanny and then of course you've got to juniors they're so that that position is in good position\nTo ... wait for one position will play in one of those were not losing any right\nI'm looking at the clock here I've got to work in another uh another break because as long first segment I'm going to come back and kind of finish that\nA great guy ran we treat our customers like family kinda theory for carrying Iran's power\n... up to Fifteen thousand dollars off for ... for

I don't go that far back\nWith what the what the next segment coach segment did but I'm I'm ... I'm betting that's what he probably did at Michigan State and may be able to shoot wherever maybe even in Alabama\nOr put that aside I'm saying that for this reason a cause for it knows what he wants to get done on defense he is a defensive and he is a really really good to pits he's he's hired he was hired for two reasons\nOne because he's a defensive minded coach and too because he is a relentless recruiter I when they only only two reasons but those were the two biggest reason I can assure you that that's why he was brought in by this athletic director he also knows about this league\nAnd he brought in coaches I Will keep reminding you who knows this league because they played in it and coached and it had their brains kicked in and also kicked in some brain so they understand this leak\nSo I Am one hundred percent bullish on where this head coach has taken this program anyway I digress his his his vision was let me get defense solid because you know what that's that's one thing uh let me get off base here just a little bit I've watched games yesterday and I watched teamed up\nFollowing Oklahoma like most of you grew up following the big orange\nIf you don't play defense you you can't score enough points sometimes the when\nIf you don't play defense and especially if you don't play defense in this league you got no chance of competing for championships none I don't care how many points you score\nAnd that's what this coach knows\nAnd that's what this coaches put in place and from a fundamental standpoint forget about making plays but from a fundamental standpoint we are so much better in game five defensively fundamentally them we were in game one\nWe're a good right now and I think we'll continue to get better fundamental football\nTeam we know how to keep leverage we know how to tackle sometimes we don't quite get there to tackle\nDot com at Austin price of rivals in ... dot com presented by mortgage investors breaking news or giving expert at our next our first of all we'll take your calls on college athletics around the SEC Anthony college football\nSponsored by mortgage investors group in Tennessee is number one choice for home loans to learn more at\nM.

everybody is I think I think George is their number two but then where it goes from there I think is really up in the air\nIt it seems like just just when you thought maybe you were starting to get a bead on a few teams in the FCC you're right over above Alabama then this past weekend happens then in the past couple of weekends\n... teams beaten up on each other\nAnd I've been doing this long enough to know I'm In an stupid to say this but I I don't know right now that I've seen you by the league can can beat Alabama\nAround nodding Alabama has to have a bad word play with that but the ... that look look at it\nIt then the Baton Rouge and play that game they will play with a ton of emotion LSU will\nUh but I I think Alabama can\nCertainly withstand that was a way that\nThere the lay there getting out of the quarterback position and obviously what they are able to hold off ... off and just put so much pressure\nOn you that that Alabama's defense does have to be great but Chris I\nI think they're getting better although yesterday they gave up ... once the next I mean it's the perfect set up for next say off they they wind up for touchdowns and he's going to absolutely unload on everybody\nAnd I guarantee that locker we last yesterday after the game I have been outside was ... when they won\nBut haven't finished a football game and it's um [noise] put it this way you put

was over and above better than the east way above the east but in Florida with a big showing against LSU obviously I'm ... and it will say I mean I don't think all burns what anybody's thought Auburn

when he got that job and and and ... as new staff or wanted to do they let everybody know they had no talent when they got there but he's done he's done a pretty good job with non\nUm he has and and the defence the defence a pretty good last night in a in a night were Kentucky if you can stop many now and you can slow that that train down Kentucky has got a hard time moving the football consistently\n... there was a different field I Am now felt that when I was there was this pre season spent two or three days\nWith Jim ... program just toughness and physicality\nA mindset and you're

there and I had a better chance because the one thing you could do was give up you know give up a turnover and particularly a football you know scooping score that they've got that game tied up but you're right in overtime\nYou know in a in a conversion down like that that's going to have to go to ... junior college that flour\nAnd they're very putting you know soldiers out thinking\nThey don't

know there's been together as long as we have right now they want to fly and and you know we had a pretty good when you asked a day when we got up and down a little bit and\nReally the first time we put the team together that we end of the season with last year we haven't had a book out and get to play the last game but the thing that we normally started last year yesterday was the first time since we've finished last year that that team went together and it's pretty good go at it and they face right up in terms of day they were together so we\nWere trying to get down to spend a little bit more time a special situation still need to get 'em we talk about her death we will continue to\nThat's what we're trying to get done right now in in uh trying to get some spending a lot of time with Jordan bound plan to point the case for made him there and I think it will help him in the long run able to play off the wall\nBut uh we just again is still about just everybody's trying to get a little bit better each [noise]\nWhen you say you haven't heard that you put the team to sort of put the guy's going to ... you mean that's the first time ab roller grant had been on the same team but not been going at each other ... what was the thought process\nGoing back to the summer and end of the started camp to kind of put those guys on opposite teams were what were you trying to achieve it and maybe waiting to put the quote starting team together\nWell it wasn't so much but damn opposite each other what what we wanted to do is get both of those guys out of the post and make a way for John folk her son cow Alexandra Derek [noise]\nA Walker and um that can't at the time and and when DJ burns got there we wanted those guys to get the kind of rats that those guys get every day because they'll play every position unless you take 'em out and those other guys are more than willing to step aside is that those guys do that so we said to them we're not only by hot right now\nAnd not think it I think it helped admiral now when he played out there\nObviously last year on the perimeter some grant played out there are more than you have ever has in his life\nBut I Do think that health in it but it it match them up some times where they weren't they weren't always match up the other because we didn't want that we wanted a those guys gardening Jordan ballot or the ponds and\nSo it was it works it works that way well where those guys are playing against physical players and we'd like that and uh\nSo I Do think it helped us I I really do but we'll see because we had numbers last year but in those numbers we just felt there was a big drop off when mansion turns of the consistency that we're looking for and hopefully now this is not going to be as big a drop off in and hopefully not anti we still have worked at the\nCurrents that you know I've never been around a ... a great team in any sport that that's not able to create [noise]\nGreat competition on the practice for\nWhere are you guys along those lines right now and are are you even better in that area and then you were last year and how much better do you still need to get\nYou know we're we're definitely better there than any time since we've been here a tendency in in the fact that our practices are very physical I mean I think that when we have\nScouts come in and watch his play that's the first comment that they they saw as let you guys are incredibly physical and you know we we also want to get down to Florida where we stand and a half or ...\nOr just trying to get our ... thinks it becomes very very physical and the guys would tell you that much rather get up and down the poor\nSaying there and go to your phone on bones against each other but uh we do do a lot of that because I think this time of year you got to get guys to a level that maybe that they don't think they can get to and we actually showed him take the other day of where we were defensively at our house last year we said we got to get back here where we can get it to another level\nWe're not all that up to the kind of level that I Want to get it too but uh we get it too and\nYou been in this for a long time you do what you're doing for a long time and done it a high level it is is a tougher challenge for a coach to coach a team that everyone expects\nTo be really good nobody outside your walk room last year Rick don't you guys will do what you did and obviously you had a great you won the SEC but as a head coach in in the staff\nIs it more difficult challenge this year\nWas a good thing I guess I don't read the papers right [laughter]\nI don't know what people know coach reading the papers\nYeah but you don't want a [noise]\nI see that that that has never\nBeen a concern of mine was where they are in pre season this out or whatever because I think the store and every year over as a coach with your team and right I think he started at the end of the year when the years over to our goal was to look at each player individually and say okay what does this guy has to do to get better\nAnd by him getting better it makes hurricane better and I you know every year every year that I've been as soon as the weather people believe it or not [noise] we've we've gone into every year\nPlay it drops below the we can we can get what we want to go and um we were closed for a couple of years back more than people might have fall and the fact is now that people think we're supposed to be there throughout the we change our brothers you know\nBecause we are still holding mining can we get our players air better every day and by doing that it gives her team that\nYou mention it yeah I was gonna say this to say to see what I Do expect\nHis office of execution I Will say that was it was an older group of guys coming back\nMen together I Do expect him to understand details at a rate or more so than maybe in the past where I don't have to harp on as much but if they don't do it\nThat gives them a harp on them anyway probably but did not want to debate last\nLast me having to get just a simple thing catching a ball and getting down and triple threatened being ready to make a slight we asked you about getting better at that right now\nSorry back here on the nation on cruise lower rent hubs\nBurnout caught the Texas Roadhouse we fight ... fight at the same for the official two

like alumni hall hound dog food city or Cracker Barrel or country stores get geared up pre game day with fight ... fight\nFor thanks again to Tennessee basketball coach Rick barns for spending some time with us here in the second segment print out you had a chance to watch them practice I had a chance to spend some time with coach born last week and I think both of us agree that this is a team across the board if\nThey're going to get ... will create a lot of matchup problems for teams that a lot of different people across the board who could score and who is coach mentioned in the last thing the guy like during bomb\nShooting the basketball looks like he's going to be a different basketball players well\nJordan played really well in the season now he didn't he didn't defend very well as he'll tell you on the last player of the season in the tournament but um he played in internment player he played much better basketball is much more assertive often slick\nAnd so I think he is going to be a different player because I think he's got a ... I think he's got a Fifteen foot jump shot if he'll take it I think he can make it with regularity with his ability to push the ball up to Laurie can create that shot for self\nWhat I'm curious to see about this table what I liked about this team and the possibilities of this team\nA lot of different guys can score and a lot of different guys could score from a lot of different places right Brent Williams can play facing the basket better now that he's ever been able to look he's going to drop on the low block and he's going to go back to the basket but he can't step out and hit a jump shot better than he could a year ago or two years ago we saw what admirals\nGame did a year ago by being able to play face in the basket and how that would change\n... Turner is a guy who can find a way to store I'm ... I think I think bounds an X factor you know how does how does he scored how does he play what all this he do for tendencies good defender\nOf what kind of nights you're going to get out of him I just think they have some really unique flexibility if they all stay healthy\nThat's going to provide them the opportunity to go really deep if that's what coach Barnes wants to do and can and can make in line up issues for other teams now there'll be some nights were late may hurt them a little bit in the post\nThat's just something they'll have to battle they had a ... a year ago but I Do like the overall makeup of this roster because they could do so much from so many different places little sauce\nYeah we'll see where catalogue center takes his game this year consistency he's got to play through and and that's the one thing and watching them practice on Thursday that's the\nThat that is the message from from ... barges hey do you go on about three minutes we've got about three three and a half minutes here okay that that's that's not a time to be tired at the time to push through Roku you've got to play longer stretches when you get tired you can't you can't get lazy with the ball up splitting can't pick up jeep files so that's the Bush\nThat there is with cow Alexander I think the potential is there\nHe's just gotta get dial did and can't be a guy who runs the yo yo in terms of good for stretches good pregame bad for the next game he's got to be more consistent and that's the the pitch them and that's the police to to him and the coaching message to him\nTo go up against the bigger teams teams with links and height um\nYou know I ah I think it's a it's especially good pretend to seize that you've got a guy like Rick who's been at it as long as he has he seen it from all different angles and he's such a veteran and such a such a savvy coach\nTo go into the situation you heard when I ask them about you know not looking into the rearview mirror and they have a coach that's been around and done it in a high level as long as he has is a perfect set up to coach team like this because he will not in any way shape or form let up on these guys\nEnact promise you going to be straight ahead and go well we did this and we got this last year\nAnd his experience\nAnd he's been there he's had teams like this and he will push them knowing him as I Do he will challenge and pushed him harder than ever\nWell I think he's got two things going what first of all you know he said they had expectations every year he told me his first year here that he thought they could be a tournament thing\nI didn't think that there was any chance they didn't end up being because of some interest but I didn't think they had the ability there but he truly believe that\nI think the way Chris that you can coach that way this year if you're Rick Barnes\nIs that's the only way you've ever coached these guys that there's complete transparency so they're they're all of a sudden\nIt's not going to be these guys or I were good and also what comes to be hard on us what what was he doing here you know he's not having to push button because he's just got a coach and like his coach to every day since they've been here they don't know we need different\nAnd so I think that gives them a chance now\nOutside chatter and talk and all that stuff that that'll be stuff that they have to deal with from a leadership standpoint but first but\nIf they're listening to ... Barnes the message will not be any different than it was when they were freshmen here and they first arrived on campus regardless of what age they are\nAll right right before we take this last break

don't think Vanderbilt bad team I'm what I'm saying that because Vanderbilt some notion that they're all the old Vanderbilt but I think that say\nI think that some of a match up that probably suits Tennessee a little butter\nI didn't want to see we're both these teams are so you ... you never know and be better ... got off to the start last night George again got away from them um\nYou know as the one thing that stands out to me about\nThis deviate from the question a little bit stands out to me about Tennessee after watching every as part of every SEC game yesterday that was on every team that was on I watched part of their ... those guys play\nUm [noise] the thing that says to me is Tennessee doesn't have the team speed they've got to have in this league and there's been so much talk about your bigger and stronger get bigger get stronger they gotta get faster\nI saw Vanderbilt showed last night against Georgia that they lack a little bit of team speed and I think that may be a better match up for Tennessee 'cause Tennessee has a hard time with speed and I think Missouri on the perimeter as scary\nI think all burned even though they're you know their feast or famine offensively they get behind you ... with some of the stuff that they do um\nSouth Carolina's got a couple of play makers you know out there and the same is terrific so you know that's the one thing that concerns concerns me about Tennessee and that's why I Would pick Vanderbilt is the best\nIt down for you here on the nation's good take our final break here at the core Texas Roadhouse we back

about a ... a lot of things that happened last week and but we're going to begin by talking about what happens next and so I Want to begin and the question that I'm going to ask everybody is\nWhere do we go as a nation now now now that the the fighting a war is over last week\nObviously been an election coming up in November we're going to talk about that is the program an falls but where do we do as a nation to try to bring the sides together if it if that's even at all possible Elizabeth us and we're going to start with you when you start with a hard question that [laughter]\nThis is painful for me as an American and as a patriot I I Am uncomfortable when people say\nOf the nation has never been more divided because I remember when I don't remember the civil war no matter what my children may have told you but um you know there have been times that this nation has been severely divided and we have come together\nAfterward and so I'm hopeful but\nI don't know how\nHow we get past the feeling of mutual disrespect and distrust I just would say and\nThere was you know when\nEisenhower was appointing a Supreme Court justices and apparently he had a million of me it was crazy the Eisenhower had five combinations and\nThere he was making strategic choices he he chose Earl Warren because he wanted it conservative chief justice that didn't turn out the way he had hoped but there was\nAn emphasis on on bringing things together and have candidates that everyone can do for you get Seventy votes\nLet's go to Cathy balls or you're one of our card carrying so my card carrying Republicans although you're very independent what's your answer to that very difficult question\nI Want to start off by saying that we have the lowest unemployment rate in forty nine years so obviously the country is doing something right even though there might be anger in what people are feeling about certain things so I'd rather see a low unemployment they worry about making a Democrat happy\nBut what is it more than just make you a Democrat happy is is there anything that that's important to bring the nation together or is is a is a split nation okay\nI mean as Supreme Court justice should not make any decision based on\nWhat the country are the people are feeling they're supposed to make all decisions based on the constitution\nCan ask you one quick so let's see I go home and I my before a gun to live in electrical engineering background like dust off my my degree and build a hand held laser a gun that I can basically a laser that I used to\nCar people off just like a phase or in Star Trek you know do you think that at some point the Supreme Court if it you know is considering that legality of weapon you think they are allowed to actually kind of consider where we are technologically where we are in time I mean they have to they can't just look at the second amendment and assume that you know lock rifles or the standard\nThat technology is different from Senate you said the sentiments of the people it's the sentiment of the people now are more pro life than pro choice and if we get a Supreme Court that would go\nThrough technology doesn't form sentiment that's why we have pills like you know plan B. that's a technology essentially a pharmaceutical technology to smoke it Jake too you know right after possible conception to have an abortion moral Josh so I\nI mean I Am going to disagree with Peter and just say that the winner of the president to get to pick\nWho the Supreme Court who he or she wants to put on the Supreme Court the appellate courts in the district court and this president has done a remarkable job of that not all the way down to the lower courts and that's just how things go the Senate has a role\nTo advise and consent where we start here with Kavanaugh was more search and destroy and I think that's why our side\nIs so fired up about this\nI Want to talk about ah again how you ... how you how you make your case following up on one ... said what can the Democrats do to get back in the game and basically in my in my opinion may be clean up a little bit\nSome mistakes that might have been made might have been made in my opinion last week I think they went over the top\nAre in their efforts to to destroy a Brett Kavanaugh\nWell Dr Ford forward that will be something we will talk about but last night in Kansas the president was out doing one of his campaign rallies and F as he frequently does he come he knows how to turn a phrase\nAnd maybe come up with a if not a bumper sticker something that will be a focus of Republican candidates between now and November based on the way the Democrats acted\nAnd their supporters acted for the last couple of weeks listen to the president from last night\nOn hand batches do an arsonist\nYou don't give power to an angry left wing mob and that's what they\nJosh is that a good a message I think it's a great\nMessage I have to say that I'm Bruce as you know I was never Trump or and a and you see my evolution I have\nI'm now a supportive of the president I loved his policies um\nI have a lot of people are on my social media page that following me who are never Trump person independence even day now are on board this Kavanaugh fight has brought the G O P s together like it's ... it hasn't been since Trump first entered the scene\nElizabeth us that don't want to get your reaction to the president's ah\nA fine tuning the message between now and November\nHave to say the one I think of an angry mob I Do think of Charlottesville and not ladies in Washington DC so I Would disagree with the president on some general\nPrinciples you say that angry mobs can be both left and right absolutely and screaming in the face of United States senator is that\nA is that good politics are bad politics\nI'm not sure we'll see I think in November I I think that\nIf I don't know I don't I mean we're not cook I'm what do you think though I mean what what do you think when you see people [noise] uh on on at at this particular case on one side and by the way I'm not saying that ... there haven't been moments where Republicans or conservatives in the past\nMay have used their voices raised their voices and gotten in the face of Democrats that they don't like that has happened from time to time over the last fifty years I'm Talking about what happened last week the video this playing now and it's going to play over and over again I think to reinforce\nWhat the president had to say is there going to see angry people\nAre screaming in the face of the United states senator or trying to uh you know defeat one who voted for judge capital is that good or bad\nI I honestly don't know because I think it's important to these were angry women\nSo I don't think it's as frightening to viewers perhaps as angry men I'm not I that women can be as\nPowerful as mad I I actually I've been ... by both women men in equal part but I you know when you're talking about the politics of an image\nI and I'm saying I'm not sure I think a lot of us who have had sexual assaults happen in our lives field that anger and I think that crosses party lines I'm I'm I honestly don't know how this is going to play out I Am as interesting as the next person because I don't know what the right way still politically\nHere and then ... and let me just I just went to a so you have been a victim in the past\nYou know it's an interesting point 'cause I I don't think victim is the right word I don't think survivor is the right word I think target target is the right word\nAnd victim of sexual assault and sexual harassment\nThis is the third week in the row are we going to row where we're a female guest on this show has admitted to some form of of sexual or a as being a victim\nOkay here's my question\nJust and everybody should talk about what lesson\nDid women who have been sexually assaulted in the past what lesson did they learn last week because of these hearings [noise]\nThe lesson that I learned is that it does not rise to the level of policy and the Republican Party now I don't know\nI I Would agree completely I think the lesson they learned is that the is Republican agenda trumps everything oh no pun intended including you know individual um and powerful experiences uh I think anyone\nWho watched Christie and Bob ... testimony um you know saw that this is a woman whose entire life path was really altered and and you know who she is today was\nReally affected by whatever occurred you know\nBut the leader ... ... ... as an attorney by the way I Would agree with that heavy watched it I was moved by her testimony but as a lawyer and also as a journalist\nThere were some questions that need to be asked no one step forward to cooperate her story including her best friend nobody ... we we don't know I as a lawyer I mean how do you\nHow do you react to that\nThat's a great question I just like to make two points one there was really no opportunity for the FBI to get the input and the testimony or that their sworn statements of the folks who would have stepped up their tons of reports of cross the media to new\nYork Times about there were four people that she indentified that we're at the party just for and the FBI talk to us for\nNo one would cooperate\n... I if there were others that couldn't cooperated\nWhy were they not mentioned over the last thirty five years why would they not mentioned to her psychologist and most importantly when the microphones in the world were on and everybody was watching or why didn't she mentioned other names she mentioned for names and and they all interviewed by the FBI more than once she mentioned for\nNames at the you know so called party which wasn't a party it was a gathering and again I I I'm not a senator I didn't have access to a small room to the hundred page report was sitting in I had no chance to look at it I don't know what was said by those books\nBut your point about me as a lawyer and what would I Do this was in a criminal prosecution\nSo if I were interviewing at a fast food restaurant and someone called my Putin manager and said\nHey Peter sexually assaulted me or in the second person said yes he did that to meet you in a third said and sorted by a bar fight and he was a belligerent drunks I wouldn't even get the job as a checkout clerk and this is the person who's going to be one of nine who will be dictating policy that affects men women sexual assault survivors et cetera for another few decades past ... seven\nBackground checks over a million pages of documents\nCamera or has been subjected to thirty two hours of testimony has been subjected to more scrutiny than any Supreme Court justice in history and so getting back to your original question about I'm\nDr Ford who I feel very badly for I really do um\nThink the lesson is\nTo trust your story and not to trust your um [noise] um\nThat the Democrats are going to take care of you because the way that Dianne Feinstein in her office handled this frankly is absolutely despicable and what I Want to see happen as a full investigation of who leaked Dr Ford's name I wanted to do as of this site before that fee for what the Dianne Feinstein [noise]\nWhy didn't she get her best friend [noise]\nThe best friend before she wrote a letter to anybody\nJustice ... imagine can you imagine anyone justice Rehnquist Justice Scalia anyone\nHaving that sort of demeanor\nNew money spent attack like this unfairly and the way that the ... these Democrats said within hours of him being nominated that they weren't going to support him so what what were they opt to do they already they work\nOut to try to get to the truth or the bottom line of this they were out to this for this mess and I feel like I Want to see a fighter ... the fiction that the Supreme Court is not political we ought to just dispensed with that because we all know that's not the case but\nI I just we now see that's why they wear robes\nThat's why I mean justice Rehnquist did not vote\nBecause he felt he did not want to ... to ... a chief justice Rehnquist did not vote because he did not want to feel that when someone came in front of him he had an interest one way or the other\nI realize that these are human beings that they're at the products of their education and their background but I think that we expect our challenges to do whatever they can to put his type partisanship on both sides and and the thing early Caesar's\nLife but what are we at the end of our senators look talk about that do should we expect more of\nOur Center for senators don't serve lifetime appointments or senators aren't you know sanctioned under article through the constitution they're not picked by the president I mean or centers be voted out after six years I think our senators have term limits because some of them seem to be serving\nLife a lifetime appointments but I think that the Senate has long since kind of law\nMore and more like the house every day is uh is is violating a confidence uh\nHow should we do that in the in the in the political climate that's one of the big issues and and and Josh is brought up that's one of the big issues because when when the Democrats are ... you know when all this came out\nThe Republicans made a very good point during the first part of the the uh the testimony when they when they were all testify is that they were looking for fairness and I think\nThe Republicans stole the fairness issue for those watching on MTV land and they owned it\nAnd then the camera and says well then we need we need the FBI investigation and then Jeff Flake says okay let's have the FBI investigation at that point I think the Democrats stole the fairness issue back\nBecause they are good well it was only for a week or what they did an interview so I mean that's that's on the issue but the biggest issue is I don't think anybody who who watches this and the Democrats want to avoid this as much as possible nobody can say that that the the likely\nA leakers of her identity\nMore either someone on science diet staff or someone on on on the judiciary staff horse or her or her friends and ask you a lawyer you're probably right but but that person that person decided to violate her confidence\nThey violated her\nDid she talent she didn't think it would get out what was the point that she knew it would get out you know she said\nThat she wanted to alert the White House about Brett Kavanaugh before the president made the appointment now that's like you said I find that a little hard to believe\nThat she felt by going to her democratic congresswoman that was the best way to get information to the White House she's a PHD you could call the FBI local office you could've called the White House switch board and you would have spoken to somebody who would have listened to her story they may not have believed that everyone who tried to\nCall the FBI switch more to say ... to give credit rating testimony apparently were given the runaround and told to file something on line
