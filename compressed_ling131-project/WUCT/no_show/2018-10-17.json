U. X. caught this term by a local New England guy collie car\nNice if we we love and we love how we how he's a great guy yeah of folk honest Pocahontas either way we will talk about that with Jeff deal he's up next season Republican taking on Elizabeth Warren\nBurr's Senate seats right here next on the job that showed on such a [noise] you're listening to ... [noise]\nOr that basically said that she was a ... a directory this for lawyers that colleges that want to hire and look at you know\nWhen she got the University of Pennsylvania she insisted should be a listed\nAs Native American but when she got to Harvard and got that job she demus yourself\nFrom that national directory as Native Americans are clearly when she was done using that it was a ... out important do anymore and she never went to any Native American events on campus or the fact is she never apologized for that the issue has been bothering people for a long time but you know he's the one who ended up yesterday opening Pandora's box and talking about\nIt well I'm with you this was going to go away I mean the president calling her Pocahontas makes it look like he's a ... she's the victim she complained about card the fact that she did a DNA test\nAnd put the results out there that proves that you and I are more Native American and she is and I'm not at all or ... that just doesn't make any sense she actually she looked through you a softball or if you're the president of softball or do you think that she ... going in because she's not stupid do you think that she thought going into this was going to be\nThe victory for whoever Trump and possibly that get thrown the national stage to be the nominee and twenty twenty\nBut it was a couple of things going I think she knew she had to try to put the issue aside somehow she was going to do twenty twenty and\nIt during the Kavanaugh hearings he was so desperate to make the national scene that she documented video and did a fundraising letter off of that that she also did another fundraising letter off the uncorroborated\nOr testimony of Dr for all of this basically to try to make her name out the national headlines at a time when she's competing with Kamala Harris and of course a center a Spartacus yeah I mean that's what the oil is for her to try to beat the far left progressive nominees for a two thousand and twenty and again in Massachusetts not\nFirst of all she has missed leading us for a long time you know she was on meet the press saying that she has no intention of running for president Joan yet said that many times and then all of a sudden she says I'm going to take a hard look at it we found out with the Washington Post story just this last weekend that basically she's been spending a lot of money ... million dollars on candidates\nAround the country raising over seven million dollars for candidates I she's of course then to Ohio recently has done for their candidate for governor ... in Pennsylvania in Oklahoma a few weekends ago while I was up in Lawrence dealing with people with the gas line explosions here in our state so she's been spending a considerable amount of time\nUh basically working on that presidential run and now I think people in Massachusetts or fully aware she has no intention of working for them show uh spend the next two years if she's reelected\nTraveling around the country a delivery nothing for us well\nShe's actually also admitted that she ... she would not commit to uh to to living on her term if she wins again she says I Can't promise that all state senator for the next six years which is something that you will promise right\n\nThe fishing industry the opioid crisis and things I've been working on things I Know I can continue to work on a whereas she's been MIA and I think I'm\nRight now it's really interesting there's a move a foot in the state to try to get Deval Patrick ... he's the former governor of Massachusetts has become a candidate\nFor a running in twenty twenty so it's interesting even the Democrats in Massachusetts seem to be trying to crowd her out of this field because I think it's clear at this point\nShe really can't avoid stepping in it any time she's on the national stage whether it's calling law enforcement and criminal justice system racist whether it's saying that anybody who voted for Trump as part of a stew of racist I mean she really just has that same negative tone that Hillary Clinton had as well\nYeah I agree totally it's Jeff deal he's a Republican running against Elizabeth Warren for Senate in Massachusetts but you run a ... and that's it's a pretty good place to do because\nThe Republicans were looking like it might be a bad November ah do ... whatever that is as you mentioned been retired Goldman when you're being away but anyway\nUh the wave allegedly was gonna give them a house back the Senate was going to be very close might even give them the Senate now it looks like\nThey might gain three or four seats including you um because she would just comment on even those who were center center center left to live in Massachusetts do not like with the left just dude you're not hearing are you finding meant to be the case are you feeling this the impact of Kavanaugh on or near Tennessee or no\nYeah there's a lot of people in Massachusetts or that feel that he was railroaded I'm the father of two daughters so of course I Want them to be listening to something happened but\nThe fact is there was no corroborated evidence with a a basically an eleventh hour smear attempt a\nDianne Feinstein her the Senate or the ranking member of the judiciary could have had that uh those allegations investigated in private six weeks earlier she didn't she chose to drop it like a bombshell too embarrassed if a man and she ended up ruining two lives on the accuser any accused and in the process made\nThe Senate look increasingly bad and I think that people are so sick and tired of Washington looking dysfunctional and they know that Warren is basically the tip of that dysfunctional spear a again because she takes such awful actions about going out there and basically saying presumption of innocence the cornerstone of our democracy that means nothing if you want to just\nMake sure that Republicans don't get their nominee for the Supreme Court ah that partisanship doesn't work even in Massachusetts and I I'll say this Joe\nYou know we are the state where Ted Kennedy used to hold the same seat and even though he was the liberal lion of the Senate he would work with Republican presidents and Republican governors to deliver for our state people are sick and tired of war and not delivering and then becoming a national embarrassment as well\nI Wonder if Massachusetts is ready for somebody who's not found overwhelming regulation overwhelming grace of of government overwhelming taxation because to me when I was warned other than the Pocahontas stuff\nThe thing that comes to mind is she's basically your social she's basically far leftists that shows if we control everything we're smart people they knew people will have a better life I don't want her to control me who does that really what it is it's sort of be the guy who believes in independence liberty and freedom against the person who believes that she's the smartest person in the room\n[laughter] I'm an Eagle Scout I always thought you'd have to have a campground better than you found it I ran for office at the age of forty and now in fifty running for the Senate never thought I'd be doing this but it's something I think is calling it's not supposed to be a career and I'll tell you with Elizabeth Warren wanted war and wanting to nationalize business of having government determine what your board of directors\nComposition should be you know that's one step towards Venezuela and look at what's going on right there she wants health care to be run\nBy government and if you know if you like having a you know dialysis six months after you needed a like England has sure go to that socialist healthcare like having hip replacements after five years\nGo to Canada but if you like having the United states where we actually get procedures done in a timely manner you know we shouldn't have government running our health care and so you know one cannot have government run our lives enough in fact she wants to access to the point where I think\nWent up to and we don't know the feeling I guess the the host said Ninety percent might be too much and she agreed that somewhere between fifty percent Ninety percent ... take a year income gal\nThat just doesn't make any sense artist Jeff deal he's a Republican running for US Senate against Elizabeth Warren in Massachusetts I Wish it nothing but the best I Know you've got to a debate coming up\nFriday night or your kick some ass in that and let's talk again before the midterm I I I really hope to

bankers the Federal Reserve\nAnd how they relate to the news cycle and what I've learned from you is that they don't relate to the news cycle it's just our understanding that when the Federal Reserve speaks in some fashion we must react I'm going to guess that I can extend that to the central banker of Europe Mariel jogging\nExplain again John how it is that the central bankers have so much power who is who we warships them where is this cold and how ... how do we get out of it grieving to John\n... well John I think economists worship central banks central banks employ a lot of them and economists are the source of information for reporters who are trying to create a narrative about what's happening in the markets and the economy\nPlus remember just as an example economists almost to a man and woman thing that all the maiming killing and wealth destruction that was World War two at an upside called economic growth and so it's based on bad information but we're supposed to believe that the Fed's\nInterest rate hike in its its attempts to hike the short rate of credit which is really old is is a target\nHas somehow out of nowhere spook markets for such a view isn't serious not only is the fed and not a rate setter the fed is a rape follow where the fed follows markets and moves up its rate based on what the markets are doing what we have to remember\nInvestors have known for at least a year or two that the fed was going to do what it's doing so the idea that investors would just now be reacting to what's been known for quite some time isn't serious the markets story is not a ... story but that's the story that the media like to promote because that's what economists tell them is the story\nThe Federal Reserve sets a target rage uh for the best lenders we're told John that the best lenders that would be the banks too big to fail even bigger\nAre having a very good quarter and they've had a very good year and all the other indices and indicate that corporations are making a lot of money the profits are very strong that the U.S economy is very strong\nAnd the world and ... the U.S economy does the world also envy our federal\nWe won't embarrass you for the

Post and we start not with the mystery of the missing perhaps murdered a journalist for the Washington Post in the Saudi embassy in Istanbul we start with the number one hundred and ten billion dollars of arms sales to Saudi Arabia\nAnnounced claimed asserted by the Trump Administration that is part of the mystery of cuts choking\nJosh I'm very good evening to you one hundred and ten billion dollars sizeable and the president was commenting on it most recently in his interview with sixty minutes this hundred and ten billion dollars is a guaranteed as Congress part of this conversation about Saudi Arabia are\nAnd the murder of a journalist good evening to\nGetting things on the issue of us arms sales to Saudi Arabia is back in the news because members of Congress in both parties on both chambers\nHave are looking for ways to exert pressure on the Saudi regime to give up information about the disappearance of ... and uh this is the thing that they think that they can use to\nUm at least try to convince the Saudis to reveal what they know and uh participate in or be investigations in the way that\nShe has laid on his disappearance now going on over two weeks and of course when President Trump was asked about this he immediately said no no no we can't do that you know his excuse is reasons were that it would affect us jobs and met a Saudi Arabia might\nTurn to us rivals like Russia and China are but it's also important to note that President Trump\nLikes these arms sales because he tells them as a major achievement in the U.S Saudi Arabia relationship that he introduced himself a mostly because\nWhen he went to Riyadh on his first ever trip abroad last year\nThe this is what the big announcement was this was the big deliverable this is what he says itchy now if you look at it that a hundred and ten billion dollars is grossly exaggerated some of it it deals that have been in the pipeline says the Obama administration\nSome event or aspirational deals that may or may not ever materialize and then there's a small subset of that where those deals are actually moving but those deals that are actually moving are now in limbo because they have to go through a congressional process to and there's no way that in this current environment without\nSome sort of resolution to the question of the Saudi regime Roland is your most parents that Congress is going to let this happen now what I argued today in the Washington Post very simple as that you\nKnow whether or not you believe that our arms sales to Saudi Arabia represents leverage that we could use to pressure them what President Trump is done by taking it off the table by saying that actually know this is something that we need from the study is he's completely reverse that dynamic he's turned it into Saudi leverage on us\nFor no particular reason that I can see you and you know what that's done is sort of now plays the ... states in a position where any country who is selling us arms has it easy\nOut of jail free card whenever they run afoul of something that we believe violates our norms are rights or you know the rights of our citizens and residents and\nWeak as it is a but it could have far reaching effects and uh it definitely doesn't help sector Mike Pompeo is in Riyadh trying to get the Saudis to play ball and back here in Washington President Trump is just taking quiver arrows out of his quiver\nDisappears a genuine geostrategic paradox Josh\nI mentioned that staying with Riad we also have to deal with Iran\nWe also have to deal with Ankara and then there was the Gulf Cooperation council so there are cross purposes in all directions as we go forward I cheat on the hundred and ten billion dollars of arms sales because that is a way of supporting what is our all ally in the contest with the wrong\nAnd I puzzle about Congress and that contest putting pressure on Saudi Arabia doesn't that boost Tehran isn't that also a factor here in addition to the money\nWell you're right there's no doubt that a a U.S Saudi diplomatic flare up undermines this trip in ministry ages main\nDiplomatic initiative right now which is to coalesce coalition supports pushback against Iran's malign influence cut off Iranian oil which depends on the Saudis pumping more oil and given that we're not working with the Europeans on that really you know the Gulf\nWould make it much greater difference and the severity of forest fires than trying to do anything for global warming\nOr the contrast between fires on private lands which are very low and on public managed lands are very very great if you look at the Akron\nOr is it down globally about Seventy or eighty percent from what they were around Nineteen hundred it's a striking the climate is going on and so is every you don't want to look at a dramatic incident that\nDay when you have to do is to get aggregate data in the aggregate data doesn't support the claim that the fire system is going out of control and to the extent that there are changes the thought that somehow they would want to change the entire economy instead of figuring out how to manage forests in a more sensible fashion\nIs wildly over broad you're looking at the wrong thing there are no solutions that would work better even way you build houses the kind of clear as you do and so forth there are many many things that could be done to deal with fires without having to have the kinds of transformation that the IOC PCC is talking\nAbout hurricane so aside clones the allegation is made that they will deepen and increase in severity and striking the land you provide a chart in your defining ideas these\nThat suggests we're not looking at increased since we're looking at cycles and this goes back to Nineteen Seventy I'm going to guess then we go back even farther anecdotally will see the same cycle\nYou know generally speaking the data gets a little bit spot here's who go earlier\nBut it's the same thing and they were huge

warming theorists is\nIf in fact you have all these things going up and down up and down\nYou can't explain the ups and downs by movement in carbon dioxide levels which has been consistently but gradually up with over very long period of time so you've got to get other forces to explain what's going on when Richard Lyndon\nGave his lecture in England but he says you know a bunch of other forces like water vapors for example that can be doing it and there are other things that are local which do this so\nIf you're trying to figure out the way in which the system works\nIt's a terrible mistake to assume that the only independent very ... you have\nAny source or significance as carbon dioxide\nThe dependent variable is temperature or what happens is there is a law known as the rainiest this law which says that given certain sensitivity assumptions as carbon dioxide changes\nYou take the log with them to the base to the base the um it means that you're going to get a slower than linear increase in the amount of combat but that's everything else being equal but the moment you realized that water vapor is probably the more powerful greenhouse gas\nAnything you do to change what's happening to carbon dioxide may be able to fix a fifth of the problem but it's not going to touch the other eighty percent of that particular problem so the return from investments are going to be lower and you don't see anything whatsoever in the IPC\nStudies that I've looked at which kind of try to do an intelligent of cost benefit analysis of where we go my own view on this stuff is\nUh

replace them so they kept choosing literally dying that and Gorbachev at fifty three and row lost\nOne of them said and what it was clear that they couldn't stop Gorbachev he is criminally young women or young they were already approaching eighty so we divert from the story of that but it raises the it also points to another moment\nWhen intelligence agencies can have exceedingly important political influence of the top\nAnd that is when there's opposition to the leader and the leader is weak weak physically or I Would submit to you\nWe politically as Trump is today because this cloud of suspicion hangs over him and also because he hasn't quite gotten the hang of how to exercise power in Washington but there are\nLarge openings for quote rogue\nOperations by intelligence today and

wouldn't say that I don't know enough but I Would say that they're it's clear you and I now agree that they are playing a very big role today\nThey are not a constitutional branch of our government so

Nineteen eighty one or two that the CIA needed to know when they see information was coming from they needed to know who was the British spy that was producing this great amount of material because the Brits were passing along the stuff\nTo the CIA but they would never say where it came from that's kind of one of the conventions in international kind of spy craft if you don't give away all souls

ostensibly Soviet been working for the west and his identity is now being investigated by an American a double agent ostensibly working for the U.S but actually working soon to be working for the Soviet Union that reads like the plot out of a novel\nWhat seems completely unlike the doesn't it but it is I suppose one of the things that he's Saturday in the house of espionage which is that it's all about is that you know it's all about\nKind of double crossing rarely ... and older changes the fact that he figured in all sorts of ways I mean he he did it for money but but you know he'd been a a an officer of the CIA for very long time and he knew a lot of secrets and he clearly\nKnew the identity of let go the ski he was able to hand it to the Soviet Union\nAnd the the two are despite the

access to an for the worst war criminals in history\nThe first seven killing books they're Seventeen million copies in print which makes it the most uh the bestselling nonfiction a series of books and history rather ah\nYeah we're off to a good start with that says about a hundred and forty thousand first six days we've sold and getting pretty good reviews in the folks and I hope people check it out\nI'm sure they will we will uh delve into this particular one as well as some of the the big stories of the day that we have to pick your brain about as well but just as sort of a prologue to this whole thing here\nHow did the killing series began it it's not a a a cheery topic of discussion what was it that prompted the whole notion\n[noise] well I've had fourteen or New York times number one bestsellers and I had seven of them writing about contemporary stuff\nUm the O'Reilly factor the nose spends on who's looking out for you culture warrior that kind of thing but then I had I had said it you know I was repeating myself so I went to my publisher I said you know and a former history teacher I I\nThink I can make history come alive and I want to do a series of books on topics that interest me so they laughed and said okay fine and they didn't think I was serious so the I outline killing Lincoln the first killing book and they said well is fifty thousand Lincoln books\nI said yeah but not this entertaining not like this so actually Jim I took a real big salary cut from the publisher um and I said let me give it a shot and then killing Lincoln has been the best selling 'em all the killing books still in print and the rest is history as they say pardon the\nPun as they say and ah pardon the pun and do you have a passion for history don't you're not just because you've

[noise] [noise] [noise]\n\n\nLooking back to the gym ... one eight six six five oh jumbo one eight six six five oh five or six to six as we talk with\nBill O'Reilly his latest in the killing series killing the ss co written with Martin do guard is are already working its way up to the the top of the best seller lists and there were going to look a bit of just what this book reveals because like most of the things that bill is tackled you look at the titles you'll say oh well I Know about that\nAnd what it usually is the case is you know some of the things about that so the first broad picture of the world war two Nazi Germany is collapsing\nAnd the rats are fleeing the sinking ship that much we know what I did not realize until ah killing the ss came along bill was the extent to which some of these people\nHad help from the United states government\nSure um after Iraq killing Patton which became an enormous salary a lot of material leftover biggest Patton\nUh was an occupier in southern Germany\nOr before he was a killer met his death in the hospital in Germany and the prevailing wisdom from pat and and many other a powerful people in the U.S government was we've got to use these captured Nazis to spy and work against the Soviet Union\nWhich is moving in and wants to conquer a Europe\nAnd you'll remember him from killing ... bad one actually fight them you wanted to fight Stalin yeah so that's what the new CIA or that took over from the AOL says did\nThey enlisted a lot of these uh ss people and get ... people to spy against ah the Soviet Union work against the Soviet Union\nAnd they didn't really much care what they did during the war in addition there was an organization set up by Heinrich Hitler their head of the ss one of the most vile human beings ever to walk the planet\nCalled Odessa and handling knew about a year a before the third Reich collapse of Germany was going to lose and him with what he can negotiate except for peace is kind of crazy delusional stuff\nFrom him but he formed this organization and they had a lot of money and a lot of assassins within the organization and so they helped these guys get out of Germany we have a you know we tell you step by step how that happened\nAnd also the American not the American Red Cross in in Switzerland helped them or elements of the Vatican help them and they got them from Germany down to a general way Italy and on boats to Spain South America and South Africa ah it it was an amazing assembly line to get these guys out and\nWe took a big guys and we took it I meant andme angle a class Barbie the Bush early on and Martin Borman who the myth was died in Berlin as a as Hitler committed\nSuicide well he didn't he got away to South America and we kind of we proved that in the book by dental work and so it was a compelling compelling a story almost on every page um and I want Americans particularly younger Americans to understand\nThese ss people I mean they were farmers and bankers and merchants they didn't go to hell university and you wouldn't World War two broke out they just signed up and put on a black uniform with the death said go on a cap and ... and ran a concentration camps where they could kill millions of people yeah\nWe just ordinary people are just amazing I'm ... and when you read it people to all that couldn't happen yeah it it it and it could happen here by the way\nA will certainly return to that thought here in a moment that it could happen here and by the way I happen to agree with you but I'm sure many out there are a raise their eyebrows right now at the thought of that I certainly understand the motivation\nBut I have to ask in retrospect since we now have a three quarters of a century since World War two and certainly time to weigh whether this was even remotely worth it is there any kind of justification\nFor whatever intelligence these people may have revealed to justify what this country and others the Vatican and others did in in the sparing these people and spirited him away is there any justification at all\nNo\nBut it's another case of people looking away from evil\nThat is what Harry Truman did ill and killing the assets we show you how Harry Truman almost had to be black male to go after Adolf Eichmann ... they had to say if you don't Mr President and we're going to lead to the press that you're not going to go after I\nWho who did that and that that forced forced Truman to do it who who who blackmail on it who blackmailed him\nI'm a element in the state department made it clear\nAnd we named the man I'm that if true mended and signed the order for the CIA to look for a man that he was going to go public with it he was a judge\nOr an American judge who was at Nuremberg\nAnd it turned his stomach that the U.S government was looking the other way and didn't want to know or hear about the atrocities that happened to the concentration camps\nAnd an insult true that Harry Truman was a bad man he just didn't want to acknowledge it is the same thing in in in a FDR FDR knew that the Nazis were mowing down innocent people knew it\nBut he couldn't sell it or wouldn't sell it because half

man himself a [noise]\nYogi was not just a normal reporter not even close there was there was much more to the man\nLike I said he worked hand in hand inside a the royal family he was the editor of the main news paper there which their main goal was to make sure that nothing ever was said bad about the about the Saudi royal family ever ever ever and he was in charge of that\nFor years for decades\nSo his ... he was he made a lot of money the Saudi Government or the royals pay them a lot to be in charge of making sure nothing bad about them was ever a result of the newspaper\nHe was also\nA tied in with Osama bin Laden\nHe had befriended Osama bin Laden in the eighties and nineties in Afghanistan and Sudan\nHe was I'm employed by the Saudi intelligence services to try to persuade bin Laden to make peace with the Saudi royal family\nAnd he apparently was championed a of Osama bin Laden jihad against the Soviets he would write about it and the newspapers there and and that was part of his his role\nSo he knows exactly the background and the intimate dealings between al ... and the Saudi family leading up to the nine eleven attacks\nSo he had yet inside dirt on everybody in the Saudi family but again it wasn't it if he got killed because of all of these connections I\nI had to be more than just he was a reporter had to be more than that he was a he wasn't official on the inside and had dirt a new things about the about the royal family that people on the outside did not\nPhone number is eight five five to nine five sixty six hundred Craig and Yuba City California Hello Craig\nHey Tom thanks for having me on your bed as far as this guy goes I I honestly I could care less\nAnd lately because just because they say was a journalist so that really doesn't mean anything what if he was a spy Tom he could be a spy for numerous organizations and if he was a spy and he was caught\nMost countries they execute their spies and we used to do that but now we just put them in prison for the rest of their life right so before he went into that meeting he tells his fiance hey if I don't come out you need to call this number so he knew\nSomething was up I mean he knew there was some reason he may not come out of that meeting so why do they go into it I mean yeah I don't know I just uh\nHas this story is the story is he was getting papers to prove he had to get some documents to prove that he had divorced his previous wife so he could marry the woman that was the news in the car a wedding warm outside but I I don't know have you ever gone into a building and sold your spouse\nYeah I knew there was there was a huge risk he was not your average ordinary reporter there was something much bigger about this guy that was a little worried to the Saudi royal family\nYeah no I I went into some ... spouses places and said if I don't come out some kind of better call [laughter] but I've never not not like this guy but what if he was a spy Tom seriously if he was a spy then all bets are off and most of those other countries so\nI'm I'm just not that ah all bent out of shape over this thing I just uh well\nThe the Saudis may have been worried about the fact that he had become a spy for the U.S because he did come to Washington and a Pentagon official\nSaid they had a plan to take the Saudi out of Arabia at it involved establishing a council of select Saudi people in mecca to govern the country um\nWith us being basically the the puppet master so a lot of that Saudi team the Pentagon was in regular contact with one of them was to show he so I don't think you're far from the truth they're great we can't prove it but he\nMade like like you Tom I don't know that we're ever really got to know and I don't think turkey has got to be a reliable source to find out either for that matter so um I don't know and I'm not all that concerned about it myself\nWell a lot of people seem to be 'cause this story is not going to lead story again today and I thought really we are truly stuck on the case for some reason but Craig always good to talk to you I appreciate your call very much phone number is eight five five to nine five sixty six hundred you

the weaponry the factors yes they couldn't turn toward Russia but in that case they have so much other uh weaponry that depends on a\nIndependence our funding us to function so when they need us one of the way they them yes it's important that they'd be an ally but again it's more important to them that the U.S has on this side I think we have to say some sort of economic sanctions we have to put a clear statement out demonizing them as a sale evil as was and also I Know Senator Lindsey Graham said\nThat one requirement shouldn't be that the crime fringe who's opposing the heir apparent that he'd be pushed aside you can have this type behavior in the civilized world\nYeah Marco Rubio's talking about Congress is going to take some action Lindsey Graham saying you the the prince or has to be moved out David Sanger from the New York times says he can't see the U.S putting any sanctions on the Saudis\nWell they may try and I'm certain that they will get some through but the fact of the matter is the president's got enormous latitude hearing usually can suspend all kinds of sanctions for national security reasons and the president as you've seen\nHas been willing to define national security and the broadest possible ways what the president already said he's already said that he\nWanted to protect the arms deal because of jobs in the United states he certainly is I don't want to protect oil flows\nParticularly of the time that were in conflict there growing conflict\nWith Iran so it's hard for me right now to understand what other than symbolic actions they may make against the Saudis in fact at this point the treasury secretary still going to the conference in a way\nYeah so David Sanger says he's he sees all kinds of different things we can do but it will probably just be symbolic or Errol Louis who is a New York one political guide says\nHe sees it would be hard for the U.S to put pressure on the Saudis overnight\nYeah no I'm let's keep in mind that hundred and ten billion dollar arms deal with the president talked about turns out that something like a less than Fifteen Percent of that is actually transfer\nOr been trans active so far so we don't know what was really going to happen and I suppose Congress could sort of throw some stones in the path and say really want to do but it's unclear how big of a deal that was in the first place and then I guess secondly when it comes to the Magnitsky Act or what they really have the power to do on the congressional side\nIs to order a report from the executive but as David is exactly right the president has all kinds of discretion to implement it to spend that time delay it and so targeted sanctions that individuals which we know is a factor of actually putting her on a regime is not something we can expect to happen overnight\nYeah well I'll go back to being again because Peter Kenyon talking about the fact that ah the Saudis needed more than we need them because I mean we become so much stronger with our oil and\nYes we have but we are still getting um about\nMillion barrels of crude oil each and every day\nGood Saudi Arabia is shipments to the U.S have gone down and down and out\nUm we\nBrought in nine hundred and forty three thousand barrels\nPer day from the Saudis ah last year\nYep two thousand Seventeen so almost a million barrels a day comment sounds like a lot it is a lot\nBut we are still dropping down to the point where now the energy information administration says that we're down to six hundred Ninety thousand barrels of crude\nThat is the law was that we have seen\nSince Ronald Reagan was in office\nSo do we need them kind of I mean we still\nGet out of our we import almost eight million barrels a day in this country and a million of that eight million comes from well now it's not that is less just as three quarters of a million the best of oil a day from Saudi Arabia\nThat would be hard to replace were getting their body that they're not gonna choppers off overnight but uh\nThe Saudis do and that's why the crown prince is trying to diversify their economy that they can't rely upon oil sales from here on out\nOn video games matter radio that

believe the best thing to happen to the Democratic party would be for them to lose because of how they're trying to win\nOr lose lose big and this is what's so important and we've seen over the last

will sit down\nFocus realize you know it's not Trump is not Russia it's not ... it's a it's a bad message it's the resistance it's the violence the mob rule and then I think they may engage in some

your enemies I\nThink that's absolutely right and I think that um look to the President Trump in the UP up an excellent message to bring into black communities that we can talk about the fact that the black unemployment rate is at the lowest\nIn us history or when the economy grows at a about four percent versus about two percent under Obama double what we were told a couple of years ago was the new normal and the ceiling and growth that such as good for white people that's good for black people it's good for Hispanics it's for everybody in this country\nAnd he ought to go into black neighborhoods and and and preach this and it's very hard to accused him of being a racist weights black people he's actually meeting with black people\nRight or at once it might it might it might not say things like Herschel Walker Jim Brown they're friends of his go with people that need to be converted to do it in a civil way of begin to change the tone ... who's the most ... what is the most

people in it involved the economy or talk about corporate uh\nShe's a detractors distract them at the Democrats are running around talking about ancestry dot com and all this and that that's a pretty weak message for them to deliver a\nDrew agrees with you it's Jim Messina David Axelrod to democratic strategist who cannot believe that she did that and she still has a Senate race to win that's

of Virginia and they've been able to flip a Virginia Colorado I used to be a red state what purple and blue and this base on Denver and Boulder\nUh the major those major population centers or where you have these major colleges and universities so I think that the Republican Party of nice to have more strategic vision and and they used to go into these major urban centers where you see the

to reaching across the aisle there's no currency for that anymore there's no incentive\nWell that is Senator Jeff flake decision theirs and and that's his conclusion is part of the reason why is that race is numbers were terrible and he thinks it's because I Believe that he liked to reach across the aisle and maybe take on the president\nThe author of eh the sub Antos here where did you get this number is named his book guinea is an outstanding poster with CBS what do you think about Jeff Flake just said\nYou know it's interesting and I and I talk about this some of the book myself is this this animosity between the right in the left wing Democrats and Republicans\nUm look ... ... is there among among a group of people who are really ideological and really passionate about politics\nThey see the other side as you know we've we've done pole and they see them as a threat they see them as different from they are the sides politics um that's what everybody\nYou know that's not everybody there there is a middle in that regard there are people who are just tired of the back and forth want sensible solutions to Prague\nAmerican citizens or politicians do you think these politicians should have more courage of their head in the past be willing to lose their seat in order to do what they think\nRight well you know like I I don't know what the politicians are thinking but I Do know this\nCampaign seemed to make a choice between whether they think an election is a base election which means you've got to go out and get those most fervent partisans get them out there\nFor you or persuasion election\nAnd they look at the numbers and they see that people are getting harder and harder to persuade\nSo you understand why these campaigns go after you know the other side's the ... you know the bad folks and we've just got to mobilize our own\nAnd that may contribute to it I I Will tell you this real quick Bryant you know we just stayed in the last part of this poll asked a question or the party's arguing about the kinds of policies they like or dislike or the kind of people that they like or dislike and most of the partisan saw the other\nIt's like as opposed to policy boy that that's hard to educate yeah that's that's that's hard to negotiate when you when you become very very personal\nAnd I think there are a lot of Americans who have a reaction against that top three issues that matter most to your polling for these midterms um health care keeps on that rule hopping up yeah health care no matter how many times we ask get healthcare keeps popping up\nThe direction of the country generally and I will tell you this you know the president a either a pro or con is shaping up to be the biggest factor for a president\nThat we have seen in mid term typically it's a majority a little more than a majority who say they go to the midterm vote with the president on their mind to 'em but we're looking at record numbers for the number of people who said that this year both for and against both ... both for and against\nThe most intriguing race or some of look to New Jersey that sentiment end as who we had a hung jury that kept him out of jail a and there was censured by the Senate\n... we wish we did pull that race and we had Menendez up but you know here's a case again where you've got partisanship New Jersey's a blue state so people ... break along partisan lines and a lot of that seems to have put aside there were people who who weren't thrilled with with what a senator Menendez it done on board voting for him anyway in that regard but\nThat it helps the Democrats in places like that it hurts in places like\nSay Missouri Leslie Florida's Senate race Nelson versus got yeah was that hurricane done for Scott do you think you could have pulled it yet because you in the middle of trying to help yet\nThey haven't pulled it yet the suspicion is the questions that we'll ask is you know does that give Scott a chance to look like he's doing something to act like an executive oftentimes NATO natural disasters\nDo give somebody in power a chance to to do that so that'll be one of the key things will watch God Knows what you look at it as a dead heat virtually they'd probably is I think the governor's race there probably helps boost turnout that puts a bit of a wild card and it was just a given yeah the mayor of

future speaker Nancy Pelosi said about the president's push to build a border wall especially in light of the caravan of over a thousand people were heading to our border cut Seventeen\nAnd\nAll\n\n\nI\nThink it's a man who'd issue\nUm I I think that ah that's ridiculous I the the president's job\nIs to enforce our laws in this Nancy Pelosi's job to make the laws if she doesn't like the laws of the book is her job to fix them and train and and and and and to legislate\nAnd she is basically campaigning on issues that she's created\nUm we need to secure our borders I Believe that legal legal immigration is a moral and economic imperative for this country by illegal immigration must be stopped Nancy Pelosi is part and parcel to the problem\nAnd she's refusing to solve it because ah for her own political gain we need to send people to Washington who are more intent on keeping us all safe\nWho are intent on upholding our values as Americans and not continuing to to divide us ah like Nancy Pelosi and and the establishment politicians are doing\nHave you dealt a John with a race issues in your life\nUm I I have I have my mom and dad\nAre taught me that I Would need to be twice as good to be considered half as worthy and so I I've always uh endeavor to ah to do my best or put God first er into served my country and that's what I'm doing now I'm like I said before I just have a future good friends are the folks who uh who just don't know me yet\nA and I'm going to show through my actions that it's not about black or white spot red white and blue and I'm looking forward representing us all very well\nDo you think we are getting better at this as a society as a country uh judging people equally not on the color of their skin\nOr I think that um\nI'm In the political prejudice than beginning to see\n'em you have this political prejudice what people are beginning to assume they know exactly who you are because we are or the the by your name and when I went to Iraq I didn't fight for Democrats or Republicans\nI fought for Americans and so people are are assuming that uh that uh uh that they know who I Am and what I'm all about just because of the party I'm running and I'm an independent thinker too many people have died for me to have the right to vote to think for myself and we outsourced\nOur our thought process and in in our ability to to vote in the lead for ourselves to a political establishment the cares more about getting re elected than representing the people a part of the American dream is not only being able to elect our leadership but also the dream of being leadership\nWe have in the system right now in this country where the only way you can be a U.S senator is it your super wealthy or if you're a super connected if you're a political politician career politician that's wrong and I think that people are are are are getting Americans against each other\nA ... and then blame the other side when things get done our country is in the throes of a generational change and the Dems and liberal media wants to keep talking about um about things that continue to inflame a and I'm looking forward to bringing us together because I've seen what what a partisan sectarian divisions\nCan do when I went over to Iraq Sunni fighting Shia cousins fighting cousins\nOr we have a history in this country of family fighting and when we cannot go back that way\nAnd so yes we still have a racial tensions racial divides we still have gender issues and gender divide but despite our issues we're still the best country in the face of the planet and can't forget all America's\nNot perfect but trying to be and fighting along the way and lastly I think the ... the United states to do a lot of race issues Kanye West came over Jim Brown came over to the White House did some stuff in front of the camera\nAnd then people are saying they'd county West is is being used by the president as a sample that he shows he's a racially tolerant but he's not what is your reaction to what the what went on last week as it came to came to gang issues and race relations in America with this with this White House\nWell uh I think that anyone who who speaks out it just goes to show that are Democrats aren't interested in diversity of thought they're interested in getting people in line are telling the\nParty line because uh uh ... it's ridiculous um we in this country I remember being raised to believe that uh everyone was entitled to their own opinions but not their own fast but now the Democrats are you saying that everyone is entitled to their own fast but not their own and [noise]\nUh I'm looking at breaking down a bit the shackles that that that Shane us to dependency and victimhood and I believe that um by reaching out to the communities people selectively forget that are that the president um\nHas a has forgiven millions of dollars of debt to strictly black colleges and universities they tend to forget that the president has met with the other presidents of those universities um\nAnd reach down to them where I'm not even sure that the the previous president did uh\nWe need to make sure that we take a look at the the underlying issues of income inequality and get to the root cause which is opportunity inequality and having those honest conversations because in in these areas are these are the places that\nAre that that a progressive liberal policies failed Americans overwhelmingly where minority African American we need to have these conversations that we need to change now I can guarantee one thing I'm for the state of Michigan\nOr if Debbie Stabenow stays in office nothing will change we need to make sure that we end her reign of hyper partisanship we in her rain ineffectiveness and we end her reign of\nPromises I'm looking forward to representing Michigan uh and uh I I Believe that\nNinety eight percent of those go one party in either party feels like they have to work for your vote we have been silenced we had been ignored and now we need to have a seat at the tables because righteous indignation is not going to change things right just influence will we have marching from Selma to Detroit\nWe've been writing from watch to Baltimore and nothing's changed in forty fifty years we need to make sure that both parties were for a vote we have a seat that both tables so that we can continue to push changed now\nI remember I hosted a show with Jim Brown out next year already all sports radio\nAnd I was we were talking to get all of these calls about black coaches by general managers he said forget that we need black owners and then then you'll have somebody in power and then there's the blackout has got to pick the people that got to get the most wins and that's what you should be looking for it not for any you know go out and you know go out and get it\nYou know and that's the thing and I love that Jim ... more black owners the thing is African Americans have been have been rolled into the sense that not only\nShould we accept mediocrity but we should expect that uh you take a look at not just an NFL with the coaches and the and the and whatever but we need to look at owners and you see that right now with what they're saying and Fifteen dollars an hour why are you telling us that we only should\nExpect Fifteen dollars an hour winds are teaching my babies how to make Fifteen hundred dollars an hour why aren't you\nAre doing the things that it would take to poll entire communities out of poverty by by actually uh um\nIncentivizing ah people to get married and keep families together rather than saying but hey if you're a single mother and you get married somebody making the same amount you could lose your benefits that's incentivizing people to do the wrong things I Would need to have these conversations\nBecause we need to bring everybody not just black or white but everybody because these are issues that all of us face but disproportionately speaking\nOr African Americans who have been forgotten I'm looking forward to working for everyone but particularly those who've been categorically forgotten\nJohn James year exciting candidate and I have a sense a I have a sense is going to be a sprint to the finish you had twenty days ah let's see what they do good luck tonight\nThank you so

Bowles way again and present some type of political cover way to make spending more sustainable\nSo you're saying no Medicare for all is that what you're telling me\nI mean that's one thing I mean I think that or will do what do you know how can you or just saying even the defense department says we have enough missiles\nWe have enough right tank so okay so it's not really about defense it's really about the entitlement programs that's the thing that really drives us over the edge to the question is how do you manage that right\nOr is that about having people as they approach their elderly year's\nFall out of these programs at early I mean you don't you get into them later in life because our lifespan is so much longer I think that's a closer answer but this idea of Medicare for all\nDoes not work and why doesn't work because of the money the dollars and cents we can't afford that and why why why would you at Tel corporate America to stop\nGetting your employees healthcare insurance this is a program that his work since World War two hundred and fifty three million Americans get their coverage through their employer for the love of God don't put a knife in the back of

you very much\nI guess what the quality will go down nobody reinforces in Medicare they all need supplemental I Know that for a fact that's right and so that's for some people that was never meant to cover the whole country but there is a legitimate nonpartisan issue health care remains number one theory of use\nI think this idea that there is an easy answer like government funds everything is stupid\nAnd I think every market will have a different solution and for us I think it's a lot of different pieces of the pie coming together it can't be one thing it can't be just a big old governor fat government program that covers that that's like oh that's such a great idea no it's not I\nDon't know how that works I Can't make that work in my head we've got to get these companies to compete against each other for your health care dollars we have to and sent private citizens to know what they're paying and to complain when they're paying too much we've already got a program out\nHealth and Human Services secretary this week saying look we're going to get these prices on drugs down and part of the way we're going to do it is when you advertise your drug on the television you have to say how much it costs\nAs you're sitting there going to have exposure and just about everything starting the new year I heard the president's insisting and for the big form is resisting\nThat's right they don't want to do what they've got their own plan it will be fine go to this website click five buttons go some will eventually will get you the answer to your question I don't think that's the way to do it\nI think informing people you know information is the key to this and getting these companies to compete with each other they're having you know success at the margin with small things that ultimately will make a big difference there more generic drugs coming to market their getting faster approval for drugs this is all going to help\nYeah I Want you to hear what President Trump and tell me if you're comfortable with that said ...\nWhat ... is the fed because the fed is raising rates too fast and it's independent so I don't speak to him but I'm not happy with what he's doing because it's going too fast because you looked at the last inflation numbers are very low\nThey put on there I mean I'm not going to jail and I was going to be honest I'm not blaming anybody I put him there and made me a trade maybe it's wrong but what are they got it wrong I put it so couple of other people there that I'm also happy with the without him very happy with papal\nShabby with people but the guy there is going there we can't do anything about it no fire out but he has a point and how are you really do all the time evidently he's just scream about the fed where we're all going to be okay but it does it bother you at all that the fed by looking at it as a become more of a political Oregon that everything that they do raise rates are not have\nTo become a political Oregon all they do is ignore him that I mean that's all they have to do and that's probably what they will do but I think he's got a point\nI think that we may be at you know look\nInflation not an issue right now right\nAnd the president's looking at camping down the growth of we have why would we want to do that at this point I think the fed overreached when it said we're going to look at two things not only are we going to look\nAt and it not only are we going to look and inflation but we're also going to look at interest rates would look at these jobs are going to get jobs the fed has no business looking at jobs in my view and that was a decision they made like two presidents ago\nSo here's the prison United States moments ago speaking with Stuart Varney on trade with China cut fifty one I'm going to stop talking with China again we're all very ready for you\nI don't think so and I told them they want to make a deal and I said you guys aren't ready if you're just not ready because they've been taking five hundred billion dollars a year out of our country it's time that we stopped okay we rebuild China you know that better than anybody you talk about it more than I Do I say\nAnd it stopped and you see what's happening with John it's a whole different ballgame so now they're paying a twenty five percent tariffs or two hundred and fifty billion dollars has it affected our economy hasn't costs go up inflation so low\nVery low hasn't had any impact that we see except for one billions of dollars are pouring into the treasury\n[noise] so um do you dispute that fact of terrorists

are interested in buying my house and um you know they're pretty persistent and so I just said let me\nLook them up and see what they're all about but uh I haven't really been able to find out much about them so\nI guess my thought is I'm a they number one on the sheer number two um if they all legit today you know do a a low ball offer on your property and what are the dangers order risk in in going forward with one of these folks yeah too\nAnd I'm I'm just doing it primarily right now for education to learn what they were about what their business model is like so that I can make an informed decision\nRight so the the people who are approaching use your house a house in good condition and I are established neighborhood\nYes it is so go ahead and name who it is who is on your radar\n[noise]\nA comedy or is there any particular company that you're curious about\nI'm One of them call a a thing goes by name open door\nI've addressed open door on the air and let me explain to you what this is about there are a ...\nSabotaging and they're racing to establishing city after city in the country\nWhere for um [noise] I guess you could refer to as mid priced homes in a market there's enough inventory where they feel like they can figure out what is a fair value for your home\nAnd so with these people do is they guarantee lie in the case of open door and\nIts competitors they guarantee you that they'll they'll evaluate your home they may come in they'll do that on line they may come in and do an inspection\nAnd then they will make a firm offered to you to buy your home and then with the idea being that you've vacate really quickly typically within a month can be quicker but\nThey just buy it and they charge you roughly the equivalent of a real estate commission to do it they charge you about six percent [noise]\nAh so let's say just for argument's sake they said the house was worth two hundred thousand they would pay you like one eighty eight somewhere in there and you're out and you're just going so the question with any of them oh and the reason they do that\nIs they believe that they develop systems open during his competitors leave they develop systems\nWhere they can properly price house [noise]\nGet it I'm dressed up however they need to win the landscaping or inside\nAnd get it sold quicker than you can with you going to a traditional real estate agent and having them market the traditional way whether or not these things are going to\nStand the test of time the market will decide but when you get out of it is you're just done if you like the price they offer you ma'am you're out no questions no gifts you know you're done\n[noise] you don't have to worry about showing the house or anything like that\nI see okay\nAnd you also have to decide the price that you were offered [noise]\nDo you think they're low balling you or do you feel like it's really a decent offered they're making for your house\nTo Paul Paul right does that make so yes yes it does yes ah I just wanted to have an idea what they're about whether or not you know they were totally\nLegit no doubt that this is a a a real thing and the company's doing this I think another one is offer pat I think is another one and there's another one called knock\nAnd so with these companies they're learning how to price they're learning how to market their learning how to sell\nAnd then they add cities around the country very heavy emphasis on the south south west and west\nAnd the reason those areas because those are areas of the country that developed along the automobile have a lot of suburban housing a lot of uh subdivisions and developments\nBuilt with very similar housing plans and looks so they can more accurately price a house they're not interested\nAnd really high end houses because they don't know exactly how to price them and how easily they'll sell and they're not interested in houses that tend to be in neighborhoods let's say there are in transition that maybe had been rough neighborhoods trying to get better or something like that but it is the real deal\nAnd Tom is with us on the Clark Howard\nGreat thank you Tom how can I be of service\nWell about a year and a half ago I got us a slow states in the mail for a credit card from a small business and I thought well let me go and sign up for this 'cause I never hurts to have a backup car case you need it\nSo I I when I got the cars started using it because it actually had a better catch that war than the one I was using previously so everything was gone fine one afternoon I got an email from the credit card companies saying well we've got your address change which obviously wasn't mine so I called them ... sent me a new one the whole smear\nAt that point I threw the card into the to my file I started using my original heart a GM and at last September this last September I got the same message from the credit card company so I called them\nThey went through the whole dance and they sent me a new card and then it happened again in October ... three times as happened it's been a different address to mail in the car to [noise]\nSo I talk to the company and they sent me on to the frog department that whole thing I did ask them I said no other cars I have fought for a second level security where they would ask you a question like you know who's your favorite rock group or what was your elementary school\nWho is your art rock group called the purple okay now I Know the code to get any of your credit [laughter] I'm not use that one [laughter] okay [laughter] so they\nSaid they'd offer they said that they they they gave me some lame excuse and say well people can guess that well maybe not but it's still should be a level of security they should offer\nLike there's an issue though that I Need to point out to you the reason the current issue or may not care as much with a business credit card is business credit cards don't enjoy the consumer protections sit\nA consumer card does under pre existing law and the card act that was passed after the banking scandals so Congress carved out um exception to consumer protections for business cards so as an example\nLet's say a criminal did run up a lot of charges\nOn your car and if they were successfully able to take it over and run up charges their credit card company with a business card can say oh well\nWe don't think they you Tom took good precautions and so we're going to hold you liable for the charges or whatever which they cannot do on a consumer car so I don't I like even if you're using a card\nFor business purposes I like for you to get a consumer card and just use it in your business and pay for it from your business [noise]\nOkay so the best course apps and then there's this 'cause I had this account closed even\nIf you've been hit three times by people attempting to take over the account and divert bills so that you don't know that false charges are being made\nI Would say three strikes and they're out somebody has somehow figured out how to crack in on your particular card and who knows how many others\nAnd I don't want you vulnerable since you don't have\nThe normal slate of consumer protections you can get any consumer card and just as a practical matter pay for it from your business\nOne hour or online news talk Ninety four one dot

and that's an almost never rule you don't want to take that elsewhere and put your home at risk they're rare rare exceptions but very seldom will there be one\nAnd the purpose of using the equity of

question\n... one from Charlotte she says what is the formula for getting the cheapest airfares donate a Sunday stay fly during the week do need to stay over at least a week or what about advance bookings those kinda things\nPrice so starting at the most fundamental airfares tend to be the cheapest each week on Tuesday Wednesday and Saturday afternoon after three o'clock so anytime on Tuesday or Wednesday and then again Saturday afternoon end of the evening\nAnd it's because of the patterns of when people\nFly now you have a lot of business travelers that fly on Tuesdays and Wednesdays but leisure travelers those are the quietest days for leisure travelers that's why on a Tuesday or Wednesday you have people on an airplane paying the absolute highest fares and people paying the lowest fares\nStaying over Saturday Night doesn't matter anymore what does matter a lot is how far in advance you by there been any of a number of attempts to figure out the ideal number of days before travel to buy a ticket for the lowest fare\nAnd I've never found one that truly convinces me but as a practical matter buying more than Twenty one days in advance\nIs a key trigger to you potentially getting a lower fare and I like for you when you're looking for a deal on a ticket to use to particular search tools to find the best deal one start at ... dot com\nAnd put in where you are leaving

parents\nPro scouts came to a bunch of games where Lawrence was playing\nWas never that good at football but by the time to go to college but he also learn a guy who could see them a lot of money on ... so he switched into this story has a happy ending after all\nGreat thank you you're trying to get your first credit card is that true\nI Am indeed yeah so I've been eating a lot of money in the past ... years and finances are looking great\nBut I don't have any credit history I applied for a a major credit card to a major bank but declined for that credit card they have no history so I've been getting a lot of different people and all different places saying a lot of different things\nAnd it's kind of confusing to try to figure out some sort of called up for some advice on what I should be looking for the first credit card\nSo if you've never had a credit card and you don't have any history of the car loans or personal loans or any loans at all is that right\n... right so you're starting from scratch you're going to have to do some heavy lifting to establish that first credit and it it's more work than it should have to be but if you it's one of those things if you don't have history how do you get history\nThe way you do it is you need to either go my first preferred choice as to go to a credit union are you a member of a credit union yet\nI Am not but there are several in my area that I could go\nOf what are known generally under it's not a trade name it's kind of the general category we're known as fresh start programs\nWhere you can establish an account membership with a credit union and what they do with those programs as she put money on deposit with the credit union in a credit union CD or savings account and then that establishes your eligibility for a visa and MasterCard\nAnd the limit on how hard is somehow loosely tied into what you put on deposit in savings or in a CD\nAnd then they'll have like a a schedule that if you pay the bill one time month after month they gradually move you from having to have that CD or savings account to just having\nA credit card with no restrictions the advantage of the fresh start programs at a credit union versus what you might have heard from people about secured cards they might mention is a clearing card to you\nI have heard about this yes\nRight so the difference is the credit union cards generally are not considered to be secured carts they're just a regular events or MasterCard but the credit union is protected by the money you have on deposit with them as a member\nPost secured our daughter secured cars are issued by banks have various sizes and with the security card you specifically give them money did is equal to the credit limit they're willing to grant you and they have possession of your money\nAs a security deposit if you will like you would have if you went to rent an apartment and then ending on this cured card after twelve or Eighteen months of on time payments they then transition you to a regular credit card\nOkay problem with the security card programs is they have\nUsually very high annual fees and you've got the time period you have to wait and usually the way they're reporting the card to credit bureaus is under a status that lets the credit bureaus know that it's a secured card and not a full real these or MasterCard\nOkay yeah my bank cut day to get me to sign up for one of those but I did see that it had quite a high interest rates I was sort of shy away from it\nSo this is one of those areas where if you find a credit union that has one of these programs near you it's a vastly superior way to establish your first credit\nOkay fresh our program at a car and I will definitely look into that thank you\nThere's one other optional mentioned just briefly and that is if you have a family member who's willing to add you to their credit card account\nAnd that would give you the ability to establish credit and the fastest way possible\nAnd depending on the issue or a credit card some will only extend you as soon as unauthorized use or others will make you a co owner\nCo owner status is what's really best for you and it would allow you immediately to establish your credit record in credit history with a major credit card your family member can sign you up for it but then not give you possession of the car so they don't have to worry about well what you might do with the card\nBut any of the methods will get you pretty quickly to where you have that establish credit history and then after that it's just up to you how you handle it\nDaniels with us on the Clark Howard show hello Daniel\nHey Daniel you have a one year old boy or girl\nHappy birthday should we break out in song what's your daughter's name boil oh well happy birthday to will I Will not say I don't want to hurt your ears and thank you [laughter] so how can we help with one year old willow\nWe're looking at a story and some kind of college savings plans are excellent family ... contributing whatever only aside we had somebody or to give us the college savings bonds or a fading fall not college savings bond I'm just wondering a is a five twenty nine plan right for us\nAnd if so which worn 'cause I don't see my own state listed on your your uh twenty nine when\nYou're a Floridian that's correct\nSo Florida does a different form of a five what comes under the five twenty nine code Florida has a prepaid tuition plant and so you've got Seventeen years to totally brainwashing willow\nThat the only school she's going to go to is at Florida State school\nOkay now what are the odds though that Seventeen years from now you won't have long moved to who knows where else in America\nProbably very slow and we've got a lot of family here saw probably stay in this area\nSo if you're going to stay in Florida do you have the alternative cause a five twenty nine college savings plan is basically a tax free way\nTo put money aside for college and it can be used in any a real college for even colleges overseas and can be used for any eligible college expense so well I Would have enormous flexibility\nWhere to go to school\nOn the other hand if you ... it's an open question how much a school where you're going to be able to cover with the Florida prepaid tuition plan\nYou will be able to buy a centrally course credits and avoid what inflation will do the cost over the next Seventeen years\nSo it's there to entirely different ways to attack college costs\nAnd so you okay you really need to think through or you are you comfortable for willow\nHey you got to go to any college as long as it's a state school in the state of Florida period and if you are then you should probably you look at doing the Florida prepaid tuition plan\nAnd that's because ... the way to today's ...\nYou'll you'll know we've lost that is as much a willows education\nOkay one more thing that the next life works at a local college here in the state of Florida and she gets I guess for ... for spouses and and that's and all that\nAssuming she's staying there Seventeen years from now so I guess that's kind of an option as well so if I did before the curry paid off on twenty nine point how would it be if I was trying to get my money back because we want the\nPrice of what happens with a traditional five twenty nine plan if a child scholarships out\nThe ten percent penalty they would normally\nEffect to you with a five twenty nine plan not used for colleges waved\nBut you have to pay tax on any earnings but you know are considering we're education's going let's say well oh your wife still working there will goes there gets the free undergraduate degree such a big number of students now go on to some form of graduate\nI mean I play money would easily be used for graduate school\nOkay well you make sure it's\nSo that is an unusual twist you brought to the table there\n[laughter] well it's certainly not what will be there for years\nI Know that's the twist I mean how do you even predict that but one thing I'm sure we can predict well I was having a great first birthday today right that is correct

daughter called the uncle day though\n[laughter] um I wanted to know um [noise] we watched that a lot and uh one of the shows or someone said something about a pack of and uh at the time he laughed and I was pretty funny apparently but I just wanted to know and my wife and I are worth saving up and working to\nStart our own ranch and a re they'll pack because I Want to know if you knew something that I didn't\nAnd maybe I should change course or something\nI don't even remember what you're talking about but um I guess I can comment on our practice I was trying I think we're talking about ...\nI Believe that it was\nOn broke several years ago 'cause there was this emu fad and a bunch of people bought him use and then there was supposed to be there's a huge demand for the meat and it basically a bunch of crap there was no demand for your mate and I'm pretty soon people just said daddy amuse everywhere but\nI'm a you know alpacas I mean I I Know I'm not an expert on alpacas I'm not even an expert on branches um but from a business perspective I think you're entering a pretty narrow market\nAgree\nYou better really no your stuff and you better really do this you can't\nRich goes or not I mean any more than any more than cows are making people rich cows make people pretty poor all the time and some of them they make people rich\nBut as I as do other running a business um

agriculture and renting before\nNo this'll be my first venture into it um\nSo why would an first venture into ... into it with a very narrow product line\nWell that is actually the second half of it I'm a first start I'll be starting with his goats and I have a uh my I don't have all of the expertise myself it's a a good friend of mine who does and we're gonna be working together [noise]\nI'm sixteen\nOkay All right cool well as long as you got more than five years I Would use a simple growth stock mutual fund\nSomething like that I probably would just using his in the index fund because it will grow virtually without paying taxes on it until you pull it out on as a what's called a low turnover ratio which means the taxes aren't charge much on the growth until you cash it in\nAnd so I started to a person is in the five hundred fund an index fund\nAnd use that to grow for the next five ten years or so until you buy a house as long as you leave it alone as long as you plan to leave it alone at least five years you can survive the gyrations of the stock market and you should be fine\nAnd that and that's exactly what I Would do I do a similar thing Scott and sometimes I've got some extra money and I'm just saving up for my next real estate purchase as an investment\nAnd um even if I don't have five years in that case I'll ride the market with it and uh 'cause I can afford for it to go down and if I mess up a little bit but yeah that that's the direction I Would go good question Robby is with us in Pittsburgh hey Robbie welcome to the day Ramsey show\nHey Dave how are you better than I deserve what's up\nOh thank you so much for taking my call yeah I had a quick question so I Am a nurse or by profession and my wife is a nurse and that that\nI Am wondering if I should go back to school again next year I'm so my question is if they work for me to go to a call now I'm thirty two years old my wife is\nUh twenty nine we make a combined income right now after a two hundred and a two hundred and twenty thousand a year or so if I go to school it's going to cost me ... years of not working\nOn that tuition of around Ninety thousand dollars mhm a side uh our gross income after I go to school and be successful together that would be close to a three hundred thousand mhm so\nUh but uh what do you make a year now are right now around Seventy thousand\nOkay you're saying there's going to cost you to three hundred grand three years three years of Seventy thousand missing plus nine out of pocket yeah okay can you cash flow than any out of pocket and can you live on her income or you're doing this\nI can live on her income for sure that's how we did it when she was in school um but I don't think I can catch anything right now because I and I also don't have a house or at the moment so I was you know planning on buying a house\nOr or putting at least they're putting a down payment for a house next year before I start school so\nThen you need to wait until you can pay for school\nI Would ah that you never in Thirty years of doing the show recommended somebody borrow money to go to school okay you got the cash flow to do it it's just a matter when you do it and what you put first what you put second you might plenty of money to come up with an underground\nYeah plenty of money and you don't have to have the whole money up front you just got to see in your budget how you can cash flow would um I can see it pretty easily ... owns it take to go through the class again or do you think of it it it it's a three year program so thirty grand a year\nThirty grand a year yeah\nAnd and she makes what\nShe makes a hundred and fifty thousand\nYou can't catch ... already granted I'm a hundred and fifty\nA note when I'm not in coal\nNo if you're in school she makes a hundred and fifty thousand dollars in a unique thirty thousand over a hundred and fifty to go to school year for three years\nI I I'm Sorry fifty thousand it's it's a it's going to be around a sixty thousand a year\nI thought you said it was Ninety thousand\nSorry I got that wrong it's it's a sixty thousand a year\nIs an expensive program you know go to a less expensive program that but cash flow it whenever you're going to pay for it figure out a way to pay for the\nPies you go you know there's certainly have an all star stacked up ahead of time but you got to see where it's going to come from I Would not recommend\nYou go get student loans because here's the thing everyone starts that program doesn't finish it but every one that takes out student loans just aren't that program has on student loans whether they finish or not\nAnd then you've got what's known as a freaking mass\nAnd so I'm not suggesting you're dumber you can't pass the test or something like that my life happens dude and the last thing you want the only time debt works as if everything works\nOther than that that doesn't work and so we tell you to stay away from it thanks for the call open phones a triple eight eight to five five two to five Joshua ... is in Dallas texas\nHi Joshua how are you I'm good how are you better than I deserve what's up\nSo basically I Am stuck in between whether I should file for bankruptcy or just go ahead and start paying 'em all might get a goalball basically all my debts except my car are in collection but that's why that's the only reason I'm basically\nContemplating um bankruptcy why are they only go actions\nUm they're like oh medical bills um one is that is a car that guy I'm ...\n... I lost my job and the I think I think like a phone bill and then there too mhm\nOkay so how much is the repo bill\nI'm actually only like a couple of grand um ... it gets what I have on there is a\nNine nine thousand four hundred and forty five dollars\nAn old apartment mhm how long ago it was a three and a half years ago okay and how ... how much how much money and your medical data began I Would say about two thousand and one of the doubt if you go to\nThe rest of it is it's a mixed in there with like my ... a ... I think a phone bill and all the payday Lowe is well\nYou know so your your total that's less than twenty thousand dollars right and then I have um my car which is a twelfth out mhm okay and what do you make a year I'm\nA little bit over forty five I make a thousand a week I'm a independent contractor\nMhm then you're single or married you're married owner and I'm\nTwenty eight on Saturday\nThe happy birthday does she work outside the home\nI'm no she stays at home and take him daughter\nOkay good um [noise] well let me tell you what I'm hearing okay and I think I'm hearing maybe I'm wrong I'm a ... cat used to say that debt is not the problem is a symptom\nOf something else that's going on I'm right and it sounds like you guys have never told your money what to do you've never had any savings for emergencies so every time an emergency comes up you get thrown out of an apartment so your car gets ... and you end up with a mess\nYes they're so we've got to get you on a plan where you are telling your money what to do or you're going to be back here if I waved him on and made all this debt go away which is what bankruptcy might do maybe I'm if it did that and made you have zero down all of a sudden except your car\nIf you don't change the habits that causes this mess in the first place you'll be back right where you are someday do you agree yes there you know so we really need to get under that says bankruptcy doesn't solve that\nI think you can probably shuttle that old apartment that for three or four grand if you saved it up and offer them a lump sum settlement uh I\nI've actually called multiple out of there are ... that was one of the first video that I Will look it up with to get that collectors you know I'm Wondering if\nIt don't it doesn't change my answer to whether it's nine thousand or three thousand you're still not bankrupt\nIt's still about you getting control\nAnd when you do that then you're going to say your way through this bankruptcy is a lot of that problem Mitchell behavior problems got your hands\nI'll help you out I'm a ... is a total money make over both agreed that take an extra job shall everything inside unless you get as much cleaned up I'll show you how to\nUs today Ramsey show [noise]\nOne of the smartest things you can do is take good care of your teeth that will save you tons of money in the long run to help I

members joined the Fifteen million people across the country you are already saving with these plans to get a special discount for my listeners\nAnd um but they use sometimes a twenty year military

Huntsville five Tricia how're you guys have how're you doing better than I deserve what's up\nCalling about my mom um I'm not really sure how to handle her situation she had taken ... three times over the past few years and she had to file for bankruptcy and now she doesn't know how to manage your money\nTo do that kind of name she doesn't know how to wear that she just won't do it\nExactly and so now we're going to have to have surgery on her ... and she's kind of ... because you have to file at that no way that she's going to happen like out of her paycheck and she's telling me that she can't maintain that\nSaid that like she's going today it mhm\nOnce and I don't really know how to what what's the surgery on the wrist\nAnd kind of not or something that's very painful and says you gonna have to have it right and they know how long have you been there and probably for about a year ago\nOkay well I think this was her wake up call\n\nOkay I think it's time for her to stay at work long enough to build up enough pay pay in a savings account to be able to survive the time the shoes off while she's only ... okay me wondering what if you weren't they weren't there to bothers drunk a drink\n\nThey wouldn't be able to drink right if you weren't there I like to buy her her drinks she wouldn't be getting drunk\nRight when you finance or misbehavior you ensure it is going to continue\nOkay does that make sense\nI don't want her to die or something I'm not trying to get this was things cancers and it's going to cause or hand or something but it sounds like\nThis woman live from one crisis to another than their own self\nCreated back and I know definitely\nAnd I thought I was reading that in the mail but I wasn't sure so I understand and I'm not trying to be lacking compassion I Want to be compassionate but continuing to assist her in this behavior line that has been destructive to her is not compassionate\nOkay so you can play like\nMan I tell you what I don't know I mean you got to sit down and figure out how you're going to do this in layers but maybe you maybe you assist her partially in return for her engaging in behaviors that she knows she's supposed to be doing\nOK but so far she has refused all help that has to do with her ... up yeah I was a little kid my dad you should say straighten up and fly right you ever heard that\nDon't even know what that means I don't even know what that means I just knew we'd better straighten up I never did flies I don't know what he meant but I didn't fly right you know but you know what I'm Talking about straighten up have you know yeah and\nWhat uh what if we didn't do what he said show you know but I'm sure they show the in this case we can't do that kind of stuff but but I I got I just think that's what needs to happen here for her own good you're I provided whether\n...\nBecause I Love her because you love her and you don't want to see her in pain and she refuses to do the things she calls the pain to go away\n... okay\nAnd you're more concerned about her behavior than she is\nSo I think I think I just sit down and tell her all that say you know how a view because let me tell you when you do all that she's going to get pissed off injury\nShe feels entitled to your money [noise]\nYou know that's weird\nAnd required cells I found very violation in the book boundaries and\nMichigan titled

five two to five were opening up a couple of lines for that right now\nThere is in the lobby of Ramsey solutions from Spokane, Washington with a question\nI Heather Hi Dan how are you better than I deserve what's up and I just finished baby step three and now I'm working on baby steps three ... saving for a house got your emergency fund for ... yeah and I wanted to know how long is too long in baby step three being the flashy lives on today be set for\nThere's not a magic cancer of the concept or the other critical thinking skills for the answer is simply this\nIf you stay there so long that you don't save for retirement you screwed up your retirement Mm right yeah or if you don't stay there long enough then you don't have a good solid down payment and you'll end up with other problems on the mortgage so it's the it's the pull between those two things\nAnd with most people that means you know three years four years something like that um but if you're if you're fifty nine it might not be that long or you're not fifty nine now how old are you\nI'm twenty eight on friday\nOkay cool and so I mean if you stayed out for four years and never started any retirement until thirty two\nBut you had a really juicy down payment on a house and got ... ... you know how to plan to pay it off in a few years because of that\nYou're not you're you're still going to retire multi millionaire you know if you do that at it but if you stayed out for Twenty years been called that baby step three besides what I'm that's see that's kinda how you think through it from a critical thinking skills standpoint so how long were you thinking of\nLike just started in June and I'm hoping to have it done in two years\nOkay and so Thirty years old you're you're gay mon on retirement taking on a Fifteen year mortgage by forty five the mortgage is paid for if not sooner and uh you will of saved thirty five years at Fifteen Percent of your income which unless you just don't work\nIs gonna make you a millionaire multimillionaire you say I'm doing this so you're in a safe zone there but that's how you make the decision more importantly than they Ramsey says never go more than three years that's not how it works it's just you're pulling those two things are pulling at each other or because you're not saving for retirement the longer you go that's all it is hey thanks for stopping by thanks dance\nOpen phones at triple eight eight to five five to to find Julian is in New York City how Julian how are you know\nI ... it can you hear me okay I can how can I help thank you for taking\nMy call so I'm In a bit of a unique position I'm I'm twenty four next year I'm going to medical school and uh I was I'm very very lucky and very appreciative uh I'm not going to have any pets after graduating medical school but at the gate\nAllies um and uh what did you get a felony or what\nUm uh yeah I'm not certain that's what I Want to do yet I Know\nI'm I'm asking how you did that\nOh oh um yeah so so if they get from my father\nAnd my grandparents um wow I'm very very very appreciative of how good\nNow yeah you should be that's amazing wonderful so\nUm yeah so when when I was Twenty one uh I was given a essentially control this funny 'cause it's under my name I'm but I'm Sorry I Apologize I'm Joe I'm a yeah I was I was getting control this money and uh\nI've been given a very good financial advice from my father ah who's helping me I manage it but um because it's under my name and he he's actually in the rain stopped me or I Would like it a second opinion as to what to do with this money I can give it a little bit of\nMoney for a living expenses um and I said\nThat about five thousand dollars from some small side jobs at hospitals but I Want to know how to capitalize on this and how that myself up as best as I can for after medical school\nWell the thing I Would be most concerned about is that the money is available and enough to get you through medical school\nUm it it definitely is um about one third of it is invested very securely and two thirds of it I have in the evenings I'm In the two thirds we were discussing putting into a ... bill on a three month renewal basis until I needed to take them out to pay my tuition and then I Would just reinvent the rest\nUm well I probably would not do that and the only reason is is that the bills basically or bonds\nAnd a bond interest rates are yields go the bond values rather go down as interest rates go up and we are in an increasing in the interest rate environment so if you put a hundred thousand dollars in T. bills I could turn into Ninety pretty quick\nAs interest rates increase so that's not a very safe investment in the environment that we're in right now um but if you wanted to have some portion of the money invested I probably would go to something like gross income type funds but I'm okay if there's enough there to do simple division and it doesn't have to really earn anything\nIf you want to keep it all very very safe that would be okay with me because the most important thing is for you to be able to graduate with zero debt\nAnd if you screw around with his money in some way and it loses value and you're not able to do that then the whole you know is like a ... we were concentrating on the wrong thing\nAnd a Julian is the right thing to concentrate on Julia MMS debt free graduation is the most important part of this math equation not what this money is paying\nA it'd be nice to be a little bit sophisticated about it but if you get caught up in some kind of a sophisticated process and you end up losing money trying to trying to just get a little bit more on this lump sum uh you you defeated you're on purpose you shot yourself in the foot so to speak so um\nThat's the process you're looking at I'm going to keep it pretty safe uh if you want to go toward something that's fine but I wouldn't use bonds for anything right now a possible play Kimberly is in Pensacola Hi Kimberley how are you\nGuys doing great thanks for taking my call it sure looks up I I just wanted to thank you for all you do they think temporary Wal Mart than than on your side than I had paid off very bad I'm following their plans to go for that\nAnd I don't know if I'm not an hour at all can\nI somehow they got them um my parents live in North Carolina and they live in a flooded area of heart problem area\nAnd I'm so every time there hurricane come through um they they experience partying it on their on their property at their home as well as my dad is\nAnd we were just wander and what you can and as far as I think that what um they have now that they do have um savings and my mom has a ticket for one\n... and often does this property blood\nWell and non and fought it and it was it got like forty answer and the house and I think about ten feet in his shop\nAnd then two years ago um it got him like that shop I think about three feet or so and it almost at like about six inches from getting in the house again\nAnd I'm ... there's only been two major flood but um but they're in their sixties and it it's very emotional for them at any town a farm ...\nThroughout this past down we actually packed up or I didn't my sister was able to help them out of state but they packed up all their belongings and let them put them away and you know because they were afraid that\nThey're so whatever else who was living there has become more painful than not living there\nAnd those are the fear of rising water even the fear is not founded we once in Twenty years is not that bad but bottom line is is that has developed a phobia for them\nAnd they're not on living there they're nervous on living there why wouldn't they move\nI don't know I mean the actual threat a flood statistically with what you've given me I wouldn't do that concerned about but if they're absolutely panicking every time the weather person comes also just raining\nAnd it's just not going to live there\nSo you know it's more of an emotional decision wrong with that is literally more move\nThe brand new money for hours morning nine eleven Ninety four point one\nYou've heard me talk about our deep there for years and how it's only a matter of time before you become a victim but I run across some numbers that even surprised me in shows the real nightmare that people

they get a success level earlier anything where your spotlight and you get a success level\nAnd your skill as world class in that thing does not mean you have everything else together yeah yeah and that's true with the you know teenagers in general is one of the things we do this entrepreneur tool box\nIs they can start to develop some of those skills you know running a business\nYeah they and

Arkansas we just had my cup here that was younger that Arkansas is an eyelash away from knocking all the eventual national champion North Carolina I think that set up last year and I think last year and I was created this momentum that we're all feeling\nI Can't wait because I remember growing up and out of a bit of that's easy fan my entire life I grew up going to the max but just simply center there in Baton Rouge Louisiana I remember watching Rickey blend in for Neal singled sending guys that have played two or three years in this conference and I knew they were\nWe know that in college bass or a football right we know the ... hours we watch and develop I feel like that's what we get out of this conference this year with the team that Rick Barnes has a tendency with the team that bruises bringing back with guys didn't go to the NBA at Auburn\nAre we talking about three potential titled teams we talking for are we talking we're we're we add as far as contenders 'cause this conference is about winning titles\nPre season this for might as well or to be an all final four from one conference time of their way and that means we're all going to the final four coach puts audited do you point I think last year we had eight teams and\nWe we we knew that they were all good but there were none that were great that national championship level\nThis year's a little bit different where do you think Kentucky and Tennessee\nCan put it together to make a run to the final four and maybe this is an outside team there I don't floor and put it together you know how well how talented they stack up so and there is a different feel ... and then you look at the young guys Mandy how well those young guys come together and take control of that team Mississippi State are they ready to turn that on and so there's a lot of teams\nAnd I said this I think in our last segment Peter [noise]\nI really believe that December is one thing but when we roll into January and February they're going to be time for weeks where you're going to have five six seven SEC teams right from the top twenty five one thing to do that on a pre season\nAnd it's another thing to earn it between the lines I think this team this league it's stacked up where it's going to be able to go toe to toe with the best leagues in the country and that's based on the coaches are in this league players from seniors down to freshmen\nAnd the commitment to not tell you so we're really a greater depth yeah maybe Walker and we also got a call I was talking\nTo Christmas told him and he does radio for a serious exam he's on the ACC channel it and he loves college basketball and that's where we're walking out to the parking lot I had asked him about something it said to want to go on my show us and I said do you still believe the FCC\nMay be better than the ACC this year and he goes I'm sticking by that's what he believes at this conference can be there needs to be a surprise taste every conference has okay\nYou're smiling a little bit is there that team that you think you know what their pick somewhere strikes to twelve but they can take a take a job\nI'm a stick with it and it's it's it's a team that you brought up in a guy that you know very well coach Martin Frank Martin is a guy where you know he's going to have his team plan is as hard as anybody\nEvery night how most of the time heart is in the next thing the other night you know he's not going to let anybody slip up on anything is going to stay on there but every little thing\nThen you add in Chris Silva who's got the potential to change gains defensively improved his off and so I Love Justin ... that kid is very versatile star is a guy who's improved guard play is something that's going to take you to the next level\nCoach Martin is notoriously can be difficult on his guards which is a good thing so South Carolina to answer your question as a team that I could see that maybe people are talking about but that could be a good thing for coach right now I think\nI Would agree with that and to make a couple of points he's very excited for he's very excited about the transfer from Georgetown trade Campbell was was now eligible and he feels like he can run his team and put gas in position to be success was frontlines going to be as good as there is physical stronger deep\nLast year when you got there I think there's a level of comfort because you guys have been around the program they understand who I Am as a coach and what we're about\nThe coach and how we do things as the program the accountability and doing your job on and off the court but also having good players like John to Kevin perjure him out to be greedy Cohen also Jordan guy so about a test to go some guys and understand what we try and do some progress\nI Want to ask John tell you what did Michael by after he\nWas dressed as a gift and if you've been a big brother I mean he didn't give me anything off the transfer next away if he was he got mom or something what what what was what was that situation like\nIt was awesome guy her brand new car she had like a ... version of it so it's kind of ironic he got the same cars the newer version um the other one was breaking down every other week so she's super blessed she's on one of the like the ... or whatever but that's perfect car for her so\nSuper happy that

that's that's the that's the great thing about excited about this season we probably have sixteens ranked in the top twenty five on this kick off the Caesar so\nThat makes a great basketball and then another thing we'll talk about the sketch when we were playing every by the people that understand that you know\nThese we plant everybody now so it's All right\nThat that was a big deal to the league office came into a couple of years or ... easy coming in and saying hey we have to change a couple of different things one it was obviously the the hiring the coaches with that comes\nSure your strength the schedule was good enough something that hurt Mississippi State last year where they didn't really have a girl that I'm not a conference schedule and they ended up being in the United states however\nHow has that changed when you look at what the scheduling has done for this kind of\nWell when you when it comes from the top that says we are going to encourage you to play anyone anywhere anytime and when you look at not even the power five conferences but I'll go into a school some get offended by mid major but let's just call it's because we all know about a but even going to their arenas it's risky\nBut it's necessary to be able to take a school from the FCC to go and say yes we'll play anybody anytime anywhere and I think that's probably a more willing coaches willing to do that and schedule a lotta time schedule and can be tricky because as a fall at the right time of the of for everybody in the calendar year but\nThe big twelve SEC challenge I mean come on that has been great and you see the end we get every year we wish we had that in football right to work hard and football are traditionally three or four years down the road\nRight now there's a weekend

can't wait to talk to him a lot of these things do people\nGet hurt or not they can recruit and that you know now you can go into the rooms to go out and say hey look we're gonna play Duke we're gonna play Kansas we're going to North Carolina you don't have to worry about you know got to go to when we are going to play those type was\nAnd then now you're talking about fixing to be in the top twenty five so now you recruiting who I planned this conference you planned against the seals in the country so all those kind of play a part and that's what I got the league and the great position that his and right now\n... position you talk about as many as eight teams could be ranked teams went to the tournament last year every single 'cause we've had on this on on this a podium and then that said so far has talked about how this league that used to be okay it might be tougher before we get into February and now it's a it's an unbelievable tracked me what it gets down to it\nOne of the coaches that we heard earlier who was a little bit not stern but very serious more serious and we saw was Mike Anderson and Arkansas I don't think this is the things they've traditionally had\nYou know the steam inside and out what do you expect for the razorbacks these will coach Jae understands that oh these coaches do they they understand that whatever the how they carry themselves as is what their team is going to follow you know you you take on the personality of the coach as a team and coaching has\nAbsolutely incredible town there and the gap or we all know that\n... and I had talked many many times last year about how Daniel gap or benefited from having a senior back now coming back this year it's it's a younger team can Daniel gaffe or do a couple of things can he take on the responsibility of\nA going on the road in mid February ... and putting the team on his shoulders getting your twenty twenty and Fifteen so coach innocent understands that he's getting his young and he's got some good young town that can get up and down the floor but there is a transition period and people will have to be a little bit patient\nOr as well as leaning on a guy like Dana gather who's going to get a lot of attention from defenses but the question is going to be how do you get him the ball where he can be successful\nAnd then also when you lose those go go three guy you're talking about ... for making\nBeer I mean these are you're leading knows no team in the conference loses a bigger production of of other points and rebuild it doesn't look there's going to be it's gonna be a

with the extra light that's one of those right now I think that's just making us work even harder\nHave in our teammates around ... are very supportive so ...\nYou you're looking at what ... what what what is it what is the situation as far as him getting back in and and it'd be a part\nOf the he's set out a few more games than that and then we're going to get him back and I'm and I'm Glad that he has his eligibility restored yeah I'm I'm Glad Austin certainly is and it's got his eligibility restored and um you know I think that um you know what you're talking about as far as as far as our guys are concerned um\nYou know we're gonna we're we've got to handle it differently and I'll say this team's teams handle diversity the best teams that are going to be in on top of the end 'cause team to lose games in this lake I mean I mean last year we lost six and one of the lake what is going to take this year it'll be six or seven again\nYou just can't put too many in or you can't let winning affect you too much you can let losing affect you too much and that's the message that I Want to share it and Bryce to be able to deliver to their teammates so\nSomething about the late ... thoughts about this later you're talking about a things in the last year we got there seem to show probably be right then south twenty five\nWe call me every time we talked about you you every interview was talking about how good does legally I wanted to be in the hour we are but last year with the best I've seen in twenty five years and this year it's better\nJust tells you where it is an ... we're going to get more than eight this year um [laughter]\nNever said this before but I must say that right now the FCC is the best converts men's basketball conference in the country this year\nAnd in in saying that I've never said that I don't know that it's ever been the case I don't know that it's going to be the case but to say that with the ACC all the Big East or the big trucks and all the other great leagues out there I don't think we've ever been a position that we've got great teams at the top\nBut the teams all the way through our so solid and you know I think what's happened is\nYou're you're the programs that traditionally struggled in our league may coaching changes really made strong commitments and those programs are no longer weaker program so who's the week program and all that and the answer is right now there is on\nAnd as long as you're still ... Kentucky in a league you know the end and Florida and some of the programs you know the rest speaks for itself\nWe've been asking us all a bunch of the guys and injured ... what's the competition life because when you look at you all got about a shooter guy that can act out so the light of how to how do you find your competition on this team and make sure\nI'm just guess what the competition just within ourselves um just everybody's competitive when his team them a competitive against one another and we all want to see each other to see so we're going to succeed by any means and I saw\nThat one guy just got to be the one guy right and I are better at the studios like I Want to be more than ... Bradley or anybody else who was one guy in practice at you like this guy that I Want a body I like I'm taking it on this guy today\nWho have stuff but I think I'd probably say by just because they were both super competitive home just outside of even on a basketball court we spend a lot of time together um even plant today so I ended up\nBut we still also had to the concept\nAnd that's what's great about these things that we got to come back this year that bringing back so much debt when you think about the tendencies of the world all those guys got some some goals in mind that's due to further what they've already done and they should all be playing with a chip on the show because obviously nobody achieved that goal in the ...\nYou know it's funny we talk about chip on the shoulder when it comes to football program Mississippi State has had that for a long time and that's why you know maybe ... had some success down there a march to this year uh Kentucky football you know you know you're you've been talking about a lot of that so I don't yeah they got they got a chip on their shoulder right now\nI think there's two different ships on the shoulders as far as for tendency in Auburn Bruce pro talked about the size chip on his shoulder like hey you guys are feisty I don't have enough sized that rolls him it motivates them is it the fact that ... probably coaches his team harder than maybe any other team in in in in this conference you think that that helps that team\nOh without question I mean coming from planet college from ... to ... very demanding I think gas respect that um I think they they\nIt's the they success [noise] um I was sitting there go right now to lose ... Chicago should act they thinking like now it's time we want to know that that takes us still in their mouth for a little bit they want to get that out their mouth and and make a deep run into the tournament and that's why you get everybody that comes back to school because they want to make they want to change it up\nHow did you handle that\nIndividually in the off season and what I mean by that is for Tennessee in for Auburn right now it's not about making the tournament right this is about a team both of these squads have a chance of potentially wind up staying right so that's going to be the case\nHow did how did players talk about or they are they haven't player not players only meeting but only ... discussing amongst themselves as a team as something an opportunity special\nYeah I think I think when you look when you think about it I think what happens is obviously you guys have sour taste a matter of fact at a loss and then they try to figure out they sit down with the coaches how can they get better individually you've got these guys that put their name and address to have some individual goals and they go out there and and one thing I like about both cultures they allow their plans to go out there and go\nAhead what's your name and address and see what happens and then come back and get back we focus on what we do as a team I think that helps them players grow individually but also helps them get now let me just getting this team concept because individually I thought I had a good enough season to put my name and address it didn't work out let me get better\nBut then I'll ask you a build up on that if you got guys that are saying you know like let's say jailing Hudson has more to okay or Jared harbor these guys looked at it and said uh you know what I Need to come back and get better\nAnd they want to get better if they want to get better they would've felt the stat stat sheet pretty well right they want to fill out a box score so ... so scouts say there were there but on the other side what if their coach comes to them and say I need to be more of a role player how hard is that to balance like man I Want to make it to the leave right [laughter] but I also want to win for my teen that's a that's a that's a million dollar balance right now for some of these kids\nYeah and and it's tough for them and obviously you'd have to have to be faced with that position if you come back you want him still play to a big part in the team and and now it's just tough for a player but I think if if I'm what's called ... and there's you know you have to look at Kentucky and assist tested that they've been able to have with freshmen and\nHaving five or six guys that are very good play together and everybody still given the opportunity for them to fulfill the individual\nBomber war with the hope we make it to the NBA\nNo you never know you might be a couple of Kentucky got picked in the second round they'll protect you supposed to be first round pick so you may not get that first round pick but you're still going to get a opportunity to play professional basketball so I think that's something that you sell the guys on and you try to get them in that team concept listen when you when everybody gets water I think that's got to be\nAnd that that's on any level and I think they knew that happens in the pros where the guys that we don't usually get the big paychecks role players usually get paid more than what they really work\nBecause of those type of situation so it's the same thing with so much ...\nThan in years past that might have just been hey who ... who are you playing in the SEC you're now you're playing eight nine tournament teams that gets another a bunch of other future NBA players that's going to help build their
