Sebastian Gorka my colleague from many is the author of a new book why we fight\nDefeating Americans enemies with no apologies what is fresh here is that there are two new follows that through the Obama\nAdministration and the Bush administration and the Clinton Administration it was not clear to those of us who watch national security that the U.S what's going to focus on ... threat we're now focused let's start with Russia\nAh your experience with Russia from your dad and mom is that no matter how they dress it up their aggressive\nAnd they're aggressive especially along the boundaries that the empire\nIs it your opinion that the Trump Administration is addressing it adequately now after the failures of the Obama administration to see what Ukraine represented\nI think sending ... anti tank missiles to Kiev instead of socks and blankets is is a very a serious improvement from the Obama years\nSo yes and the the personalities while making the decisions not just in the White House but but elsewhere for example which I'm of the joint chiefs general dumped it fully appreciate but a\nA KGB Kindle is always a KGB colonel and the the important way to look at Russia is not as the Soviet Union of you'll\nBut what I like to call them and the status quo actor\nConstantly looking to destabilize\nBut we we tend as Americans I Love my fellow Americans we tend to posit good faith on behalf of the other right I'm okay you want to be oh yeah I I say something and I'm a maintenance and and I'm not a lot to do business let's do this yes the Kremlin has never work like that whether it was run by a song whether it was run by\nStalin or by KGB cuddle\nSo we now have the requisite knowledge and understanding that these are bad actors not the Soviet Union\nThis is a nation in a in

... very simple and you should find that book and other related topics\nFantastic Kobe by the way K. O. V. I. C. K. O. V. I. C. where one eight six six five oh Jim bow and the out of the calls from Dallas this evening and listen to the cliff five Seventy good evening welcome ...\n... it's good to be on the show thank you and what's on your mind to live our\nHere he was ... spending that my experience has been I'm sixty one years old I've I've tried ... travel and most of the major the ways that America Ninety five north south on the east coast my ... my experience has been you need to map out your your your route\nWe're we're on an on the major freeways but then if you go to a situation where like in a south to North Carolina where the Florence are gender flooding a closed that down then you need them\nYou ... you need to make sure that when you're when you're going yeah they'll go on the major freeways first and they wait for the Detroit then that's when you should you should start on the sidewalk because it because when there's a major hurricane like Michael's coming through it's coming up to Alabama\nYou just need to get get on the major freeways and get as far as you can as fast as you can stay on declare major uh I'm In a state and then and then then if it happens when you have to take a detour then go that gun\nSo if you want to have to go because to say about that certainly sounds reasonable to me that he\nIs absolutely correct but importantly you must know what the side roads are so this way in case you have to work those roads you should at least be familiar with and so when you're traveling on a leisurely\nUm track to some of these escape areas that you may find yourself having to evacuate sue\nSo this way so if your if your area is let's say area that everyone knows you're going to be there now and the other people are gonna meet up with you\nAnd you should know at least several of the major roads to get to that location just in case you have to take one of those roads\nSo when you're doing it on a leisurely timeline it's not a problem you don't have to be concerned about it but if you let's say\nBefore let's say you're on a major artery and you're told that the ... has to take place you can easily tax the email from your phone that hey I'm taking this beach and we're going to go to through this direction to that location so this way\nFamily members who you rely on those even ask the people on the other side cannot get that sick no meaning that tax to the email message wants that to our turns on and the people on the other side\nGet that connection your text or email all show up once their their cell phone reaches that tower\nNo as a as a ... thank you Alan for your call the your thoughts here or how does the GPS era affect all of this\nI'd makes everything so wonderful that we know where each of those are like you can send an activate your GPS for your family members\nSo this way you can see where you know your family members are by checking where they are on the GPS system so but in times of\nWeather related problems such as Michael you know the storms getting thrown down you know can take our technology\nAnd if the towers set of people that you're sending a signal to\nWind down dance\nSingle you won't get that you know the people on the other side won't get the message but if they hit another tower that active they will instantly receive those messages so as long as you're sending a signal you can let people know which way you're going how you're going that way\nAnd on the other side it's important to understand that they will receive at once a power is connected to that cell phone\nThey will receive the message and now they know what happened to you\nAnd I would just throw in a quick little plug for a radio and\nThe good old ubiquitous over the radio always their distribution such moments we go to Patrick in Rochester, Minnesota joining us tonight on the show with our guest disaster preparedness expert at the early ... good evening Patrick\nA good evening jumble of this uh this coverage is very fascinating with hurricanes and so forth [noise]\nUm [noise] and uh otherwise to than being a good script per movie um why not just bomb a\nHurricane several hundred miles out into the Pacific a couldn't be a new killer it would rain radioactive waste a but a\nMaybe a hydrogen bomb or\n... nuclear bomb too because you didn't know because it involves a a a trigger that consists of uranium plutonium\nWe didn't care about the radiation we just wanted to really knock a hurricane out of kilter a I Am not sure about this but I Would dare say that if we were to drop our entire nuclear arsenal into hurricanes I\nIt might have an impact but these things are so much bigger than a single nuclear weapon that aside from all of the other uh him practicalities of such an idea there is too big and then they\n[noise] well you know let's put it this way\nLet's say the United states was to say oh you know in the state of Florida the state decides hey we're gonna take this action and do something with the store and the storm goes towards Alabama well Texas\nNow ... is the state of Florida are liable for ... for this storm and damaging the states the other states or let's say another country let's say the United states there is a big storm coming towards us\nAnd then we diverted to Mexico and they go straight through the city and cause a hundred billion dollars worth of damage\nAli liable for that so that's another area of issues that arise if we try to control the weather because the weather's going to do something and the people that it hit they're going to be upset\nYeah and I would note one instance in which this happened I'm not sure that anybody was ever found liable or even there was proof that in fact the action led to what followed but this was this has been probably half a century ago or so somebody got the idea\nOf cloud seeding a part of the eye of a hurricane this was I think the hurricane was off Jacksonville, Florida\nAnd so they did it and the hurricane promptly took a sharp left turn and handed inland\nAnd the the I don't think anybody was ever able to tell if in fact the cloud seeding caused this but I don't believe that ever again that was tried so ah the the fact is that that we just don't know enough about these things in the end of the Anthony notes quite correctly or\nA runner but just simply changes course in damages somebody else than the than who is liable and I think\nIt could be a painful lesson and be a liability laws if in fact we ever did learn to do this we we'd better learn to do with the exact precision

you can't ride it out and these days especially if you're on the coast lied and specially areas that are fall\nSo high water levels et cetera there is no riding it out you must get out\nYeah again

guess you know I I was a kind of surprised with Nikki Haley a a saying that she was gonna leave at the end of the year two and a gym as you pointed out why now before the election you know suddenly she could easily a postponed I think before a go after the election\nBut then it got to thinking about it and and I don't know I I don't know how accurate the information is but I've heard this on a several major a conservative talk radio programs\nThat a Rod Rosenstein up was going around trying to get Trump far removed under the twenty Fifth Amendment\nBuddy can only get a couple of cabinet members to agree with him\nNow it it just seemed coincidental that Trump met with Rod Rosenstein what just two days ago or something like that and all of a sudden you know she's announced she's going to resign I I'm just I'm just throwing the drive I have nothing to back it up it's just a sort of like a you know a gas in the gut feeling\nThat it's interesting but I I don't I don't really think that we're talking here first of all she's not always you miss it in a cabinet meeting she is not a a a a a principal a a a official as as such as defined by the uh the twenty Fifth Amendment\nA ... and the so no I think that we're probably not talking about about that but I'll defer to our guest a Benjamin Friedman\nI think I'm with you on that and I I don't I don't see that as his Bible I'm not even sure how that would work but uh\nThey were the ambitions I think for higher office are clear but I don't think there's any pathway for her right now on that uh\nIn in at least for the for the time being in one could imagine a if Trump got impeached or in a tent needed a running mate that she would be on the list but that's pretty far out scenario\nAbsolutely by the one interesting aspect of this thanks for your call top but just looking at the second floor of the twenty Fifth Amendment whenever the vice president and the majority of either the principal officers of the executive departments which would not include the UN ambassador\nOr of such other body as Congress may by law provide transmitted said or the president can do his job so on and so forth technically speaking Congress could say that whenever the vice president and they but\nRotary Club uh that that would be another body it it's just a a strangely worded amendment but to the issues at hand alum in Redding Pennsylvania joins us now in the ... album to good evening\nGentlemen and for your situation that they had everything to do with real world events that are happening in real time and that real world event is that the Saudis\nMight of murdered a um Turkish\nEntered the Saudi embassy now\nTrump is clearly doubled down on M. B. out new chain of the house it's God\nAnd has clearly said a line in the sand against turkey so I Believe that Nikki Haley\nUnderstand that in order to have a political future she needs the basically reference if this president just stay viable and I believe that as opposed\nTo stay viable for what is it safe viable Allen for what\nFor her future and politics could look he's going to fact Saudi Arabia to their health I and\nI'll be let me let me I'll leave or do I guess ... and tell you very frankly that the idea that that somehow\nThe entire American foreign policy infrastructure at the highest level is being dictated by what happened to somebody you walked into a a consulate does somewhere I I got to tell you a Benjamin free but I just a that's a little too Machiavellian for me [noise]\nUh well it's it's a speculative or I don't think it's crazy I I think it's one could surmise that uh one of the conflicts that might have happened was that she wanted more critical the Saudis and cut it but um because of Trump's filthy to them which is\nPretty evident but uh I don't think there's much evidence of that or I mean it makes sense or the Saudis are it murder it appears a is a a critic uh enter\nA car on ... so uh that's something but ah I don't know that that has anything to do with Haley's resignation\nYeah I I Would tend to does a good about myself ah but ah you I'll graduate it's such a conflict as you describe might very well have existed and sometimes the presidents of allegiance to various people are\nAre a little tough to figure Iranian leadership

important is this job in the the Trump Administration certainly there's been a bully pulpit\nFor a a lecturing the world of a number of things that are very candidly ad but uh I Would agree with every bit of electric drive her to date I think it's high time that the world was told that the number of things on the Dickey Haley was quite a affective do it so your your thoughts\nWill chase it perfectly it is pretty much a bully pulpit a you know especially in the ministry says he relies so much media perception\nI think especially in public and voters me Nikki Haley is very very very popular especially along with it I mean pretty much the Republican women that I Know\nA white Mickey elites rod and twenty twenty four I mean I'm personally someone who would vote for I think she's a great leader so she's very very popular and for that reason her position is very important or whether or not the station is important or will probably determine who goes it\nAnd if they can do a good

on Ted Cruz\nLions had you know each shot you know my dad chats\nAnd you know and now he's crazy so is it ...\nIt it does certainly a so seeing him or if you could look at it and a common thread that runs through a Trump Administration foreign policy I I have a little trouble\nA finding a common thread that holds for all parts of it but I I guess if I had to describe it it would be an on again off again a partial embrace of neo conservatism I don't know\nWell I mean I think you could describe it that way I Would describe it another way which should be speak loudly and carry a much bigger stack you know I very much they translate someone who is I'd say like cigars likes to call people\nIn his own way and for and he's always laid back it up I feel like it except are so rare example is the

the sign I Believe or a top of that I'm with her young children relatively speaking I think it's a wise move on earth part and I definitely would love to share a step back into it at a later time I think she has a lot to offer our country\nBecause I think certainly she it it it appears the death of not just a politician\nYeah is it appears that that is the plan I mean I Would be back this point I Would be surprised if she doesn't so she gets back involved again a in twenty twenty two years from now on the campaign\nAnd so she gets her page back on television and she gets interviewed a lot and then uh whoever wins in twenty twenty she then launches her twenty twenty four campaign that's that's my plan for her and\nShe [laughter] I don't know if she'll do it or not but uh [laughter] I I\nI I think she ends and the thing is I mean people are talking about like across the spectrum she is well respected by people on the left and the right or former governors\nShe's got she's got that

sounds like she ... she in Japan ... perspective yeah she she has\nGrown to respect what the Trump Administration has done in the last two years I think she ... green and that the world now listens to our president and respects our country and ah I think that that one or over so\nDoes she have to agree with you on that he was he was not a Trump banned in the beginning at all so um I think she's not alone I think she represents a lot of people try\nTo have to agree with you on that I I think she was always a fan of is about his platform and is I'm sure the gender from the Republican Party perspective but maybe not of his personality\n[laughter] there's a nice way that's\nI think well there's a lot of people like that she's not alone so uh but I think she has grown to be a a respectful of what it is that's happened I mean yeah and she she did not give a full throated\nHistory of everything that she has been involved with but she went through it pretty quickly and the highlights were pretty impressive all by themselves so I think we're going to say Nikki Haley around but I don't know why we don't have more politician to\nSee what she's doing and see the respect that she's going to garner from it and go hey maybe I should do that too I there there\nMay maybe this is about weather and and some others may follow suit diving earth humility speak volumes and has earned her great respect like you said\nFrom all files\nUm it would be nice for others to recognize that but what it is and perhaps take a ... book\nWhile she's the model of what that ... she's the bottom of what the

I don't think this actually hurt the administration right now it gave him a chance\nTo sit next to her um to be able to a real run run through what he regards as his foreign policy successes but um I think there's gonna be a lot of speculation about this and what he's done though is you know widow intentionally or not the spotlight is going to be on\nThis very popular very very successful female Republican and right now this is probably what the administration and the Republicans need at the moment\nWell and she was sitting next to him and they were friendly and she is a popular woman and so all that help with oh I guess Donald Trump doesn't hate women oh oh he gets along fine with this woman that I like a lot oh that's interesting oh so we really isn't a complete over\nHuh how 'bout that\nOkay so back to the old ... strategically business or David ... who's a CNN political director says to him this announcement does seem strategic\nYeah I mean full presidential treatment for a departure of the cabinet member you don't see something\nQuite like this is not how are the other cabinet members who've left the administration are into began or did not get this kind of treatment so I think what you saw there was that both President Trump and Nikki Haley\nA saw advantage for themselves in having this moment tying themselves or to each other both for the current moment and for a ... ... their political futures they just praying\nThat Nikki Haley heaped upon the president and\nHis vision and his family which was so interesting to hear her talk about millennia Trump and then uh at great length about Jared Kushner and Ivanka Trump at\nThese behind the scenes a masters in geniuses in the administration who go unnoticed I mean that plays right into the president's heartstrings there's nothing he likes to hear more than that so she was used as you said came into her praise of of all things President Trump\nOr from his policy vision to his personal family and that is not by accident\nOr you heard her say I know I'm going to get asked about politics you're going to ask me and my running in twenty twenty and that's why I'm leaving and she just endorse the president and said I'm going to be campaigning for this guy now of course\nI have no doubt that Nikki Haley is keeping her options open for a presidential run herself one day\nYeah no question about it no question about she did go on a if you missed that she had there and said el ends and she did run down to foreign policy successes of Russia Iran North Korea or on and on and on do you believe in term limits\nBut she said Jared Kushner and Ivanka Trump has been so wonderful\nAnd Jared is a absolute genius\nThe way that he put together the NAFTA deal it was absolute genius that and he doesn't get any credit for that I mean I've forgot he was supposed to go down there and cut some deal with Mexico so I guess he was involved in a ... getting rid of the NAFTA deal and putting in the U.S M. C. A. or whatever that things go\nShe called him a genius\nHow he was so great and so so ah was able to handle all that it was just terrific so she was yes either she is a phony new dollar bill or she is

hurricane season is officially over in November first that doesn't mean that nature always follows whatever the official or a calendar is on all of this so you get into and Joe always brings it up about climate change\nThan there are just a bunch of news about it a about climate change in in all kinds of different ways the Nobel Prize for economics was handed out yesterday and it was handed out to two guys William Nord house and Paul Romer\nNord house is best known for his models of the cost of climate change\nRomer works on a economic growth but Norton house um\nIs not just a academic he spent much of his career pushing for better environmental policy and he was an early promoter of the carbon tax and he built models to estimate the cost of climate change\nAnd they constructed these bottles so they could be used by actual policymakers not to impress his fellow academics but uh for policymakers to go okay this is what this guy says and he just got a Nobel Prize in economics because of it\nSo this is um\nAnd this isn't about whether you whatever you think about a climate change whether you believe it I don't believe it may or may not manmade whatever it might be but he's talking about the fact that there are things\nI'm Joel mentioned a client his clients are energy companies he talked about the hedge funds\nA there's a lot of people that are looking at how much it's going to cost to ah prevent damage from storms to people that are betting on how much it will be damaged that much people's property will be damaged by storms\nBut it is um Nord houses brother is an environmental lawyer who wrote parts of the clean Air Act of Nineteen Seventy\nAnd um so this that they're looking at going look at you want to you want to protect yourself from some of these storms than here are the places and this is how much you need to protect yourself against the storm surges how big the storms or just be\nThere was a great piece on sixty minutes about over in the hall and I believe it is where they have built all kinds of diets and storm walls that will close when the storms come in and they're they are surrounded by water basically at sea level [noise]\nOr they're

at it all this stuff about climate change and there's two things in the news today that kind of stand out at about climate change to me one of them is\nA President Trump who had been very outspoken about ethanol and\nHow it wasn't something that he thought was um [noise] really what we should be spending our money on well he's going to Iowa tonight\nEasy easy [laughter] [noise]\nSo when he gets there he is going to\nUm the midterms are approaching fast than the president's administration has\nAbandoned the longstanding EPA policy of allowing the sale of this ethanol blend gasoline all year long and so tonight he's going to announce that the EPA he's order the EPA to expand the sale of corn ethanol\nOr and it's\nOnly going to be for a few months so this is basically a full blown you're going to be able to get gasoline made from corn and\nSo the corn farmers in Iowa are going to be and the people of Iowa or going to be all very happy because he is now calling on an increase in ethanol sales which could help the a Republican\nWho is trailing the Democrat in the polls to be the next governor of Iowa as well as to uh Iowa house incumbents who are also vulnerable\nUh the oil industry's most powerful great group immediately said it will fight to block the actions so this is all he's going to a rally tonight in Council Bluffs Iowa\nAll right so there are some uh environmental news coming from the White House which is different than what it was before then\nThe other climate story or besides the hurricane today is Exxon Mobil yes that big evil oil company\nThat's what they're doing they are funding a multimillion dollar lobbying campaign focused on Congress because they want a price on carbon emissions\nStrike they are putting up a million dollars to campaign for a carbon tax Exxon oil\nOne of the few times and oil company has given money to fight climate change which uh if you got Exxon Mobil putting money into this thing lobbying a million dollars to lobby Congress\nExxon said they see a carbon tax as an alternative to patchwork regulations putting one cost on all carbon emitters nationwide eliminating regulatory uncertainty over axons businesses in states\nUh that are coming up with all kinds of different policies California has a carbon tax they tried to do with a carbon tax\nAnd they could not pass Congress\nPassed the Senate but did not pass the Democrat controlled house when Nancy Pelosi speaker\nSo I mean the tables on this environmental business are being moved around all the time it's hard to keep track\nYou want to say well the the oil companies are against the carbon decks nope not anymore not Exxon Mobil and I get what they're saying is look we can't just keep making oil different for different places\nWe've got one bland we want to make for the whole country for the whole world that instead of states coming up with all this patchwork of regulations about oil and oil production and and uh

thing he didn't have his hands up didn't say don't shoot but a President Obama a dotted fit to talk about America's flaws and suggested that Ferguson was a microcosm of it\nObama's attorney general Eric Holder said when it comes to matters of race America has been a nation of cowards close quote\nAnd he said that there were a America right now or is involved in ... racism gave ... examples\nSays the push for voting rights with a new push for for photo voter id was an example a pernicious racism never mind the majority of blacks want photo voter id\n... said a as another example of pernicious racism the fact that black boys or expelled or suspended from schools and a greater percentage than the other kids in that particular school\nHe a Jesse Jackson even food and all white school board in Decatur, Illinois for cutting out a bunch of black kids that were fighting after football games he argued that the all white um school board\nWas racist a and that the policy that will apply to these black boys was racist\nDecatur defended himself by pointing out all around the country where the school board is all white or school board are considering a pope people of color close quote back black boys are still kicked out disproportionately compared to other boys at that given given school why because they're misbehaving\nThe third example that a Eric Holder gave as an example of punishes racism or is the fact that a black\nCriminal defendant who commit the same crime has a white criminal defendant gets longer sentence and that is true what Eric Holder didn't tell you is that the U.S and the commission or that came up with that with that that also said the reason is for is the fact that judges\nOr when it comes to sentencing will take into consideration defend this arrest record and it turns out the typical black to send it has a longer arrest record than typical white defend it as a result that black defend it gets a longer sentence\nNothing to do with racism or the U.S

words of advice I'm always sort of cast helped us it's the format\nWhat is the right format to put it in there actually three chronological functional or hybrid\nNever thought about the idea that there would be more than one way to do a resume chronological we'll start with that when I get that that's an order time was whether it's from your earliest job to your last job or going from your last job to your earlier so I think we can understand that one that's a basic concept but one of the other two the functional and hybrid\nFunctional is one that focuses on skills that are quantifiable on the resume hybrid is a combination of the functional which is a focus on the skills and the chronological which less the work experience in chronological order\nOf the three which would you say is probably the best choice for basic just reading a resume\nThese days I Would say it's the hybrid because with the electronic scanning systems that are used with talent acquisition or they're looking for skill set on the resume things that are quantified in the experience and then actual\nHR people are looking for chronological lists of employment\nWe've covered chronological recovered functional we just talked a little bit about hybrid which is kind of a combination of the two how do you choose what to include on any of these\nFirst of all you want to start with a summary of qualifications which is some other kind of descriptive sentences linked together in a paragraph that our other than the qualified scales things like if you wrote a grant how\nMuch that grant was worth let's say it was five hundred thousand dollars and you wrote in one that grant how that grant was used it was used for training purposes how was it used\nTo train counsellors to be certified in their field other things that you can list are computer skills\nMicrosoft Office\nWell let's go back to qualifications you said you can include those but do you want to include all of your qualifications or a summary\nWhat you want to do is have at the top of the resume a summary of qualifications that is that is descriptive and then underneath your skills\nAnd qualifications you want to have quantified things like if you were the top sales leader for a quarter in your field than you want to list that in numbers um if you were\nA the most if you prospect that the most times in in if you are the leading prospect or in your group you want to put that in there if you wrote over a research paper and it was published you want to put that in there\nIn general when you're ... bond and your your summary of qualifications and your caller because what you're really saying is the summary is pretty much a preview and then you want to go ahead and break down the coldest ... that's correct okay well we better qualifications and you mentioned skills what are the difference on a resume between qualifications and skills\nSkills have actual numbers and items that quantified them\nA a summary is just that a description of what you've done you might have I seen that on the chronological resume as\nA description of your job title or description of the job that you did for for that employer\nIs it important to include every possible qualification unskilled or should do just Taylor that to the job you're applying for\nYou should always Taylor for the job that you're applying for I Know that

reinforce the decision America Made not to make or the next president United States and so desperate to matter unbelievable\nThe number two I think the Democrats are pretty maxed out on motivation and they've been raging for two years they're eager to vote so I think any additional motivation to get out of the Kavanaugh fair is likely to be only a modest increase Republicans on the other hand

nationalist got who\nOr what is with her why she allowed to get away with this anyone who voted forms of white nationalist peachy he got elected because of white nationalist what is wrong with it I mean I Can't get over that she's allowed to get away with this and nobody follows up and says well I think it's wrong Hillary Clinton to label Donald Trump supporters as white nationalist [noise]\nEspecially you got more African American votes not enough but a more intimate votes in Romney and McCain\nAnd he is done better for minorities in terms of economic benefits I think the whole Charlottesville thing was a travesty so easily avoided are easy to condemn any didn't he blew it you asked me and he says\nIn the Woodward book it says he's quoted telling people yeah screw that up I

because she got more in the west coast in east coast but not in the middle and the states they have to be delivered in\nSo she can go to certain people raise some money usually though it raises for

I don't like his policies you can't say that he's had a great speaker you can't say that he can't fill up a a building\nBut Hillary Clinton cat never coach he has nothing to say there's nothing authentic [noise]\nYou know maybe a secretary of state she was affected because she doesn't have to sell anybody on anything it's out of the political arena she is not a good politician ended up story she reminds people of losing that's it\nAl Gore got more popular votes in George Bush but Al Gore's not asked to help out John Kerry because you looked at as a loser who couldn't motivate and execute and produced when you had to listen to this more from Hillary Clinton's ranch cutlery to\nAnd the ... one of their priorities should be left to protect our elections let's make sure that ah we had electrical security let's end the suppression of voters so there is a big agenda or if the Democrats take a\nListen number one there is a movement\nOr to protect the election and so for the big story I think in the Washington Post no sign the Russians are metal him in the midterms they are concerned about what's happening with China\nAnd the president called about specifically and they are much better hackers sadly then the Russians and a much bigger economic and military threat than the Russian so they are concerned and the Russians got so much blowback\nAfter what they try to do in the election from Facebook adds to the people\nThat is really hurt American us railroad Russian relations to a point with all these individual sanctions on rich people and now the fortifications of our our defense of Ukraine with lethal weapons that we've given them and missile defense system that's been implemented now they're realizing all we did\nWas make it impossible to have good relations so the Russians aren't playing a role we should keep everything else in mind but we're not legitimize ing elections what are you talking about because elections you didn't when you got three million more votes because you maximize votes in Los Angeles\nAnd you maximize vote in San Francisco and you maximize votes in New York City\nAnd that's fine but it doesn't get you elections that's what I play the game you can't decide a baseball game on total hits you can't decide a football game on total yards hey we ... we had Tyler position but\nWhat's the score the school was you lost a lot of states by a lot [noise]\nHere Steve ... news Ninety six five and a window Hey Steve\nGo around I Love the show man thank you ... you are listening\nOriginally from Chicago um I don't ever remember politics being the way they are terrible graduate or if the sports ...

I Can't believe the polls that were alive journalists that were saying that are a lot of the late night gods who give their opinions\nBecause they said that every year when there's intellect or every election year they say they look at the polls and they're wrong and that's what we found this last election\nSee people say well Hillary Clinton Jeffrey tube and we just played so you know why can't Hillary Clinton go out there she got more of a three million more votes and President Trump now Bill Clinton won ... liberal states uh for her but that's how you do it a try and tell you it's electric what does it take to win Iowa was it take to a new ...\nAnd the any of the injury I Can't do that once you live in electoral college like you can't get rid of that 'cause it just California ... if she

Stephen Harper okay okay I go to ... do you let me go to trial yet well he's a former Canadian Prime minister okay\nSo she or he was asked you know how effective is Trump foreign policy with Nikki Haley in George ...\nShe was very effective in communicating very different American approach to foreign policy you say an unorthodox one also one that you know was not an easy one to deliver what she did it in a way that I think got her respect and was effective and\nThat you know there's there's often a it's often position that the president to take the stronger position on foreign affairs must somehow inherently disagreeable and I think she showed that you can be respected and be very effective well delivering messages that a lot of people don't want to hear\nThat was even opera ... the president got an unorthodox style and people just can't handle it is that you say well it's two different ways approaching things would you say it so wrong ways approaching thing they said it's just being open to it you know when things do have to change they just say well you know he's wrong to be doing this because that's the way it's usually done she was\nGoing to arm I think to the president because she would walk into journals are to the un building and stand in front of world leaders and she would continuously continue his message America First and we're not going to stand for that and we're not going to be bullied\nNow think about this Indian American that's a positive right number two ... husband's in the military ... number two female who has come out against a strong on race in South Carolina she took down even Confederate fine shooting as well ... stood up strong\nA very popular good campaigner I mean she is I I Know things change so ideal\nRight and state experience at as a governor which is huge if you're going to run for president one day and then also she has a global knowledge because she's trained internationally and domestically she brings a lot to the table her resume strong\nIt just so bad that we agree on this was so much better when we disagree well\nYou know she she really I've always found her career being from South Carolina and um there were some controversies when she first took office of some people that didn't like some of the things that she did so I wasn't really sure\nOn and then over the years she's just sold everyone and the way she represents South Carolina the national level and or international level it's pretty impressive and we met her and honestly on a personal note when my mother got sick\nMy mother had a stroke in February she wrote me texted me and said I heard your mom had a stroke I'm praying for there are a lot of people in the Bible and your mom's Bible study that told me that your mom was sick thought that was very impressive she came on our set the other day we interviewed her in at the end of the interview she said by the way how's your mom doing special touches it ... it really matters yeah here\nUsually to Nikki Haley said about this White House in this policy which is America First which in a international body might not fly cuts them\nWhat had happened with the United states on foreign policy now the United states\nSaid that's what we're seeing if we say we're going to do something we fall when the president for that whether it was it the chemical weapons in Syria whether it was\nSaying that other countries have to pay their share of whether the trade you know forgive and amazing they\nAnd they call it\nA shot that job as we respected we might not have that many friends

them a shot at freedom things or do whatever we might have a window right now you believe right\nWell I'm going to say two things about this because I'm Glad you brought it up it doesn't get enough attention the conventional wisdom on Iraq is that it's\nThe greatest mistake in Vietnam or worse than that it's sort of you know a constant refrain\nLet's look at that Fifteen Years later there have been for success of national elections there is a constitution there's real politics and it's free media in Iraq\nThere are a lot of problems in Iraq there was the rise of ice and they're still the real threat of violence sectarianism similar kind of a weapon on but at the same time they are further along now\nAnd they are now to regular elections African constitution and they are demanding reform and here's another interesting thing about the moment\nThat we're in right now the person that looked the slate of candidates the one the most votes in the election in may\nThat finally resulted in this government that was formed last week\nWas led by somebody who is the crowd was the fiercest critics was in the Sheena Arab majority community in Iraq moved to the outsider of the Iranian influence in Iraq so that data point number one data point number two is that over the summer and it intensified in September you saw real protest\nMarches and and and sit in there you know the Iranian consulate in Basra which is\nA traditionally very close to her on a since the fall of Saddam was burned by\nProtesters people are furious at the influence of Iran in that country ten years ago ... was\nYou know seen as almost a sort of colony of Iran ten years later in twenty Eighteen phosphorus is maybe the ... center point of the new Iraqi resistance against Iran\nThat is something that I think bodes very well and you should not just assume that Iraq is going to always be uh the Vaseline of Iran which is pretty much just some ... under Obama and I think\nYou know even at the end of Bush's uh you're just going to have to live with the Iranians there that that doesn't mean that the u._s. should send a hundred thousand troops into Iraq and re fight the Iraq War that's not what I'm saying at all but it is an opportunity for the kind of diplomatic\nEconomic engagement I Know that sometimes foreign aid is seen as the dirty work but it shouldn't be in the case of Iraq where if you can use that investment um to support the politicians that need to show their own people that their independence from Iran America can really play an important role there and that is the opportunity that we have and it's\nEspecially as the Iranian economy itself is about to pay these crippling sanctions and here's a chance to really\nYou know potentially make it a a difference here and now and to prevent what we thought was complete what's with that Iran to take over I mean how many times have you heard that in the last from Europe right so it's not necessarily selling a lot of the Rockies really resent Iranians right now I take advantage\nYeah I think it's a it's quite interesting we need somebody like Ryan Crocker who thoroughly understand rocket and understand who the power players are and have to be an ... er here right now like random avenue ... river yeah we don't have an ambassador there right\nNow we do have an ambassador I'm I'm I I'm Sorry not getting his name off the top of my head but but you know Crocker\n... I think was a terrific ambassador in and he understood he he by the way he negotiated times of the Iranians you have to negotiate with people just not a an argument for completely shutting someone diplomatically but it's understanding that it\nIs that what we thought was inevitable if the Iranians were there forever and we would have to leave in the sense that they're going to basically be controlling the political process they didn't control the political\nProcess the time in the formation of the government their candidates did not do as well as they would have like in the election and now that we have the beginning of this new government in Iraq lets you know work with them and show that we can be just as good a partner to what they want 'em and not that it's just a back burner issue and that we're trying to even with you know it's yesterday's ...\nWhy he lasted the Washington Post or the Washington Post writer and there's the turkey believes he was murdered they believe they they said they can wind up the footage to show what happened in Saudi Arabia he tells the latest\n[noise] All right so a couple of words of caution here um I mean when it was just Turkish officials I was more skeptical they have put out more evidence the Saudis story looks less and less plausible and we should brace ourselves for the worst this has very significant implications because\nSaudi Arabia the United states of an ally since Nineteen thirties and the strategic rationale for that alliance is still going to be there even if it turns out that they get this horrendous and horrific crime but we also have an interest in any rules based international system\nAnd that means that we cannot allow countries to kill Washington Post journalists were even abducted Washington Post journalist the way that the Saudis\nHave just done they have ... if this is true this is what the Iranians do this is what the Russians do this work the ropes of the world do\nThe national order and in that respect\nSaudi Arabia does need to pay a very significant consequences to deter them from doing that I Do not think that means that we we think the fundamental us Saudi alliance as bad as this particular thing is\nAnd it does not necessarily negate the reforms of their younger crown prince who was finally doing a lot of things that we have one of the south has to do for decades which is\nAllowing women to drive allowing halls have movie theaters are allowing some private investment and their oil companies and finally doing something about the radical hate filled Islamic\nFundamentalism that comes from a lot of their mosques and they're kind of clerical and that was that so all of those reforms are a good thing\nBut it comes with a really ugly ugly side as well and this is not the first example of it\nWe've seen a number of crackdowns as of yesterday in Saudi Arabia people could do not deserve that dreaming\nIt's something we see with you know a al Sisi and you can say you know we're choosing between some bad options but the Saudis to understand that they really cross the line here is somebody who was an American resident went on American citizen wrote for the Washington Post ... I mean as a journalist I thought the gate it by it and we can't happen\n[noise] yeah I think the president's got a step it up and get some answers because uh you know he's been attacking the press ...

looking\nFor good affordable laptop for college can you recommend a good one to me\nSo laptops or the cheapest\nThat they have ever been for a full featured powerful laptop\nYou can buy an entry level laptop that is more powerful than like any windows laptop of just three years ago and you can buy those at right around two hundred dollars\nAnd they go on sale all through the year there are certain times their laptops are cheaper than others the usually the lowest cost time\nTo buy a laptop we'll be either in August\nOr it will be or in the month of November approaching the Thanksgiving holiday the whole Black Friday the old time so it's really inexpensive\nFor you to buy a laptop that all works fine for school except for Apple apple laptops continue to be extremely expensive I'm looking at one of the sites you can get a sense of how cheap laptops are and how capable they are micro\nCenter dot com which is a high volume seller of laptops and I'm working one Ninety nine two forty nine two

being used how much effect it has so the newest scoring models like the newest psycho model\nGives you a good bump into your credit score if you take an active collection and\nSatellite pay it and it's now report is a zero balance but the lender has to be using the newest model of the psycho scoring which just completely depends on the credit grander\nYet it so it's not whether one of the three credit bureaus are using the latest model it's based on the credit union and what they're even\nExactly so as an example the one that takes into account how you handled past what excuse the term what they would call bad behavior and you've turned it or you've turned it around and you\nModel known as spike oh nine is the one that the credit union would have to be using as I understand it for there to be a meaningful impact on your score paying off and old item I mean generally wants an old item hit seven years that vanishes anyway\nMy follow up on that is a one of the items collections us from twenty eleven but it looks like when on my credit report and now shows twenty Fifteen like maybe there was some way to the gate got refreshed or is that\n... that is the term that I use for it and that is an illegal activity on the part of whoever is reporting that debt unless you took some kind of action on it in twenty Fifteen so what you do is you challenge the date was known as the date of last activity for it\nGot it and generally they don't want to fight with somebody who knows that's how the rules work that's how the law works\nSo you would challenge that item not being on your report that the date that that item is on your report because the aging of it is so important and you contact both whoever the collection agency is reporting it as twenty Fifteen instead of twenty eleven you challenge with them and the credit bureau\nGot it okay so ...\nHow many items from there that are these old items and collection\nOf depends on which bureau I have as little as two one zero and as many as four and another one\nIn or they generally in the age back like early this decade or some of the more recent\nThe most recent one I Would say is four to five years ago\nOkay so that one's got a little clock time to run but the thing is is that the whole idea of credit scoring is that you're not in a credit purgatory forever\nThe ones that period of time passes even if you don't pay on the debt they disappear and you have a fresh start\nSo you're getting this or that but settling the ones in particular that are more recent would be to your advantage if you're trying to get credit right now\nExactly so the first thing for me it was just a cocked on a credit union and just ask them if they're using the\nNine and the person you talked to a loan officer they'll know if it's somebody at the credit union they're not going to know\nAnd you ask them how do they make a determination are making alone\nIn the event that you have a zero balance is on these old items will that change the loan approval process for them there is a great explanation about what happens with older items on credit reports\nAt a website you may have heard me mentioned from time to time credits sesame dot com go read their briefing on what happens with collection items and the different scenarios that apply\nJim joins us on the Clark Howard show Jim you have an idea you want to share with your fellow listener about emergency savings funds is that true\nThat's true so Clarke I er I already max out my retirement or a threw rocks and a four one K. and I've got a [noise] a money sitting in the emergency thunk obviously for emergency [noise] but\nUh it's a pretty good chunk of money and I was toying with the idea of taking maybe I don't know half of it and putting it into a target retirement fund that either recently passed\nKnowing that the you know that they're trying to keep killing who is retired or about to retired or try to keep their money you know from from going down obviously I Know there's no gas\nThat in order to maybe for a little bit of money\nThat I think that that is a very low risk strategy to try to goose the return on your rainy day money right and so going into a post retiree portfolio which is what you're doing I think that's a very viable strategy\nObviously a someone who's already in retirement they've they've lived more toward bondsmen stock I notice the interest rates go up bond won't be looking so hot\nThat is true but you know the whole idea about how they do one of those portfolios is where I mean you can even go into a balance fun that's fifty percent stocks fifty percent fixed income or bonds and the ideas that the risk counteract each other you'd have to have a perfect storm\nFor you to lose a substantial amount of money with either scenario\nAnd even though you're a hundred percent correct his interest rates rise the value of bonds will go down if you're concerned about that you could build your own portfolio using a short or ultra short bond fund\nAnd using a lower risk stock portfolio stock fund portfolio and eliminate a lot of the bond interest rate risk\nBut the idea of as somebody who's a Mac saver like U. of taking a lot of your rainy day money and investing it at a low risk kind of point of the scale I think is great\nChris is with us on the Clark Howard show hello Chris how can I serve you today\nWell I'll tell you what Thirty years I've been thinking about lasik surgery surgery and I keep upgrading my glasses every year year and a half and got the point now I've got a range of\nA lazy and I've seen so many price ranges a some a dollar and then there's some ... and ... dollars and I just want to know where to go\nSo this is this is a tough one because this is where the wallet meets medicine and science so there are high volume chains are used to be a lot more through the shakeout phase with lasik\nBut there are the volume chains that charge like two fifty three hundred three fifty and I\nYeah and then there are the boutique places that do lasik they charge several thousand dollars and I was like and this one is one of those things that does not have\nA right answer when you go to the high volume chains you have the benefit that the ophthalmologist doing the procedure dies a ton of them and there's an advantage\nWith medical procedures when someone has a great deal of experience\nBut also you are in a basically a factory in assembly line and if you have issues or problems later\nThe difficulty you might have with one of the high volume discounters is that any follow through is extra any what they call the euphemism enhancements\nEnhancements means and lasik surgery okay a lot of people may not be aware that after you have an id done you may need a follow up surgery that it that it may not have gone exactly as planned\nAnd with a high volume discounters you will usually pay every time they do any kind of follow up with it\nWhere you pay a much higher price up front it tends to be a more personalized experience\nAnd more time will typically be spent with you pretty qualifying you as a candidate and then doing the procedure\nAnd as a general rule it's not ever going to be a hundred percent but it was a general rule all follow up is included in the initial price you pay\nWell okay so that's why I Can't say that oh yeah just go to the place that's three hundred bucks and I\nWhatever so it does matter on reputation and what people have to say about it now there's a website that we had been directing people to\nTo check out doctors and get referrals for doctors and reviews of doctors and I would suggest that you go to Zach Zach\nZ.

maybe I'm listening to Kirby Smart too much he but he really does a great job\nOf trying to confuse the or the fan interviewer on how good is team is but I but I Know what you know I Know I Know the large degree of talent on that football team or I don't think you know issue comes close\nWell here's my thing is you know you got Jake from played in the rose bowl last year ... went toe to toe on the shootout Baker Mayfield and we all would have lost money that was the ...\nUm so you know I don't think he's going to be rattle back home that home field advantage is real um but I think it only cares you so for me to your point I think I think we do have talent\nI I got to trust your target coaching in that\nIt unless you're on the road so I think it mattered Saturday for ... for Florida and I think if Georgia's in a shootout at could matter for al issue but just in terms of the getting the game establish no I mean jak from has\nEnormous experience at this point in hostile environments thank you very very much appreciate the call case is up next good afternoon\nPaul how are you okay\nGood afternoon thanks for the call\nJust wanted a get your inside on may be why UCF in Cincinnati isn't getting a lot of ... and this is the second year UCF started six to know her better as it because of the\nConference airplane and or maybe the gangs and their schedules and\nI mean the bottom line or they do play each other so that tiger will be a broken and UCF as a I mean here's the deal when I was about to say UCF has a tough road game this week at Memphis that says all you need to know about the UCF schedule\nA Memphis has been a consistent team in recent years they've had some decent wins\nThey've had a they have a really good program but but that's the extent of avoid UCF is right now they don't play a scheduled that's comparable they're not going to tiger stadium Saturday and say did they lose so ah yeah I Am officially tired of the UCF sickle fans\nSean is up next in Georgia Sean go right ahead\nI thought that that ... ... ... just wanting to know what\nYour thought of Florida were pre season on how they lived up to those thoughts are done better and second thing how do you think they're going to be next year\n[noise] yeah I I did not think they could do what they've done so far I mean I I had them somewhere in the in the eight when margin I I I ... I didn't think they could get much above that because I thought the schedule\nWould end up getting them um But Dan mowing has as John a phenomenal job as we talked about last friday when we were down in Gainesville just energizing that team by making correct caused by developing Philippe Franks and uh I think next year\nThey're going to ah they need they need it they need another good year and recruiting I Will say\nThat thanks for the call appreciate it let's continue and Steve is in Louisiana hello Steve\nThat'll Powell [noise] ah [noise]\nI won't talk to you about men crammed in time that I've been a fan for fifty years and I'm proud of the defense is not the best defense they've ever had a\nFact savings probably had\nEight bedroom ones and I know that ... had a bunch a but\nThis ... is the death that's ever been on the field for Alabama they have for bona fide NFL wide receivers they have for\nA\nRun in text that will probably be in the NFL or\nTo as that they've\nTold you earlier will probably be the number one pick in two years\n\nAnd all this talk about uh Alabama schedule a last time I checked a Alabama couldn't say are we won't this team and his team and his team and then teams have to do it the other team has to agree\n\nYou're correct on all sides of about corn Steven thank you very very much schedule\nDoesn't look all that great I think would Louisville's is really ...\nI'm going to play they better opponents or they'd be getting more respect\nJoe is up next a joke in the afternoon\nBut at the ball I make in the day\nWe were doing great\nWell that's good I've been listening to the show and Darryl ... well you know that's\nGood bye And good read it but he ... he sold up you know the ... the same\nThey all got the same problem and all that they would want to call and talk about next saved in Alabama and I just got back and not on the brain but anyway I won't talk football and some of the first I Want to say Dallas and prior to everybody along the coast is so effective by hurricane Michael\nThoughts and prayers weigh ins and outs stay safe but ah this Alabama game in Missouri coming up oh what what does Alabama need to do to straighten this day fans out I mean I I Can't remember the last time anybody home thirty points up almost [noise]\nPlus was Clemson and I you know so I wanted them to do that and as David ... got a good quarterback and Google is coming to Tuscaloosa Saturday and\nI like to know what what can do to tighten up as they fans and just shut down through law I mean how how we're going to correct problems on day than some ink which crave on days is out now and we're yo know lowering the secondary and we all knew it was going to go to\nGo with you know I think the answer is pretty obvious it's just really comes down to the fundamental football and you watch the games that are they're they're making too many mistakes uh they're missing assignments are not following the play ah they're they're just sloppy\nYeah it didn't ... this past Saturday look look really bad it's\nLike they wouldn't even [noise] it's almost like they didn't show up I mean they were playing but they wouldn't play with the same and dance the I've seen them play the first five games as far as you know the defensive side of the bowl as ... where we gave up there but we're we're safety points up so\nThat was part of the problem Joe is it the it it comes down to intensity and the the defense just isn't\nReally being tested uh overall I mean I Know they're they're getting gashed there you know there's there's something wrong I mean remember you do have a change at the top I'm I'm not blaming cash or what he followed Kirby Smart and Jeremy Pruitt\n\nBut I'll get off here ... thank you for taking my call and when you live in a John Rand no appreciate everything you do\nFor the input on college go above the go without gel way would be born not Alabama\nLike why are they saying it very much we're going to be here and again I I I don't think will save us enough times but I think everybody knows the a footprint of this program and where it is a seen and heard the motion\nYeah I mean I think there's a we're looking at a pretty good shot and now the Notre Dame can run the table I mean I remember talking to you in the pre season that was actually a big call of ours was known her name was a real playoff contender before the year we had him at the top four playoff team at the time and\nAll of a sudden it's starting to look more and more realistic I'm with you know maybe northwestern maybe as the but\nNotre Dame is looking like a very good chance we've got 'em over sixty percent now to make the play off not quite in Alabama Territory but they're close\nNow we know things don't always or ever for that matter go according to plan it it's easy if you if you look at Alabama work Clemson or Notre Dame or even Ohio State to find a a lotta lotta wins and it's it's hard to pinpoint the losses\nBut if it gets jammed at the top what happens to a a loser of let's say a one versus two S. E. C. championship game\nYeah I mean it it is definitely possible that the loser and that after the championship game to game could missed out because if there's enough other wins you know from teams around the country to thing I'd say about that though is\nI I said it last week I'll say that again is I think the chaos still like come on and there will be lost his elsewhere wink fooling run of the top five that we talked about at the beginning\nThere is a only a two percent chance that all of them went out through November So I think that those losses WorldCom it's not just on likely based on the projections it's unlikely based on history the last time we had\nFour undefeated major teams was Nineteen forty nine and was army in power in that group so I that's just not going to happen again\nOr let's talk about this weekend's biggest game of the SCC and maybe the country is Georgia at LSU what's at stake\nYeah biggest game in the country in terms of the playoffs the impact that it has nothing really to do with LSU I Know there are obviously mathematically alive but our projections just don't give them\nBasically any chance to make the playoffs at this point from Georgia a loss would knock them down to about thirty two percent to made the playoffs that might sound a little high to some people I'm guessing but it's really just because\nThey would still be an overwhelming favorite to win the SEC east now they have to get past Alabama I'm In the championship game but at least they would get in that game still most likely\nWith a lost so important game for Georgia 'cause you don't want to have to win that SEC championship game but uh this is their toughest contests are scheduled contests are remaining\nAnd finally shifts a it's a question gets asked all the time by by fans who maybe don't understand the process very well\nThey're a path to the playoffs where you see uh\nWe do not see a realistic path\nTo the playoffs for ... the yeah I think I heard you a couple of callers ago you're sick of hearing about you and I I think it's only going to get louder if they keep winning but we still don't see them as having a resume to get it done now maybe that committee takes in a consideration last year or something like that but I don't think that you are going to be able to look\nAt the end of the season I wasn't UCF has done with a schedule that they've played and say that they deserve to be in over for other teams from the major conferences\nOkay you said it I listen to thank you very much as always we'll see you next week ties all\nThat stuff stuff all

Paul\nKnow Georgia is young they're very young and they possibly could lose the game you know the SEC the schedule is\nWhat it is just like Alabama last year their schedule was that the greatest but guess what they steal won the national championship it doesn't matter who you put in front of an ACC teams they got to be ready to play and they have to win the new\nBraunfels to jump on the LSU bandwagon all of a sudden inside they're gonna be Georgia because his team they beat LSU you know he's praying on his knees right now\nFor for LSU to be just because they already lost ... paid leave we'll pay\nIn Jacksonville and we will see not love to make a bet with Ron in has him have to take the picture to put on your show with the Georgia shirt and now the one with the gate or you're just like a marker spears the when he went with his home team\nOkay and I went with her LSU to tell you the truth but let's get to land\nI live healthcare is a primary care provider was pediatric care urgent care VA services and they can even help with your seasonal allergies the islands healthcare T.

I tell\nYou what he won ...\nWell we appreciate that contribution there ah Terry is calling next hello Terry Hi Paul how are you today I'm doing well I Hope you are Oh thank you\nI've got a question for you what do you think about like the FCC their east and west every five years might be put a shakeup in there and they draw for the numbers to\nDivide the divisions\n[noise] well I mean they they do rotate or the you know ... there is there's a game rotated but but I Would agree for the most part uh with with fourteen school you don't see you don't see the are you you don't see opponent like at like Alabama in Missouri they played one time it was a one off you don't\nSee 'em some of the uh the LSU Georgia game is is a rarity we haven't seen this game since Thirteen and we haven't seen it in Baton Rouge or thinking about ten years right\nI I mean I Believe that would put a lot more ... end of\nCollege football especially they as they say fans\nBut all the problem here is a problem though uh and and this is one reason why I think of the the argument for nine games is going to continue not by many people by by some is it where they games you end up getting a\nMe too and watch a ballgame lets us be spent the truth out here okay nobody wants to marry and some of those games on the next to the last weekend of the year\nAnd if you added a conference game it would create more losses for the conference but I think the quality of football and the and the product or least disseminated on television would be better\nLike it is now I mean it just seems like the west coast die because of the way they're playing oh let's just let it I mean you probably better than you're going to be better\n[noise] [noise] yeah but this year and I think it will say it could change dramatically this weekend or or\nMaybe not the Missouri in Alabama that's the level of light likely to go to the west to east has done a Mississippi State has lost a to Florida in Kentucky already this year so those are ah west losses to the east\nYou certainly uh we'll see more of these match ups to sometimes there's a little hard to ah calculate uh this year though I Do think the east is getting better thank you for the call thank you very very much Michael\nIn New Orleans Hey Mike or good afternoon\n... first time caller thank you very much\nIt's hard to ask you a little bit of a crazy question I was looking at the right things and I was wondering if Colorado having to run the table and when the pact well how could they possibly put\nThem and over and over again like did that happen\n[noise] but I don't think you could um you know if you if you run the table a and I remember Colorado is in this position what two or three years ago and then lost the uh the patch world championship game I ah [noise] I don't think they would get in over Notre Dame\n[noise] oh okay it's just I was looking at the right ... yeah well I have a happy and ship but they they have\nTo go as they do go to Washington are now Washington right now is still a good when it did lose to Auburn ah it's not undefeated but it would uh I mean that that's a hard one to say right now because I I have a very hard time believing Colorado can get through this gauntlet\nSo uh they're not going to say that they played UCF later near so I think I Know I'm not trying to compare Cincinnati to Colorado but let's move along Gary in Jackson yeah hey Gary\n... first time caller how are ya\nI'm doing great thanks a lot of\nGood um I just basically had a comment about Florida Florida fan and um I think Marlene is doing awesome job there and uh I mean there's nothing I can say that's that's a not good that he's done except one thing I think Florida has a secret weapon\nAnd they're not using them\nAnd that secret weapon\nTo me is Damien pears I don't why he's not getting more more carries I mean he's got flashes of Emmett Smith and I'm not saying I'm a no at all but I I and I coach football done around football and I can just see that\nOkay well let me let me let me toss it back to you because you do you do no more than most of his Gary so you write us a legitimate question now let me ask you to try to answer the question what what would your best guess be\nWhy why they're not playing Damien yeah\nI I mean I don't know he has a phone bowled a he's not the only thing that I can think of is that he's he still doesn't uh maybe no where where to line up or write or maybe it's getting used to the system that's the only thing I could think of 'cause when he's in there\nI mean he just shows flashes of a Emmett Smith ... may I remember that in the middle of night I go way back in Nineteen eighty when they played harsh a walk or as a fresh but they didn't put them into the middle of the season and boy did they find out ... the first time in boy after that I was like\nUnstoppable and\nUh well yeah I've got a standard freshmen against Alabama I think it was ... he made in Seventy ran for two hundred and\nTwenty five yards I think and I just\nRemember I remember they doing well well ... thanks again here's you know but yeah I mean I I don't know but you you're a coach you understand it better than most there are there are usually reasons or walk coaches are concerned especially with a running back you you have to understand\nEverything about the game and as far as her own for a social Walker he did not start\nFirst game against Tennessee he did come in and never look back so we have a lot to do here I'm On the program Berlin courses coming up here shortly so do not dare go anywhere ... Houston and you are on the air ...\nHey how you doing all\nWe're doing great thank you\nA first time caller thanks for having me I'm sort of got one a general question didn't want about all those years and I'll just get off the line to let you talk okay\nUm so first\nKelly Brian where do you think a a likely home for him to land would be a second would be a nose to Georgia I you know I'm really just not getting why Georgia's so over hype they uh\nYou know middle Tennessee state Tennessee dandy all those games should have been completely controlled by a team is highly ranked as they are but they weren't so if you could shed some light on that\nYeah it was like hey I I think those are the are the kind of like Brian sweepstakes are pretty interesting yeah I've heard Mel uh Auburn mentioned of hurt other schools mentioned or I don't really have a great insight into that right now but he's going to go somewhere that he's comfortable\nAnd I uh\nDon't know the answer yet um we are we're we're robbing and some break ... is ...\nThat's part of the program but uh we look forward to chatting with one of the true legends in the FCC and in college sports in sports in general all of that coming out shortly\nWelcome to balance the official retail department store for the SEC where stores in the southeast belt get your passion and knows it's more than a game it's a way of life in

think that's what they have done is is uh they seem to get along really well are are basically from my standpoint they seem to\nAnd uh you know north central has come down from the north\nAnd into Smith county and in a ditty sees come up from the south so speaking twin likes this come from the northeast side toward a from Cookeville area and so ah they they seem to cooperate really well and uh I I don't see any change in that and just based on what I'm here\nAnd we're speaking with a missed billboards executive director of Smith Kenny chamber talking about the new broadband coming to to the area um [noise] [noise] ... you mentioned that someone's said about twenty twenty or twenty twenty two the whole county she should have broadband but they are I take it a project what what's the timeframe on this one\nOf their talking two years a max on this so I'm thinking that uh you know couple of years from now these people will be sitting ... who was a complete system in place or where they can use\nAnd I guess once they start this project it makes it that much easier to extend it the rest of the county\nRight well it it the answer to that is yes and no uh\nThe the reason I say yes is because if you've got a line extended to this point and then yeah you can tap on to that and actually the way they're doing this is their looping the line\nSo that if one portion of it goes out you can you know get it from the back side and I and I'm not sure I'm a vote way over simplifying the technology but uh that's kind of the way it works is water flowing and if it doesn't fly one direction you can you know bring it from the other\nBut the reason it's not as simple as how the cost of getting this to a customer or\nThe one area that to the cap telephone went into the cost per customer was about Fifteen hundred dollars that's why you're commercial companies won't do this and that's why you gotta have grants and government assistance or a a\nUSDA in uh in rural development if it were were for these loans you wouldn't see things like this happening and it's just like in the old days when telephone came in when\nUh the ... rural electrification administration was form if it weren't for ah programs like this you wouldn't have that and and people that don't see this is a good thing they are being short sighted because\nWe're gonna have to put people somewhere and you maybe there will be mega city some day and we'll all live in one you know form square miles off about ... I Hope not and and I don't want that for my children and so I'd like to see us have these services to where\nYou'll be able to live out in the country and do this and how organizations like this are about the only way you can do it because of the cost\nOf getting in line to the customer it gets really expensive so that's\nWhy ah the timeline might be affected by being able to get a grant more you know maybe they go to this area because they've already done this and they can connect to it so there's a lot of factors involved but\nThe map that I saw showed that we would have something in you know two to five years\nSo the old adage if you build it they will come right\nOh you know your population density drives a lot of things in for of course for commercial companies that means everything you know if that can get their cost per customer down to Fifteen or twenty dollars will yeah they're they're ready to move in ... do you tell them it's going to cost Fifteen hundred dollars

like Facebook and other social media and their travel schedule is nuts we talk about that as well but there are a couple of things that happened today and I'm gonna I'm going to bring you this I Breathe a video on television I'll bring you the audio on the radio\nHillary Clinton\nIs now saying why the Democrats had been so uncivil\nAnd she somehow was blaming the Republicans keep in mind\nThese are the people that are dividing conquer these are the people that are separate these are the people that are historically known for segregation Jim Crow separate but equal this is a separate party it always has been there are also responsible for slavery and the KKK and write them on lynchings\nThe Democrats are actually seeing the same things they've always said\nWhich are we must divide and conquer and separate and if that doesn't work if we actually see some civility we need to be uncivilized so that we can get that we can get back what it is that we think is ours so let me give you a Hillary Clinton had to say too I think God Chris gentleman poor about being civilized or not\nYou cannot be several with a political party that wants to destroy what you stand for what you care about that's why I Believe if we are fortunate enough\nTo win back the ... or the Senate that's when ... started down but until then the only thing that the Republican theme to recognize angry that its strength and you heard how the Republican numbers led by Mitch McConnell\nReally demeaned the confirmation process I\nInsulted or in a ... not only that\nI I'm Sorry I had to demean the ... the confirmation process\nThat was the left that did that with Spartacus grow because and Kamala Harris interrupting and being rooted in Columbus jar and lazy and Coons and and\nBlumenthal these people were disgusting in this hearing what is she talking about this is why she's not the president because she she just didn't know what she's telling today\nAfter four women who are speaking out you know what I remember Republican operative shutting down the voting and Florida or in two thousand I remember will swear\nThat actually never happened that actually never happened there were no Republican operatives shutting down the voting in Florida the biggest problems were in Palm Beach county Palm Beach county was being run by election supervisor who was a Democrat she's lying because she thinks will believe it\nBoating and John Kerry I remember the things that even the Republican Party dead or to John McCain in two thousand I remember\nBut with the Republican Party do to John McCain does does she remember\nDenigrating every woman who had a credible claim against her husband meet someone like Paul ... paid off to the tune of a hundred and fifty thousand dollars Juanita Broderick has a book out saying Bill Clinton raped me and Hillary Clinton or Bill Clinton is suing her\nI mean\nOr what they did to me for twenty five years\nBut we were all the time that was a lot you know Christian I'm going forward reporter all the way she thinks she is she would say well\nSecretary Clinton what what lies what are they saying about you that was wrong\nTime money and effort on promoting it written you're dealing with an ideological party are driven by the left for power or to find that like corporate interests who want a government that that could bet on the ... you can be several but\nOvercome ... going to do unless you win elections\nHave no idea what she's talking about first she said you can't be civil then you can be civil and then she complained that she was wrong to somehow when she wasn't\nIt was actually use was disgusted which she just had to say Christian I'm an poor who is I guess a left the I don't know she must be for her to sit back and listen to that and not challenge any of what Hillary Clinton just said is pretty disgusting so you can't look at her ever as a um\nAs somebody who is a a true journalist you just can't\nNow add on top of that Eric Holder the former attorney general under Brock Obama his wing manned basically\nEric Holder said today that Michelle said when they go low we go high I say when they go low you pick up\nYour ticket Eric Holder [noise]\nThe only the only thing I was reading Eric Holder and Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama in the far left in this country is that Eric Holder is dumb enough to say it out loud instead of just thinking it believe me all the far left wing progressive idiots sink the exact thing that he just said [noise]\nThey just aren't dumb enough to say it I guess he is ... that guy thinks he's going to be the president twenty twenty keep that in mind it is edited nine four one packs a day nine four one Seventy four seven Joe packs dot com it's going to be um a line one is John in Houston I John what's going on\nThat and that a lot Joe how you doing today living the dream my friends do you make for\nThat area you have for people to ask you that question or what [laughter] what are the the the topic I wanted to talk about the Perry actually got me on that it is in a it's a bit about the fracking and the industry the oil or that we are capable of producing\nUm I was in the Gulf of Mexico there and the Deepwater Horizon incident wow and all the the crazy stuff all the crazy [noise] restrictions and all of that that happened or we actually are rigged\nMoved to Egypt we moved to uh\nUh the Mediterranean just north of Alexandria and or just a few a few days before a Mubarak was overthrown a and we ducked or more word\nOr off the coast there uh and so I I I got to see first hand and and hear everything that people were saying about the Iraq Obama and how great he was because he was the first president and a long time to go over there and say hey we're really sorry for being so tough on you guys\n[noise] excuse me um\nAnd and you're not as bad as we thought and we need to get more credit and oddly enough that happen to coincide with\nThe fracking industry and uh the middle east realizing that America really could support herself right uh so they they just opened up all the taps a oil prices crashed you know you know that whole story\nGoing on they they they don't ... I think that fracking it was said would cost you you have to get fifty or or fifty five dollars a barrel to make fracking profitable so what they did was they dropped the price so low that it made it ridiculous to frack and fifty\nAnd there's so much garbage that you've got to go through before you can actually get to the source of the issue when you finally got to see what these trade deals worth especially energy wise with these other countries were you surprised at how how completely out of balance they were we got very little bigot everything it was very strange yeah\nIt it was really pretty fascinating and\nHere's the other side of it as these things were outdated you think about the north American free trade agreement that was put in place I think in Ninety to rent was side\nThat was twenty five years ago and and the thing about we're America was twenty five years ago from an energy standpoint I mean\nCompletely a hundred and eighty degree uh we were dependent on a lot of countries that didn't necessarily have our interest in mind who are uh are developing a the energy sources that we were buying and now\nI'm you know Mexico and and and and Canada both\nVery different positions than we were twenty five years ago so it makes a button that good sense that the president was that you know what it's time to renegotiate this thing and we got an email now the uh uh I think it's a ah what do we call it the uh uh U.\nS. M. C. A. United States Mexico or Canada trade ... agreement\nMakes total sense for\nUs to have done that we got a really not perfect listen uh you know I I I don't think I've ever negotiated deal while I was governor or otherwise that I Would call perfect but um this president understands how negotiate and negotiations are not\nUm without their challenges a but negotiations are generally uncomfortable comfortable for both sides but a President Trump he get\nOur cars went in and uh I like when\nIt's all I Do too and and the president said will get tired of winning when I'm tired of it yet it is a former governor Rick Perry use the energy secretaries have United States of America you and I've known each other for more than a decade now if you can believe it and you've always told me that you believe wholeheartedly that we could export more oil than we import\nAnd people scoffed at that people left it but you also have said and I think we'll get there that we can be energy independent we're now exporting more than one importing you're not surprised by it\nUm how did you make that happen how do we how we as a country make that happen\nWell I Want to get a credit to where it's really do and that is to the private sector innovators in technologies that are\nUh you know George Mitchell is a great example of the man who is really the father of hydraulic fracturing yeah a lot of people told them it wouldn't work wouldn't work and he stayed with it stayed with it or when you couple that with directional drilling and I might add some of that technology of directional drilling that made it possible\nUh and as he's him that they came up at at one of our a department of energy national labs to be able to allow the polycarbonate ... material to stay on the drill bit that has so changed uh and being able to go in and horizontally drill\nA these are formations like the Bach and up in ah north\nDakota or there was never really built if you will or to drill horizontally but when you can or excuse me a verdict like but when you can go and drill it\nHorizontally it completely changes the world\nUh and and the economic impact is stunning\nAnd I think that's the real story for America our best days are in front of us are the future of the oil and gas industry and America is stunningly power\nOr the jobs that God created the wealth that gets created take a look at the eagle Ford right there and you know south of San Antonio right how that changed that entire region you go up to a North Dakota and those communities up there that are just booming or the limiting factor for them today\nIs having the infrastructure in place that can handle the workers or it's the welders it's the all of these really high paying jobs are being created in the energy sector all across the country in the Marcellus Shale up in Pennsylvania\nUh and and you want to say adjusted position crossed that Pennsylvania and New York line Pennsylvania it's it's forcing up and that oil and gas area where the Marcellus has been done\nThe line into New York where their governor and their their government in Albany has a forbidden them to hydraulic like frack ... directional drilling and then um you know the economic uh a downturn there is palpable man it's it's it's sad that they don't see\nThat American energy and it was an ... an American energy creating allergy is watching driving down the missions\nThe emissions in America are down fourteen percent since two thousand seven yeah these countries that were you know her rang in us about getting out of the Paris Agreement and and my response to them as listen\nWhen you show us that you're reducing your emissions you come and talk to us about signing on to some agreement\nAll I could not ... I go to ... China was given Thirty years before they had to do anything so none of it made any sense or each each energy secretary Rick Perry\nAnd and you're right I I see what's happening to the eagle Ford I see that it's a boom town I see their jobs there and in North North Dakota and in Pennsylvania that there were zero jobs it was it was ... land so this is all good at one last question are you going to run and I really appreciate you taking the time\nAnd I told you I was gonna bring this up because they're talk to 'em\nSo appealing two nights ago on the program and she's excited as all get out Rick she she says hey we're finally doing the right thing and we're going to explore Anwar um that was something that was that just politics in red tape stopping that up till now\nAbsolutely I mean the previous administration didn't like fossil fuels they put the a lot of a country off\nA out of bounds if you will for expiration because they didn't like fossil killed they you know they like\nAnd listen I'm I'm a big supporter of renewables as well ... led the nation and the production of wind energy back while we were governor right in the end the two thousands and they said and picking one or the other but the previous admitted instruction did they picked renewables and that was it\n[laughter] you know fossil fuels nuclear coal ah they they are paid a price with the previous administration Anwar\nAre not only really helps Alaska or with those uh uh revenues that are coming in\nIt is again part of the supply or globally\nWhere we need to keep this supply stable and taking Iran a a oil off the market agreed appropriately because of their inability to be a citizen of the world that act appropriately yeah uh then you know have an Anwar coming online\nYou know frankly having the Russians in the end they are and the Saudis increasing their production as well all of that is important so that we have a global supply of energy\nAnd that the United states is leading the charge you think what's happened in the last decade or we've gone from being totally dependent upon countries that didn't have our best interest to being the number one oil and gas producer in the world than jobs they get created the wealth that gets created\nThat's what the president said he would do when he was a running for office that actually what he is doing and I'm ... I for one look at it and go thank God that uh we got to present that does what he says\nHe's got well I think it's a simple question would you rather have Venezuelan oil or an Iranian oil or Alaskan oil and I think that's an easy answer by governor and and secretary I I just think you're doing a masterful job I Love you always take some time with those it is the energy secretary for the United states of America Rick Perry riffing civilian let's let's not be strangers\nHey let's do it again and God Bless your brother\nAll right we're back after this and the Joe Petro stand writer [noise]\n... ... ...\n[noise]\n\nJoe John gym so triple Jay's a nighttime talk news talk Ninety four point one news talk Ninety four one dot com\nI Love talking about release factoring works for me I Hope it will work for you I kid you not almost everyone over fifty has occasional aches and pains they could have a real negative effect on your entire life right that's why I keep telling you about really factor there are key ingredients a hundred per cent drug free ingredients\nThat work together to help certain pathways\nIn your body that are associated with inflammation have you tried everything you could think of you can't find relief maybe it's back neck or hip pain shoulder knee pain even general muscle aches and pains but sometimes keep you from sitting or sleeping or were standing there may be golfing or playing tennis I'm as busy as I've ever been in the gym and in my career\nAnd entertaining a whole lot of people do right listen and kids you're not really factor is for real order the quick start discount it down for only Nineteen Ninety five let's see if we can get you out of a pain to relieve factor dot com relief factor dot com 'cause that's where we could start right now for less than a cup of coffee a day you could get pain relief and\nTo solve that inflammation problem\nIf you're like my family you've got a ton of videotapes I mean VHS she might have film\nIn a rating they're not going to get any better or nicer or better quality sitting around in a dusty boxer on a shelf somewhere wanna get I'm taking care of put together on modern media\nFrom a great company called legacy box I Love legacy box I've dealt with them they're incredible when it comes to saving the history of your family for years to come you can get those photos that a film that VHS all that stuff", "show_name": "no_show", "year": "2018", "city": "Algood", "day": "10"}
