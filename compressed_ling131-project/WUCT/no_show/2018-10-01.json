home\nDot com [noise] news talk Ninety four point one reading your appetite for news local\n... rather than weekday mornings seven to eight [noise]\nRadio eight six six Ninety red eye he is our economy and I'm Mary McNamara before we get to all the developments uh in the FBI now remember just an additional background check it's not an investigation\nIt's very important to say that because there are differences between an investigation and a background check so we'll get to that coming up here in just a little bit and how Democrats have been moving the goalposts to on this the one I loved yesterday well he might have perjured himself and what the amount of drinking in high school really\n\nThat's that's what you've got no oh caves are where are you going to measure\nThe amount of drinking in high school yet so we'll we'll get to that here in a little bit a couple of things that we didn't get a lot of chance to talk about the economic things last week and and so with the the announcement the day that he knew United States Canada and Mexico\nTrade deal has been done and were stating that because no longer is it North American it's United States Canada and Mexico ... name has been changed [laughter]\nAh the aid of a couple of economic indicators are you know the month of July was was horrible I mean it was the the highest in five months for trade\nA deficits soybeans killed us or not being able to sell soybeans a ... Europe isn't going to be able to make up the majority of the soil being lost that we have had and civilian aircraft got hit a real big in in in July of last week economic indicators coming out that ... you know because of the tariffs\nAre that were put into place just about a little ... about a week and a half ago that it was starting to hurt a manufacturing not only in China but the indicators in the United states you could see them going down as well you and I talked about this many times you can screen that you want to get\nThe trade imbalance down\nBut the reality is the only thing that matters is economic growth that's a strong thing that the president\nHas had right now you know that there are people in the White House like Larry Kudlow might not be Wilbur Ross might not be Peter Navarro\nBut you know the ... and they're telling him you cannot have these kind of massive tariffs with Europe the United states Mexico and\nChina it's going to kill your economic growth if you wish to be president in twenty twenty you've got to reverse course got you got to come up\nWith a ... a deal if you wish to isolate China politically you probably can survive that but you cannot isolate the United states from Europe Canada and Mexico you can't do that\nAnd so uh the the fact that this deal was done so quickly at the last second\nThe administration\nJust a free trade deal and you're going to go in there and say okay fine NAFTA's gone and nothing replaces is going into the going into the midterms\nAnd then uh wanting to have economic growth in two thousand Nineteen and twenty twenty and you just said ... gone massive tariffs on China won't deal with Europe you've got advisors to the president saying you can't do this did you hear a cushion or was the one they say that\nWas one that that got everybody to come down ... ... ... was the one right read that and I'm like well really\nWell I mean the reality is is that again uh you you head into the mid term you don't have something done you're not going to get anything done uh on the Mexico deals so you're left with nothing\nOr you get this when and claim you know you can at least claim that you're selling more dairy to Canada\nIf you could if you can call it a win\nWhich if you're selling more it's it's not less well look we so we ... we said this already met that they're you know to try to to try to regulate and international economy and sorry I Know people don't want an international economy but the reality is you can stop it\nAnd I can't stop you probably you can isolate yourself but you can stop it it's impossible but when you have as we talked about in Mexico per capita where they if you look at the trade going back ... back back and forth across the border\nAnd it's a tough thing to figure out because as we said before remember forty percent a blood comes in from Mexico\nBut I'm On a good comes in from Mexico forty percent of that good was made in the United states and the average product has crossed the border three or four times what was it four times they say it was four times\nAnd we were selling Mexico to begin with per capita that's the population for every dollar they ... they you know they tend to watch we sent them three dollars for a smaller country\nThey've a third of the ... you know close to a third of the population of the United states Canada as like what one eighth of the population the United states\nAnd we were uh selling them like for every dollar they set us you know for every dollar you know we bought as an you know per capita that's per person\nIn the United states of Canadian products per capita they were buying roughly eight to nine to ten dollars\nOver the last couple of years per capita is what we were selling them there were smaller country you're not going to equalize the trade deficit it's impossible oh there's no way you'll ever get there\nNo I don't care how much more dairy you're going to sell them they'll never consume as much as the United states won't even be close no\nSo uh again we'll see what comes out of this and it probably we you know start leaking out hopefully in the ... next couple of weeks especially since now goes before Congress and we'll update on what's in there for ... here's your forecast\nGoing to pick up a lot of moisture for Southern California and western Arizona as the remnants of hurricane Rosa come ashore through the early part of the week there's a low in the Pacific that's combining with the system that will create some unsettled weather\nMost likely as far as Los Angeles where the chance of showers today we'll continue to see the chance of rain along the Gulf Coast from South Texas over to Florida\nYou'll note we've already seen some snow and the higher elevations of the mountain regions of some of the northern tier states\nIdaho Montana and north and South Dakota so if you're traveling in and out of a I Ninety four in the region I twenty nine or Fifteen keep in mind this is the time of year that snow can come at a moment's notice but most of what we're seeing today falling from Seattle all the way over to Detroit\nIn the northeast and Midwest there's a look at your national forecast red eye radio I'm meteorologist John ... thanks so much John eight six six Ninety ...\nWhere the effort Cumberland talks news talk Ninety four point one where the upper Cumberland teams talk a high school playbook sixty minutes of exercising does sixty minutes of football high school playbook\nWas all over social media on friday this is why we go direct going direct means getting in your face which means expect more of that where ever you are if you're a lawmaker oh I'm Sorry if you're a Republican lawmaker\nThey don't see they don't care about flakes hatred for the president\nThey don't care about his disdain for see I don't know if he was looking to coon by his situation now he knew he wasn't going to win in November So we decided not to run\nThen he of course that's been going off on the president on a number of things\nHolding up procedures and and and essentially are a number of items hostage so he can get his way\nHe was ... going to the left repeatedly but see Mr flake they don't care about you or your disdain for Trump you could be an agreement for that disdain with them they don't care 'cause you're still the bad guy\nSo he goes\nBut the vote I'll\nI'll support it in committee but I'm not going to support it\nOn the broad vote well\nThere you have the essentially the door open for others to say okay we support that as well so now you have the background check not in this is not an investigation\nNo it is not know it it has a background check with a series of interviews\nIt is they've done several already they're gonna do another one and the scope is limited and see the liberals got on onto the president for limiting the scope well this is only about ... the accusations but it does include the Ramirez accusations not just the Ford accusations right\nSo now you have again the claim being made and now it's going to have been by the way we could have done this\nJuly thirtieth with a Ford accusations\nAnd you got what the FBI going and doing interviews they will not make a decision they will just hand their report to the White House the White House will send it to the Senate that's how the all of this is going to work\nSo you delayed it by a week or if you're the Democrats you realize this thing is going to go nowhere and you start screaming perjury\nWell the house isn't gonna bring up perjury charges perjury for what exactly what specifically and where's the proof that he lied about it\n\nShe the problem with the the ... the allegations is that you cannot they they it's ... it's impossible to prove or disprove based on what has been present well they initially jumped on the fact\nThat there were a a of friends of a\nFord who said he lied when he said but he lied about his drinking\nRight how yeah right\n[laughter] I'll just how is that I you know he talked about the fact that he drank and mhm\nSchool he likes very still likes beer right you know and and your because he would have to get down and he said he didn't order in every city boy he never he said he never blacked out right now but he said he fell asleep after drinking ... which you might have you know but but how do you\n[laughter] why do you get my reading that you you don't know if he blacked out or not so how do you get 'em on perjury for that but I I don't I don't understand well\nYou know what's interesting here is if we're going to go off on that then then what about every person who wants to run for president because\nI don't know I remember a block Obama and the and and uh and\nHim smoking pot and the story of him ... and all of this but they're just sending the perjury of it oh no no no I Know that but the point is the perjury is what goes back to we want to label him as a bad guy he's a liar he's a blackout fall down drunk right\nWell then this is and then you've got to push back of course on Sunday from a Lindsey Graham and and others are where it was you know look this guy is not a stumbling drunk\nBut at the central he goes back to label labeling him Kavanaugh as such from high school or gosh ah\nWith with ah with Brock Obama and others follow it only matters is if he's if he leans white if he's a threat to the left then we're going to shout well we never you never heard of a guy drinking beer in high school really\nWell I I what I also love was how they move the goalpost were first on friday a and part of Saturday it was he's two part just\nBecause of his reaction attacking the Democrat asked the that they that he was ... that that he was too partisan right and and can't cannot serve he doesn't have hit and he doesn't have to take because he's too ... well the part that turned into because then the\nThe uh uh the report came out about ... Britain's Ginsburg back in twenty ah sixteen where she said uh that um\n[noise] uh\nShe calls Trump fake her she's getting involved in politics you shouldn't be getting involved in politics and this is a direct accusation at you by individuals mhm he didn't take on and say the entire Democratic Party he said you\nWhile nine ... written in in one story or because there was no promise a that he could he could he could rule without bias or something to that extent and I thought are you kidding me you've got Sotomayor on tape on record\nSaying it is the job of judges and justices to legislate from the bench\n[noise]\nThe whole thing is this is it because if it were another let's say Elena Kagan that the president nominated now there would still be objections he must be up to something that would probably be the objection [laughter] it's Trump he must be up to something\nI mean he could have nominated Merrick Garland oh no no no no no no we look further into Merrick Garland and he's the wrong choice I mean it it it would have been something some kind of objection\nBut for the media [laughter] that there's no promise that Kavanaugh would leave is biased as side right now is you what first of all that they still don't get it\nRight but then they dropped that ... they dropped that in became his temperament it became his anger it wasn't that it was directed at that because once against Berg thing came out of ... women Ginsburg's been political all the time and then they had to drop that so they went to the next thing they moved to go pulse again which is\nHis temperament and you know Feinstein has gone to the you know as petition or the or the or the ADA too uh to change their um\n[noise] uh uh their ranking up him as a from well qualified because of his temperament because of his screen or because of his anger\nMhm yeah right\nThat's where they've gone I mean and so it's just they just keep moving the goalpost blood that goes all the goalpost\nBecause Grassley and flake let it happen\n\nThey allow them to move the goalpost and here we are and it will be two weeks essentially passed when it should have happened\nThe vote so\nOn them ... ... but did they have the numbers last week while they wouldn't have without flake\nTalking about friday as part of why they they have the number they didn't have the numbers and had no trouble apparently this is where it did change according goal reports this flight was able to convince the others a handful of others to get on board and support\nThe American bar association or she's gone to them and said you know he doesn't have the temperament disturb because he got angry excuse me somebody you isn't it it's not just beautiful\n... they they sit there and they accuse you they do not her\nBut they said without any cooperating evidence\nYour and attempted rapist and you're a rapist oh yeah because of the you know because of the uh uh you know you're a gang rapist mhm and they say that and you get angry at them\nAnd so then they scream and yell and say you don't have the temperament to serve the beautiful mhm that's what they're doing now mhm just keep moving the goalpost\nBecause it's every you they know it's a this is the desperate attempt you throw not one Hail Mary but everybody's playing quarterback on the left now and it's it's like they're throwing a Hail Mary hoping\n\nNew CBS News on the

hall a Kevin mckell attend reasons yep yeah we'll we'll we'll clear Cavanaugh I'm\nIn the supplemental background check the witness was vote will be interviewed olive agreed to fully cooperate they will answer questions asked and in all likelihood give the same answers they've already given under oath and under penalty of felony perjury if their answers differ from what they previously said\nThis was something I I was talking to a family member when this was announced on friday and I said here's where it's different because you can compare forge testimony to her what she told the Washington Post\nThe Washington Post things could change drastically\nBy the time she testifies and some things did change\nSo\nNow what different is\nOf course the Washington Post doesn't have prosecutorial power doesn't have there's no bearing there there was no nothing that was said and this is not a criminal investigation so she wouldn't be charged with with lying to investigators here with the FBI but\nIt is official record after she testified so the standard is the testimony given on Thursday mhm she hasn't been interviewed yet now we're mirrors has not testify under oath she has been interviewed according to reports on Sunday\nSo at some point Dr Ford is going to be interviewed and our first story changes after sworn testimony\nThen that opens the door to perjury\nAnd the report will go to the White House and then on to the Senate committee wants the White House reviews or that report which will come later this week and mark judge said he would fully cooperate right ah\nOver the weekend ... uh to the Senate Judiciary committee the FBI will for a second time along with Maryland authorities as well as every prosecutors looked at this evidence admit that there is no felony federal jurisdiction here mhm\nUh after the Democratic party attempted to have cabinet rested on Saturday merely officials reiterated their findings that by their standards are worse charges possible would carry with them a one year statute of limitations ... additional prosecutors run record setting the evidence is insufficient\nTo merit a basis for even a search warrant much less than the rest we said that already before and that you couldn't even get a grand a grand jury would even indict\nWith all the law enforcement bodies are well what all of the law enforcement bodies\nContinue to point out that is a lack of time and place\nAnd while the accuser was a hundred percent sure that something happened the accused in three witnesses or a hundred percent sure they were not witnesses to any event resembling the description right\nThe FBI or will also highlight greater amounts\nOf evidence against Dr Ford her fear of flying her miss remembering her one hundred percent clear account of the mysterious Safeway second door it would only had one her complete inability to figure out how she got to work from the incident and the continued repudiation by her best friend that such a gathering occurred with her present is likely to tip the iceberg\nA therapy notes will likely be required to be turned over ... why they were not turned over to the Senate Judiciary committee is inexplicable especially since she used that as cooperation upper first telling other missed a mysterious incident that's really interesting riots\nDoctor for its own family not one was capable of coming to work support uh\nWhy weren't they the FBI may need to ask given that she was living with her parents at the time right there you go\n\nIt's going to be the talk of the towers from MIT who saw Ninety four point was\nWell if they if they interview or mirrors and anybody she wants them to interview\nAnd anybody who's come forward that will likely by the way that that part of it will likely that claim will likely take the longest that likely is more involved because of the fact that it was not a part of public record\nDr Ford testimony is a matter of record and there's only so far I think with Dr Ford's case\nThere's only so far you can go and it would basically be the parameters would be everything that was outlined in the chapter on the\nWeb but I mean politically ... and you know and they get hurt you know they do an interview with her and everybody else surrounding it which means they've expanded the investigation beyond just one of the Democrats can't make that\nPoint no don't try to but no there's not going to be they didn't have a point to begin with but will and will's what's allowed when someone like flake did what he did\nWill will the Republicans at that point move on and by the way did you see the story too and got a little bit of publicity that\nAh the ah the weekend\nPoll that came out of the poll boosted friday or Saturday and showed Holly up two points\nOn um um contest or no no no I'm In I'm\nIn Missouri ... yeah well it and and we wondered about that Claire McCaskill McKay if that if that was that there was going to be a last minute yes vote although politically I think it would be too little too late\n... ... it could be potentially we'll see I think what happens\nUm you know later this week\nBut I think the hesitation by those senators who backed this ... you know the further investigation the\nFBI background check then I I think politically they could be damaged even if he's confirmed you did the damage anyway you allow the circus to go on\nCreated more of a circus as a result of it and we know flake is not up for\nReelection which is why I think it it became more convenient\nFor the the other the other senators likely jumped on board\nAh you know and and by the way they ... they did so potentially at their own peril politically but flake had to be the guy because he's not up for reelection he had to be the one that went forward and requested this and the president you know comes in and says okay fine\nBy the way for what a two week about a part of two weeks Democrats have been screaming\nAt the

Thursday\nCame out essentially the Iran mosque and his lawyers early in the day had reached an agreement with the SEC saying and and and and apparently that whatever the agreement was was going to\nHappen and then by the end of the day they were pulling out of the agreement and he was willing to fight it\nOut of this all stems from him saying basically that he was going to take\nThe company private and that he had access to funds or he had done that some time ago\nAnd as a publicly traded company\nThe chairman of the board and CEO you can't say that because you're essentially by that statement especially if it's on true and that was the whole point is is that did he actually have the funding was it was a secured had it had been promised to him\nA any evidence that that he had access to funding to take a private [noise]\nThat started this whole thing into okay and then of course the or some other things that he has gone on social media that question his ability to run the company but this especially because you're manipulating the stock price or the company\nUh it had to jump when he announced that the stock price at a jump because it was you know people investors if it were true might have been able to make good on something like that uh and do well if they drove the stock up\nBecause he would have to buy out all of that existing stock then it came out on friday which was interesting actually late or Thursday and friday morning the investigation showed that because he came up with this price of\nFour hundred and twenty dollars per share and according to investigators he actually used for twenty four reason that everybody suspected on the Internet he was trying to impress his girlfriend according to investigators with the four twenty price and of course\nIt's relation to pot and he was also seen smoking pot\nOn a pod cast a and you add all that together and and the SEC basically you know going after him then announced over the weekend that he will no longer be chairman of the board well he can't be for three years he can't run for election\nAs chairman of the board for three years\nHe'll remain on the board and he'll remain a CEO the company so he's going to remain in the face of the company\nHe won't have as big a seat because he's not chairman but that's going to last for thirty six months at least and could and thirty six months he could be if the company is still around or he could be the chairman again so I also uh twenty million dollar\nFine or that he paid\nPeople thinking I guess they don't have to learn it

that a judge Kavanaugh or that the Bolshevik like Dianne Feinstein Chuck Schumer even as people close they\nAre they're going to continue to attack him even after he's confirmed as as a Supreme Court justice I'm sure the ... and I have another question\nThey they they made but it's not going to go anywhere and it's no wonder you know once it's once it's done I mean I I think the focus elsewhere because once you get on the Supreme Court\nI'm going to happen no no that's\nNot out of the fact of the things early there's nothing that's going to happen ... the the the uh the lip service will continue Mario\nNo doubt right but I but I think the ... I I think they'll move on to other things where they can have more control\nI say what you mean yeah the the lip service that that's what it is the packets in the lip service and I think that they'll continue that attack and that's\nWhat that's but that's that's the norm they call that Tuesday right they'll they'll they'll attack him when they were to say Supreme Court decision that I don't like that when he went on to your to get in on something funny because Mario or a Gary and I were talking during the break\nAbout the the question by George Stephanopoulos asking one democratic lawmaker over the weekend or do you think judge Kavanaugh should recused himself\nFrom any case involving if he ceded any case involving a democratic lawmakers and the lawmaker comes back and says well yes I think that would be the well in that case I can I can make the case that\nIf you're a male you should not be you should recuse yourself from any case involving a female and if you're a female the same the same applies and then beyond that\nIf you are a in a ... a heterosexual marriage you should recuse yourself\nFrom any decision involving gay marriage or a vice versa or I'll take it to the most

only one of the fifty three genders ... have to be believed right only the allegation from one gender what about the other fifty whether it's at fifty three fifty four and genders uh the the that are out there and then we just got into the bizarre conversations of of why don't you believe the other genders and going through the specific other genders\nAnd why they should or shouldn't be believed it was an interesting conversation about\nFor video row dog here's your forecast\nWe're going to pick up a lot of moisture for Southern California and western Arizona as the remnants of hurricane Rosa come ashore through the early part of the week there's a low in the Pacific that's combining with the system that will create some unsettled weather\nMost likely as far as Los Angeles with a chance of showers today will continue to see the chance of rain along the Gulf Coast from South Texas over to Florida\nYou'll note we've already seen some snow and the higher elevations of the mountain regions of some of the northern tier states Idaho Montana and north and South Dakota so if you're traveling in and out of a I Ninety four in the region\nTwenty nine or Fifteen keep in mind this is the time of

I Would you like\nYou know this isn't this isn't a the way it should be uh the politics has gotten so ugly\nBut on friday he was being cold out and even after he decided to go to the White House basically a nasty administration request demand really but he was not going to vote on the floor\nHe would in committee but not on the floor for the confirmation then as soon as that came out there were others basically on the left coming out and calling them out still\nBecause they if they believe in this coup by approach it has never about working with the other side or coming together the two sides coming together it's Republicans coming over to the left\n\nThey don't hail Joe mansion\nAs somebody who is bipartisan\nWhile technically he is but he's not getting them he's not getting any points with his own party now he doesn't get any praised for no no McCain did all the media doesn't praise them no McCain did I mean after McCain was Hitler after he ran for president for and then went away and was no longer a threat\nYou know and then and then after his passing he was praised by the left but it's always someone on the right who goes left it's not the other way around\nLet's go to Peter in New York City Peter you're on route I radio walked into the show\nBut I Do a very good say war bloody and brought the investigation that sort of like to find out a little more about this stock the science\nMean expand the investigation on her\nShow and we know about this just so hey this is this better just as bad as just shoot Vegas they didn't know about that you know nothing about her\nWell you know here's I guess this'll be my my point on on forward we just found out who she was of course you're going to know more about cabinet and you're going to know about forward but it's a it's it's coming out\nMhm mhm\n[noise] well there's a number of things that that I think as a as a part of the investigation if they're doing it the way that I Believe they would be doing it I remember it's a background check\nSo the I guess the the the players that have been named in this so far might not be what the FBI limits themselves\nToo and and discussing it with Ford or according to her attorneys as of late Sunday she still not yet been interview\nWell my question is you're going to start with Kavanaugh likely because it's a background check on him you start with Kavanaugh but then you're going to go into all these\nClaims you're going to try and find separately separate from the testimony you're likely going to go and and interview maybe even\nFamily members somebody who could\nBack it up because what you're trying to do the idea is to see if there's anything at all\nAt the White House or the Senate committee should question in his background and you have to substantiate those claims\nSo there could be a number of people here that we're not even thinking of that could be interviewed during this process and that might not be good news for Dr Ford or her attorney\nSmaller the guy I mean apparently are going to interview the guy from Yale who said no he he\nDrank more ... right it's like I don't know where that goes well how can you quantify it and how can you prove you know and that's that's the ... and plus it has nothing to do with this it's got nothing to do with the original case so it's it's it's a basically this\nThis old classmate from Yale claiming that he perjured himself right so we'll see where that goes how do you perjure yourself in the amount that you drank did you see 'cause I didn't want to buy it right now there was there was no ... and there's no proof\nRight\nHe hasn't been asked about that specific incident right\nSo it's there it's it's not perjury\nUnless you get to that point to ask him about a specific incident ... and you of evidence that he lied but the the consumption of alcohol and what's amount you talk and your judgment of it compared to somebody else's judgment thirty five years to go would be an interesting perjury case\nRight [laughter] so I don't well because then you would need a somebody in the house to start that that case against him and that now that I'm not going to have it\nAnd they'll they'll see that they will interview this person like they'll interview everyone and they'll determine whether or not anything was by that person's claim can be corroborated not just what Dr Ford claims but what any other person related to the situation claims\nThey are going to look to have those claims backed up by somebody else\nMarty in Saint Augustine Florida Marty welcome you're on the radio Hi Marty\nYes I'm a first time caller here and I think personally from Daytona Beach but uh [noise] I I ... I was a Trump volunteer for an entire year for a campaign\nThe one that thrown in a way of West Virginia and the style of the people outside and you got people in fact I can then say you're going to see some Democrats flipped a specially the one in a a West Virginia and even possibly a\nNote the quarter as well and that even includes Donnelly a ferret on layout of Indiana so I think that's where it's going to come from a a because the pressure is so great for reelection\nAnd running some great cat were running great candidates this year are in those three states a week and they pick up to the three yeah unless they get on the stick and start [laughter]\nOr a caving themselves you know supporting a cabinet off\nLike I don't know I mean if they didn't if I I don't think it's about getting Democrats I think it's about keeping the Republicans\nAre I I did think earlier might've been they might have been able to get last week maybe some of the reports that were out you know again town hall had the report their source report that ended up not being right ... ah that ah you know that they had a they had the votes that's my question if they had the votes why did they call for this\nRight and well and here's my ... because\nRight after um flake came out others jumped on board saying yes they want the investigation too so it tells me that they went back into neutral territory there was word that came out\nA belief from ... camp early on that he may not be in support on friday that he may not support the nomination I think it comes down to those four who were in that meeting\nA mansion Murkowski Collins\nAnd flick I think those were the ones are those are the ones to watch I wouldn't count on Heidi Heitkamp or doubling in this case and I think I could have said said the same thing on friday at if if the whole like thing\nDidn't happen I think you probably could have said that on friday that on the broad vote\nYou are not going to get those those votes\nSo we'll see what happens later this week but [laughter] it's frankly politically speaking especially right now and especially with this situation friday is a long ways away and is\nIf you want

it's just that she was too much work and when she was she said she believe a hundred per se but it was capital right there I mean\nI I I Will tell you this I mean when when they say that she's credible as I said the reason she is incredible is because you only remembers one thing\nYou're credible because there's a consistency to your testimony\nThat's why when anybody and I would love to in a never happened but I Would love to interview one of these Democrats who say she was credible how forget about the fact that her own witnesses you know there is no forensic evidence and know witness even the ones that she names a ... story\nBut the fact is what she said herself\nIf you just came and you say well look how can you remember this so clearly but you don't remember this you don't remember this you don't remember this you don't remember this her testimony alone irrespective of the other ... evidence or lack of evidence her testimony itself was not credible\nMhm yeah I mean that's the that's what a centrally was at play here whether or not she was to be bullied because remember what they were calling for first she needs to be heard she needs to be heard she needs to be hurt well then she was heard well that's not enough\nWeight about what if you believe her testimony to be credible then that is enough her speaking in front of the American people we don't get to see the FBI questioning her on TV\n[noise] that's not going to be before the public\nSo tell me wasn't why wasn't fair about this process [noise]\nAnd that's what the left once you've really it's not a

like you would have\nTo ask the Democrats that question I Can't answer for the Democrats are as ... as I said very easily that's why she's not ... that that's why that alone she's not a credible witness unless\nThere were people to bakar up when they say she was credible on like based on what and this is a legal statement this is a personal statement against her right I don't know what she went through\nBut when you say I'm a hundred percent somebody did it\nWhere I don't know when I don't know how did you get there I don't know how did you get home I don't know\nAll you know what she did it but any information surrounding it and then the witnesses that you give\nGive contradicting testimony that you gave its not credible right the ...\nAnd that's why I said I don't uh somebody's asked the Democrats that specific question but again as you see for example George Stephanopoulos last question when they don't answer it just moves on\nIt's like okay give me an answer\nYou want it look something that bothers me more than even even the the the ... which we call the fake news is the lack of guts of journalists to say I'm not leaving this question until you answer it right because it's important that there's an expectation\nYep [laughter] remember who ... who who was at who at the bottom of the follow up question where was that was that ... that was here in uh in there was ... was it oh oh no yeah yeah yeah well there's a separate ... okay or one where you have a local reporter here\nUh from W. F. A. A. P. palace but no the one you're referring to was Chris Wallace and then they came back and said well we weren't told there would be follower of ...\nThat is that if you asked a question didn't make sense to be a follow up question right that that there's actually an and this was something that has to stop this ... this kind of buzz sorrow world respect\nThat we have for politicians when I'm a journalist and I ask you a question if you don't answer it I'm going to ask the question again and then I'm going to come down right to it and say you're not answering my question\nWell I don't feel it's important oh so you won't answer my question I Want you on record that you don't have the guts to answer my question I phrased it that way which of course is not permitted because\nFact that a journalist is supposed to give\nA politician who won't answer a question on an issue but as the reason that you brought them on the air with you ... don't waste my time if you're going to be come on the show had the guts to answer my question but if you're going to be got Liz go away\nI feel like I'm Talking to somebody right now and yelling at them but if you're yelling at all of them and and you know that's but that's that they get away with it drives me up for you know because people like well Stephanopoulos and everybody else allow them to get away with it\n\nThe the person especially a public servant who's being interviewed does not dictate the questions\nNo no I don't\nKnow what would they do when they don't answer the question they do when when when they don't answer the question they are dictating the question ... well and that's just they need to it it's very clear to us but it's just state it we're going to help this person build a narrative here so let's talk to them\n\nLet's help them build their own narrative\nYeah we'll forget journalism right oh\nI'm Sorry then my question isn't the one I should be asking\nAll my focus should be elsewhere\nYou're saying well okay and and the easy thing to do is the challenge her own owes answer as soon as she gave that non answer I would've said okay so you're saying the Democrats did\nYou like\nYour your your\nNon answer their tells me that you're basically admitting the Democrats did lakes is\nYou can respond to that state but if you'd like to yes or no true or false [laughter] [noise]\nBut this is why people right at ... at least frustrate the daylight Saddam ... this is why people hate it nobody's going on with Tim Russert because they knew it didn't matter which side they run\nThey knew they were going to face tough questions or remember for two weeks in a row none of the Democrats from the Senate Judiciary committee would come out with Chris Wallace for what they do is is if you do that\nYou become black balled yeah\nThey won't come on your show any more because you demand that they\nThat they answer the question everybody knows what the questions are going to be [noise] yeah when you come in with look when you're a U.S senator and you come in to talk or you're the president or whatever you're somebody the White House\nWhen you go on a show you know while you're going on the show and they'll tell you we want to talk about this and so you know what the general questions are going to be and your goal is okay oh look I Need to get my staff around here we need to figure out how to way not to answer any of the questions how to white filibuster\nWe the every journalist knows everybody on ABC CBS NBC and Fox knows that's what is CNN they all know what's gonna happen mhm they all know they're going to do that when it's somebody going to finally say uh you know and as for my question would you answer the question\nAnd at that point what happens is you're not going to get the major you're not going to get the major personalities any more think about this we live in a society\nWhere the media believes we need to get the major personalities on the major political personalities who run and drive this country it's important that we get them on the air so they won't answer the questions that we asked them\nYeah that's it\nNo it's face the other way [laughter]\nI meet the press that west pressed the meat that we're going to do a handshake that's the way it's going to we were just going to go out there and pat each other on the back unless you're a Republican and this week is weak this mhm we there [noise]\n[noise] [laughter]\n[laughter] your mom [laughter]\n\nI might as well be having that answer to every question here mom [laughter] like you'd think lake that you're a mom\n[laughter] [laughter] [laughter]\nYeah [laughter]\n... because that's the ridiculous nature of this why not just make it\nWhy not just make it I Would have a group of buddies I went to grade school with and we play this game of\nGrade school Scrabble ridiculous Scrabble the words ... you got to make up a word nothing can be a real war word and you've got to use it in a sentence when you put it on the board\nAnd as long as you use it [laughter] okay so that's why I Would just make it a game [laughter] because that's all it is exactly nobody's taking a the their constituents\nAre seriously in the case of Jeff like he didn't care ... ... you know how she could answer it I don't know I don't know who leaked it yeah I don't know like you're asking me a question I Can't answer right why didn't we but why didn't we get the I don't know that's a great ...\n[laughter] this is an old man [laughter] ah\nBecause very as they're not or a very observant yeah yes and it's

them yeah the video being taken by a man who was warning people on the ground\nTo get up there they're on top of the building a looks to be like a rooftop parking lot or there's some vehicles are surrounding these people that are that are up there and this Saddam he comes and it was roughly ten feet a ten foot wave\nThat comes through and whites these houses moves them like they're nothing uh

these ... this footage that's coming out than most of it from citizens there and people that that were there on the ground but a while and then you look at the pictures that came out on Saturday and Sunday or the aftermath and it it it it just looks horrific\nYeah just horrifying watch that video because the guy screaming for the kids that are running up and that got off the road and got up there but it was just at the rose you people going down the road back you know just driving down it and you just knowing about ten seconds is going to be wiped out and it was yeah that's terrifying just to

John trout thanks so much John eight six six Ninety red eyes\nIt's going to be the talk of a town where we saw Ninety four point one\nEvery year and the Judiciary Committee doesn't happen rather than having hundreds of times we had it with the issues that are they're sensitive issues that are the sense of ... and not going to get a chance to talk about\nYeah so there you go ...\nI Want to move away from that because that doesn't look good for the narrative are yeah well no because those those are huge points that he may yeah I mean those are those are huge points first about the lawyers we'd ask that question weed out that we'd ask that question early on was she made it seem like\nFord made it seem like I never knew that the committee wish to talk to me what the committee talk to the lawyers and that's when we had asked that question we said that hasn't been that hasn't been resolved and Tom Cotton coming out over the weekend insane her lawyers didn't tell her\n\nThey need to visit and and as you said for lawyers will face a Washington DC bar investigation for allegedly not informing heard that the Senate Judiciary committee staffers were willing to travel to care\nRight\nI mean who's working for your pro bono are you you're not working in the best interest of your client if you're not giving them the option that is the charge that caught and is making there which is huge because that shows why that's why wouldn't your lawyers be working for the best interest of you\nBecause they're working for the best interest of someone else yeah well how much are you paying them as a client I'm not paying them\nOh\nSo are they actually working for you and that's where you and I talked about this Friday and cotton is making the allegation\nThat you know they'll be facing the Washington DC bar investigation for not informing her when you asked a question why didn't they inform her if she didn't know why did it and will those questions be asked by the F ... uh\nWell I mean you would you you're looking to through the FBI looking to vet the process all over again right\nBecause it is a serious allegation just as much to prove her wrong as it is to prove him wrong or liar\nIt is just as much about finding out well in fact the entire purpose is finding out the true it is not necessarily to find out which one is lying because one of them is lying\n\nIt's about finding out the truth which means it's equally as much about the person making the allegation as it is the accused\nAnd the other point is we're Feinstein and the Democrats in the media we're always trying to make the point will Feinstein did or best teacher one wouldn't know she didn't and as we subtle long if you listen to the show we said look there is a process\nAnd I'm Glad to Tom Cotton pointed out the process and and ... and they said they do this hundreds of times you and and decker said he doesn't know who will not that sensitive because no justice sensitive on other issues but things that are highly secretive that we don't want people to know about\nBecause we are doing you know in in different investigations and so this has actually done where\nShe should have when she got the letter\nShe ... the protocol is you go to Grassley you're the ranking minority member you go to Grassley you talked about it and you say okay what group well probably what we ... you would have said was look we can lead to contact her back\nAnd tell her we can do an FBI investigation if she wishes to this to go forward we can do an FBI investigation\nAnd we can keep her name out of it for a certain period of time but we can definitely do the FBI investigation we can actually interview people on this and keep your name out of it and then we get to a certain point we might not be able to but as to the point of the investigation\nAbsolutely we can did Feinstein tell her that\n\nHer Feinstein's goal was to hold this as long as possible to spring it at the last possible second\nYep knowing that they're only play here was political in nature\nNot actual procedural other than delaying the process itself they were calling for the FBI investigation but the Democrats didn't really want an FBI investigation had they wanted the investigation Feinstein would have made that happen right away\nWhich tells me one thing a couple of things they didn't buy into her story number one\nFully credible and could be proven and backed up by an FBI investigation than Feinstein would have acted July thirtieth and you know something I I I agree with the Democrats\nThey they did you shouldn't do an expanded they should do an expanded uh uh you know a background check and they should uh talk to forward and say ... or ... your lawyers are with you by the way why didn't you tell her that they were willing to come and see her yeah\nSo is anybody pain you besides her let's let's let's expand this\nI Wonder if the Democrats really wish to be expanded huh\nI'm doubting it\nOkay we're done it's a week okay we're going to vote no anyway so it was [laughter] well because what they need is a new unobtainable\nCoal\nSo in this case uh like you said Ramirez she needs to be hurt she needs to test I I Believe that will be the next thing she needs to tell her story\nThey're going to realize this one's going nowhere so you need to go to the next allegation that's not cooperated and hear from her and you just go down the line and you see how far you can extend this now the balls and procedurally the bottles and McConnell score yes\nBut the vote is not know\nWhere the votes fall is not can you stand to lose a Jeff Flake yes if you have\n... camp who's still on the fence Donnelly is a no no if you had mentioned you can lose if you've got mansion you can lose you've got high camp and if you've got Collins and if you've got a test or do you do you want to fester he said no so if if that goes forward\nHow many I guess the question is how many can you afford so you can you can lose if you've got if mansions and you can lose like in one more\n\nBecause you've got fifty one mhm and so imagine would make fifty two you could lose than to\nStill have fifty and have the vice president break developed right\n\nThat if they think they've got that then McConnell's not going to hold it up at all if they've got to have you know they would have done this over the weekend I I have the feeling that they will I have a feeling\nThat if the FBI investigation comes in\nAnd you know even if it talks to ... and said look nobody can cooperate her story either\nA a a ... on this in fact we sort of get the same thing with the the witnesses there are I think at that point they will have the vote and then what do you ever hear about this together doesn't die forever it probably dies forever\nSomebody said they'll keep bringing it up no they won't they\nWon't on your end up getting nowhere rent produce anything for it yet it it has it won't affect his decisions they can't write so they you know if it wants to see it on the Supreme Court well they'll impeach well they could impeach but you'd still need\nTwo thirds of the Senate mhm you're never going to get two thirds

Democrats no they're never going to get\nA you know to the the the sixty two on the on the lack of evidence that you have an any of these cases right now\nRight because you're not going to learn

week just who are the FBI supposed to interview\nMeal idea that's the sixty four thousand dollar question Mr judge gets judged fairly admits the tree ill today that he's willing to talk to them and I don't know what they're going to find out about him and I think another way that for other people that I spoke to was there that\nHas not been found or ... no I think they said that\nThey just were not fared they get to be with the whole thing they were not there you know two of them that said that they were not even there so I don't know what they're going to find out from there\nYeah it will be to say the least uh an interesting\nUh exercise and I I assume are just futility it strikes me as just an exercise and feel good or we're going to brash about and will say well we got an FBI investigation and nothing at all I can imagine would come up but then again to the quote a\nFormer Senator Joe Biden of Delaware the FBI does not reach conclusions the FBI\nSimply investigates a bill come up with what she said and what he said and that's the end of it and nobody thinks anything other than that somebody doesn't know anything about the FBI investigations up to a pretty accurate paraphrase of what then Senator Joe Biden once said\nWhen the theater with it all\nBlake who's not either running for reelection I don't think\nThough he's not he's invited not to run out that he could run anyway but he's not and his\nApproval rating is still very very low in Arizona and yet he's a pivotal person in this and uh the rumor has it that he was influenced by getting an elevator\nAnd people were screaming at him in the elevator and he was so uh you know influenced by that just to come to their yells screens that this was the uh this was the deal that I Can't believe that that was the only thing that did it I think he really just does not like President Trump\nSo there are so many things that come into beer in the Senate Judiciary committee is not just about a judicial nominee is about President Trump\nIt's about Kamala Harris and Cory Booker trying to run for president as it is a whole everybody has their own agenda a one way or the other so it's more than just state judicial nomination that we're seeing played out is so many other scenarios\nThat indeed the the actual nomination the bread cabin ought to be on the Supreme Court is almost a secondary consideration for and the the uh the the circumstances surrounding Dr ... board she's totally secondary she has been a part of this entire thing I Will never in my life forget the look on her face when she was informed apparently\nFor the first time unless unless she's really Meryl Streep there was a heck of an acting job which he learned\nBefore the committee for the first time\nThat do the Judiciary Committee had agreed to go to California the interviewer in private and our own attorneys who are supposed to be representing her or were apparently representing the interests of the the Democratic Party and I might have been attorneys who signed on with a client who don't represent that ... could be this barred\nAnd Republicans made a bad mistake and hiring the special prosecutor because they did not want a bunch of white old men in quotes a questioning her so they hire a woman a prosecutor hut and eh\nI don't know if she did her job or not but it doesn't matter they Democrats good question here and of course they are essentially there were some softball questions and the Republicans that could have asked them I think some pretty strong questions\nWere silent and something else that has to be emphasized that is from the ... the sound that we have recorded sound of the the protesters who accosted Senator Flake an elevator aside from the fact that what are people randomly doing running around Capitol Hill these days [noise] uh I I don't understand but beyond that\nSome of the statements that they were screaming at it and no one cares about what happened to me\nPlease what happened to you is a terrible thing go swimming but in fact you were solved it and we all hope that if you were\nThat you got as much justice as possible but the perpetrator was tried and convicted was appropriately punished which does not give you one cent pillar of knowledge about what may have happened between two people you've never met at some location where you've never been\nAnd

S. but this is not just the weekend you know frankly if this exact same deal\nHad been put forward by Obama or the left would be supporting it and say this is meaningful so it\nIs I mean if I haven't seen blowback yet him for Ron Wyden said we needed to do this I Need to see the details who sunset and sixteen years are going to look at it every six years wages for auto workers as I mentioned will rise a so that'll be good ah but steel and aluminum tariffs day I thought wait a second why\nBecause I thought they were just like a hedge to push us towards negotiating these these trade deals\nThey were and um they lost the trust so Trump has backed off of the automotive tariffs that he was up ... planning to put in against Canada and he had used that as a stack up but they decided to keep steel and that's a little surprising because the Canadians took such direct a fence\nAnd Trudeau himself or when the United states levy those taps to begin with it's clear that the U.S is looking for um some more leverage with the Canadians going forward the fact that it wasn't seen as a give with this deal was a little surprising\nWe'll see what the person says eleven but he's not going to be in the way government works well you know have a new government for the ratification right correct yes and now another reason to a more intrigued built into the mid term it's a new\nOut of ... as well when that President uh Lopez Obrador er and er and he is a new Congress actually comes in so it's a lot of change happening also Canada won't have a new government there but they are going to be election season 'cause trio has to come up again in twenty Nineteen so you know this is not it's this is absolutely progress\nThe markets are very pleased that we don't have to worry about the after falling apart but we don't have a new NAFTA yet\nBut here's the thing and you know it it's a matter so much that the president at eleven doesn't uh say we won because as you mentioned the two governments gotta show to their people if they feel like they're losers in the deal that will only make things harder to ratify\nYeah I mean one little thing I don't like the new name I mean aside from the fact that you can't say a some ... very early but also didn't ... the fact that it's not North America that it's now the United states first and then Mexico who was second to the deal and then Canada\nDefinitely I ever thought a little bit of symbolism Trump understands how to brand stuff I or\nBy the way even though you you only took ... bothers me a Donald Trump said this is talk North Korea about in his speech over the weekend got thirty six\nHours really being tough and so I went back and forth [noise]\n[noise] [noise] we fell in love [noise]\nWhat's your reaction to that in vain who studies diplomacy\nWas meant to be funny um the people that are left it was a rally um he does a lot of stuff that isn't real and rallies um I Do think\nOn the one hand it's very clear that I'm a leader a dictator who has the worst human rights abuses record of any in the world and that's a low bar [noise]\nUm you don't want to say things like that it's not presidential on the other hand you can't say Trump doesn't care about human rights at all because with leaders that he has a real problem with like in Venezuela or in Iran he has used their human rights abuses to wacko right it's very it's very opportunistic and transactional\nA it was a it was an unfortunate statement I'm In the sense that it's obviously meant to just beat the opposition and they've got right onto it and you know sort of a took it took that bait\n'em but I I think in a in a couple of days we won't be talking about us Japan South Korea how do they view Trump's initiatives with North Korea first of all the Japanese right now we're very happy with what has been the best bilateral meeting they've had with Trump\nSince he won the presidency and they came over immediately what that gift of the golf club um they've agreed to engage in bilateral trade negotiations but not formally to talk about an F. T. A. a free trade agreement\nAnd Trump has said no on the automotive tariff so the Japanese feel good at home right now I'm ... the prime minister as one another term running his liberal Democratic Party\nThey're not super comfortable with the United states running ahead with diplomacy with North Korea\nI Need even more time and I just real quick on the reef and the EU cutting a deal a cutting the U.S out you're feeling where this is heading trying to avoid the dollar\nThe Iranian foreign minister they've talked this morning about the potential for getting oil out directly\nA number one I don't see any major European CEO that's going to say I'm going to risk access to the U.S market because I care about Iran\nThe Europeans are very deeply angry with Trump for pulling out of this Iranian nuclear deal the Jaycee pure way that is a very different story from saying they're going to start doing business as usual with the Iranians again I think the Iranian economy will be very deep\nCome next year but they're playing hardball with us when you say\nThey are I haven't seen any policies yet and I'm not sure we're going to write a button and now we also said we'll stay in Syria as long as Iran is going to stay in Syria that to change that has it changed your it's one of the Trump wants to watch and friday October fifth\nAh gee zero world would end Bremmer congratulate me what time a check your local listings is different in every city around the country [noise]\nWhat is he talking about I thought he was just doing the right thing and yet he wasn't doing the right thing he was doing the right thing because it doesn't matter he's out there anyway so it means nothing\nWhere not only that Brian I'm\nI think he's being dishonest or he wants to run for president he talked about that and and there is among many I think Republicans this idea that you can be a Republican and the anti Trump at the same time I mean the never Trump hers will love Jeff Flake and I think that's so this is this is a\nPolitical move disguised as a moral move now politics can sometimes be moral but let's see I I think flake is being dishonest one he denies any political that this is an anti political move this is not anti political for him it's very personal and very political\nUh it just it's unbelievable so here we are we have an investigation going on and the FBI has five let's say five days to get it done\nSo they're going to talk to ... they're going to talk to his best friend mark judge from childhood they going to talk to 'em or the other guy Patrick Smith\nAnd they're going to talk to judge about ... and what she said about the third accuser and what you said about huge parties\nThat are basically a group sex parties where they do\nI I don't know what they would they do in there I guess it's a term illegal acts so that's not good enough for Democrats of course they want more they say that we want to know the scope of the investigation because you know seven days is not going to be enough cuts for\nEven days that's bad enough for them to limit the FBI and the scope and there's another question that that really [laughter]\nI live in these in where fires fan and that's the kind of the nation and all of us are expecting the FBI to conduct\n[noise] so now the seven days not good enough not the investigation they want to see done they would like to go I don't know how one go months\nWell look Brian ... and I think that gets to the heart of what we're discussing that this has not done in good faith by the Democrats they bought a week old but NATO now campaigning to a week is not enough I mean think of this thing this thing was done more than two\nWeeks ago and then they extended it with a whole for trickery now they extended it again another week thanks to flake because of a very narrow majority and oh that's not enough so the aim is to deny a vote\nThe aim is to hold this off until the election then run on it run on the election as though that Supreme Court seat uh is is the basis for the rallying\nCry the Democrats in in the\nCongressional races and then the Democrats want to fill that seat themself Chuck Schumer would be majority leader if they take the Senate and uh and then they would deny President Trump any\nPicket all presumably oh he's being investigated we can't generalize him by giving him another Supreme Court seat so this is all part of a long game strategy of the Democrats to\nNot give this Supreme Court pick to a Republican president because it could it with a fist conservative on their reliably consistently conservative voice that would\nStrengthen or the conservative wing of the court make it very difficult for even the liberal Democratic president or a liberal Congress to pass the big government programs so that's what this is about and so it's not surprising at all\nThat one week is suddenly not nearly enough well within three weeks\nNo not enough it's got to go to November that's the ultimate goal\nWell the thing is uh I think that how many CEOs would we have how many people in prominent position where we have if we had to open up their high school yearbook talked all their high school friends and their college friends and an exam and if they acted like CEOs when they were Seventeen Nineteen\nI mean do we wouldn't have any everyone that Wall Street you'd walk out you know what everyone in the newsroom across these countries should walk at all these anchors should turn in their blazers because believe me they were not but they were not pristine college kids\nOr the sexual so I get it is serious but I also get this region Mitchell the extremely average questionnaire prosecuted from Arizona seemed like a wonderful person but never got to the point where adjusted to a five minute increments says after all this study and she did\nDo you put out a five page memo and it was obtained by the Washington Post and she said the accused the person who accused him of his salt saltier at our house in southern Maine she would never been able to prosecute due to many holes in her story to missing\nIncluding notes from the sessions with a therapist we couldn't get we don't know how she got to the house couldn't get that don't know how she got home from the house don't know who invited to the house I don't know where the house was\nI don't know how she knows it's Kavanaugh and the people that you listed that were there all say it never happened and they don't even remember her\nTo the conclusion the prosecutor joined a private meeting with Senate Republicans on Thursday after the hearing where she told the senators after eight hours of testimony that she heard and study she would not have prosecuted to Kevin Kevin over for a song and was even close\nSo I mean does any of this matter\nWell Brian look I I think I think it raises a good point in terms of the conduct of others but if we're going to do all that\nThe un and come and dirty up Kavanaugh then I think we're entitled to a response to about those who are doing the dirty up what about Blumenthal a notorious liar what about Cory Booker notorious\nFabulous makes up stories all the time uh Dianne Feinstein with our Chinese spy on there and her office for Twenty years\nI mean on and on and on who are these people who dare to\nTo condemn Brett Kavanaugh for something he did in high school on which there is no evidence and so now they've changed it from sexual assault now it's drinking so it's always about dirty and him up right and and I think that the\nProblem with the flakes of the world is that they don't have confidence in anything right it's never going to be enough\nAt some point you've got to decide at some point I mean who is the purists person you're looking for who's the super St who's a good enough to pass the judgment of of flake and the Democrats no such person exist\nThis is the real world Brett Kavanaugh has been a superb charges ... per person for his entire adult life if he committed a crime that's one thing\nBut this search for anything that makes him look bad I mean this is a real travesty and this is what the Democrats are doing simply it's politics and I think people like flake who want to make it about something else or living in a fantasy world or I think in his case is just doing it for himself\nI think this is the ultimate selfish act of Jeff Flake\nOr yeah I mean now we know is not even a pure Iraq is not saying I I have to be here to my inner uh my inner set of values no it's oh yeah well I'm Out of politics I could do whatever I Want\nAll the uh before I let you go I just got to get your way into something else that President Trump promised to do and has done not many people looked at the south Korean trade deal and said that made news but it did matter\nBut not many people look at the fact that the U.S as a form as a framework for a new trade deal with America put that no one really paid attention and now we finally ... NAFTA here's Peter Navarro today we're on Fox and friends with me cut thirty for\nThe biggest deal and the history no hyperbole at one point two trillion dollars in trade a great day for America great day for North America and Brian my uh my favorite part of the deal is the fact that it's going to turn this hemisphere back into a manufacturing powerhouse\nSo deal done we're going to get the official a detailed shortly but the president's going to announce it in about an hour in ten minutes what's your reaction\nBrian it vindicate the president's approach doesn't it that that he said the deals are no good\nAnd we're going to change them now you know lots of people said the deals are no good but and they kept sort of gently knocking on the door of Canada or Mexico or they eat you China oh sir please would you change that they'll know okay thank you very much\nAnd everybody acknowledges NAFTA has\nChanged in the ... the world is just no Internet five years\nAt the same look ... and this is how Trump negotiates it is working\nIt is working for the benefit of the United states but of course the Trump haters one that's sort of take the opening shot and say oh my God\nYou've broken the China well yeah you have to break the China before you can get new China that's the point here he breaks up the old deals says he won't settle for demands new one they kick in screen because\nThese countries are all representing their their workers their businesses but America shouldn't that was the understanding that America had to give more because we were the richest but Trump was elected\nBy the people who felt left out from these riches and now it's properly hit rapidly and representing them\nAnd the farmers got to be happy the markets rocketing up ... in all three countries thank Michael good when thank you so much to be a fascinating week\nNews in one hour or on vine news talk Ninety four one dot com\nNews CBS News on the hour sponsored by their works relief\nI gather Rodriguez the FBI probe into sexual misconduct claims against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh has shifted into high gear investigators have interviewed the woman who accused him of exposing himself to her at a party at Yale Republican Senator Jeff flake tell CBS has sixty minutes\nWe other outrageous allegations that come forward\nThe FBI we'll talk to people who want to talk anymore or we won't be any better off\nAnd I think that we can make progress lake agreed to vote to send the nomination to the full Senate in exchange for the promise of a one week investigation after a confrontation with two women in a Senate elevator one of them Anna Maria ... with her assessment of cabin out I\nThink that he stands for the rollback of decades of progress for women said for communities of color for workers and make that President\nTrump pulled the news conference in an hour from now on an eleventh hour trade deal with Canada and Mexico business analyst ... countries will agree to new rules that require Seventy five percent\nOf auto content to be made in the ... us and Mexico and Canada that's up from sixty two and a half percent in the current\nThe remembrance to mark the one year anniversary of the worst shooting massacre in us history her son is the ... joined us live from Las Vegas\nAnd the sunrise event but first in a series of day long remembrances there are friends and relatives of the victims here also hear the governor of Nevada Brian Sandoval one year ago\nAn event took place that rocked us to our core and took something from us that we can never ever put back\nAt the very end of the service America the beautiful will be played than fifty eight dollars will be released one for each of those killed live in Las Vegas ...

opinions the overwhelming majority which on this network I regard as quite critical or hospital for Trump now that may be justified it made me that these folks have included on the basis of how Trump is behaved and the Republicans that they deserve this kind of push for CNN in effect or most of its people have taken a stand up on this president\nAnd about this nomination\nJeff Greenfield being critical to Bryan shelter about what we saw I laugh out loud and to me I cannot believe that as you know if they actually wanted to get a bigger audience they would talk about ten\nIn ways oh acting emotionally when if you will get Fox on the worst our boy in the most part is that you can find we always have a balance it out\nAnd there's not that hatred that hatred that they get pointed out by Jeff Greenfield he's been on the show before right\nHe we let you we got permission to interview him when he was still a CNN because he had a book out and he seems to be fair to an analysis critic doesn't mean he doesn't have Trump or it might might love Trump but the fact is he felt an obligation to give them a fair shot what I've loved about this last few weeks\nWe've got it on Trump is almost out of it and I think he's got to be little reflective and say it's kinda good to be the either storm overall Kavanaugh's candidacy and the controversy is going to help Republicans if he gets through they'll say my goodness they fought and we have to fight for them if he doesn't\nMy goodness we have to make sure we get another shot and get the Senate held for them for Democrats they already motivated I think overall America benefits we might have get get over sixty percent of the people for a midterm to actually vote Zacharias online and Arizona Zacharias\nHey Brian Brian thanks

president says he give the president and a minus so far and what he's done for the economy so around the world he's telling NATO you got to pay more he's actually done everything that he said\nExcept forget the wall built and Mexico pay for Mexico is not going to pay for it yet there might be fees to come up there but he's not able to pull it off or Republicans are not stood by him on that because they're the party split but we'll here we are trying to move forward with a nominee that happens to be conservative that's what he's guilty of\nYou cannot tell me the doctor for to count is enough to destroy the life of will in Orlando or Brian in New York all my other callers\nYou can't come out with the allegation don't say how you got there how you went home who invited you Brett Kavanaugh has never met you his best friends says it never happened your best friend says you don't recall your therapist who let the notes out and you never mention his name to the therapist\nYou mentioned it to people your beach friends\nWho told you to go to a congresswoman who went to a senator who ended up having a staffer somebody else leak your name out\nAnd now next to you know you're supposed to destroy somebody who's been thirty five years in the public eye and as an impeccable record\nA is a scenario I don't think anybody's life can withstand John also a news Ninety six five and a land oh John\n[noise] hey Brian thanks for taking my call 'em you're saying all the right things and you know that um after hearing the or listening to um the hearings on on Thursday\n[noise] um I agree I I I agree with ... and I appreciated what um [noise] uh the senator a gram\nHad to say and I think it's clear to the American people or what the full intent of the Democrats are\nI think a ... somebody could have 'em\nBecause they were always questioning or wondering why not delay have this delay a and they some ... a Senator Grassley or someone could have ... how long of a delay we know what they would have responded and in fact they probably wouldn't have responded to that question because we know their fall into\nA job that we already know how they're voting this is oh sure right we already know how but\nIf people were watching those proceedings I think it came out to millions and millions of people watching that proceedings and so this by asking that question would have put the Democrats are in a position that they didn't want to be put in that would have been may make clear\nTo all the viewers what their full intent was because they they weren't going to come come out with a date or how long and in fact if they did it would have probably been like eight weeks ten weeks three months from now after the election\nAnd teach and then John I Know what you're saying and it's not a bad thought but you know the way there is playing out if we all want the same goal and that's the truth your scenario works but their goal is to lay and we're seeing it what kind of investigation what's the scope of the investigation I Want to see it in writing\nReally now all of a sudden you add just as we thought a friend came out and says I Can't believe Brett Kavanaugh says he never drank too a blackout he used to drink\nA lot and to me he got really so you know he was ... when he was drunk what does that have to do with anything we're talking about as sexual assault or exposure in a situation where the accuser\nAdmitted says she was so drunk she doesn't remember\nAnd it was thirty five years ago so do you see out of the choose your come somebody else who said why ... then he has a roommate\nFor mayor wow there's room mate that sounds bad he used to drink like well it turns out it was a roommate he was stuck with the other three two we had no problem with that fourth won all three of them at a problem with so he's got a chance to stick in the cabinet oh let me see Yale doesn't endorse him well yeah had protest to keep him out of there\nThere are so ridiculous because he's a conservative they ride the protest to keep at Yale alum this off the Supreme Court\nThat's unsinkable but that's the mindset that what you're dealing with you not dealing with a group of people that want to get to the bottom of it and Chris Coons is the biggest disappointment listen to a little of his interview with Jeff Flake a and a and Scott Kelly cutlery\nHe had exchanges with Senator Feinstein was center a ... hour with others that I thought went over the line [noise] um he was clearly and pull entrant\nAggressive angry\nMade you wonder about is sort of building in my case yes but Senator Flake you identified with or do you want to sing partisan but ah but boy I have to put myself in that spot down to\nYou can you can understand why he was angry and uh [noise] you know I think given all the way there\nYeah and uh you know Chris Coons ... basically and the company never even gave him a fair shot they never were open to voting for him and he was willing to put up with that but now when you start talking about his integrity you want to challenge his decisions roe v Wade and you might be a emotional about that go ahead\nIf he if he snapped ... three hundred nine decision said he had to defend but when you go after and basically says he's not there was an editorial out today says he should not coach girls basketball think about that\nNew units somebody has gotten out of prison that wants to second shot you were selling with someone they finished ... class in in jail and it was an exemplary life on and off the court to go on and who should yeah literally I don't know if the court in sports and be on\nAnd now has all of that thrown in the street by people who doesn't even know who basically hate Donald Trump raw sushi on K.

welcomed Tom Bev and Tom somebody's door it's going to be happening in a matter of moments the president's about seven ten uh ten minutes late but he's going to be announcing a new NAFTA\nYeah it's a big deal for Trump I think uh and and you know as you mentioned as as a promise delivered him and he said called NAFTA one of the world trade deals in the history of the country he promised to renegotiate it uh and he was surprisingly effective at doing it individually and and really leveraging a Mexico against Canada\nAnd so ... yeah this is a this is a big deal and we will see the devil's

who said we need to redo this among the people the benefit farmers Tom ... politics dot com Tom how big a deal is this\nWell I mean again this is a it's a promise kept for Trump it's delivering he's talking to his base or you know right onto the stump absolutely and and look the one thing that Republicans are here's the problem for Republicans the economy's great\nRight it's better than it's been in a midterm since Nineteen Ninety eight we haven't seen this kind of an economy sixty nine percent of people say they're very or somewhat satisfied with where things stand\nUm the problem is is that voters don't vote out of gratitude they bowed out of anger and frustration right and fear and so you've seen Republicans change their messaging from Haiti economies grateful for us to\nThe economy is great but if you vote for Democrats it all goes away right and they're trying to really instill that during the base to get them out to vote because um it's it's the economy is fantastic\nOh yeah that would you explain to that time that's why when you say hey if you lose the house the president going to be a nonstop or investigations that fear that's right if you lose the sand that you don't get another judge that fear that seems to have a gender\nThat's right and the other problem with the economy too is when the economy's good voters tend to feel comfortable and where they are and start to pay attention to other issues and so you've seen healthcare rise you've seen education rise in the mix um economy is still the number one issue but not as much as as a it has been necessarily in the past and that's because things are things are pretty darn good right\nNow here's congressman or leader Kevin McCarthy cut dirty one\nWhat I'm finding is prior to the cabinet hearing intensity level was really on the Democratic side that more Democrats were wanting to go vote than Republicans Republicans thought there was not an IED but in the last week there's been a fundamental shift\nPeople are now becoming upset not just how\nJustice Kavanaugh was treated with Dr Ford that the Democrats knowingly had this letter held it and then put her through this\nSo I Know that's what he wants is he right Tom [noise]\nWell that's that's the big question we were trying to figure out right we're trying to get some polling data in here to see what's going on Democrats have have clearly been there outrage meter has been eleven we've seen this gender gap it's been at or near historic highs right in the last four polls taken in September\nA took a reason average and and women were voting in the congressional about number for for Democrats by Eighteen points Republicans were voting for men were voting for Republicans by two points we got twenty point gender gap\nUm that could and probably will go higher and the question is how much more can can Democrats squeezed out among women and whether men actually respond and get angry and upset and and move toward Republicans I think we will have the highest gender gap that we've ever seen this election or because of this because of this hearing\nYou played a clip from John Heilemann earlier about if if Kavanaugh goes down this will benefit Trump and Republicans I completely disagree with that I think that's a hundred percent wrong I think if Kavanaugh goes down as nominations withdrawn and gets torpedoed whatever the Republican base is going to be so disgusted into spirited what happened they will stay home and there'll be a bloodbath\nHuge white I think there's a chance you might be wrong and that was repeal and replace you clearly could see the Republicans blew it they never had a plan ready to go in the skinny repeal is that even a plane and it was empty ... empty paper and they couldn't get their numbers together\nThen you look at this and say we got to give Trump some weapons we gave him three moderates he this is exactly what to do he took it from a list there was handed to him screened by the federal is screened by his own people screened six times by the FBI\nGuy you gave me fifty gave me fifty one you got to get you heat legitimately as an argument both repeal and replace Republicans all we're staying how do you feel about that theory\nI mean it's a potluck anything's possible I think anybody who's going to go with your theory that might attack\nLike ... anybody who who who tells you they they know what's going to happen five which now is lying I mean we can see and here's what's interesting about this if you look at a real clear politics you look at our no tossup Senate map which allocate to the states based on where the polls are right now Democrats are picking up one seat of goes fifty fifty\nBut if that shift just one point and Republicans direction of the next five weeks Republicans could pick up four Senate seats in ... in the Senate and and still probably lose\nSeats in the house which would be the first time that's happened since ... it'll be the third time that's happened since Nineteen thirty four doesn't happen very often but it could happen this year\nIncredible Tom Bevan real clear politics dot com and breaks out every race with every guys it's

entire trade with Japan so you know the border is so porous this just in time delivery systems this is great for everybody\nYeah I'm very curious to see him and try to do remember the G six seven rather a they had that left the communique after president was irate and he let them have it but here's what he just said you know about you do you think he has the highest regards from Europe or in a lecture and do\nIt yeah uh and um you know look just and I think it's been a complete embarrassment for Canadian so I mean you won't less well\nYou know he had this totally embarrassing trip to India where he dressed up his entire family in Bollywood costumes and even the onion said this is totally ridiculous right and you know he's been posturing knows the moral conscience of the world and you know and the world is ...\nCanada right [laughter] well\nHe is very flexible you know he's very good a yoga and as Pete says he's endlessly handsome\n[laughter] I'm only kidding beat 'em but\nSo the president's talking right now and he's got to be speaking about this but the other thing is with the Kavanaugh situation the president has been remarkably restrained I Would I'm been I'm Amazed if you've seen this before when he had to pull it back together after the convention they will seem to be going off to reconstitute the burning Kelly in and bad and\nCan you bring us back to that moment and the discipline that got the campaign back on track\nWell it was a moment where it looked like the whole world was against them I mean I'm I'm thinking about the the point a couple of weeks before the election where the the video surfaced and and everybody wanted him out I mean I was just you know it was sheer guts and determination\nThat kept things together and that's been all that but that's the guy I mean we liked him because he was tough I mean we looked at those other sixteen candidates and we thought you know nice people well bread you know great families but they can't take on the Democrats\nRight and when the and the price you want to do is the billionaire resonated with blue collar workers and they'd always wore ties didn't wear blue jeans Sherrie how they pretend to be somebody who wasn't\nYeah absolutely and you know something on the campaign we decided really early on we are not going after blue collar workers who we are not going after private sector unions public sector a totally different that's the only gay but you know regular people on the assembly plant these are our people had something else\nYou know I debated a bunch of left these about my book the Republican workers' party and and they just got furious right they said workers we own that word right I mean we're the workers' party and I said you know nice try but you know something that's ancient history or not the workers' party anymore you're the party of transgender bathrooms\nDo you believe that the president needs another four years to drill that through Republicans heads 'cause you don't feel like you're there yet\nThat we're not there yet uh I was hoping twenty Eighteen would do it we're not there yet I mean at this point people I Know tell me we're going to lose but you know as many as ... seats in the house [noise]\nAh in which case will have an impeachment Congress at that point you know the impeachment Congress will play on Trump's favor I mean if Americans like divided government we're talking Trump and twenty twenty I think we are talking trumpet twenty twenty whatever\nRight but yeah it's it's going to take a pro says\nThat it's going to have to see and hopefully you have to understand too is that the president did they did in after Mitt Romney got hammered they did an autopsy yeah but you believe the autopsy many ways was wrong\nThe autopsy was absolutely crazy it was like\nYou know let's be nicer right uh and and you know let's let a lot more people cross the border from Mexico it was just you know it's going to lose the Hispanic yeah it was just a a classic example of a party so down on ideas that they did they didn't all the way up\nSo Trump said you know this is just totally wrong you know and the great thing was that report said we really need a mild mannered guy yeah right and then we got so ah you\nGot into the Trump campaign now\nI um [noise] read programs for judges and I send a list of possible judicial appointees when I heard they were looking for them and I attended a speech and you know what afterwards\nI found myself ... uh you know two or three messages a day with Jared and Stephen Miller and read it in a bunch

how they look at him going down the aisle\nAnd they're never looking across to see what they ate costs were that printer and that is car courageous but goes I don't care what the prices on that

nothing\nAnd I told you about for years about the ups and ... printers\nI think and more recently cannon has joined this movement of having the printers where the ANC is basically free but you pay a

in life now I'm kind of curious about where you stand on buying a actual fully a\nMuch bigger fan of you doing what you've done so you were buying gold exchange traded funds the ts correct yeah I think that's the only wise way to do it\nBecause if you buy physical gold you gotta buy sell spread on the price where you get a little bit ripped off on what they sell it to you for then you get a little bit ripped off on what they buy it back for me for you have to store it you have to worry about theft\nIt's not\nIs convertible as quickly and to cash is you have with the exchange traded fund it's much cheaper and much more efficient tone gold or any precious metal with an exchange traded fund in ATF which where people aren't familiar with what that is I should say\nJohn that essentially it's like buying a stock\nRather than buying the physical gold but the gold is stored for you\nBy the fine in a vault in a safe place to protect your investment\nSo if if gold is where you think it's

credit union is who you're paying from into\nThen mode did it right making it work across any platform\nMike is with us on the Clark Howard show hello Mike\n... how you doing I'm doing well how are you good\nYou have a question for me about seeing if you're on track and on target have enough money to retire with comfort is that right\nThat's correct so I've gone on to um some retirement calculators on line and I get a enormously a wide variety of answers\nAnd that so frustrating\n[laughter] yes well it it some some days I'm happy and some days I'm scared out of my mind so\nSo there is one thing as a retirement calculator that is more than playing horseshoes\nOkay you know there is no precision with the the closest there's been the precision is a tool that was developed by a organization called financial engines\nBut generally is available to people if I remember right to people that work for a specific participating employer they use something known as Monte Carlo modeling\nThat takes projections and calculates in worst case scenario based on historical declines in the market and what age you are and all that and comes up with\nA best guesstimate about how close you already are targets and how likely you are to never run out of money okay but again as I as I recall that's only available to people at participating companies unless they have\nIf you tried different calculators are wide organizations elect you use there's\nEven if you're not a customer of them you think of any of the big financial companies they'll have a calculator you usually go to Fidel investments and use theirs and they are all using different methodologies\nAnd that's why you'll see such variation in who thinks here on target and who's not so if somebody who wants to rest easy at night\nYou find the one that says you are headed towards financial Armageddon unless you increase your amount you put aside by so much\nAnd you go with their very pessimistic projections to make it happen\nRight okay so the Monte Carlo model would that be something that if I met with a like a financial counselor they would have that available for me\nYes there may be there may be some that are ... subscribing to Monte Carlo simulations\nThat would be able to give you based on the all the various\nScenarios give you the likely outcome and it's not a certain outcome it's a ... percent outcome with ... percent hide that you will be okay if any of the tools you you have used have they shown us based on a ... percent calculation\nNo it's just been basically you need this much per month and I'm your projection is that you'll have this much per month\nDollars okay and it's been all over the place so\nRight and that's it and that makes it is clear is that could be that what I said is true and that's that they're doing their best effort using the best methods they know but the likely outcomes are going to range so far\nBecause right now buddy nobody can know with certainty\nBut somebody who is if you go to a um [noise] the only financial planner you know you might if you want to check up you might contact people with Garrett planning network\nAnd they charge you an on an hourly basis to give you advice and guidance and ask if they do Monte Carlo simulations about how you're doing and then you know if you've found somebody that you can pay on an hourly basis to run those analyses for you\nOkay gotcha\nBut I Will tell you that my generally experience is that when somebody is asking the question you're asking and running the simulations you're running that you likely are fine on your path to having enough money in retirement\n[noise] well I Hope so but I think what I heard you say is to find a find someone that can give me a Monte Carlo simulation

machine\nAnd the door opens and you can drive off in the vehicle\nThat either [laughter]\nI just got to pay for it first try that out there if\nYou think about what I was just talking about with car

car by just that we don't know what you're gonna get\nBut again and however many years car buying has been around one complaint one that's it that's that's impressive so they must be doing a good job

definitely get an answer to that if it's money that was pre tax or after tax okay\nBecause you could if it's after tax money you could roll it into a raw IRA so yeah\nAnd that's what I Would do if it's before tax money I'd still roll it into a regular IRA he would you know because that's been sitting there from a decade ago you're not there anymore um I I don't know why I Believe it there\nOkay

I'm Glad I've always liked him\nAnd uh I think he had some people that were in his ear that ah didn't need to be perhaps even people close to him but uh he is helping Alabama tremendously and he gives Nick Saban insurance policy that no one else in the in the sport has right now\nYeah they're the only team that can beat Alabama right now is Alabama you write\nI'm a I remember\nAh the commentator on the first game was talking about my clock sleep a as the officer coordinator as he is the guy with the keys to the sports car\nWell Alabama's kicking game looks like they took their land for any sports car and put four dollar caps on it yeah uh [laughter]\n... I'm going to take that to where I first of all ... actually has a surprise me um and I ... I spoke to someone that's\n... that's a pretty keen observer Saturday of that situation and and he has been really into sheer and that's surprised with some people because even though he's been in that position has been a head coach uh\nUh people weren't certain of of that ah that that move probably the the weakest all fencing coordinator savings had in terms of reputation since a major apple white the very first year major apple why was young he he wouldn't be a a questionable decision now\nAh the kicking game in Alabama it it's just like a punch line to a joke I don't understand I I I mean cause it nearly cost Alabama the national championship last year\nOr how continues to haunt them because it has cost saving games or if you look at the games and Nick Saban his loss and it doesn't take long to look at those games there's usually a kicking mistake\nYeah well one last comment if you'll allow me and my grandmother who was a final southern lady from Tennessee told me you can always tell how much somebody really knows about a subject but how long can debate it without raising their voice\nBetter\nTheir wives comment and [laughter] I liked\nThat because too many too often and I I um I've been guilty of that myself and you know I learned this from a preacher friend of mine he said the softer you talk to more people actually listen\nBut a ... some of the callers have a tendency to let their emotions get ahead or their thought process\nI think that goes for everyone and I I work as a very talented people that sometimes just decided to scream instead of talk\n[laughter] it was wonderful talking to you and thank you for the privilege\nThank you it was it was mine a kitten can we possibly are we about to do this maybe at first and the show's history I mean we're we're not based in Kentucky are we but we will now break a record and have three consecutive calls from Louisville, Kentucky\nFeel like I'm hosting as showing W. H. S. or something uh [laughter] how are you\nHardly good afternoon I eat on top we're doing well thank you very much\nI just wanted to talk about what you said about Kentucky this week coming up is that is a big game we cannot overlook Texas ...\n... how do you think are deep and just playing a superb\nAren't we the surprise of the whole country\nYou will be soon I mean I think there's some debate a and and this weekend may settled that early debate between LSU and Kentucky in\nTerms of er which I mean she has the two top ten wins one on the road Kentucky has very significant wins as well but of Kentucky\nCan go on the road this week and ... and went in College Station I Will be or even more than ... ... am and I can't I Can't imagine being much more\nImpressed by the cats we are going to

a bunch of Russian yours to Kentucky but we're seeing now that uh Kentucky is a that was just a fluke you know Kentucky the real deal with\nUm venting in them up they're they're they're running a ball well they're playing good defense but Florida defense outside of that game you know\nA has a plan really well and I guess in Mississippi State they obviously made some because you know state was playing pretty well and that first quarter they were moving the ball a kick to feel goals um they're playing pretty well the first quarter to quarter and a half\nA him in especially in the second half\nYou know ... some of them said they brought the heat you know they they brought the heat they brought a lot of blood saying\nOh we all know about the blitz safety blitz on MySpace last snap at Fort down so defensively man they got a couple of players back in the last couple of weeks one may have been I think suspended or for the first couple of games another one miss\nAgain the first three games and they got everybody kind of back in Mandy offensively they look really good off instantly I\nDo some inconsistent stuff from Philippe Frank I Know he um his numbers when you look at his numbers they look pretty good uh but but still some inconsistencies there\nAre ... they they they got a bond I'm a little better office of rhythm you know at times they looked it looked pretty rough Saturday Night but but man you know about Paul if you've got a strong defense\nLike it looks like Florida and you know very much experience to a defensive coordinator like Todd grants and they're going to win some games and the league and they certainly look really good going into this match up defensively you know against LSU\nRaw selling girl from a s aside joined us Ross you are you you live down there you you spend a lot of time around that I Want to shoot program even though you don't cover as ... as much as you want to because of your job with Sports Illustrated ... let's get your take or five weeks into the season on\nEdwards Ron too impressive wins a huge stretch coming up to Florida and George Packer back your tech\nYeah it's a ... a real issue that made it a schedule has arrived\nI'm add Florida home against Georgia home against Mississippi stay home and his Alabama so you get a you know outside of Mississippi State or you know all the top twenty five teams I'm In for re next Bob we sell share the by weaken their\nUm before Alabama so it is it is a nice you know and and you take these ah these next four games that if\nI mean heck part if you can go three and one that's pretty incredible and if you can go three to one you will be you'll be you'll be\nIn in in mid November um even if you can go to and to you you're you're still looking at a pretty\nA pretty good season you know a ten ten and two type non and three at least type season so this this whole uh this'll kind of make or break the season you know right here this war game stretch a ... it's going to be interested in the city and obviously\nYou know and it was ... got his boys playing well playing better than anybody else I think that anybody saw that they\nThat they would play you know there's a there was a lot of confidence in the in the Lsu football building before the season but I don't know where else there was confident about ... football season except there\nAnd we're seeing why they were they were pretty confident about this team you know they play really good defense their front seven is really nasty I'm you know they're they're defensive backs that they're just they kind of cycle them through you know we know they like to say db you and they just get\nGreat you know and it fell caliber guys every year the mixing this year I think that that ... that's kind of surprised everybody\nI'm One of course they had a kicker you know it was made some really big kicks and they didn't have that last year missed eleven people rose last year did LSU so they have a kicker 'em and they have a consistent quarterback\nWho appears to be a every week progressing you know getting better and better and better and we always say you know a veil issue has an above average quarterback look out in\nIt looks like el issue has an above average quarterback\nIf you had to guess a lot of these are these next two for certainly for the next two weeks or I mean do you think they get through this the first part of the gauntlet\nForward it's going to be tough um I I I Want to even stay call that the Florida game might be tougher than the Georgia game well and they're not say that because\nOf what I saw it a Florida as defense last week against Mississippi State um and and I know that el issues all fence\nHad has its struggles you know I Know that they they're they've gone\nSo many stretches in these first few games that what you're going to go on these long stretches where there'd be a a quarter and a half or two quarters or even two and a half wars without scoring um it happened to get to Auburn it happened to get to every game have happened you happen to Alice shooting against every game and\nIs this game is that Florida is going to be pumped up after a big Mississippi State when they've got a great difference that I think can can really slow down or stop allergies often\nUm ... that's going to be interesting to see you know and and again down there the rowdy you know the swamp and things like that I I\nThink that might be a tougher cast\nUm and it's very ... hit the floor is the Florida game yeah so and they didn't come out of there and go get a win at the swamp and and come home and you know and that's\nGoing to be a day game I Know in tiger stadium against Georgia\nA two thirty kick butt you know it's it's gonna be rowdy if they can get out of the swamp with a whim but that is is really going to test to fail issue and they were tested at Auburn\nBut are you know I think Florida got just as good of a defense and we saw you know of I mean unless you're barely escaped that were bought one point so it might be one of those type games you know where it's decided in the final minute down there in Gainesville\nRoss always a pleasure thank you very very much we'll talk soon\nProbably thankful sprayed stuff that's an interesting point a Florida could be a tougher game on the road than the number two teams Georgia at home I think about

suddenly he doesn't fit in and he's not in the ... he's not an FCC guy and but you know you live there than that Dan mowing game was serious stuff to Mississippi State was\nMan it was the earlier the host was looking for to them and they will they had this one circle and counter for here and you see where that gesture them although this fan base that much better for them and how many ...\nHow are they doing right now after a another beat down\nOnly how'd you get that bad on the fence but that that fast and it often citizens graders but no not really that quarterback you impress me at all uh I mean they've tried to compare him to to those couple of weeks\nAnd you can either get the power to stay on top of it this fall the folks who ... power equipment has covered their your home for quality

and they had no guys are okay let's start with you you are you did\nYou know unhappy Mississippi State fans calling and give your your state of the program\nLast week didn't we sit right here in the seats and say this is a must win we did for Mississippi State or or else they were going to have anarchy and that's exactly what we have um if you look at what happened on Saturday\nTo problems occur one Nick Fitzgerald still has yet to progress throwing the football he still is slow to diagnose pressures and coverage and mismatch is that he might have and the secondary and the passing game\nWe also saw team though that did not bounced back from a diversity\nThe dropped past bio Cyrus Mitchell\nAbsolutely destroyed this team's confidence at that point it would have been had he caught at Thirteen three and that might have sealed the game in favor of Mississippi State instead\nThey were less kind of picking up the pieces there up six three and they were never able to recover from that I missed opportunity so ah I Am concerned about this team there and ah of their office of lying to continue to get exposed with speed rushes to line backers are somewhat undisciplined\nAnd they didn't tackle real well in the secondary offensively they have their own issues because when you don't have a quarterback that can throw the ball accurately\nYou're going to get challenged every single week in this conference and when you have teams that can play man to man on the other side like Florida was able to do and you can't separate you're in a world of hurt in this week so high it might get darker before the done if they don't figure things out quickly\nAuburn coming to town\nIt looks to me the most disappointing thing to me about Mississippi State is lack of identity\nThey don't know who they are as a football team when it comes from this is what we do best and we're going to try to impose this on every opponent that we play\nThe last two weeks I watch Mississippi State off and try to figure out during games what's going to work right and that directly related to ... ... that's that's the thing that you have to identify as do more hit and then you add the element we talked about Paul ... from an FCC standpoint this is not a big game\nBut when you talk about trajectory of a program\nLike damn mullet had everything to gain and nothing to lose\nBy winning this game now because of Florida fan base is already sold on them moment Joe more here was the one under the microscope in this particular game so when you when you look at Kentucky last week they scored Thirteen points total in two weeks of football right that is the issue\nAt Mississippi State right now and now I'm gonna tell you as a player as a perspective from a player and Greg has been a part is\nWhen you walk into the locker room after two games like this as a defensive player or or often and where if a decent just given up forty points a game you start looking across the locker room like yo\nOr we go get this fixed or turmoil starts the ball up\nLittle bit yeah between players and that's where you don't want to go so I think right now Mississippi State is in the in in in common to land the boss trying to figure out who are we offensively we're supposed to be the dominant defense um and the defense gave up Thirteen points\nThey've set up is fine I Know that's what I'm saying so I mean you know they you win a game giving up Thirteen points you you better the goal of every beef it's I've ever played on was to give up Seventeen or less\nBecause the expectation that solve if you get you at least Seventeen and then uh it might want to drop that or the time being they had the minimum so I doubt that that is the most disappointing and then we heard all this talk about Joe more ... and they ... the type of guy that he's been used to a choice of ...\nKim necklace Gerald like he he's slow to diagnose right now\nAh he's not comfortable going through his progression Z even in the run game you know what he does better than almost anybody in the SEC\nHe's been slow to put his foot in the ground and be decisive north and south now that could be the byproduct of the injury that was coming off of he might not have confidence in that leg but he's not the same player today that he was last year\nAt this point so he's got to look in the mirror and figure okay what do I need to do to adjust\nBecause right now what I'm doing is not playing winning football and the guy behind me can play so I better play well for fear of potentially getting replaced by Keith Thompson who's the guy that can really go given the opportunity to host what can I Do you make the question comes some just we're all just listening to talk\nTo them I I was here ... let me ask you this do that for before both standpoint always resort to you when we have off into his Nick Fish zero hurting this much damage to leave in Mississippi State no\nHe's hurting by not having the repetitions in the spring full speed repetitions of a new style and it takes money to get comfortable\nWith and often that is new to you write the often still fits Nick Fitzgerald really well put Nick Fitzgerald and Penn State's often\nAnd look at how many rushing yards traced like Charlie had against Ohio State how do you think Fitzgerald would have fared like this often sits in perfect cleaner but\nHe's not being decisive than the run game unbroken plays you still inaccurate when he leaves the pocket and when he runs the football he's not running with the same gumption that even that I remember remember running with over the last few years so it's just it's just been different and it hasn't been as fast to register and processes I think a lot of\nReligious look out of sorts man down and look you can have you can have an office and have an office of playing and they'd be bad and you're not good any way right now I don't think Mississippi State really has a place\nI think they're still trying to figure out who are we are offensive Lee ... at this position how can we best suit this office around him because the position is what makes it go\nThe quarterback position is what makes officers' go I don't care if you're running football team or appeal football team a option football team the decision making by that guy that regular reflects on how will and how much success you have a visually and right now it just seems like they search and before you go it's\nA thought from you and and Greg on on this weekend in Gainesville we talked about Florida what about all this you heading down there\nUm LSU has played old miss and everybody is excited but you know medium cautiously optimistic with my with my tigers um I like what job arose has done up until this point the numbers aren't there but he seems to have\nThis team and the rights situations in all of the games that they play and there's a lot to left field to be desired\nFrom them from officer standpoint I don't know how much validity you give to the success they have because we know what ms defense is to be but where they are right now I think they play really will as a team I think just route from\nOffice to defense to special teams nothing spectacular they got some spectacular players on the defense side of the football but nothing has really been spectacular\nBut it's been winning football for ill issue they are doing what they do best so um it it'll be an interesting game I saw some things from them ... and ... had to compensate a little bit for his lack of efficiency offensively and he was able to coaches guys download some place to get them in the end zone\nBut with that being said we know\nWhat the environment is like around this game so it it's going to be a tough one\nThat can be a tough game or expect to be really low scoring what I\nIt was ... went from caretaker to play maker in the span of sixty minutes not only was the impressive statistically worry accounted for three hundred and eighty a yards which the fourth most ever by and I'll let you tiger\nBut the throws that he made some of which were contested and their receivers made plays on the ball and when it wasn't there\nPut it in a mixed performance today the Japanese Nikkei to twenty five index was up around and a half percent stocks over in Europe or mostly higher although UK foot sea one hundred was down two tenths of one percent the German and French markets though we're a bit higher on the day the bond markets treasuries headed to the downside today after two ...\nPrevious sessions the benchmark

uh our next guest was the Kentucky quarterback he was the SEC player of the year he was also the number one pick in the NFL Draft we are talking about the legendary Tim Couch temp thanks good to see a year or two ago up in Lexington and we will hopefully ah\nWhat a a what a year it's been in the bluegrass thanks for joining us\nBobsled Paul you appreciate you having me on the show and yes but it's been a great start to the days of course in a you know we could have asked for anything better that seem as playing great fan of excitement it\nIs that an all time high right now and I'm just I'm just really happy for coach scoops and his staff and what they've been able to do since he arrived in Lexington ways level to recruit and develop players in the end or this football it seems that now\nAnd I want to get trying to get some perspective because listen in it you know forty years ago Kentucky had some epic teams and yeah if you go even further back than that it's worth mentioning\nPaul Brian Houston coach there but and and your team certainly a hedge tremendous moments but ah it it's always a struggle for Kentucky for obvious reasons but\nExplain a little bit more what you were saying I mean the the job that that mark students is done building the program sustaining and help us understand where it is right now and where can go as well\nYeah you know\n\nBooker was fired at ... came at\nA you know I was actually a fortunate enough to be part of the search committee that went there without hired the coaches\nAre on on a you know interviewing the coaches and stuff with ... with Mitch Barnhart and I just trying to uh you know get get the best coach for our program it here so I was fortunate to be a part of that process and get a chance to meet mark here and that and it just kind of hear his vision for our program where he thought we could go in and how he was going to attack it and he talked about\nThe way he was going to recruit the state of Ohio the state of Florida with his connection there and and uh you know he wanted to talk he talks about upgrading the facilities in the stadium but you know getting the fans are support at an all time high it and not only has he done what he said he was going to do as far as all those things\nHe's far and away exceeded everything and you know he's never year you seem to continue to build this thing and uh we we just looked like an FCC so policy now you'll just as far as our personnel we walk out if you know we can line up and play against Florida we can play against Mississippi State or South Carolina\nAnd we we can dominate the at my at the at the one of his back on both sides football and and we've never been able to do that ever that I can remember I could touch football and I grew up in the state you're up in Washington my whole life and and played there but\nYou know we always had to be kind of you know I don't want to say gimmicky but we had to do something different you know often to lead to compete with other teams in the SEC says we didn't have the personnel just to line up and go beat people and and we have that now and this is pretty cool to see and I'll be honest I never thought I'd really see the day that we could do that against us these these teams but uh that's kind of where we're at now\nLet's talk a little bit about the challenges and you were there a and hear what the fans are saying I think it's great that fans are already looking ahead but there there's a danger in that day and then this week Missouri in a couple of weeks before Georgia\nAnd on November third or what what would you say to Kentucky fans because they're calling and there and they were excited and they shouldn't be but uh there's a lot that happens between now in the middle of the end of the season\nYeah there's a lot that has to happen you know we're number one we have to stay healthy and\nAll those things but uh you know we just got to continue to get better each week and you know they are the games become bigger each and every week the more we continue to wedded that it's going to be a really tough came quote on the road it gives the ATM and you know it's a you know we'll find out you know after after Saturday exactly what kind of football team we have if we can go on the road and\nAnd win that game after you know two big emotional way like we had against Mississippi State South Carolina\nAnd the goal in the road and if we can keep that going in and play like we have banned and get it went down there somehow it just be a it'd be great for our program ended it released that film for the rest of the year and you know but uh you know we just got to take a week to week right now you know I Know where everyone's excited\nYou know we're kind of feel like we've got the best thing we've had in a very long time and we know that probably is true but uh you know we still can't get to get ahead of ourselves especially as you know come the players and coaches\nYou know all the people that the you know involved in and I just just kind of take a week to weaken does you know just try to keep a continued San ...\nCan you understand because you were\nIt was getting over the Florida game that so much has been made out of that\nYou know I think it was huge um you know it just you know I was part of three of those games myself and just kind of always grew up you know just listening to that you know it's like you can't be Florida in football they can't do it and you know I thought when I got there that we had a good opportunity to beat him a couple of times and then we weren't able to do it and you know we have we've had our chances throughout the\nYou know whatever it was thirty one thirty two game losing streak that we had against them but you\nKnow to to go down there and and not only when that football game but when it the way we did it just kind of you know dominated we run the ... random football right down the road or defense Blake grade you know we just looked like the better team and I thought we looked like the better team in Lexington last year we wind up losing that game ... point but\nYou know I think for the last few years a couple of years we've we've been the better football team but now to finally get over\nThat hump and and actually get a win against a team that you know no one really thought we could be just you know huge for our program and I think it just gave our guys you know so much confidence they go out and compete with anyone and accomplished\nLet's talk about Terry wasn't he'll join us in a couple of minutes or you've\nSeen a lot of quarterbacks come and go before you after you are describing him to our audience\nMilitary guys improving you know he's a first year starts to junior college guys do\nI get off a little bit of a rough start you know first game was do you any struggle just a little bit but you know then he goes on the road and gets a win against Florida and uh you know he's just kind of you know you kind of steam growing every every week you know as as a position us being you know really developing as a pastor weekend the week out and you know last week against South Carolina so I\nKnow really going to his ... going through the progression you know getting you know I you know to his third guy in in in a progression of dumping the football off getting it to you know just get it out as as quick and not trying to force big plays down the field and\nYou know he can continue to develop as a pass through with the way we run the football and the white theory can run the football and stuff and you know if he can just get that um you know that passengers or just a little bit off it's going to be\nYou know so difficult to stop with the you know the play actually game we can do it with any of the ... you know taking shots down the field receivers that's a step up and play well around into but\nAre you serious getting better each week and he's got a ton of now that you can obviously run the football I got you've got a huge arm uh you know he's just trying to figure out this often and you know understand where to go with the football and making better decisions and and I really feel like he's getting better at that every week\nThe legendary Tim Couch or joining us talking about Kentucky for Bob Hope to see you soon Tim thank you very very much always great to visit\nA crusader fall thanks for

were skeptical however any trade agreement muzzle must be judged by whether it improves the wages working conditions and well being of America's workers and farmers House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi said misstatement Democrats will closely scrutinize the text and the Trump administration's NAFTA proposal\nAnd look forward to further analysis in conversations with stakeholders\nAnd the agreement reached Sunday gives us farmers greater access to the Canadian dairy market and they keep saying that the dispute resolution process and he was one of the genocide and offers candidate protection and Trump goes ahead with plans to impose tariffs on cars trucks and auto parts imported into the United states\nNancy Pelosi\nIt's so weird\nAnd [noise] I guess it shows my naivete that I always am surprised but when you're below sea and I'm Wasserman Schultz when they complained\nAbout how little of thousand dollars was that told us a lot about Democrats and our rich these people must be\n'cause it's that can be Thirty years when I make it a pretty good but now a thousand dollars is still a lot of money to me if I was in dollars pretty good bucks right huh yes absolutely oh you're making a lot more than I Am sure maybe doesn't around as though no ... would you ever called crumbs no\nNo not so I mean to me it just doesn't make any sense first they\nSay that thousand dollars is crumbs no big deal oh I didn't want to raise taxes are going to get the crumbs back there was nothing but that's what they want us to believe that so what people are going back to work that doesn't really prove anything\nAnd now they're going to closely scrutinize this trade agreement a trade agreement that is overwhelmingly good for America American workers\nRemember the dairy farmers in this country did not have access to Canada why there was a two hundred Seventy percent tariff on dairy products from here to there\nJust needs people's using happy but farmers will be able to to show their their goods to Canada and not be taxed like but\nIt really does I mean it shows a naive miss any ... in me that I keep on thinking that they can't possibly say something that dumb\nYou're unhappy the jobs are coming back to your own happy the corporations are paying lower taxes or they can hire more people you're unhappy to some of those people three to four million of them got a bonus or increasing their pay or both\nBut now somehow when it comes to the giant corporation they completely become Mitt Romney conservative right then and then the corporations are people to your mind boggling so I always use that phrase so it can kind of trigger something and they did get through some of the smarter ones that this isn't exactly who you're his purported to hate\nThat they also have Citizens United and they've got no less than three political action committees spending millions and millions of dollars trying to stop cabinet and you don't get into that the second if we if we have a moment it's Michael Malice go and get his book beer reader the unauthorized biography of Kim Jong il\nYou stop the nuclear testing area hasn't done any in a long time ... sent back some remains were fallen soldier something that we couldn't get done for sixty years old and he's still go shooting possibly demilitarized in the DMZ with South Korea um what has he done I mean what can the corporate media of electricity mediocre left\nIn this country what can they point to as a failure here\nI mean 'cause it's active isn't it I mean you don't just undo sixty years overnight to you\nWell I I mean there's a lot more for him to ... that is the big one to do and I think if that happens if we have the closer the concentration camps then it's going to be a very very hard to well then it\n... it would because the moon jail I don't even care you know what I mean if we're talking about liberating hundred thousand people who are prisoners and Trump doesn't get credit Alaskans\nSanctioned in a bad enough in is the relationship with us important enough to him to do that will he left these two hundred thousand people go\nThe problem is when you let them go and you take the gun away from the hostages head then your hold on power because precarious so it's kind of very hard for him to liberate because then he is going to be\nAnd all of those other dogs in this you know your accuracy are going to have a lot to answer for for the population so tricky position\nGiven that he had like some kind of weird epiphany and the best of intentions or you know hit back would be in that case just like Saddam would be up against the law\nIs his objective right now Michael only to survive in power\nWe don't know it really ... he's clearly making all the right side of the moon is Hassan pale in his talks with President Trump he's not the same person his father who was very much a function of the Cold War you are so so there is hope there at the same time you know he's been raised for this and he was a kid\nAnd he had that whole establishing behind them pushing him to hold the course so we don't know what this man is thinking and he's a very young person too so that also kind of add that to the calculus\nIt's Michael ... author of dear reader the unauthorized biography of Kim Jong il also my favorite an artist so so let's talk about having a little bit about\nYour your your top ... for me watching but Kavanaugh hearings and and watching the ridiculous kabuki theater that Spartacus was I called and wrote because now because he was admitted ownership TV groped of a growing
