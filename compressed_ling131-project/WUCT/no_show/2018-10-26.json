fourth November fourth what does it mean why is everybody should have died it why the concert All right we welcome Catherine ... power\nThe limits on cash family fellow at the Washington Institute for Near East policy former treasury official K. to very good evening to Malcolm in I've been arguing\nYou know because we are getting in your presence between break in the break about what we're going to start with I Want to start with a swift Malcolm go read All right but but doing what he is swift and why is it part of this\nUh sanctions on November fourth that everybody's pointing to good evening to you\nFor pleasure to be with you I'm so swift it a financial messaging um it is I like to kind of explained that it it's like an email\nUm it just carries a message from one thing to another state the predominant way in which banks send financial messages and financial messaging services\nAre one of the activities at the origin of financial messaging ferrets his tour on it's one of the activities that will become sanctioned up all at the end of this wind down period that we're in right now\nAnd November fourth so as a November said that he thinks shovel activity\nSo ... are there alternatives ... outside of the switch swift which you can use to force the zero important policy than\n[laughter] so so I should take a step back and look at the last round of sanctions um I Know the last round of sanctions west um get cut off a number of Iranian banks and so that's what the U.S is seeking to see again at least in part\nA what we saw then what's that there are other ways to send messages and in fact a without the underlying relationships between banks that messaging services don't mean very much so if you think of the email analogy I could send you an email um but if you don't know me or don't want to have a relation\nNot the way in which funds or move to just the way in which messages they're sent\n'em if you look at when the sanctions relief was put in place is another good way to consider it\nSo a lot of of of people thought that when Iran was given access again to the Swiss platform that it would be like turning on a switch and all of a sudden Iranian banks it'd be reconnected to the international financial system but of course that we didn't see that\nA lot of things were were wary to reconnect with Iran or for a variety of reasons that were uh in some way it's related to sanctions overhang but it related to all kinds of other concerns in dealing dealing with Iran\nAnd so does underlying relationships didn't necessarily materialize\nWhat we've seen since the U.S withdraw from the uh the Iran deal and may is that even those banks that did re engage most of them have had since withdrawn those relationships are so it doesn't it doesn't necessarily matter as much it's not a silver bullet\nUm if the banks won't uh aren't willing to do that the business anyway\nAnd I think that that actually the announcement that this special purpose vehicle that the Europeans have have said they're going to put in place um to try to maintain a financial linkage with Iran when the sanctions that reimpose\nIs kind of an individual indication and acknowledgement um those banks with or without swift aren't going to do it and they're trying to find an alternative even though it's essentially a barter system that they're proposing\nAnd not likely be very effective given the past records but I wanted to ask you a two things one we know that Iran will look for ways to evade any kind of restrictions\nSo we see it now on the world where they're they're trying to disable do tracking system oldest fleet so you don't see the destinations volumes and it wasn't swift also means for us to track\nThe money flowing unit in Iran so due to raise a concern that we are going to lose that information you know valuable information for tracking the Iranians ... is in real terms of the means to do so\n[noise] so uh first I think that that some of the the the conversation around losing access to to to tracking Iranian activity is it's a little bit of a a\nA Garbo and there's there's two things that are apples and oranges there's a program called the terror finance tracking um\nI'm Sorry to hear that the terrified of tracking program that uh that the Treasury Department and ministers and has since uh shortly after nine eleven um through which they receive a information from swift under subpoena that can be searched to look for terrorist financing activity\nUm and that's that's a separate kind of program ah\nThis this with and that continued when a Iran was taken off of swift previously under the previous round of sanctions um so I think that those are two issues that are getting mixed but but on the issue of Iranian beige and of course first of all there's other ways that they can send these messages and that they did last time whether it's by facts or email\nOr any way just to to signal that they want to move funds from here to their\nBanks that are willing to take the sanctions risk of dealing with Iran um you know after November fifth are probably going to do so regardless of whether or not Iran is on the space program I'm just as you go ahead\nDon't know I I I don't want us to run out of time and we did not ask about the efficacy of the sanctions so far\n... she was she did address that in the in your opening about the first round I mean we we try to keep track of the companies that have pulled out we tried to report because people don't know would you judge Jeffrey ... the first round of sanctions successful and really impacting the target you\nKnow I think that's a really important question and we as we approach November fed because I've I think one of the thing to remember is that\nA wind down but what that meant is that businesses at that period to pick up any business that had been allowed on it they were doing\nAnd that a lot of firms acted very quickly after the announcement and and ... and so I'm In terms of of assessing the Africa yet but I Will keep already seen a lot of pressure um that that's going to be brought to bear through that first\nYou know the sanctions that was back replace um August sex you've talked before then just that you're going you know we've probably seen a lot at the end\nUm that we're going to the ads that November ah because it's activities should have a party and in fact\nBecause they said yes social snapback within the words are written into the Jaycee Pierre way perhaps not curriculum and that's the way a long term that that that what

to be doing as we enter that last quarter of the year uh starting off with Halloween and extending into Thanksgiving into on to the end of the year ... tribute go joins is\nHe is a travel expert or vacation amusement parks and the like a licensed private pilot journalist and author and the here to offer some thoughts tonight Pete thank you for being with us oh\nThanks for having me out I always a pleasure being on your show Jim\nWell I appreciate that you by the way the author of America's top roller coasters and amusement parks that goes back some nine years and uh [noise]\nUh looking at the edge just first of all the Halloween aspect of it all of their are thrill rides that are out there and I want to start at a kind of I guess a philosophical point of view\nWhat is our obsession\nWith scaring ourselves I have never particularly understood that I'm not for example one who throws up on a on a roller coaster I just don't tend to go on them a haunted houses or\nDon't send me a running home to suck my thumb and hide under the covers I just don't particularly enjoy it I had been frightened didn't particularly enjoy the experience\nAnd ah I've been frightened for for good reasons for bad I've been frightened in movies and I've been frightened in Vietnam and its bears part of life\nBut I'm not going to pay somebody money to do it to me\nCan you explain this to me\nWell you know you can ask ten people are basically anywhere anytime and they'll give you ten different reasons why they like roller coasters are\nThey you know the old adage of a you know when whenever you feel threatened you either fight or you you fly you go away and then basically the people that love rollercoaster that people that liked to fight that like it to experience something different that as a a straight a pilot myself\nYou know do their bags on his lied everything off for me it it is it the rush that you get when you're simulating a you know aviation low because you know our ... our roles that men and so on down the line that intrigues me others just like to forget about their problems\nAnd you know you're probably pretty small when you're doing five gee a hundred and twenty miles an hour and some of these top new rollercoaster so that's another thing that does is it there are many reasons to overcome that sometimes you just want to have the confidence that you can do something like that walk away and say okay well that was great and you know I got a little more confidence in myself in my abilities\nGold is a better way gold is a better way gold is

sure that our gifts to pay tribute go knows what it is I don't remember it was very brief I remember that I mean that that it felt like it lasted about one second [laughter] do you do you know what ride that was\nYes I Do actually is one of the first rides I actually was on it it also had a little bit of a what we call a corkscrew\nWhich pays yeah he's just gave you exactly on that that was a ... I think it was called the ... or something along those lines and was very short it only had that one little law that one that one little area but\nYes I'm very familiar with it and are are in today's standards it probably like a kitty ride but back then it was a it was pretty good and and of course Opry land was a great place to attach to put an amusement park right next to the ... hotel and the and the grand old Opry\nAnd I have to admit it was a how shall I put an exhilarating\nUh I mostly do it definitely woke me up by our member that that uh we had been quite busy we're doing my show from a from Opry land and and the couple of our staffers are over there with me and uh I guess you could say that I was a little bit tired at this point and and uh\nHe woke me up Yes sir [laughter] there'd be no doubt about that [laughter] certainly did [laughter]\n[laughter] it was actually called the ... cannon ball of fire is if I ...\nOh yeah that uh well anyway I'll put it this way it did lead me say this is awful just be saying well\nIt was okay and since you know as a as a gift to the park I got to ride for free okay that's fine but I paid to do it again ... no not really but then again of course that's that's just me what are some of the places out there when you think Halloween and thrill rides\nPete tribute go what places do you think about\nThere's some great ones out there that started I actually uh uh in I'm In law actually started a I guess it was around September late September and go all the way until Halloween some of the places that comes in light of course the universal studios\nAll went to their hallowed horror nights at universal studios and that's all based on a you know pretty much a American horror story the walking dead the shining great place to go a pretty scary now if you want to go the reverse and\nSo a place where he didn't have to be totally scared and and ah you know they they do some good shows but it's a great place to go with the kids of course you've got Disney World and Disneyland that have the Mickey not so scary Halloween a I guess a park and\nOff for the kids and of course you got the booty you a Halloween parade and of course the fireworks to happy hollow wishes or over the other thing uh some of the better ones are as we just mentioned to that of course Six Flags and all the Six Flags locations had the ...\nWhich is your cleric classic scare zone all you know where you go into these mazes and stuff like uh the ... the the sewer soles in a which is layer and places like that um and of course the the point has got hollow ah weekends\nOr with the great pumpkin or fast that that goes on their ... zombie high school shows the entertainment is absolutely amazing my daughter actually had to audition for one of these shows at Six Flags and are they really are they really get into this big time uh I mean even the chain stores\nSound extremely we'll plus they changed the names of the rides sometimes\nAre for example over its heroines or which is a heroines in Charlotte North Carolina or they've got an actual weight street uh where you can go through the cobblestones of the street and of course demented scare crows and zombies and and um\nYou know Dr Jekyll and Mr hyde or be be found there as as well as a you know a bunch of other characters are\nFrom a lot of the novel is a great place to go so there there's a whole bunch of places that I Would say there's about maybe two or three dozen or that actually do this and now they're just a you know the ride just still open the weather's fairly decent and people have fun\nLet's talk about the term age appropriate over how many of these are places you wouldn't you wouldn't take your kid even if your kid loves the scary rides\nWell the good thing about all these places where they're at universal studios knots berry farm which is in a ... that's ... basically Anaheim all we mentioned to the ... lights over Kenny would a hell of a screaming Williamsburg Tampa Busch Gardens\nAre and of course ... and he's not so scary Halloween all these places that we've mentioned plus others\nUm during the day you know during the day it really is it like that\nIt all happens pretty much when the sun goes down and ... awake and that's pretty much uh most of these places with you you have kids in there and they're pretty frightened\nYou probably don't want to go at night to these amusement parks but if you do there were scare zone their actual zones where you'll you'll be scared and and there'll be people that will jump out of corners and of course the mazes and and and all the different things that go on the actual entertainment themselves in the places that are non scare zones\nAre are very family friendly\nAnd very age appropriate so uh and and of course they they normally will uh will tell you it it it is easily mark where these places are where you can bring your kids even at night or just to see the shows are we just have a good time on the rise and not have to worry about\nYou know paint totally you know scared or or having a ... I Can't have a traumatic experience with that\nPut it another way that the lawyers have made sure that none of these places are going to subject your kids do something that might make mommy and daddy call a lawyer [noise]\nAbsolutely I mean at the uh the people that are here you know and again my daughter actually did this for several years she loved it and she had a fun time\nWhile going through college and and I'm a there are rules and regulations that they follow you don't normally if you're an older person you know they're probably not going to\nTry to scare you as if maybe or a teenage gal ah or something along those lines though you know there are different marks and different people that they'll they'll actually go and give the full one hundred percent presentation and others\nThey know when to back down and do they know if if if they scared you\nThat probably the leave you alone if if if it's really really bothering you and again that's all part of the training program one of the reasons why I I liked the keys amusement parks in what they do and how they train people in order to make sure that it is a very good experience for for many\nUh and again there are there are there scares owned and there are ... owns a you know if you only need a scare zone then you know something is going to happen\nOr not I don't want to back him to take a look at that in greater detail in just a moment\nIraqi Michael nonprofit Christian organization partnering with local grocery store and my people and volunteers to these kids while they're on the phone rang we came here and they the negative impacts of hunger and empower it how to get them at all I Would you miss my bond there\nWhy would your family like the ... now you'd like to be a part and the ministry messages on faith that\nHe did it would be great and this is where the camera on top and care\nMy name is dawn Randolph I'm an independent financial advisor in L.

Bosch animal that you rode over a um I guess as to be at least\nThirty years ago in order to do that or you know from now to hear um you know people that love to ride roller coasters or or or get you know that that that Russia or whatever you want to call it um they want will of course they're going to go higher they want to go faster and the manufacturers have a real problem because\nYou want to keep your riders conscious during the entire ride on somebody can so\nThat you really have to to walk the line and of course with computer technology now it's actually a lot better you know how many how much the port so how many G forces body can take\nNot a pilot somebody who's experienced in trained to do that and in good physical shape so that's the big key is\nTo be able to make it stimulating exciting at the same time but not a you know have any problems or have any negative effects that are that occur that's wise simulation rides are actually very big these days\nBut what I mean by that is the track never actually really moves what happens is is you actually have you with a three D. or or D glasses or you actually sit in in a compartment\nYou know or some other situation where now all of a sudden that ride that normally only goes twenty or thirty miles an hour it goes up and down maybe a little bit is now more intense or so that seems to be another way that they're revamping some of the old rides or to make them a lot more interesting\nHere's a call from Rita in Dallas on the jumbo have showed one eight six six five oh Jim bow and our guest beat tribute go Hi Rita\nHi I just wanted to share something with you or we're now in the last week of the great mental state fair of Texas and my daughter took her four year old grandson to the affair and she told me that our state fair now has\nAn information desk where they put a bracelet on the child\nWhich the child can I take off with the child's name and the parents' phone number and it's on the inside the bracelet so that someone could not come up and pretend they know that child and say Oh hi Tammy because of the names on the inside but if a child gets lost\nThen it's easy to find their parent company then\nThat's an interesting thought utterly of to say the least uh an encouraging one ... safety in general a tribute goes that some people it's practiced and all of these are major theme parks and ah and scary rides\nYes it absolutely has to be because of course the the life blood of any amusement park is directly proportional to the amount of accidents incidence of problems that occurred at a particular place or again you very rarely hear of a roller coaster incident and when it does happen\nIt'll be on CNN or MSNBC or Fox News or one of the major networks because it becomes a big news kind of like a plane crash\nSo it doesn't happen very often security has been a stepped up especially at places like ah you know it's a Six Flags or Disney Busch Gardens are Cedar Fair or they do that on purpose because obviously we want them to everybody wants to have a a good outcome now the the carnivals and the fares that the state fairs\nAre starting to come on board with the same\nAh security and and technology with the blade bracelets and so on down the line which is a very very good thing to have because these days you never know what's going to happen and you know we always tell people\nThat don't always go and pears always tell the parents where you're going to be in more most importantly don't go alone especially on on your age or you shouldn't be doing that but if that does happen there are a lot of security or devices that that are at these parks or that can help you find the last one\nBecause if you go and do continue the discussion about some of the great ways to

duck and the legislature was being a was starting to a pale\nUh at the demands of the king fish the emperor of Louisiana all of the things that he told them to do there was they were starting to have

we're coming up on the election obviously it's timed for that\nSo\nWhat I've been seeing and I'm sure you have to his people\nUm well\nWhat they do on on cable news of the interview all the political hardcore political people and the hard core political people are all ...\nThey blame the other side I'm telling you it's it's ... he's at fault for this no he's a fault for this\n... the ... the the plastic is John Brennan of all the people John Brennan I'm I Know he was a big deal and head of the CIA and all that sort of stuff but I don't think he's very bright 'cause he says some of the dumbest things I've ever heard\nAnd sure enough after all this came out yesterday John Brennan says Trump still blame for the current political climate\nDonald Trump too often has helped to incite a some of these feelings of anger and violence is what unfortunately a lot of ... a lot of individual do\nYeah so he does the same thing and of course it's immediately this is where we are blame the other side but he's I mean he has criticized Donald Trump\nOr in every way he possibly can and so for the Trump stirs they get all upset and very mad about everything else and that brings up the question should John Brennan have the right to express his beliefs his were his feelings\nAnd this is this is where this whole story's going for me is when we first of all we need to catch this person because there's something very wrong with this person sending out these bombs but secondly is so\nJohn Brennan says nasty things about Donald Trump\nDoesn't he have the first amendment right to say what he feels about Donald Trump I thought that in this country we can basically call our leaders whatever we want to call them and nothing will happen to us\nAnd doesn't Donald Trump have the have the right under this is a citizen under the first amendment\nTo call people whatever he wants to call them\nSo we're going to get into a First Amendment squabble I think about all of this but they're all coming out saying the other person's responsible I'm at the rally last night and Wisconsin President Trump says whoever's responsible will see consequences\nMy highest duty as you know as president is to keep America safe and they actually threats of political violence heart attack on our democracy itself\nYep but people are criticizing him for not saying whatever they wanted him to say ... and I go back to okay so if if you're if\nYou can criticize them you can call him names you could do just about anything you want other than threatened\n\nFred burden or we're strapped for the big defense group said this type of bomb or may shipped his tactics because of the media's reaction\nWhile I'm not surprised bill a with a cluster bomb or a they they tend to put together several I did the male amount a next we'll be uh for me from a demo perspective is predicated upon the news coverage now will the bomb maker shifted tactics similar to what we saw was the Austin bomber\nMeaning he's watching he's waiting he's trying to see what's going to be the reaction and if he has more I days but he constructed who's going to be next on the target list\nYeah and the the Austin bombers is a very interesting case because of the back back in March or for a march second to march twentieth he terrorized the town in the city of Boston by package bombs exploded killing two people injuring another five\nUh the\nGuy who was doing it twenty three year old mark Condit blew himself up in his vehicle as the police were closing in on them\nSo see he ... every bomb he made worked every one of them\nBack to Fred burden from strap or he says it's important to remember none of these bombs had gone off\nWell I think they'll the significant part of the that aspect is that uh the bomb maker ... then it might be different than the person who's delivering it let's let's keep that in mind or the focus here might be nothing more than panic and share terror versus actual harm\nSo by now the FBI and ATF or know exactly what the bomb is a I Would not be surprised to see some aggressive or investigative development you know my\nOr so or the motives might be simply what we're seeing unfold right now\nAnd we'll be right back\nNew sauce [noise] Ninety four point one of\nAll eight point six million New Yorkers as they have handled the situation with a real sense of resolve a they're not going to let an act of

their values undermined or the way of life undermined New Yorkers are standing strong right now\nIn the last thing I Want to say is you know it in a moment like this there's a lot of concern there's a lot of fear\nA clearly it's upsetting time it's a time when there's been too much hatred and too much division in the air\nAnd in that context people can feel powerless I Want to remind people that everyone has an opportunity to play a positive and constructive role here\nUh first of all helping law enforcement this is something that everyone can do if you have any information at all that you think could help law enforcement to address the situation and share it with law enforcement immediately\nOr let them be the judges of the value of the information don't hold back\nAre so many times and I agree with the commissioner law enforcement that ultimately has proven they will find the perpetrators but so many times it's because\nUh an individual citizen step forward with information that really led to the key breakthrough you have information\nShare it if you're concerned about uh packages that could arrive at your home or your workplace you see something that worries you reach out to the police get their involvement to address the situation\nPeople can be part of solving this immediate challenge but finally we all can be a part of solving the bigger situation that we're facing as a society as a nation of tone is civility a tone of mutual respect as something we all can create\nWe shouldn't just ask what are the most prominent voice is doing we also have to ask question are all of us\nTreating each other with respect treating men and women the law enforced will respect people in the media report the news treating them with respect this is something that we all have to do as

see anybody suffer but why are they forced to leave these countries when if ever since the government\nThe United nations all these agencies\nGoing to address the symptoms why why did they feel so bad so scared that they have to leave these countries that are trying to tell me that these gangs are so powerful they are powerful than\nThan armed army yes yes they can call that a problem I don't think no I think that you already that would rather stay home I think you they will Rogers I think you rushed\nBy that point yes the gangs have taken control the mob the mafia\nWe're the government leaders\nI really believe that and that is why it's the violence is there the corruption is there the payoffs are there so the question then ... and I agree with your with your sympathies but then how do what do you how do you do something to help\nBecause if you go in if you send money to that country you know that money's not going to get near any of these people it's going to go into the pockets of the of the of the leaders and the gang leaders so the other side of it is do you what do you do you interfere\nWith the CIA somehow in their government and I think that's\nWhat we've done in the past I don't know if we're doing that right now\nBut you take a look at look at Mexico right next door to was they seem very bartering compared to Honduras for some of the Central American countries\nBut look at who runs the how the government of of of Mexico they're corrupt to why because the drug cartels are so so powerful money wise and armament so I that's how you change that\nI don't know but I think that's what the CIA tries to do because we can't do it by giving them money\nWell I I agree with you have what you know we have all these people and the government the United nations you know we tried to straighten out the problem in Somalia and and as far as the media goes you know they like to go and they\nLike to get the you know a sympathetic stories and everything why don't they just\nStrive reporting asking questions on the scene there amongst those people you know\nWhat they say can be done to improve their country yeah you know give them a choice yeah stead of just you know\nAnd solve blame America as all our falls and and part of it is because we have\nHardly any leadership look what's going on here it's what's happening here is the main focus in our government is get elected I mean everything else is secondary although\nNow that it's about their power yes\nSo they're ... they're corrupt there were up in that way they're corrupt in that way as well and the other party by may it's not as politeness you'll see in Central American country but how many politicians are not wealthy people when they go into public office and they come out multimillionaires how does that happens\nI might have been asking this for for years now Senator Feinstein polo see the two most liberal you know do\nThey make a hundred and forty seven thousand near the poles worse over a hundred million I Do that without being corrupt yeah they have this\nThis facade that they're so caring for its its reminds me of that old song smiling faces you know they smile in your face and stabbed in the back I mean is that we're bell\nSo politicians are that way\nWe recognize it we ... we kind of ignore them because we we realize that's who they are and we don't like it but\nWe've got busy lives we want to do something else it's just it's just more blatant it's time tens of on steroids when you go into the into Mexico or Central America and the the drug gangs do

it's it's hard it's hard they're getting in because they have the money and the host governments unfortunately bend the people that have money so opposed to you know people that do so\nWell what's

it scary to think about any suspicious packages showing up anywhere but there's been so many layers of this story and eat an instant blame on rhetoric and politics and not having a lot of facts in something that\nAt least people are talking about in this neck of the way you know we we really have no information about the suspect or the motivation we\nOnly know that the target since so hearing that had my is really promising to me as a journalist because I really want more information who is this person I Would think that we really looked at it smarter news if they've gone back and looked at well\nWho else has sent suspicious packages over the last year and I'm sure you're aware of that person back in March that show that ... that doesn't packages out she never wanted them to to the

turns out that the likelihood is this person's mentally ill not necessarily a political operative\nAnd so I'm really curious about finding out more information you still rightly pointed out we don't know if this is the person or someone connected to it but what the deal here I think we really need a lot of information to quiet some of the extra conversation that's happening without a lot of facts\nYeah right now it's more news is as limit your a site um and you can get at smarter news so you also are put together under the new sources in a new guys news items or a bowl of all including

themselves\nI mean that's something that we always want to look at it in the news you know how sophisticated are these packages who who could influence the packages are these days as you know so

question for me that how you doing makes a huge difference potentially to how I answer the question\nThey may help in the long run I was just curious about the question concerned about taking Social Security is a sixty two\nAnd possibly investing that whole mail as opposed to waiting for the higher amount a later age I feel like with the right of investment you probably wouldn't be doing better off than waiting tools a sixty six and four months\nSo it seems like a whole chunk of change\nAnd the government and all and you could probably be doing something with it yourself\nStunner is at what investments earned today what savings earn today it is nearly impossible\nFor someone to take early Social Security invest that money and out or in what the and Putin advantages to you waiting those extra for years to take your Social Security the reason is is it every year you wait\nYou get a Social Security check roughly eight percent larger and then as the cost of living adjustments occur\nYour cost of living adjustment his base for the rest of your life on a higher initial him out so and also there was no taxi are going to do for a while\nEarly investing the money and then if you do well investing you then have to pay tax on the money you earned investing so there are a lot of inherent advantages to wait\nAnd the most common age people take Social Security is what you're new to laying right now at age sixty to write my advice is when you've got to have the money\nIs when you take it and in my case you know what age I'm going to take it\nToo late\nAge Seventy that's the last time you can take it and get all that build up of the eight percent frogs me extra each year\nRight and so I'm going to a hold out till the last minute so that I can end up with a much larger

can you just want to know what deals there are [noise]\nSo let's talk about you ripping yourself off there's a new study that's been published by the oil rig a consulting outfit and they found that people doing four O. one K. loans\nDecimate your future financial security and retirement\nIt's very common that employers will make it super easy for you to do a loan from their four one K. plan\nAnd the philosophy of employers historically has been hey if we locked down our four one K. and people know they can't touch the money under basically any circumstances\nWhen they're going to be afraid to contribute enough money to save for retirement\nBut the reality is a lot of people do take loans out from four one K.\nAnd depending on whose survey data you believe it's a very very common thing for people to do four one K. loans and typically somewhere twenty twenty five percent of people will do four one\nK. loans but the thing is when you do that those loans dramatically reduce how much money you have down the road and in fact you may find that\nYou will have to do away your retirement years down the road that you'll have to work any of a number of additional years to make up for the last earnings from that four one K. loan\nThat's even when you pay the loans back and you may wonder how could that be\nWell there's a two for here when you borrow from a four O. one K. you have to pay back the plan right\nAnd so while that money is not invested in most Sears Holdings and for one case go up so you lose the up escalator on that money that you borrowed\nAt the same time you usually will reduce what you contribute to a four one K. moving forward\nBecause you're having to pay so much money back to the plan to pay that loan back\nSo you don't have the cash flow to both pay back the loan and contribute so then think about what's happened you got money that's not invested for the time period it takes to pay it back\nAnd you're investing less moving forward\nThat's that's the story\nOK I Would tell you don't even think about getting involved in that because that is there is no true product or service is being sold\nHere but it's just speculation that at some point people will be able to use these electronic coins and that sounds to me like that could very dangerously end up being\nAn illegal pyramid an illegal game of chance so\nUnless you are somebody who really love

rise\nThat doctors are totally opposed and look at it as competition but that's idiotic and ridiculous and self serving because doctors aren't willing to practice in rural in poor areas almost nine are\nAnd that's why we need to use the enormous brain power\nExperience and education and training of physicians assistants and nurse practitioners to dramatically improve access to health care and the United states it extremely low cost\nRosa is with us on the Clark Howard show hello Rosa\nHi how are you great thank you Rosa how can I be of service to you\nI have a question about with our mortgages ah my brother and I inherited a two family house in the Boston area completely paid off I think I've had paid it off the ... maybe ten years ago at least ... entertaining the idea of very facts mortgage as part of our retirement plan and we just monitor opinion on that\nThat is a fascinating scenario that no one has ever asked me so I entirely a reverse mortgage the eligibility begins at age sixty two are sixty five or ... you and your brother in that category yet\nNo he he'll be sixty two in about seven years but I only be fifty five\nOkay so you've got some time before this is a potential viable option for white but under under the lending guidelines having a duplex where you have ten minutes and one side\nAnd the two of you and the other or do you each take one side of the duplex\nNow he lives in the downstairs apartment I Lived in the upstairs oh there's no a tall right at all\nSo I Would I Would suspect and again it would depend on the lending guidelines that would be in effect a seven years from now that may work\nAnd the thing though with the reverse mortgages is that I always look at them as a last option not a middle one or a first one\nAnd the reason is and again this is under today's rules but the way that you and your brother would have to pay our gigantic to originate or reverse mortgage the fees are astronomical compared to a traditional alone\nSo it is an option that you look at when you have a lack of other options to provide income that each of you would need to live monthly\nRight so okay\nIt's too soon in your life spans to be looking at this and you know it's going to completely depend on how the rules play out and you and your brother under today's rules we both have to go to financial counseling\nUh-huh to make sure that this is an appropriate step and strategy for you and then you'd be able if the rules again permit to take out the reverse mortgage which essentially sends you a check every month instead of the more mortgage company receiving a check from you each month\nRight okay so the principal source for the loans is through the federal government\nThey have their underwriting standards and guy\nOther or not you would qualify again at that time what is it that's making you and your brother thing to reverse mortgage at a point that you're pretty far from normal retirement age\n[noise] um well when neither one of us had children and when we don't have spouses and I'm going to be honest with you I'd rather enjoying life before I you know I'm wearing content I mean I Want to travel now I don't want to wait until I'm In setting a date you know what I mean and just really interesting\nAnd I'll tell you the alternative is to do a home equity line of credit\nOkay\nHome equity line of credit would be much cheaper to set up and we'd have more flexibility you don't have to worry about the federal rules or you can do that now you don't have to wait\nTill he's sixty two\nAnd you would have to service the interest on it for typically a ten year period and then after ten years that's when principle that you would have borrowed we'd have to start being paid back but it's much more efficient way to access money\nThan to do so through a reverse mortgage\nRight I mean it's not something my thinking about her you know like I said I'd had maybe seven to ten years okay within that timeframe yeah\nYeah so again at that time depending on your financial circumstances it still might be a better idea to do a home equity line of credit than it would be to do a reverse mortgage\nTravis is with us on the Clark Howard show hello Travis high court say you want to build up some money for yourself and there's something you're intrigued by what is that\nThe ache or is that I see it on a online or download it use it for about two years now and I just kind of want to know how you felt about it\nI Love a corns new deal\nYeah it's a great idea it's a way of you in little teeny chunk of money you start building up investment dollars and it does it explain how it's worked for you over this time to your fellow listener so let me explain else you explain it\nOkay um what I liked purchases at the gas station a store or wherever it all round juniors dollar so and change and then put it put it into I guess the stock market\nAnd I don't notice it it's not like me going and investing the money myself I just don't even notice it coming out of like how it's a giant tons\nSo it's it's like saving without even on you're doing it\nAnd the fees were you doing it I think there are twelve year twelve dollars a year she I think so I think it's a dollar in laws\nYeah so it's a great opportunity if you feel like there's never any spare money to save and invest your future so great way for you to get it done\nYeah uh what I was ... ... is there any better or right now it says I'm putting about eighty two hundred dollars give or take each log into it and I didn't know if I should stop doing that and putting that money into something else\nWell if it's happening automatically and it's painless and you're not noticing it and you're building up nearly a thousand dollars a year doing it that's a great start\nOkay\nSo I have no problem with you doing that if you felt like you've reached a point that you're ready to write a check every month or two an automatic deposit into something I'd love

I'm not exactly sure what the best thing to be I think I'm not the beneficiary combat it or how to handle it\nMhm okay so he took the shot when your husband was a child yeah\nThis is not a term policy it's a whole life life insurance policy\nAnd then click on the dollar\nWow they should be canceled okay\n[laughter] that's a whole life insurance policy about ... million dollars is a very expensive\nRight yeah yeah and like I Know that you know I found out the beneficiary I mean he's a great guy I'm not worried about you know that it's\nI don't I don't care as a good guy doesn't matter if it's a good guy that's it's it's really weird that it's continued to have the parents are the beneficiary and this is a grown man with family of four with four kids\nYeah there is a very like going on you know wild blind but\nIt's strange yeah long you been married for a long you been married five years you know and then five years they've not address this issue that strength the strength you know really I mean they should you should\nAddress the issue that they should not be the beneficiaries anymore you should be and really the policy ought to just be canceled\nBecause I Would I Would not want to pick up the ... I Would not want to pick up the premiums on the half a million dollar policy on there's a whole lot policy because it's new twenty times more expensive than term to create an investment inside of it called the cash value that has a poor rate of return that when you die they keep your money\nSo that whole life insurance is a horrible financial product\n[laughter] and so if you just called me up and you just owned a half a million dollars a whole life I Would say cancel it as soon as you got your term in ...\nBut you're not paying for it today anyway so today you get your term insurance in places proper on you and your husband and I think your husband should have a discussion with his dad and said that uh I'm going to go ahead and suggest you drop that policy now\nI Will not be taking over I Do not want it and I don't think you ought to continue with the expense of it I think you ought to drop it\nRight yeah that's right I don't want anything to pay that kind of thing I Do not me then it cuts that you have only take it\nWell it's not only nah needed because we're not going to take it over and that was the original plan plan has now changed yep 'cause you need to make decisions as an adult isn't that amazing Steve is with us in Carlsbad, California Hi Steve how are you\nDavid how are you today better than I deserve what's up\nI'm I'm a question regarding up part of my retirement savings comes as a thing called a pinch him from my company and that overall is about eight percent of my total as sad or\n... or ...\nWell it's I mean a person it's projected to be a at a project that retirement save five two hundred and eighty four thousand dollars and that is that would be ... percent of my total assets you know and\nAnd my question is whether good or bad as a lump sum yes or ... okay\nHere's why okay if you die or not we if you die when you die [laughter] 'cause we're all going to die or get when you die a that money's gone\n'cause it's a pinch of it and you get ... and you if you have a survivor benefit or something there it may it may go to your spouse for a while but when your spouse you and your spouse die even if there's a survivor benefits the money's gone it's gone\nIowa or as long as you live it's going to pay at a rate of about five percent in this current market\nSo it's as if you had an account and the investment advisor said Okay Steve\nWe got an account for you over here two hundred Ninety five thousand you can invest it you can make five percent on your money and when you die the money's gone\nFor you can take that two hundred Ninety five thousand you can roll into some mutual funds in a good IRA roll over and mutual funds will perform better than five percent and when you die the money stays with your family\nWell that'd be a better deal right\nYes I did [laughter] that's what I was thinking yeah versus a hundred percent joint and survivor annuity but uh\nIt's still love your job and you know you got survivorship on it but when both of you down the same concept applies so the ... the bottom line is it's got a decent\nBut low rate of return while you live but the fact that you lose all the money when the two of you die\nMakes this a bad deal and so you always take pension lumps on are almost always type engine lumps arms enroll them to IRAs and invest them and good gross like mutual fund so it sounds like your network cynics us from a million\nA yeah it's a closer to cause that that's probably about four oh well in their total total network to assets house and so forth\nYou know well ... congratulations [laughter] how old are you I'm sixty three white ago how much of this did you inherit\n[noise] um probably somewhere in a hurry to four hundred range from both my\nUm my family and my wife's family\nWhere are you a millionaire or that ... before that happened\nOr a millionaire\nBefore my wife's mother passed away yes uh when my mom my my parents were eligible young at that point in time not a millionaire no\nSo would you say that you have a four million dollar net worth because of inheritance or because of your savings patterns\nAre shutting patterns or because of the amount of heritage is is maybe ten percent maybe ... percent\nInside his home lowest irrelevant yeah OK cool as I'm ... I'm always researching and asking millionaires how they did it for the benefit of our listeners because I got a twenty four year old listening right now that's got the opportunity of hearing from an actual sixty four year old person who actually has a four million dollar net worth what would you tell by twenty four year old how how should they be you when they grow up\n[laughter] [laughter]\nWell

them the first to the we were see where the devices that were sent to former President Obama\nA and the D.C package that was sent a congresswoman waters and so the analysis began on that ah I think yesterday and we were\nStarting to receive information over the course of the last twenty four thirty six hours so it was\nYesterday I run a Jack of all our\nAnd a three year old fashioned\nDescribe your reactions to when you\nCan also could you give us a fifth of wind\n[noise]\nFor the\nSaw the first part of my reaction to hearing that we had a possible match\nA just validated my unbelievable faith and confidence in the mental image of law enforcement and in particular of the FBI lab there's a reason why the FBI's lab is known as one of the very best in the world and the folks who worked there are extraordinary and once I knew that they had a print\nI was pretty confident that we'd be able to find the right person as far as the the devices themselves a it's important to say as as is in the complaint\nOr that even at the devices and we're still trying to determine whether or not uh they were functional as they say is what we're doing all kinds of analysis on that to make a definitive determination but they did contain\nEnergetic material or which if subjected to the right combination of heat for shock of friction or could be dangerous to the public and the public should treat any device like that\nAccording to how could you tell us plainly was targeting\n[noise]\nI don't know and then uh what you might uh normally expect a I'm a I'm a part it appears to be a partisan but that would be a determined by the facts\nAs the case goes forward and I'm not able to comment on that easy cooperating [noise]\nWe're not going to be this hasn't ... stands at this um\n[noise] carrying on what\nGiving you more ... more focus\nFound it and I ... I have a chronic illness and I still work full time and I am not letting it take over my life\nIs good and my question is is how do I I check 'em for like a doctor ball it recently I recently switched off clients that I got started again I'm\nAlso the chronic unless you're going to hit the adoptable every year\nRight I'm\nThinking God if nothing on because it it it's not it okayed and not life threatening are you going to double\nEvery year now okay ... what what is the nature of this what was the nature of the illness\nI mean I don't want to go into detail that guy is a pain condition and the doctors are unsure of work I'm I'm okay God and so if it was over there but I Do is ... I'm sure because it's relatively new got I got I yeah\nWhat I Would do is just try to estimate what you think it's going to cost you a year and the more experienced got to help you that you have with is the better your estimates are badly because once\nYou've ... battle with it for five years you're you're going to kind of know a five year average versus five months you're kind of guessing it what it's going to cost you in a year right right and you just put that in as a budget item so let's just make up a number okay if you're the duck double was six thousand and you're going to run through your six thousand or the duck double every year then that's five hundred bucks a month\nIf it's three thousand dollars a year this is going to cost me out of pocket that's two hundred and fifty a month and I just put a you know\nA a whatever a line in your budget for medical expense home doing chronic medical\nWhen just call your call chronic or whatever just give it a name and the money set aside for that so that every 'cause it's kind of like we know it's going to come up\nAnd leave a little while now someday hopefully you'll find a cure and you know it's not a lifetime of this or something yeah but for now for now you're saying it's predictable\nOr expensive they are going to be up into your future and so ... for the next so many months we need to just be budgeting is if we think we're going to spend X per year divided by twelve in your monthly budget\nI mean my issue is that I'm literally on like penny pinching\nI don't like seeing where I can make that happen so what I've been hearing is I mean I decided starting next month I'm going to kick out fifty dollars that you really I think you're right now on what I I'm I'm hoping overtime on the opposite you know pay out more\nSo why are we got an income problem a debt problem or a spending problem where\nI got an added that problem [laughter] I'm I'm sixty thousand I that I make I don't think a lot on the license social worker and because of my condition actually switched jobs had more flexibility\nOn Sundays fee for service division as opposed to a salary position mhm and I make anywhere from Thirteen hundred kept sixteen hundred ... a paycheck and\nI knew he had ... ... twice a month okay and you said you're living with\nThem I guess I'm I'm living with a roommate I pay nine Seventy five or rent it give us a lot um when I did get some help from family\nIncome in or what is the nature of the debt student loan\nDebt is everything credit card I often because they can hear it I was trying to horrific thing mhm I'm not at all and then it's you know most of it is right in tune it out and it it sounds like a total of six figure out\nOK show for the short term we're going to make sure you take care of the most important things in the food pantry not eating\nNot eating out in your pantry like in your life your lights and water and your rent and your transportation so food shelter clothing and transportation and utilities the eighth grade we used to call that a civics lesson what's in the sense of the necessities are only the debt you've got is not necessities\nYou take care of the debt only after you've taken care of the necessities and then you were just fell out into the debt as you can\nAnd here's the thing you're either going in preparing for these medical expenses or they're going to be new debt\nRight because they are coming you told me that that's why you called yeah yeah yeah\nI mean it's not me declaring it I'm saying like I said I've got ... how do I prepare for it you save uncover it so\nNow that's our short term long term okay we got to get your income up and you're out go down and knock this debt out long term but that has to do with your medical condition and has to do with your career and has to do with a lot of different things that you've got to face\nAnd so um but that's how I Would you begin to look at it get take care of the short term make sure you're taking care of you so that you\nCan you know be\nPrepared to take on the long term which is get your income up but um we got to get past some of the medical stuff and you got to really start looking at this career really hard chop up those credit cards is time for plastic surgery Tucker is with us in Atlanta Georgia Hi Tucker how are you doing well how are you better than I deserve what's

I'm actually I got my license in March and June ... June was my first day in real estate ... I've got to choose the house has sold takes listings and extending clothing bought into uh the second week of November So\nWhat is your projected income for the uh the that six month period of time\nI'm I'm thinking maybe like twenty five thousand\nBy the end of the year and now what does your why didn't make of the one who makes\nFifty a she made a fifty one thousand\nOkay so basically it sounds like in real estate you're going to make as much as you use to make\nYes okay good good news right\nI guess right now what she's worried about is that she's bringing in most of the income because of course it's slow when you first start out I'm only selling to houses that between that long the span 'em and everything if she wants to keep her car because she's saying she's making money to pay her car [noise]\nYou know that's not how it works when we're married that's how it works when your roommates\nYou get to do whatever you want when your roommates but when you're married it's for richer for four and sickness and health and onto the all my worldly goods I pledge is what the old marriage vows sad\nAnd so it you know if you want to be divorced you get to keep whatever you want to Cape but if you want to be married we are doing this together in other words if she gets cancer you don't look at her and go oh you just give them hell that cancer thing there by yourself and those trips that came out you get to do that by yourself\nNo no you would take care of her because we are now one one were married and and it's in sickness and health and right now the house is sick and so we don't get to be a print system be selfish that's not an option sorry\n[noise] yes and and um that's what I was trying to explain period that we need it my my truck it's for sale already have it on the market good on that as soon as I Do some of these qualities of course will happen\nIf I Can't get what I was asking for what you what it what I oh I'm going to pay the difference to get rid of it completely good with these clothing and that's what I was trying to tell her to is I'll get a car cash in and she tells her car and then what have at least one car right now\nWell I don't know I don't ... I don't agree with that I Would get her a car and I'm not sure we're going to move down and out of her car if you can make fifty five thousand if you can get these closings and everything you've gotten the pipeline it sounds like you're pipelines pretty good\nIt's just it's been tough from the lay off ... or the firing until now but here's the money that you've got ... the the business that you have coming\nShould create the income they used to have if I heard you correctly\nAnd yes and and like I told her like she's she's worried that it's not coming in fast enough and I told her there are any or clothing by the second week of November everything should be close to saint\nLouis area and three weeks from now here I mean so three weeks from now all this goes away so here's what I Would I Would not sell her car today\nI Would show your trial today and I but I Would I Would say I would tear this this this ridiculous\nPhilosophy that she has all the ... I'm not putting up with that crap okay this idea that outlined make money I can keep ... on that ship your roommates that's just BS okay I'm not going with that show uh\nBut uh but but the idea that I think she should keep her car and I think the two of you and I think you're going to be making enough money but then the two of you could work through a budget that has not a hundred and five thousand dollars worth of debt making about a little over a hundred but instead has about Seventy five thousand dollars of debt making a little over a hundred if both of you are willing to roll up your sleeves and\nPay off thirty seven thousand dollars for the ... a year for two years we can keep her car but if you're not willing to do that as a household then you don't have a financial trouble your marriage trouble than she is not willing to join armed with you and fight and outside enemy\nThat has come at your house and instead she goes to her corner with her toys you have a marriage problem [noise]\nOkay but hopefully you guys can get on the same page when you back all for her car a little bit\nYou run around and started selling mama's cars not weigh a good way to get mom on board\nHello so let's try that other approach 'cause I think it's reasonable financially to keep her car if your income goes ... looks like your income is going to go\nThan you might be looking at a different career and she's going to be looking at us on our car and you get her car to drive you drive a cheap car while we get this mess cleaned up\nThis is the day Ramsey show [noise]\nFinancial SEC wars mega mall mind bombs going off in three\nFour point one [noise]\nI get a lot of calls from listeners not knowing what to do with their timeshare I don't care if their reason you want out is because you were duped you can't afford it you inherited it the smart thing to do is just get rid of it they're horrible they never live up to the expectations the resorts sat and the only way you're going to exit you're timeshare safely\nLegally and forever is with time share exit team\nThey have offices all around the country where you can sit down face to face and review your contract to find a solution they've accepted south\nBest in the business because they simply a more options for exit than anyone else it could be a long process\nBut there with you every step of the way the ... team to show carpet and then there are extra service\nThat if they don't get your out you get a full refund called ... for for ... and schedule a free consultation for for nine nine ... or timeshare ... team dot com\nHere we go again another winter in the upper Cumberland there's going to be rain and snow and ice and slush and these are freezing cold that means real punishment for your ... beer cross over to getting ready for the weather with a little napping well\nStephen K Philips or the longtime orders of your Cookeville map of auto parts store and they want to invite you to their new Napa location in Crossville Cumberland plaza up north main street in genesis road show Napa auto parts in Crossville now has new owners in a new location we experienced a knowledgeable strapped can answer all your questions with\nPlenty of ... napping no out and they'll help you find everything you need to win a rise your vehicle from\nFresh antifreeze to rub your white dribbling the icing washer blue\nSeasonal braved the conventional or synthetic motor oil\nAnd get out and get on the road with Napa new album your nearest map auto parts store will avenue in Cookeville and now in Crossville and Cumberland laws are just off north main street in genesis rode\nThe main thing Phil Bredesen is covering up his record on sexual harassment again read it and didn't have a zero tolerance policy well Bredesen was governor harassment and state government was rampant the Associated Press recorded the harassment cases double in just one year on reticence watch on the Tennessee and reported that instead of helping victims\nRead it and try to cover up the harassment and next Tuesday found that British and the administration conducted incomplete an inconsistent investigations the even shredded documents to hide the scandal\nOne sexual harassment expert called Britain's response quote on\nForgivable two former Bredesen staffer to mishandled these scandals are back working on his Senate campaign outrageous women\nWere victimized bred for look the other way and put his political career first deal reticent can't be trusted in the Senate and leadership on paper and is responsible for the content of this advertising\nNot operate by any candidate or chemicals many W.

I'll I'll tell you what do you want me to answer your question I Will tell you\nWhere do you think it was going to get my point when you better watch out\nWell I I'm willing to bet you that nobody hires Mike wage Mike wages a very good football coach ... and we've seen that repeatedly but he is extremely difficult to work with\nAnd that is why the majority of athletic directors have shied away from I Know my college I used to work with him during his career out of coaching when he was on Syria sex I'm radio\nAnd he's likeable and he's very smart but he doesn't listen any ... any will not listen to an athletic director he will not take orders he will not take direction and he is in many people's minds a nightmare now you when you get him you will probably win\nBut very few I recall Fisher\n[noise]\n\nThreat is up next tread good afternoon\n[noise]\nFall day going to take a call rather sang friday to you you back Paul I just want to make one comment yesterday at the end of the shell and Joe from grand bay to stay up all night\nAnd he's going to try and create some pressure packages most notably probably the right side of the all sense of line ... Wilson the big often to tackle maybe struggles with speed off the edge that is what Ninety nine Ninety to Ninety six create for Florida on defense so it is imperative in my opinion\nThe Georgia stay ahead of the chains get themselves in third and short and manageable situations to maybe less than the heat that they're going to see an open up the playbook on third down prop into coordinator Jim Cheney [noise]\nTime I I Want to talk about something that's not going to be a a major factor tomorrow but and it's a little bit difficult because in your many years of being the preeminent recruiting\nExpert in the country it's it's a delicate thing to talk about young men who have not signed but have only committed but but Georgia has lost\nSeveral uh commitments in recent weeks including one yesterday and and I'm\nReally interested in if if there is some reason is is this young people making decisions too early than regretting or is there something to be concerned about is the Georgia fan till they\nGive you a Georgia fan in this particular prospect is an outer state prospect and I think any time that you go outside of your footprint and you go into your competitive or competitors back yard and you get an early verbal commitment it's increasingly more difficult to keep\nVerbal commitment it's like having a five hundred pound Marlon on the line what he's five hundred yards away and if you're going to bring him in it's going to take some time I think when you become more distinctly concern is if you start to see this happening on multiple occasions with ... kids but I Will get this one caviar\nJust because you have verbal deep commitments from your class doesn't mean that something that's been precipitated by the prospect only\nCould be something that mutual could be something that maybe it's created a little bit by the coaching staff in the in the sense of slow playing prospect maybe feeling like there's been some movement on their board and there was a guy that the higher priority that they want to pursue\nDown the stretch to what we see on the surface as outsiders looking in isn't always the case from the inside looking out [noise]\nGood answer and maybe that will come some of the waters down the time or\nAnother game I Want to get some thoughts on for me because it's a it's an under the radar game but it's critical to the SEC is not the game here it's been going to Columbia, Missouri and we've already talked to a couple of people who don't like the match up\nFor Kentucky Kentucky is not favored in this game it's a big game for both for the Kentucky gets his when then they wait for\nFor Georgia next week 'cause there was a perhaps a shot at that really making some ... some hay with the SEC is ... ... ... what what are your thoughts on this match up and you agree that it's a bad one for the wild cats\nI think outside of the Texas saying I'm game this is the first match up that we've seen Kentucky have to take on a bona fide difference maker quarterback a guy that can put the ball and all the nooks and crannies in the field creates\nThe case for some of the opponents that Kentucky has taken on you couple that with the fact that you're on the road and that would create some worry for me as well\nI still continually say that this is a Kentucky team that finds a way they seemed to have a great chemistry know who they are no what they are not and I'm Still looking for somebody that can consistently find a way\nTo isolate and game playing against Josh Alan whether it's has a designated pass Russia you know he's going to be set up and opportunities to rush to pass or try and get drew lock off a schedule and out of sync and then he made the plays in coverage as well so you always got to be aware of where he is on the field\nFor my money this will not be about Kentucky's defense and whether they can contain this misery office in the past and getting this is going to be about consistency quarterback\nFor the Kentucky Wildcats you know what you're going to get on the ground out of any snow but can you get the consistency in the past in game and the decision making in the ... game out of the quarterback position for Kentucky [noise]\nTime looking at a time before you go and uh they always say don't look ahead but you know everyone's looking ahead to next week a tiger stadium first the controversy of the week the white situation you you're on the field for college football games every week\nYou know what a big issue targeting is your thoughts on what we saw and was it the right call if\nYou read the rule as it is dated and how it is laid out in the rural ... whether you agree with it or not and then you watch how the play played out\nThen it's targeting may not like how the rule is worded may not like the fact that it looked like Devin White might've pulled up a bit and if there was a malicious intent I Know that's led to a lot of discussion about making the targeting rule\nOr you know a targeting Warner at targeting too with a plague written tense we don't have that right now but when you're when when your helmet or your face mask gets up into the chin or the head and neck area and make contact with the quarterback because he's delivering the football\nThan by the letter of the law whether we like it or not\nThat targeting we can debate the rule we can debate the intent of the rule and how it's written out but the way it currently stand\nThat's how it works [noise]\nNow a meanwhile in Tuscaloosa as the game plan is being put in ah with my ... and his staff\n... let me ask you yeah my uh what would you be doing differently or would you are because you have to and you have great wide receivers for you just going to continue doing the same thing you have been doing\nOn defense ball for all those you know I'm not talking about for the farm bill for which start with Alabama's defensive strategy and then we'll turn around the ... does defensive strategies for I think the alternative strategy\nIs to continue to put defenders in a conflict of assignment\nEverybody is always so concerned about stopping the wrong with Alabama right if you don't stop the run they're gonna they're gonna just run over all over you all day but the the new are peel additives here the the run pass option and the fact that it's no longer just Calvin really out there is no longer just Julio Jones Maury Cooper\nThey're putting for game breaker is on the field at one time so you've got to pick your poison\nSo it's difficult for the defense to ever be right versus this off than if they get you isolated in space Alabama's player is better than your defender and so I don't know if anybody coming up outside of maybe LSU on defense maybe Clemson down the road and the playoffs\nTo get Alabama off schedule and and get them behind the chains off at first and second down we haven't seen that yet so I wouldn't change a thing from Alabama I Would attack I'd put the hammer down and I would force LSU to pick their poison and then play off of that and to has been really good at making those decisions line of scrimmage and post now\nThanks so much Tom ... joining us as he does\nAnd

H\nA starter against top twenty five genes Patrick my homes in a jury golfer also an eight or nine that doesn't mean you won't be a great prose just means you may not have had their\nPieces around you in college oh welcome into the program and let's bring in Matt\n... thanks for the time a critical game uh Missouri trying to um skipped make make a step forward and you want to start locking up some ball conversation in Kentucky still thinking about the SEC east um [noise]\nWhat's his came in to you as you get ready to broadcast it\nYou you can't just on a little bit earlier\nCourse of his career and how it's unfolded\nWell where's that big signature victory where's the one that you're going through and you say look this is one of his finest performances\nVersus topped your talent and\nReally haven't been able to point to one as of yet\nThis was an opportunity is going to be a tall task to say the least because when you watch Kentucky play and we've all said this all season long\nThis isn't your father's Kentucky football to visit your older brothers Kentucky football\nWonder mark stoops he's kind of slowly built his program\nInto his image they're greedy group they're going to stop Iran they're going to run the football this was like an old school SEC type of approach that the wild cats have won with\nMissouri's work to be more tough minded\nIn housing lack the pieces around him to have the success maybe that's a function of him acknowledging you don't have to do it all on your own allows some of those assets on your office to contribute and don't try to shoulder the burden\nOn yourself especially when you're facing one of the better defenses that you'll find and all this conference in in statistically anyway amongst the best in the country [noise]\nMatched let me ask you about the other side the other off sense because Kentucky has gone a long way this year but they're all fence a finally seemed like a laser ran out of gas or the tank was in full because a tech saying them that they didn't do they weren't particularly creative\nIn in overtime and it may have crossed into the game and then last week it was a much different what's going on on the offensive side of the boss specially quarterback\nBut you can talk to you and if we're rewind the Texas A M M game you know they might have done well just about as the ... absolutely possible and doing the obvious thing hated diminished now they didn't do it\nEnded up costing them that ball game they struggled offensively all game long ago never took an officer snap on the positive side of the field on the plus side of the fifty\nAre they going to be able to get going again when you thought going into the by week that maybe they would bounce back quickly it was an explosive performance versus Vanderbilt a windy night three for nine passing a lot has been made of that a quarterback with Terry Wilson\nThe guy's a nightmare though because of his legs he will take place that should go nowhere and turn them into forty are gains\nThat drives defensive coordinators nuts and it impacts the way that they can deploy their defense especially in coverage\nYou can expect Missouri to have the Kenai maybe at least one defender especially on third downs allocated to try to account for Terry Wilson and his ability to scramble because if there's nothing down field that doesn't matter\nKentucky's never in an empty backfield they always have a runner's longest term Wilson's in the lineup [noise]\nTalking to match scents from the you've you've been doing a the SEC film room\nThis year and in the past and it's such a spectacular watch this year this week you are hung out with Nick Saban I Know there's always a an entertaining exercise but to take a sitting there and give us a your view of what he was like to be around and what the thinking as he gets ready for the biggest game of the year\n... there's no telling how many things are running through his head um but I Do notice that um the coaches and we are blessed in this conference on a lot of ways because these coaches are engaged they understand football they want to share\nSome of their knowledge with a fan base and obviously the folks in and around their programming via that film room show I'm the same as bad as intentional other coaches we work with and that comes in\nI'm somewhat sedated you it's it's not the most ah animated\nEntrance into the room but he is very intentional about what it is that we're trying to accomplish what it is that we think that we want to talk about and inevitably touches on those elements but always elaborate well beyond what we thought was maybe one or two layers deep\nYeah rarely leave a those interactions without having learned something more about a play\nThat I probably watched twenty or thirty times as we're pulling them out\nHe uh he was getting on me and this past ... show Africa One back power play which is a pretty fundamental play you see it all the time and everybody's got it and they're often that's\nThe part of the reason why I picked it is I wanted to hear\nWhat he could add to what is otherwise a play it as being run on YMCA wreck football fields all throughout the country and he probably talked about it for about a minute\nAnd it was a very interesting insight into that place but there's no doubt about it that or\nWhatever he is whatever it is uh he's doing these folks\nExactly [laughter] I I didn't\n... which is I don't follow I mean I've followed social media was within reason but I don't know if I didn't know until two hours because you've been sick well\nI also knew that I couldn't tell you because if I told you then you would be disgusted by me I mean it'd be like I'm not going to\nThe show are normally see you on a Monday and Tuesday but I thought okay maybe I mean she's\nGot kicked off on their charts I yeah you never really want to ask right so it's kind of one of those things but but you know I Am at least still allowed to be on your show sometimes I get kicked off so\nKind of other times he got out and look at it as all the time but\nThe reason why you're not on the show and Monday's you're you're\nWhen you're not there in New York yeah\nBut anyway so I'm I'm back in action and and fully recovered in a very thankful for everyone who checked in on me not you know we all those things that you gave man you need one good water yeah my back well remember last year we had our whole thing with the immune an even dropped and that that kind of went viral for us on your show but then\nBut then he for some different things so anyway but we're we're all back in action and I tell you what just in time because this is a huge games is how they can match up\nJust even kind of being around here in Jacksonville and Paul we've always been to the game every year that of the nation this feels so much different I Am not just saying that it really it is\nWhen you were students did you come down here with all your buddies and party [laughter]\nI didn't party but I did come down one time and I worked for the on campus\nAnd so I came here to cover the game but the funny thing was the only way I could get here because I had I wasn't being paid I was paying my way what the take a fraternity but here\nWith all my recording equipment and then when you know really dirty looks like a total do we but when do I not look like a total degree so I took the fraternity trip here just to get groceries [laughter]\nExactly you know he doesn't and then I covered the game a ads you know the radio reporter for the game and then had to get on that stupid bus\nAnd go all the way back again was a bus I'm like oh\nI mean it it was when I actually I yes Florida one but so that meant the bus was even worse than maybe it would have been otherwise\nDetroit River of liquid\nOh I think everything I was trying not to look I I was just trying to keep to myself and and I think at one point I felt like putting a bag over my head but um it was it was a traumatic experience but that's hard work you know you take a fraternity [laughter]\nFlorida Georgia to try to cover the game that's the only time I went in and I did actually go back and I remember saying to my parents I'm like I'm going to go to that game anymore that game with too crazy for me but it really is a such a heated such an intense\nRivalry it had a different\nAlmost a different strain to it than every other rivalry every rivalry has its own whether they're citing any\nValue to see a like it or I mean there used to be a real them over game until Nineteen eighty nine right even though it was different because it was in Birmingham legion feel which everyone knew it was in Alabama home field exactly\nThis this is neutral site I've seen I really do think it's about even fifty fifty right now from what I've seen at least today Florida\nFan George ... is it like it's more of those\nBut see I Would say that for the fans like it but I think that's I think that's what makes the ... you weren't really figure it out or to living in Florida you you have the advantages of all the things that come before but Georgia bans this was a ... yeah\nYeah Jacksonville is also the perfect site for this game because this game is do Jacksonville and I don't know how to put it other than that but it's just it's it's very authentic to the town that has played in and um it it's always good but the fact that it matters as much as it does this time around it really makes it\nInteresting if you go back before the jaguars came there this was\nAs college football capitalists Birmingham was yeah I mean you talked about you and and what was interesting it was it was a ... there was a it was a Georgia Florida Florida State ah environment and the ... pro football changes everything\nThan and look I mean this town now with this ... with a jaguar as being a great NFL game they're very much bought into that um but I Do think that you know\nThey relish in this game relatives as they are a weekend women rose I you know\nI I've been thinking a lot about this game and and I err towards the side and you know sorry for Florida people out there they're going to be mad at me for the\nHigher toward the side of thinking that Georgia comes out and and it has a really dominant showing I think at the game maybe close for a while but I Do think that Georgia isn't it the worst thing that could happen for Florida is back to Georgia got the biology you they're angry they've had time to think about it they've had had time to do on it\nUm but the one thing is that in this game and it's true for any rivalry game you have to throw all that out that that's where I'm leaning right now the ... where do you lean when you think about the complexity to this\nI was talking to or or or\nRipped from buddy Martin Morning on his show and I know you were there as well yesterday\nIf you're that were buddies buddies very fact that he ... he he does have a good beat on what's going on and I don't want to like fully buy into all of that yet but then again and again\nWe want to go I'm just going to walk up and down\nThe tailgate parties and just ask everyone in just partake and ... ... I have this ... won't\nTake long well if you don't have a like a you know the thing that would be a way for the first drink\nLaid out salt maddening you at the landing tonight just you know ... would you go to the landing we I think yeah\nI don't know if it was last\nYear or the year before we were we stay in hotels down there and there was some concerts that I wanted to go to the mayor or three years ago I cannot remember was the last year because last year we were together right I mean not\nWe better together it was a great ... well I mean we were just reminiscing about actually before we ...\nWe were at a party we went to a party last year we went in but we both got invited to it or one of our caller yeah one of our\nTeammates homes to having lived here about that seems to be that lives in Jacksonville truly not hard to come up with the the ah\nHe did not mark experience you know um so anyway the point being I wanted to go to this concert but I'm thinking if I walked down there at ten o'clock at night oh you'll never come back um I'll never make it to the show because I'll just be I mean I'll be doing shot [laughter]\nHave you ever done it a shot [noise]\nYou look at me like I've always been moved boring boring I\nMean people who do shot or\nOf a sudden not boring or or vice versa I started doing shots um anything but\nI remember when I met somebody on the audience about an hour ago you submitted your much friendlier than you are on television I said well the\nTime yeah exactly I mean he's actually doing up here it's acting but you know I just didn't want to everyone to totally know the real truth\nAbout you know if if people knew I was really friendly then I'd I'd have to talk to everyone and no one would ever call in to your show now do the show is constantly ...\nWell they say that a lot anyway but but some\nFlorida fans in Georgia fans been like on your show the ... I've heard of that as a few loyal fans are\nVery confident I feel that to Georgia fans have a false sense of confidence and they and I think if you\nIf you look deep inside they would say oh we're a little nervous just because of what happening until LSU which is understanding\nBut they don't still do have more Jimmy's in Joe's in Florida had then again that doesn't always win the game I think they do just a debt wise I think they do but Florida has been a lot of talent and they played a lot better they got a ton of confidence as a team I get why there I mean I get\nA link does when our children when he was earlier the good ones differences is that what made ... last year is in the NFL right now\nThey have talent but they have not been great years\nAnd then they will be great and maybe it's not this year which is just going to be disappointing 'cause everyone expects\nYou know everyone to do a one one I really quick thing I Want to let you know I just wanna make sure everyone knows about that Maria Taylor who is on college game there she and I had one are very well\nWe love Maria she and I have a ... going and I just want to make sure that we are to graduate yeah and so and I love Florida I went to Florida so um we out of that going that if for a while my model or get involved and high high stakes bats at your age your doesn't I don't know what else to say about that but after a while [laughter]\nDo that you can bet with two will much chance I don't know I'm Still Georgia go back like\nFor Joe when I have to wear a Georgia in Jersey and seeing Georgia fight song if Florida when Maria has to wear a Florida jury's ... what do you think about that I can tell you\nI don't remember really what the game was a book about three or four years ago Florida was probably about two in Tennessee Florida has no chance\nAnd they shouldn't have done insurance out too in Tennessee and Lyle Jones a blue about Thirteen point lead in the final men or the game I wore a Florida Jersey on the program I ...\nRyan listen thanks for the call it that was really great question by Jesse is up next to Jesse good afternoon how are you [noise]\n\nHello Jessie good afternoon on it and I am doing wonderful thank you\nI if I had a good time and I'm sure that's going to be a great place to me\nIt is the time\nI think I Am thinking about the game\nI don't know I think it may be a lot closer than people think I don't know I think I could go either way I don't I Know a lot of stage or can they walk away with it that it got there and then why do you say well\nWe couldn't Georgia's just six and a half point favorite show I think that gives you a slight indicator of where the perception is [noise]\nYeah I'm ... I I I Try to like a ... I like to listen to all the sides and\nWhen the when the noise finally [noise]\nDebates I come to a conclusion I don't really consider my production very important but I I like to be the last one and so I don't have to defend it all week\n[noise]\nHowever I Can't I Can't help but there again I just have to say the gator they share that they did what you're doing the best team win\nThank you ... it out yeah I don't know the best team is show or that's what ... about Randy is up next Randy welcome to the program good afternoon\n[noise] hey Paul thank you so much for taking my call how you doing we're doing great how are you actually tell\nYou when this day and was on hold and that little get land from Jasper called\nAnd wrote short circuit died so I'm Glad I got a chance to talk to you\nBoth thank you for taking the time [noise] well\nUm what I wanted to do I want to use your child to lay it that\nIt would you lose the game that he donates rather dollars to your favorite chair and I will also\n\nYou know that's a ... that's where magnanimous gesture I thought somebody made the best I think it was mad from Gainesville made the best one of the Georgia wins the game then we just don't have to listen to Lance anymore this year wouldn't that be a blessing to everyone\nSo that would\nBe a good one but I just like that I just like if they have up here see everybody's gators but I Wonder also said something about will say though he said a couple of weeks ago that\nSaid Georgia quit and I didn't know what I saw was what all of a surreal bell collar country ... and with and that's exactly what it was but I mean\nThese are my heart that they will come out tomorrow and I actually believe that law will be just feel that\nIt's interesting that you say that a Desmond Howard was here earlier and he expects a similar thing I I think for Georgia to be a fact of the ... either either from gets to a raid starter Justin ... comes in and watch the place up uh out to sea feel some are I I I think it's long overdue and other Kirby should've\nLet him roam a little bit more in Baton Rouge Brad is up next bread go right ahead you're on the program it's all your\n[noise] hey Paul thank you very much for taking my call year it's been nice talking with you this week near a truce southern gentleman thank you um [noise] here's the way I think\nThe games don't go Paul I think George didn't run the ball a little bit and give prompts some protection I really think George is going to put up some points and I don't really think it's going to because I think George covers the spread\nAnd I think that uh that's that's really going to keep our days an insult to ... keep 'em fresh and when they're on the field I think they're going to be good enough to stop the gator all sense [noise] um [noise]\nHaving said that if we cannot control the line of scrimmage and we get in third longest from gets put on this but I think he's going to have a short hooked on him and I think he's going to say the freshmen come in and we're going to take our chances\nWith him because he just said he has not been used him when he has been used is just been in a one dimensional form at some point you got to take the training wheels all in and let it go it's just a shame that Kirby\nMay have to do that and the biggest game of the year\nWell listen uh there's a precedent for and and you know what you know what that is so I\nIn from the standpoint that you have a team in Georgia that\nThere's just not quite broken through this you're outside I wouldn't say the or the south Carolina game was impressive I don't want to short sell about\n... and Florida Florida has really uh I think plate above what fair\nPalin looks like and I think some of that comes from coaching on both sides of Grantham and and and then and now it just doesn't work to make fun of the season though and that that by week\nIs critical and you always have the ... you always have the ... for Alabama LSU and Ohio and what does Kirby's Marvin working on that that's what I Want to know that's that's my biggest mystery of this game as what and ... is you know it's not it's not that it's not a matter of whether there was a package for just feel just what's it look like\nOn Memorial Day before I let you go because I Know you've got all the callers and I'm just going to touch base on people this week calling in I'm\nSaying to Alabama gets called Alabama this the calls and they say of Alabama here's the deal I got to ask the visual that lives in my town and I'm told him before ban certain coaches are better at work in the rest of it is a is an art form and the better you were the rare\nSometimes not every time but sometimes you can get more calls on will tell you some excitement can work around\nWell let me let me to hear your point is really good but think about this for a second I'm\nA viewer Nick Saban chewing on route versus a first year coaches\nThere is a difference or you don't ... I had I don't want to disrespect to anyone but but it was let's say a first year coach in his league complains about an official yeah the SEC looked into it if there's legitimacy to it but that's different than Nick Saban complaining show whether that\nTo affect the eyes of the mind of official I don't know what I Do know and I'm I Everytime I say this I get criticized I still believe\nAll

Stoneman Douglas High were Seventeen people were killed another Seventeen injured\nAccountable and great city schools honored run the with the courage under crisis and war and its annual conference in Baltimore Thursday night the council tweeted the announcement which the Broward school districts Twitter account shared encourage you all exhibited after a tragedy and stand that you won't talk after to make sure schools become save is absolutely amazing the tweet rent\nLittle information available about the award online and in pollock the father of meadow Pollack who was among those killed in the shooting share the news and the Broward school district account\nAnd quote that weren't going to Robert Runcie as reprehensible punk rock\nHe has culpability and creating lenient policies and Broward schools that cultivate criminals like the one that murdered my daughter and they weren't should be given to one of the end that's the teachers that paid the ultimate sacrifice school districts handling of the shooting and the events leading up to the subject of several lawsuits and currently under investigation by commission appointed by the governor\nIs nuts man it's good to me it's just so stupid I mean after this this shooting in these innocent deaths he even had some sort of\nA get together some dinner where he was touting the praises of the promise program he lied about this guy not having been the promise for reasons well he wasn't in high school he was in the problem for them and middle school was guy and they're doing this\nI think your analysis is pretty good I uh Reagan hit the script almost almost because the cameras pointed out we're not at all he had to work with me that a message out he couldn't speak directly to the American people right I I you know I\nI find Trump as a you know they they ... you can tell they study the Reagan certainly and other previous presidents they use the helicopter track you know yeah you know he'll sometimes see and hear the question he wants to hear and not here question doesn't want to hear what right off the road or a a\nHelicopter on his way out so\nI I I think it's true or Trump has not held nearly as many press conferences that swabbing right he as he certainly gives his moments to the media on just about every given day as you know when they when they all know swarm into his office and you can only answer a few questions now and then so\nThe bottom line is is the way the media African in ratings days\nIf you want to get your message out you had ... right right and that's breaking would do in in this day and age you know so Trump is creating its own rules and I don't blame them forty steps using technology to his great advantage\nIt's John Hi Bush the executive director of Ronald Reagan presidential a foundation and Institute but it's interesting that you say that Trump is on television every day every single day and it's a new video shown bite or a new video clip every single day or you're taking long form you know rallies I don't remember Reagan doing any of these sort of rallies where he would show up in\nFrom the White House rejected from it was wrenching and he would do the media there their piece every day um he's he's that exponentially different to did Reagan do a lot of his campaigning on Trump is doing\nWell during the campaign years has Nineteen eighty four Israel I just like his national election campaign and boy did really well a campaign that's no doubt about it but there again where I think Trump spin very inventor\nHe's has actually said well okay with the old rule he's never stopped campaigning from a moment he announced resume and I don't think he's ever going to stop\nHere the way Donald Trump looks like as if you want to win re election\nYou better campaign from the White House for from wherever you are every day a week\nAnd if you want to tell your own praises and your own accomplishments you have to do it this way he notes the media cameras will be trained on him but he knows in a press conferences and I'm actually asking a question here I'm guessing he knows in a press conference he won't necessarily be able to tout his own praises is that what's happening\nNow let's actually so I you know I think he's figure it out it's not against the law that campaign early you know so he's just inventing a whole new way to you know to put himself in front of the American people I don't I you know I ... I think\nWhether I'm sure there are styles in the future for different presidents won't be radically different\nThey're probably gonna pick right up words prop left off because a lot of what he does actually works\nWell what's interesting is John Hi Bush he is the executive director the Ronald Reagan presidential foundation an Institute what's interesting to watch is thirty thirty five years later Ronald Reagan is praised by both sides\nAnd the media doesn't necessarily ever say anything negative about um\nThis guy I don't think a hundred years from nobody's going to see anything good about them so it it's almost like a Reagan walked slowly carrying a big stick and had a big smile or as Trump just gets in your face is that in in your opinion is that the the stark difference between the two because when you look at accomplishments like you said they're almost exactly the same\nYeah that's a that's a fascinating question you oppose because I I think about that every day I Trump is not such a bright white light at the relationship so intense that I I I too cannot imagine twenty thirty forty years from now somehow\nThat dates media looking back you know it was it ... towards tourists Donald Trump ... the fashionable but also say during the ... you never thought it would have been imaginable either a you know\nOr they may not as bad as it has been as intensely war with each other not not at all but Reagan was the target of the liberal press every day he was an office there is no doubt about it and it's only really because of his remarkable successes but as you look back at them in history the\nFacts are facts are stubborn things and and people that look at the Reagan presidency and they have to give a damn what side of the sense that you might be on\nGuard reviews John Hi Bush executive director the Ronald Reagan president foundation and Institute I'm I Wonder if you have an opinion on this and all of anybody's ask you this before but\nWhat was Ronald Reagan's hum relationship with the media going in Donald Trump for forty years was a media darling in New York LA Washington everywhere\nThey loved him because he met money if they put him on people would watch the show and they put them on people would advertise on the show this yeah this relationship went downhill in a matter of three years that's all we're talking about here three years ago\nRight before he announced he was still let me do you darling was Ronald Reagan in good with the media before he ran or ... I I get the feeling that he was\nWell actually he wasn't it was really hot yeah yeah you know I mean you got to remember\nReagan started off as an outsider even with his own party he they ever on many many thought he was way too far to the right so but at the end you have to remember to a one week before Reagan's first election he was down to Jimmy Carter by ten points\nAnd when he came to office the press you know he was the enemy of all done he was just you know right wing not\nEverybody about bedtime bedtime for bombs or was it was my main headline everywhere right\nAbsolutely and now you know they make fun of writing and say I can only speak and he was speaking off of three by five car and you know it wasn't smart he wasn't well read it was that was absolutely not the truth and I think as Reagan continue to perform\nIn like Trump succeed and achievements ... uh they they they have to change their mind about Reagan I think by the time he got into a second term\nThey started to understanding what they had the front of them are already saw reading him for a success was but it really did take you know when you know darn near water to walk presidency before the press really started to ...\nIt's kind of amazing or a last question and I appreciate the time John I'm ... how does how does Trump either a repair this relationship where do you see him going forward just doing exactly what worked so far because I mean frankly the media might say that he's a failure he's horrible news or something ... and there's something else but the bottom line is\nThese crowds of a hundred thousand people are signing up to go see him in Texas and elsewhere what what do you see him doing going forward\nAnd if we use the word repair I don't think that's conceivably possible because I don't think this is something that's necessarily now within his control\nI don't think even if they woke up tomorrow morning and want to you know kissing Holland suppressed not going to happen and and that's because it's interesting it it's not too tough to imagine that Trump has an individual made a decision\nTo go to war with the media but but now that the media has made the decision to go to war with Trump yeah that's a very different thing I don't think\nThe media and I I think they kind of a a you know that the kind of bought Trump's line now and and now they're they're they're in an enemy camp and against him no matter what I don't think there's a truth that's on the horizon ever and I think that's going to be the case and so ah\nSo Trump like Reagan did hops aboard Marie once lived a circle around the city I was here I I just don't see a half\nAgo I think you're absolutely a hundred percent right and oh by the way Trump said recently that he could nominate Hillary Clinton for the Supreme Court in the media still wouldn't luggage John we are usually the information to be actually let's do it again soon them in fact you great to be with John Hi Bush the executive director of the Ronald Reagan president ... leads to do we appreciate your we're back after this on the Joe ... writer [noise]\nShow him\nAm sixteen hundred\nIn many bedrooms bedtime is well complicated especially as the weather begins to cool well one person sleep soundly the other is either freezing or way too hot boiling branch makers of the world's most comfortable sheets loved by three us presidents\nIs offering luxury flannel betting for a limited time and bowling branch dot com they're unbelievably soft warm and breathe bubble so everyone\nStays the right temperature the flannel sheets coming forging stunning patterns and colors\nYou're guaranteed to find a style you love plus you could try them for thirty nights risk free but whatever you do don't wait last year there flannel sheets sold out and just a few weeks so go bowling branch dot com today for fifty dollars off your first set of sheets plus free shipping would promote code\n... dollars off plus free shipping them right now at bowling branch dot com used my code packs\nP.
