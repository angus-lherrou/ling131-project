before these were missiles that were intermediate range from a few hundred kilometers to several thousand kilometers\nThe concern was based in New York based in Russia that there was no warning\nThat when they were fired maybe six minutes maybe four minutes to target unlike the ballistic missiles of the U.S and Russia in silos that have a big ballistic dark and you have some warning time\nThere is none with the INS so what that means is when the missiles were fired miscalculation or not you must respond instead of late don't check shoot launch on warning\nThat is what started the end of the Soviet us Cold War in Nineteen eighty seven when the two scientists in these last hour as the president of the United states has acknowledged that the U.S will leave the INS treaty between us and

right now I'm principal among them is that the Russians have been violating it since at least two thousand eight\nAnd the United states despite what has been doing has not been able to bring the Russians into compliance that would seem to me to be a good reason to get out of the treaty because we just have a one sided agreement right now but the other reason is what you've just been talking about and that the Chinese are not part of the treaty that question is\nDo you think it's possible that Beijing could be persuaded to join a new uh ins treaty which should include Russia and the United states\nGordon uh it's my opinion that are both the Russians and the Americans at various times have tried have implored the Chinese to consider some kind of relationship with the IMF treaty the problem with China\nUh since we started a outreach since really since the Nineteen eighties when we began to try to have these conversations with the Chinese is is that they have refused entirely\nBy an international arms control treaty they\nTheir their goal is dominance and if your goal is to dominate well then you conceal you hide you refuse any kind of transparency so that your enemy can prepare to defend themselves against the Chinese understand this and so they reject arms control as we have practice it even with\nOur dire enemy the former Soviet Union\nAddress Russia and have a dialogue with China about intermediate range missiles they the same concern could be a magic in Russia had with Europe Russia could have with China there's no warning here\nOr John it's my opinion it based on conversations that\nThere is a wide swath of the Russian national security elite that has long been concerned with China's military buildup especially their buildup of ballistic missiles and nuclear missiles unfortunately for them however ... has decided that he\nNeeds China's economic support in order for his regime has dictatorship to survive\nSo he is going to downplay and

come after them and so they ... they're buying time to prepare\nFor an eventual Chinese tilt against the Russians garden\nSo Rick with these short and intermediate range missiles that the Chinese have them all of them are appear to be mobile even the ones that are supposedly hidden underground\nThe U.S doesn't have road mobile a ballistic missiles we've got ones that are in silos they're really vulnerable because they can be taken out on a first strike\nUm do you think that the United states will actually go to what the Russians and the Chinese have which are these ballistic missiles sitting on big trucks that can just go wherever they want or are we going to stay with a silos in the future\nGordon the army has a program to build a modern short range ballistic missiles and there have been suggestions from army officials that they would like medium range ballistic missiles as well\nAh the Chinese have been building medium range ballistic missile solid fuel mobile medium range ballistic

the\nConduct of the pill a navy in particular I'm thinking of the Decatur incidents some weeks past when there was a dangerous maneuver by the Chinese captain it did not happen this time are these connected to or disconnected from the trade dispute with the United states\nJohn I think they're disconnected in the sense that um we've had of the trade dispute with China for very long time and only now is coming to a head but also um as the navy statement indicated you know we continue these freedom of navigation operations and we will make these ...\nUm and we do this not only in Asia but around the world to make sure that the global commons remains open side of the problem I guess in the sense is that we have a number of issues with China that are are sort of coming to a head at the same time and of course one of them is trade and the other is a China's trying to close off the global commons\nI remind you all the we have frequent elections and we're coming to one here in the

on your drive in the news\n\nI'm John Gordon Chang and the Daily Beast we're living in China China is in conflict\nWith the Trump Administration with our European allies the conflict has to do with the Chinese business plan which is piracy and China has not at this point acknowledged that it has another way piracy or else is the Chinese position well you can not lie to your own data\nAnd I'm looking at an article published recently by Jeffrey Snyder all hump bra investment partners and every child I'm looking at China GDP China dollar correlations China China nominal GDP China industrial production\nChina or retail sales China fixed asset investment\nIt that it's that charted only goes down\nDown now either this is a recession or China doesn't have recessions it has retreat so I don't know what the polite word as we go to Charles our child of Sunday's with our child he's also an investment counselor Charles the question Gordon and I have for you and your crystal ball\nWhere is China in six to nine months because that's a projection our markets like that's what the stock market reflects\nDoes China have in our flag to these declines good evening to\nYou both ah thanks so much I think not unfortunately I think if you look in excellent data that's produced by un CPA the the divides all economies into their consumption their investment instead of China has been inflated the largest investment bubble ever created in history\nAnd then on top of which there is a lot of leverage nobody really knows how much that there is on the Chinese economy when you cut through it and the demand inside the country hasn't gotten to the ... worth of support all this stuff so I think there's only one painful way through this and that is that the structure Gordon\nCharles or you know the number of countries have tried to manage their way out of crises tried to outgrow um problems than in China is certainly falls into that category and it seems as the article that John referred to in the beginning of the segment\nEssentially um you don't have very much upside potential for China really what it is is at best a straight line flat line gross from ... ... it just seems to me that it would have been much better for them to accept some medicine and have a crisis and then get over why aren't they doing that\nWell I I don't think that China really has the long a period of experimentation in history that we have in the west village just haven't lived through the many booms and busts and we can trace our modern economy back to the mid Eighteen hundreds we've had many painful depressions we've learned from some of the\nThere's just too much productive capacity in China\nOf the world and places like the U.S where that's not going to happen anymore so there's a simple way through this you have to have your capacity you have to encourage people consume more inside your country and you gotta you gotta be forthcoming with how much debt truly have and if it's too much just go to the guy off the mark downs and\nThere has to be a redo the Chinese financial structure\nUh Gordon I reading these charts I find I knew highlighted this to me China's retail sales don't look as bad as everything else does that make sense or they are they selling domestically\nI don't think they are John Doe their numbers tell you that they are so for instance they're saying the official national Gerson says excess but retail sales increased nine point two percent in September\nThe same month a sales of automobiles so Levin point six percent\nUm vehicle sales were down the three months of full three months of the quarter and yet they're saying that a consumption is increase\nThat just doesn't make sense John especially when you start looking at the sales of other items which were also slot or down so I think that China has a real data problem in terms of what they're reporting to people but I think it got to do that in a sense because if people really knew the truth\nThere would be panic there'll be panic it would be the end of the economy so what they're doing is they're just trying to lie and basically get their way through a very difficult patch I don't think they can do it this time um and then we'll just have to say\nAll right they're buying the Brooklyn Bridge every thirty five minutes a child a what what is what's in it for us does this indication of failure I mean it's a it's a big two thousand eight here we're looking at does this come our way we got defenses or their equity collapse\nI well I think fortunately yes we do I mean one very good thing is the chairman Jay Powell for the Federal Reserve has managed to get interest rates up above three percent of the ten year\nWhich means that in a China collapsed or China\nDowndraft we have room to lower interest rates in cushion the blow compared to other economies I think we're all in\nMuch better position than any other large economy it'll hurt if trying to go through this painful\nProcess economically I fear that a distraction might be suggested by the leadership there that some military adventure or whatever to distract the population from andme ethic poses an order is certainly a very dangerous set of months here um but in the end I think the United states\nEven if the Republicans do not maintain control the Senate will survive the coming retrenchment far better than any other major\nCountry and and gotten I'm checking with you because of this question before is the Chinese Communist party capable of taking a recession because that cures this there they they they they've missed price their economy can they take a hit\nI think that they believe that they can't and that's the reason why they have been flying the economy were too much cash you know as you talked about just a few seconds ago\nChina did not go through it's two thousand they everybody else did\nAnd eventually they got to go through that and right now we're in a pretty good position because as Charles points out our interest rates have gone up we have moved to move them down again and we're very I think robust Korea and so um you know whether China goes up or down and you know we'll be able to get through this and we'll do very well\nEarlier today Charles that Gordon and I were corresponding and there was a report in the Financial Times that businesses have barred up to one hundred percent against their stock\nOr that they they borrowed it they give it to the bank and they borrow against it but the stock market it's collapsed their assets of collapsed and the central government is looking to subsidize that collapse as long as they can ... I Believe that that is not a sustainable model that's like Fannie Mae times a million correct that war\nBill unfortunately throughout China the Asian and parts of Asia people do like the gamble and liberate them do it with ... money is very dangerous um I Hope that our European banks which are also highly leveraged are not overly exposed to the China tried to best were American facts I think we're pretty good shape\nBut in a China collapse I think that inflict torture back another European back to the blood heavily emerging markets and things and try to while are they in trouble\nAnd garden of your talk about at banks putting in defenses here so that we don't go through a weight as sad as the wave washes are way\nWhich they did um but I don't think that they really are thinking in that direction job but you know clearly there is going to be of some sort of adjustment and China\nProbably will be severe I think there will be fairly soon though I could be wrong on that but it will come because China has just done too much too on balance its economy since two thousand to\nCharles or tell of Sunday's with Charles Gordon Chang the Daily Beast I'm John bachelor [noise]\nNews saw

it's just us and we have the same objective\nSo in Europe I think it's it's way more problematic because of what I've just mentioned well the U.S is huge and people came from the same place so convincing way easier here than there so that's one of the major difference between the U.S and Europe\nWe had a crisis ten years ago the financial crisis to sweat the earth I've chiefly real estate failure in the United states to all of that laws were changed uh and I'm thinking chiefly of Dodd Frank and other adjustments in our taxes how does that make it more or\nOr who are more likely for a

Senate Finance products and available in every state\nOne of them back to ...\nThe White House correspondent to talk of his new book Mr Trump's wild ride published by all points books\nSubtitled the thrills chills screams with occasional blackouts\nOf an extraordinary presidents I Love the prologue year what I should have learned you lead off with this quote major fantastic guy wants to do with President Obama two weeks ago he was not thrilled I'm sure I'll be more thrilled\nQuote the first words Donald Trump spoke to you know\nWe're right yep please continue with what you you felt you shouldn't have learned\nSo uh what I wanted to do at the beginning of the book Jim boat is approach my audience from a posture humility because I don't think anyone who writes about American politics right now who comes across as\nA full blown do at all or at aspiring no at all it's going to have that core credibility that an audience can feel and touch and relate to you have to understand and you have to communicate\nThat you're gonna miss things and even as someone who is professional inexperienced and been around the track is I certainly have been you can and do miss things and if you do you owe to you'll read or a sense of personal accountability\nSo that whole prologue is what I should have learned that I didn't learn or took me longer than in retrospect I think I should have taken me to learn\nSo with that sentiment that you just read and I don't want to give it all away but I'll give listeners a sense I take that sentence apart a deconstructed almost word by word\nAnd say to the readers here with things that Donald Trump was telling me about himself and if I'd only taking the time to look at that sentence deconstructed and ask myself some basic that super high level of psychological analytical questions but just basic questions what is he trying to say what does he mean how's he coming at you I\nWould have learned about eighty percent of what I came to know about Donald Trump after sixteen months on the campaign trail if I just paid closer attention to that very first sentence and one example of a\nFantastic what is that about well it was a press conference before rally in Bertrand Michigan early August of twenty Fifteen so long long ago feels like a million years ago [noise]\nAnd it was the first big rally that Trump had after the first Republican debate and why did he say major fantastic because he noticed me in the pool of reporters\nCovering his press conference before the rally and I was the only network news correspondent in that group of reporters and the first one he'd ever seen at any of his press conferences so major fantastic wasn't about me it was about you're here\nYou're a network corresponded I'm getting more important that's why it's fantastic that Trump\nI should have learned a paid attention to what he was telling me what what that those two words actually mean and the sense as I say in the book of ... exuberance that is part and parcel of the way Donald Trump thinks about the world talks about the world and views himself with in the world\n... exuberance all the time in every example and then I deconstruct the rest of the sentence and I say to myself they're all sorts of these great\nClues that Donald Trump was essentially laying before me and if I had taken more time been more\nCurious about this different kinds of political actor and has different ways of dealing with language I learned a lot more than it would have taken me nearly so long as it did during the campaign just to sort of practice lock\nWith all due respect to you and do all the other reporters now you've covered\nAh let's see for presidents these for three news outlets yeah let's face it this was an entirely new experience for any of you you just\nLet let's let's just do your look at the at the circumstances of this man I I was wondering can you compare him not to any other president ... but not even any other governmental leader any other key public figure that you've ever recovered can you compare him to anybody\nNo I Can't I mean he is one of a kind in the sense that\nHe is this very large personality and as I write in the book\nHe was a fully formed celebrity before he got into politics politics has we've learned can make people into celebrities Ronald Reagan though in retrospect people think he was a big celebrity he was a B list movie actor yeah some recognition for his General Electric\nUh sponsored radio editorials but he was not a fully formed\nBig time celebrity Donald Trump was he was also a developer of real estate golf courses\nHe had brand identity not just domestically but globally he checked a lot of different boxes and he was a completely different actor at different completely different instincts and orientation to the underlying rules of the game\nAnd I write it early on in the book that there was a kind of school of rock improvisation if you love that movie as much as I Do check black or that Trump brought to politics and I describe myself in the book is one of those fussy parents in that movie those uptight parents who want to\nUm school to be as it always was rigid following the rules everything by the book\nAnd Jack Black topples all that and the movie school of rock on behalf of rock and roll and music\nDonald Trump in his own ways toppled a lot of the rules and I was one of these fussy parents say don't you know the rules why don't you following the rules and why can't you a color but in the inside the lights and you know that sort of thing and it took me awhile to get out of that it took me awhile to get out of it and say you know what the lines are different he's drawing them\nAnd look at all these people lining up to see it this is a new experience and take it in\nThat we're going to have to pause on that note I Want to come back we're they look at how some other Republicans learn these lessons with major\nGarrett who saw how do you

very short and very turbulent time with Michael Flynn he was bad news and it didn't work out and in retrospect now President Trump looks back on that in the main as a valuable conversation\n... major

draft of history as I've read about this presidency Patrick ... from ... Missouri to like a good evening Patrick into welcome to the program\nI Want to thank thank a major get for writing such a good book and you know actually he needs somebody to tell the truth but I really think if anybody takes a look at these bombings it's awful convenient that all the people that are being investigated\nOver this current corruption received a bomb\nAnd none of them went off and now the FBI almost completely stopped that would imagine investigating them and it's running around trying to find out who said he bombs I think and it happens right before the election plus it takes the heat off the convoy coming up to uh Mexico\nWell let's let our guests comment about to all of those various factors that it has momentarily are taking the attention away from that took care of a bad but I can assure you that the care of and once it gets close to the U.S border we'll be right back front and center and an\n... let me tell you I think it was a long way we've got the same time I think it can continue and it was doing go ahead\nSure and and the caravans going to remain a story and remember it's if it remains on its current course it's not going to arrive if it ever does at the U.S border for weeks after the election they're long long way away but the government's going to be a story it it that's not going away and the FBI has lots of different\nParts of it agencies within the agency and it can and does\nI assure you walk chew gum and do a lot of other things far more complicated than those two things on a day to day in our our bases and yes it's a high priority case\nBut the people who work at work those kinds of cases they don't necessarily or even generally work government corruption cases it's not as if everything the FBI was working on\nLiterally goes and runs in this direction that's not how the agency operates these things work methodically across the agency they will continue to work but what I think the caller's already indicate Jim ... is a sense of\nWhat is this really about and I would I Would caution everyone in the audience and I say this all the time and we we have a an approach journalistically at CBS at that tries to live up to this sometimes you have to wait\nYou have to wait for the evidence in every way don't say what things what what what we know and then the ten or twelve or Fifteen things we don't know guess what that's what we say we don't know\n[noise] ah during this chapter eight of your book Trump's a Mr Jones wild ride of Saudi Arabia and the middle east in particular Jared ... dealing with the the crown prince and now that we of course have some later perspective on this chapter your daughter\nSo I'm One of the things that our listeners game from our conversation demos is that the answer to this question do we really need another Trump book which is not an unfair question and I would say in this sense we do why\nBecause we need a book about and that's the reason I wrote it and it was difficult to do while I was doing my day job don't think it was in a book about what's actually happened what decisions have been made what\nIf you want to call on this and the White House certainly does what series of accomplishments of occurred in the first Eighteen months and whether you think of them as accomplishments or not things did happen\nThat are likely going to be with this country to five ten Twenty years from now one of the things that's with us is this dramatic shift carried out by president elect Trump through the good offices of Jared Kushner his son in law during the transition\nTo start a relationship with the Saudi regime and fundamentally alter America's approach\nThe kingdom in that geopolitical read region shift away from Iran shift away from the Iran nuclear deal and create a different access if you will in the region which is the United states surprisingly Israel and the Saudis to be a counterweight to Iran\nAnd so much of U.S policy in the middle east was predicated on that and has followed that track set in motion and detail how during the transition by these early interactions if you want to think of this way or the two young princes Jared Kushner\nAnd the Trump Administration crown prince Mohammed bin some on the de facto leader and Arab parent in the kingdom of Saudi Arabia and their interactions and their trust in one another was foundational to this emerging Rio orientation of the U.S relationship with Saudi Arabia and\nA long time ago summer of last year when the White House was more inclined to cooperate on books like mind Jared and I had a long conversation about this which is on the record in my book you\nDon't find very many on the record lengthy conversations with Jared Kushner about anytime many topics almost none on this topic so if you're curious about how this all got started and what that perspective is I I recommend the book to you because you can actually find out in Jared Kushner's words what they're trying to accomplish what their initial hopes were\nAnd certainly the Jamal could show the case brings many of those hopes and aspirations into a harsher and more difficult light\nBriefly or do you find the fact that this was his first foreign visit is to be significant\nDo and that's why I devoted an entire chapter to it not that it's going to change everything are all the orientations that Trump brings to Middle Eastern policy you're going to be successful but they're ... they're dramatically different and there are different in this respect\nPresident Trump said there are Saudi Arabia

before the top of the hour of our friends in for Larry Elder live and the pain free really factor dot com studios have and fourteen twenty the answer in Cleveland, Ohio\nOr what to talk to you for a second about an issue that you care about more than any other that most Americans do anyway one that's sitting the pocket books of American families are the outrageous cost of prescription drugs in a recent poll conducted by Frank Luntz\nHe got an earful on this words like greed gouging and unfair kept coming up and a lot of questions why does the cost of drugs keep skyrocketing why are the costs of the top ten medications increased over one hundred percent since ... eleven why does the whole system is rigged\nThere is an answer the big drug maker spend a lot of money lobbying to protect their profits over one hundred Seventy one million dollars to be exact\nBut there is a bigger lobby in America our politicians must answer to we the people and we want solutions to prescription drug affordability and we want them now it's time to hold drug makers accountable and put patients at a profit they ... they have their lobbyists\nAnd there are hundreds of millions of dollars but we have our voices are stories in our votes it's time to end the drug maker monopoly pricing power and stop them from overcharging the American people it's time once and for all the ... parents ahead of profits enough is enough citizens for truth in drug pricing\nI Want to share something with your ... the conversation I had this morning that I was reporting for us stepping in rural of MSNBC um there's about another forty seconds of it and you did not get to hear that I wanted to do to you to hear the end of the conversation because as you can see\nIt was rather um eventful uh she she is insistent that the president of the United states is dog whistling has always been dog whistling uh in order to reach his base of white nationalist when he said he's a nationalist I explained very clearly that no he was comparing nationalism to global as a\nMatter of fact I Wish I'd had this queued up or I Would have played this at the time but you do remember this one the president pulled out of the Paris climate accord right\nI was elected to represent the citizens of Pittsburgh not parents you know what that means\nWell the United states first not the people of the world first that's what nationalism is what does it have to do with white nationalism what does it have to do with anything having to do with race but that's what the left tries to do so I Want you to ... to go back here just a little bit\nWe play a little bit of the stuff and he wrote conversation that I had already play and let the thing finish out and I don't want your reactions eight eight eight nine seven months age eight eight eight nine seven ... seven to for three\nGive this all is that the president Stephanie the president very clearly in Houston\nVery clearly defined what he means by comparing nationalism to globalism\nNot comparing whites to blacks not comparing white America to to minority America he said global is think about the globe burst in our country second a nationalist think about our country first and the globe second I'm a nationalist he made it very clear\nThat this had nothing to do with white nationalism and it seems like people are going out of their way to find fault with it\nThen we're going to agree to disagree given president history on racial issues giving his professional history given his father's professional history\nI prefer ... extra careful in his word choices especially as we go interaction where he is capitalizing on ... so we're going to agree to get where we\nStarted well yeah we we certainly are but what I Want to know is ... how it is that you are going to take the position you are when he defined globalism before defining what he means when he says nationalism you can't put words in people's mouths and I feel like that's not cause it sounds like what you're doing stuff and\nI'm not putting anywhere in his mouth what I Will be able to do is look back on many many things that President has said over the years and it's why it makes me feel uncomfortable\nOkay what what exactly has the president said recently about this issue that makes me feel so uncomfortable has been you know your your expertise is is largely in economics you or your you know Bloomberg TV a editor as well you're a former anyway you know you so given all of your economic history the president is largely talking about global or a nationalism in globalism\nIn were you know it matters of trade you know he has often said look we're going to stop other countries from taking advantage of the United states if I have to use tariffs if I have to start trade wars in order to make sure that we get a better game for our market\nIs that right now is not not economic nationalism but is that not economic nationalism is my question not\nIf you look at the way the president of south that gives you the truth\nIs that an impact he would engage in things like PC to point out and partner with our line\nOf attack definitely rural thank you for coming on the first year that she is on Sunday that live at the top of\nThat music can be on there of course was uh the end of the top of a interview that I did with a Seventy role this morning so that was a replay of this morning's conversation that I had there and I'm waiting for that and um but what I Want to get to and I want you to respond to is this an eight eight eight\nNine seven on stage um she said she's not putting words in the president's mouth\nBut she is doing exactly that she is saying that the president is talking about white nationalism the president said globalism nationalism global just put the world's first in our country second national is put our country first and the rest of the world's second I'm a nationalist she and Jim Acosta are saying\nNext news in one hour or online

who's you've met John Brennan before I\nYeah I mean he's turned out to be such a a political hack it's it it really is almost sad to see and then when the president does reach out his hand and he does say something to try to unify the country in the wake of this or you know these are terrorist bombing mailings and stuff than the Democrats just sort of slap his hand to hand that way but\nAh John Brennan is not done a good service to to this country and you know Democrats are always take this attitude that the divisiveness in this country haven't unified ... when they lose\n[laughter] you know

holding [noise]\nOh [laughter] oh welcome back every one way to fix for seven six weeks I'm Mark who's singing Leesburg, Florida hey mark\nHey Brian how you doing good where do you think about all these we have nine shepherd packages now what do you think the overall aim is it's got to be from the same people\nSure um first of all you can leave your shirt on TALK and you got to make a statement gets simple God she's a rubber Graham shirt\nOh really okay yeah I'm I think it's a group of people I think it's multiple people that are doing this um\nI don't think it's just one person I think they want to make an impact they didn't go after the Democrats and they didn't they didn't target both of them because they wanted to make an impact so they just went up to the Democrats debate you know if Trump a hard time I think it's um it's a group of them not just one mile without work in a group\nLike they did with Kavanaugh ethic that's what the problem is that I think you're going to find it that one it's a bunch of\nWho it is the you know mark they got to balance you know that there's some they put this together like we can't even imagine like no show a show runner has ever put together\nAny type of drama on TV they're putting something together I think maybe even within our show we're going to begin to get some clues on this because you're delivering nine shepherd packages in five different states to all these different locations somebody slipped up\nFor the all went to one place and fanned out we can track it that way they're even tracking where the envelopes were made let alone the labels who may let alone with the ... bought they could do all of that thanks so much more of an interesting theory one eight six six for all eight seven six six I FBI's run ...\nNews saw not one of them are loose on down\nI mean we know a couple of things where if it is true and it's a dummy device who we wouldn't be able to detonate I Wonder what we can learn from it and how much danger postal workers were in UPS drivers were in\nAnybody was and how far did he get now we know it wasn't going to get close to the Clintons house we got the George towards his mailbox we know got to Brock Obama's didn't get to his house we got to his location where his mails distributed or John Brennan was actually send to CNN even though he doesn't work there\nAnd they spelled his name Ron Eric Holder Maxine Waters that too and now you're Robert De Niro and Joe Biden it didn't get to actually to their house and I'm Wondering where are the those people who were handling it if it was a legitimate bomb if it turns out not to be were they in danger and do we have to amend the system again\nYeah I think that uh will again remains to be seen if the devices or actually did it have a running timer attached to some sort of power source of battery a battery device within the timer uh the clock mechanism is there a power source there\nThat that could have actually triggered these devices good\nQuestion secondarily if if certain mishandling a balancing the devices around a machine sorting the devices\nOr of a sufficient to you know potentially trigger that can cause a an injury or death or or maiming somebody look if if black powder in uh in in a one inch PVC pipe with glass it sorted all that PVC is potential shrapnel as well\nOr the glasses potential shrapnel could you kill somebody could you blind them could you maimed somebody\n... you know cause them to lose a hand an arm um because of the the amount of black powder that's all in my mind a possibility this is a dangerous device even if it could have been triggered by the clock because the the person didn't have the technical\nSkill right to detonate this is still a very dangerous to\nIran I just want to get your mind taking in twisting around just to see what other conclusions you get do so we pulled Mary Ellen O'Toole a she's a profile or oh she was on CBS this morning this is what she would simmered conclusions go on\nI Would be looking at the forensic and as a result um and also the behavior it's a combination of the two so for example the FBI lab will be looking at the functionality on these devices are they intentionally not working or are they not exploding because of some problem\nUm and if that's the case if they are intentionally designed not to explode but to create fear and panic um and then we can possibly expect to see an escalation and sands another batch of bombs that come out [noise]\nUm this suggests to me that this is someone that really planned this out quite well so we should not assume that mistakes that we see in the posting of the package as our mistake the main thing done purposefully there's also an arrogance about the about these bombings\nThis is someone who um is creating a great deal of fear and panic and New York and then on the D.C area and he's enjoying that my sense is that that sense of power and control and I met the counts that he's getting out of really being the center of attention now throughout the country and it's probably like an artist\nAnd housing ... or how they're faring attacks ...\nWow the word of bombs is that your fear was that you worry\nThat that is a concern some of these folks who are building devices are very often are testing them beforehand I think we saw that with the that Chelsea bomb\nI'm worried that the guy had been created some other devices with testing them near his house a bad happens with some of these guys and so how does he evolved from this does he is he fearful because of this big law enforcement response right you have\nFBI Secret Service New York police department post ... ... postal inspectors um US Capitol police are engaged in this so far and other law enforcement as well um does that make him fearful and say holy crap I'm going to get caught and he pulls back\nOr does it empower him and it hasn't Mary Ellen was saying does it in Boulder him is that the rush he's looking for and say look look at the that the power that I hold you see sometimes this with our son is who are ... they they are they start a fire and they pulled back to watch the response that excites them [noise]\nSo what kind of a fender do we have a you know the next few days may tell us that\nYeah my lines are jammed I Want to let the people talk for a while but before we go can you let me know what it's like in New York New York has got the sense that they can do things themselves and maybe they earned that right that we have a very uh steamed counterintelligence operation at the same time the FBI comes in and they want to run things\nAre they ... the joint terrorism task force or they clashing do you know how they're doing right now\n[laughter] yeah I think we we have some good leadership up there I Know a bill Sweeney the assistant director charged a friend of mine\nUh Brian ... and I just saw him uh about ten days ago down and down in Orlando a runs counter terrorism for the FBI the J. T. F. John Miller is an FBI alumni I think those relationships have matured and moved in the right direction\nI don't think ... particularly because these devices are popping up and other places around the country [laughter]\nNYPD understands if it's terrorism the FBI takes the lead I think that department gets it um and that these relationships are mature enough now\nThat look this is a combination a team effort not a one department effort a ... at the FBI as I understand that the FBI has taken the lead on evaluating these devices out at the lab in Quantico\nThis should be a team sport right now we need the team to come together I think these participants get that\nGot a Ron thanks so much shrink wrapped\nAround us go a former deputy director the FBI or every line is Jim I'm going to try to

Newsroom on Fox News channel given idea what's on your mind would take some calls it also go over there\nAnd which gone off for proven to be a lethal or even actual uh but the materials they're the intentions there and the targets are certainly there and they're all famous and you know all of them and they're all Democrats who are critics of President Trump what it means we'll be following but first let's get stores\nNow with the things you need to know who the power of three Brian's big numbers\nWere just Thirteen Days away from a very very important election is at a lecture of\nJust if you look at it monumental importance isn't it wouldn't you say monument\nEverybody or so that is interesting the president's talking about a monumental a midterm yes but he was somewhat subdued because what happened during the day but I think very much responsible if you want to know how the house and Senate will go looking in Wisconsin look at the governor's race where Walker trails\nNumber than best skater so now studying at least nine suspicious packages that were sent a prominent Democrats and critics of President Trump the latest was addressed to actor Robert De Niro and found in lower Manhattan this morning\nA night suspicious package was found this morning the last two in Delaware the latest address a vice president Joe Biden and Robert De Niro production companies you just heard I'll bring you the latest [noise]\nNumber one I\nWas just a week ago that the press that was it was all thing the fact that Congress men have body slammed the reporter well if you're four or five violence and your speech is\nPeople are going to hear that we don't know who deliver their farms but odds are there was someone who is hurt the president's Madison had acted on it so he bears responsibility for this\nYou know I it David Axelrod and he's the one I count on on the left to also be a level head [noise]\nLittle surprised me with this because do you blame the President Obama for the shooting in South Carolina where the shooting at Sandy Hook he was president at the time he went to use rhetoric who is different but it happened during his tenure this is the president's style you think that these pro shooting that people might interpret it that\nThe seeds or some unrest is a er during when he was a campaigner\nAnd he saw someone recipe so you know there was a time in which we ah you know we hit the guy\nI don't really think that that gets you nine a package bombs [noise]\nA series of pipe bomb strikingly similar targets prominent dams and CNN [noise] what do they have in common they all spin they're waking hours critical of the president who do they blame for the mail bombs to the president is that fair I mean think about this\nNinety two percent of all coverage is negative if you look at other channels they have a panel sometimes of eight or ten and seven dislike the president some of which you have ... beans popping out of their next with their ... their hate for him\nDon't you think that has a lot to do with the fact that there might be some ... in the country it's not just coming from the president you just don't like the fact that he is president like his tone in tenure or you don't care I think he is legitimate which is pretty much the story of from the start\nSo what do we know we know these people have been targeted by vice president Joe Biden Maxine Waters Debbie Wasserman Schultz Eric Holder John Brennan Brock Obama Hillary Clinton George Soros and George George started it off\nI don't think the president's responsible for that but what I Love to see a reset between the media and the president after the midterms yeah before that I'm not too sure to work after the first one didn't\nBut maybe the president after getting his feet and read them for the last two years\nAfter getting the mother investigation over a that lasted two years if that kids over and he merges unscathed which I expect him to maybe he's going to take that time and who would not say yes\nThe New York times Chuck Todd ... come to the White House three of the two or three of the ... excuse me or the the White House or a Trump Tower one day and you say listen I'm going to come to New York like to see you guys and then he go to Washington to me with some different reporters\nAnd then you have off the record conversations where people get the air out the main problem with them\nI don't think anybody could say he's not accessible now I Know is one on one interviews he gives more Fox but boxers what more fair to him and then the other channels so I don't think they necessarily good or bad I think they're more fair\nSo and I know we've got a lot of lying to you what I'm going to do is go on America's Newsroom shortly\nAt which time we'll talk a little bit about what I'm doing tomorrow night where everyone everyone who joined me at St Louis county library\nSo that I'm going to be coming in going right to the stage and we see now with mark Cox and we're going to have a great time up you have some tickets there and you'll get a book with every ticket and I'll be able to sign them personalize them\nAnd it's all about thanking the listeners in St Louis who keep us or one of the top are chosen the entire area\nThen I'm going to do the same cocoa Louisiana with Andrew Jackson America New Orleans I didn't get a chance to go the first time to Baton Rouge on Saturday and on Sunday I'm going to be an Octavia books at one o'clock flying at about five o'clock back in New York about eight o'clock eight nine o'clock\nAnd they're ready for Monday I'm and Monday will be on the five Tuesday I'll be on Martha it's going to be a crazy couple of weeks but have not been able to talk about history and uh about the history book for obvious reasons\nUh we got a series of package bombs nine and\nUh would be bombed devices and I said devices because it's not been proven that any of these packages would've blown up their looks like there's powder on the inside shards of glass on the inside on the outside it looks like a bomb\nBut for the most part there is no proof that it'll blow up but it almost says the same effect thankfully it didn't because a lot of innocent people would have been hurt and a lot of prominent people would have been hurt if it did\nHowever but it's not going to hurt the president or the former President Bill Clinton or Barack Obama because they've been screened for George Soros he's smart enough to leave his mailbox outside as compact\nSo that got him there forward in Delaware and never got to Joe Biden but two packages were intended in Los Angeles it was intended for Maxine Waters in Washington DC in Florida down in Miami southern Florida that was intended older return addresses were for Debbie Wasserman Schultz\nIn Washington Eric Holder the former attorney general has been a big critic of the president might be running against him he also\nWas targeted so the people that block for all these prominent people would have been hurt but we know it's the same on blow up the same boat we're up on the inside the same printing or they say it's the same printing\nThat's on the label and then the return address is all Debbie Wasserman Schultz jumper and his name is not spell correctly they also have\nA mocking sticker on it it mocks ISIS one device or at least one has a parity ISIS flag and as

doctors will simply write the script just to get things moving along and that's\nKinda why the drug industry now puts more money into marketing that does into research because they know what's affective they all knew to get everybody\nDemanding a prescription med or a brand name at what they need to get it it's just a significant number to make it defensible and justifiable and keep you in the brand name fold and that's where part of the problem is\nAnd let's also underline this point Clark and that is there are only two nations in the entire world that allows so called direct to consumer advertising a prescription drugs and that off\nAnd New Zealand and that's it\nEvery other country especially developed countries like us have looked at that practice and said no we see that as doing more harm than good because let's face it these decisions are meant to be made by trained licensed health care professionals and not\nAmateurs like you and me and everybody listening and therefore it doesn't serve the public interest to do that in fact the American Medical Association has called for an end to this practice because they see it as just inflating drug prices and scaring people into expensive treatment regimens there would be much cheaper alternatives for\nSo is it best what you and I can do is we can't change that momentum we're not that powerful sorry changed that momentum so we've got to drill back to basics and that is the core most of us are going to do just fine\nWith the generic mad that already exists\nFor a condition that ails us\nI think that's absolutely true I think also people need to be more open minded to the idea that their doctor when they come back at you with\nA idea that well there is a generic or there was an alternative drug you might want to explore the cheaper or covered by your insurance you certainly want to listen because this is somebody who is a read all of the academic papers and on all of the research that you haven't done so you want to listen to that person\nAnd I would also encourage people to write to their elected representatives because indeed if we do want to try to bring the drug industry focused once again on curing ailments as opposed to moving product getting rid of these direct to consumer ads would be a big step in the right direction because that's\nBillions of dollars that would therefore be redirected backing to more useful endeavors such as basic research and wouldn't require me to explain to my son what he does want or watching sports together on TV\n\n[laughter] was gosh I Can't get past the revenue explained that to your side anyway the best thing you said is that there are now spending more money on this marketing and they're spending on are indeed to actually make drugs that will improve people's lives and that is a real miss direction a national wealth\nTo have all that money go into the ads and so don't let them change your mind don't like those ads influence what you are going to consult with your doctor about\nIn fact even pay attention to those ads because let's face it they are not imparting sufficient amount of information for you to make an informed

situation\nThat cause us to take a look at our auto insurance because we ah we added another car we had really looked at it in a while\nThe kind of realize we might be paying too much for auto insurance and we started looking at our policy and we're kind of trying to figure out where we can save money with where everything's set out as far as our coverage so we're going to be adding a six sixteen and Seventeen year old son onto the policy within the next six months\nOh oh oh oh I\nJust add your wallet just take that and I even stab your wallet a lot 'cause that's what happens when you get a teen driver on your insurance\nYes you know we're lucky enough though that we didn't have to buy the car\nTrue so or saving money there\nAny of the cars you have old enough that you can avoid taking a coalition and comprehensive on that vehicle\nYes and that's a matter of trying to sell that to my wife but that was one of the first thought so had along with um raising our deductibles\nYeah I'm a ... fan and raising deductibles okay\nAnd try to raise those two thousand that's usually if you're going to have any vehicle you have has alone that may be the max here allowed to raise it to\nOkay but that helps and we were five hundred now so\nHe has to raise it to the thousand because you don't want to make a five hundred a claim on something between five hundred thousand dollars

now wow\nHow can I be of service because that's a shocking thing\nWe were just wondering what looks America in a lump sum or taking a a month or distribution [noise]\nSo if we just look at the dollars and cents or without looking at her individual plan almost always and it's not a hundred percent of time but it's close\nIt's better to take the monthly payment from them than it is to take the lump sum but you since you told me it's a retailer you kind of not me back on my feet because that creates a different concern\nHow solid financially as this retail\nThat we don't we don't know well\nYou have real ends to doubt how viable they might be\nOh yeah\nYou do that would mean that even though the odds are overwhelming there would be better for your wife to take a monthly check in this case she ...\nWhat about taxes another\nLump sum was that the tax at our current rate or whatever the or extract that flow from won't be\nYes that was when you get a lump sum distribution you get clobbered on tax in the year you receive it\nYeah that's the only reason I Do want to take it because that was for the for the very top tax bracket\nSo here's the thing if you take the monthly check and she was there a long long time there is a cause I federal agency called the pension benefit guarantee corporation so if at some point the company she works for or fails to you know ceases to excess fails and they're done\nThe pension liability is turned over\nTo this agency the pension benefit guarantee corporation and they have a formula based on how large a pinch and your wife would be receiving what kind of haircut she'd get how much\nOf her pension she would actually have reduced that she would receive from then forward from this ... federal agency so residents scary the rights of the risk to her is this is you know if this was a company that was\nDoing great and reporting huge profits and their future looked great far out into the future\nThen you take the monthly check\nIs almost always the monthly check him pews higher return and then you're going to be able to generate on your own on this pension distribution but the lump sum you know she gets the money\nSo I always tell people take the monthly check unless you're worried about the company's finances\nOh I don't know which way to go\nI think it's a matter of let's look at it this way if\nShe takes the monthly check and let's say three four or five years from now they fail\nWith it or is it just demolish your quality of life and your ability to afford things or would it be more like a well we're not going to have that money every month but will still be okay\nHarold ... well\nIf it's an old well and you're going to be fine either way take the monthly check if it's money that's do or die for you as a couple I Would take the level of some\nSoccer clubs straight to the\nSo and I would I Would say with her as well because she worked there for so long psychologically it may bother her a lot if you know the pension stops for is a new wouldn't be stop it would be greatly reduced in the event of a failure\nGreat\nDoes that help okay here's here's with us\nToday 'cause you know I'm fortunate enough to have a pension benefit that I have to choose at some point lump sum or receive as a lifetime benefit and these are tough decisions how to choose Sheryl is with us on the Clark Howard show hello Cheryl\nHi how are you great thank you\nYeah like I said as I heard an advertisement I'm On the radio about real estate company in that um next after their wailing ten can be a fair market price on your home without fixing it up or getting anywhere pairs [noise]\nEither will sell your house and six six or less guaranteed are Dale by it or that market price that they offered to an adequate seemed to get to the train of thought to check with him\nResidential real estate is a very high interest item right now so there are local real estate offices\nLocal individual but high volume sellers and national offers where they say we not only will market your house but if it does not sell we guarantee that will be the purchaser\nMhm and as for what the purchase period is most often what I've seen is he said six weeks for the one you saw\nI think for most of them I've seen are twelve weeks [noise] 'cause normally for someone to effectively market your home\nThey need typically a three month window\nBut anyway if you found somebody who says six weeks fine\nSo these come in two types one is selling distressed real estate let's say you're having to sell the house of a loved one who died near the administrator executor exact a trip that's one kind or the other is where you're selling your own home\nYou know you're having to relocate was somewhere else or you've already done if I had the home you want to move to you need certainty getting your house so so in that environment is not a distress sale it's not a house that's falling apart or anything like that\nAnd you're just looking for certainty that the sale will go through and you're not going to get stuck with two house payments with these things the key test\nIs they offer they make as to what their fallback price would be ... is it one you can live with\nYeah actually the price that they offered her family to trick to pray and ... and it couldn't add on I was actually surprised I thought it would be way under\nThe un I think that's fine if it gets you the peace of mind that you're working for mhm and you know the six weeks out if it's not sold in the open market you're out of that house why not\n[laughter] if they are saying that they charge you X percent there that have been like a fair price\nSo what they do now do you pay six percent commission if they find a buyer you discount the price six percent if they're the buyer okay is that right\n[laughter] beret and you had six percent that included the buyer and seller for if they buy it outright adult now and they just kept that are not\nNormally they would they would have some discount that would be the equivalent of a commission from the price they are offering you and I have no problem with that\nI've had I've had so you got to be the right person though you got to be the person you need to be done with it and you know that you'll be out of the house at that point to pay the price they offer use reasonable why not have that certainty\nFound it and I and I hope I don't hear back from you at some point six weeks come and gone and made it an honor the deal I Hope he does not so I Will tell you that that's never happened before\nOh okay well again no one's ever called me and said that I'm not going to say that they haven't ever done that to somebody with one of these all can I get from one of these companies but nobody's ever given me that feedback thing that's unusual what you said Sheryl is it the purchase price they're offering you\nIs there a fallback price is in your words spot on and that's not what I usually heard from people usually I've heard that\nIt's a price that the person calling me feels is below market but in your case you've got nothing to lose if the price they're offering is at market\nJoel you and I should test this ourselves yeah we sell our houses you know I don't want to do that you you're listening to the Clark Howard show [noise]\n\n\n\nMessage ... burning your degree

oldest okay\nAll right and um well I mean you get yourself out of debt and the other kids as they come up and do you can do whatever you want to do with them in terms of uh you know activities in sports\nWe decided was that all of this is for fun\nBecause um I mean Daniel my son played ice hockey all the way up through high school we knew at six years old he was not going to play and then I show right we we're pretty sure at that point you know and uh so we made decisions to invest in ice hockey to have fun\nRight not because we were trying to create a future career for him lane and\nNot play we ... the ... there are a couple of different options and when we put Atlanta it's less than half the cost of the others yeah\nYou know and you know so parents go bananas on this stuff is my point and on some of them you know they spend ten thousand bucks on whatever and you know in a sport that the kid is never going to go pro probably not even going to get a scholarship\nAnd all your does burn up the kid and a half your budget but seven hundred and fifty bucks is not the case the year ... you know you just got to be but you do need to get what it does is it makes you stop and get pause enough you called me that's pretty cool\nYeah he paused and he went crap I got to think about this and so you know just try to find you a trade off to innocence pay for it or we're gonna you know in a sense we're going to knock this out\nDylan is with us in Indianapolis Hi Dylan how are you\nLike forty seven dollars I'm not over budget as things stand now um we had back in\nDown in our account and that is almost twelve to Fifteen hundred dollars in the ...\nThat the bank to far overdraft has to do that\nI mean why why did the bank charge you anything if there was a ... to\nMe it well it was ... that was charged to our account\nI Know but if it's identity theft or banks shouldn't be charging you anything\nWell they did and they said there was nothing they can do about it a lot can change banks\nYeah we did okay wait we actually closed banking and we just have a debit card that um it's like one of those little Walmart orange you know so we don't even go through the banks anymore mhm it's just a debit card [noise] but um they charge us\nLike six nearby six hundred dollars in overdraft mhm and they wouldn't take them back mhm but down\nHere in that time because that was going on we got behind on our house payment\nAnd I'm ... thanks for the smaller next that we had well we got the smaller and I said but we're still have a hand on our house I've talked to the housing alone people and they're working with is that we're having to pay extra a month on our mortgage payment\nSure how old are you going to\nPick a nine so I'm fifty nine and a thick the mom Seventy nine so\nAre you guys on some kind of a fixed income for some reason\nThis disability out three other and none of you were able to work you know I Do a little sad business with crafts and things like that\nWas the nature of your disability\nUm is a hip displacement what's wrong with him um he had um as a broke his back uh-huh and he has a um\nBase of the bone sticking close to his nerves sack mhm and he also had a triple bypass surgery a few years ago when he has a defeat the later and he's\nGot like twenty five percent of his heart beating so mhm okay um well\nWhat what you guys have more than anything else is an income ... right due to the fixed income and that's why I was exploring the question that does sound like you've got some pretty serious limitations\nUm but what I'm going to do if I'm In your shoes is where you kind of started doing there with the crafts\nAnd even in his shoes are obviously none of you all are going to be involved in physical labor of any kind right on crime but if there was something that you could\nDo like I talked to a lady the other day who was just going to garage sales and she was buying clothing for a quarter and a nickel showing it on ... for a dollar and two dollars and she had done that like ten thousand times I made like ten thousand dollars\nMhm okay\nAnd that doesn't involve any heavy lifting obviously involved the keystrokes on the computer to set up an ... account and sell some stuff only but I'm not saying that's what you do I'm just saying that something like that that is\nThat that that is in the line with the limitations that you guys have because if we can add a thousand dollars a month only your world it would change your life\nWouldn't it it really I guess or\nBe dramatic and how old is mom\nMom Seventy nine\nAnd how much of this thirty four forty two comes from her\nEleven forty seven\nYeah she passes where you don't get a real problem\nCorrect\nWe've got to solve some of the income issue one way or another here um and how much is your house payment\nRight that's\nThat's that's just due to taxes and insurance going\nUp probably right now and what's the home worth\nIt for a ride out of hiding in honor of ... when we only want to go to this you know I sure would be good when you know\nSo I think more than anything the the the magic wand here is some kind of an idea for you to create some income and I don't know what that is but I Want the three of you to sit around and talk about what you could do a ... year obviously not going to do anything this physical\nI get that you got some serious limitations I understand that and I'm not picking on you know I'm just trying to help you a buddy man a thousand dollars a month would change your whole life\nThousand dollars a month for a year and you pay the house off\nAnd that'd be rid of that payment and then when mom passes you're not in a problem and right now you'd be in a serious problem two thousand dollars a month income change\nYou feel like you were rich like you were a multi millionaires or something it would change your life that much and so in is that possible yes that is possible\nIt's very possible but you need some income ideas some things you can do jump and it's probably something you jump on the computer and sell something or\nWhatever and again it doesn't I don't want to put a bunch of strain on you physically but um you know I'm having an intelligent conversation with you over the phone so you could have an intelligent conversation with somebody over the phone and sell them something\nRight and that that's a possible thing you can do um the the you know and it doesn't cause you to\nWork forty hours a week necessarily but if you could do anything that creates a thousand two thousand dollars a month it would change your world and that's that's really what I Would work on rather than try to solve the forty seven dollar problem\nThat you've got what that is a symptomatic of the fact that you're struggling with income and legitimately ... your struggle it's my pleasure lazy or something like that but it just hand\nIf you could come up with any kind of a small business idea that your husband than you could do together um and just get them to get the needle to move a little bit here man it would change everything\nFor you I thank you for the call open phones a triple eight eight to five five two to five Benjamin is in Oklahoma City Hi Benjamin how are you\n... how are you better than I deserve what's up\n[noise] so my wife and I graduated college about a little over a year ago\nAnd we got a good job good and bought a house good and I'm Wondering in your eyes or does it get in on what are we paid it off about ... ... in your eyes or you're paying\n... from a financial perspective is a good time to\nStart thinking about having kids 'cause she thought life being pushy and that it I'm sure mhm ah so I just wanted to get your thoughts on it\nNow I was actually the one the only kids faster than Sharon ... who she won but I'm\nA I I don't think that there is a financial manager other than just being completely crazy like if you don't have sixteen kids if you're broke that stupid okay that was crazy but you guys are in great shape your sharp young couple whenever you're ... whenever you're emotionally in relation to ready to have kids and God's says it's okay to have kids\nDon't have kids I I don't I don't tell people that need to be out of debt and have their emergency when there's not a baby step for kids\nUm you know you don't have to be a certain place you're going to be fine a child is not going to destroy your life financially or as a matter\nAbout oh ... five hundred and sixty two thousand dollars to re route really not really they eat the same broccoli you eat after a certain point there in the in the same warm house you're already in after a certain point and so the actual cost of a kid is just not that is not devastating\nBut again you don't want to just load up a whole house full of them if you're broke and that that will cause a problem\nBut to decide to have your first couple of children\nI mean it's that's not something that's between you and God and your wife\nAnd you guys are in good shape\nFinancially smart you're already moving in the right direction\nYou want to start now it doesn't bother me at all this is Dave Ramsey

old daughter and so we're not quite to the college saving yet\nBut we do have grandparents that instead of buying a Christmas gift their birthday presents would like to uh put away for her college savings and I'm just wondering what's the best way for them to go about that [noise]\nUm I Would go ahead and open the child and e essay and educational savings account how much money are they talking about that they want to put in the\nHaven't really decided but growing up I was giving savings bonds and they don't really want to do that I could I don't know if they're thinking like a hundred dollars or you know each birthday and H Christmas I'm not sure okay\nOn where you can open some mutual funds as little as two hundred and fifty dollars others five hundred no there's a thousand minimum to get them open okay but you're going to open an educational savings account in a mutual fund an e as say\nIt requires because the child is a minor that someone be in charge of the can't be the custodian that would be you all\nRight I and then your mom and dad can or his mom and dad can add to the child's educational savings account the only limit is you cannot put a total between all of view of more than two thousand dollars a year into that account\nSo that you can in a five twenty nine but more than that but you know we're not talking about that being a problem we're looking at the minimum and you've just got to get some money scrape together to do a lump sum to start\nThe mutual fund you know so maybe two or three people put some money to get maybe just put it in a savings account to get up to five hundred and then you open the say\nGreat that is a lot of health thank you\nCan't just check in with your smart vest or pro when they can help you get that done Lisa is with

you having a career problem or something else\n[noise] no I've been a teacher for eleven years and I love what I Do and even though I Am I make forty cheap housing ... channels\nAnd put it into that account because I might not reached a thirty six thousand just cash flow and get something my salary\nMhm board of the penalties for\nWithdrawing or should I Do that one of the penalties for withdrawing I don't read for\n... yeah it's about fifty per se or ... percent on taxes are but I I really don't need the\nEntire emergency fund I currently have thirty thousand a month to keep taking Fifteen thousand and put it to that I can rebuild my retirement my emergency found in about three months\nIf you don't need it why would you rebuild it\n\nI mean I don't have to have all the thirty thousand I just built it because I feel very comfortable with having that is a cushion\nRight and what is your income a year\n\nAbout a hundred and sixty\nOkay so what is three to six months of expenses\n\nIt is about to join the three thousand\nOkay that would ... that'd be three months or six months\nThat will be fifth month\nOkay All right so you can be within the range of three to six months of expenses at Fifteen thousand and um if you want to use some of that money that's fine and if you want to build it back up to six months later that's fine but it doesn't sound like you need more than twenty five thousand ever in your emergency fund\nYes but I'm not a citizen here I'm also not a U.S citizen I'm I work here on my now ex patriot and I just feel more comfortable because if I Need to leave the country I have about sixty days to get all my affairs in order and leave\nMhm\nOkay so you're just going to keep a little extra will show went out and that's why I feel more happens if that ... that event occurs a while you're down on cash because you've funded this thing\n\nSo it's very unlikely um I just received a new role and at least for the next two years I'm probably very safe at my work life\nMhm okay\nThe thing is is here here's what's bothering me is the proper amount a house in your emergency there's thirty thousand dollars and the answer is no\nShe use emergency funds for emergencies period if the proper amount to have in your emergency fund which means you should end up there is Fifteen thousand twenty thousand then don't have more than that later\nShow you decide what the proper amount in an emergency fund is when all the smoke clears but don't tell me you're using your emergency fund to fund this and then you're going to put it back which\nTells me you don't agree you know you've got the and your mind the proper amounts thirty grand I think is what you're saying and so the answer is no don't put the money and retirement don't use your emergency money to do that but if you're willing to reassess your emergency fun and say I've got this thing over funded\nGoing to back it down in the twenty range then I might go ahead and do this deal\nA because we're not there but but if you think you need to keep thirty thousand dollars around for emergencies didn't keep thirty thousand dollars around ...\nAnd don't monkey with it as emergency fund is is is foundational before you move on to investing of any kind so you got to decide your definition that's what I was poking around on I'm trying to figure out what you really need slash want and it sounds like emotionally given the unusual situation that you're in you want to keep thirty grand around\nAnd so you should keep thirty grand around\nIf that's it don't mess with that but if not if you're going to permanently lower it then use some of that money to do this then hey I'm just fine with that a cage is with us in Salt Lake City Hi cage how are you\nDave how's it going better than I deserve what's up [noise]\nHey thanks for taking my call today I'm I'm a college student I'm two semesters away from graduating with my bachelor's degree in finance um but the more that I go through school and the more that I listen to you it makes me want to really make a living being a financial ... many years ago and still today [noise]\nUm so I was just wondering I Want to get your advice on whether you think it still possible or somebody like me to run their type of fitness that maybe you're biased on [noise] the best business model to maximize success on the early going up starting\nOkay well the um you know the based financial coaching where you pay someone pays you a fee just to sit down and do one on one coaching which we do some here and we go we we have a program where we certify people that do that\nThat come through our training to do that is it's difficult to make a living exclusively doing that\nUh because it's it's a very much uh the inventory is your hours in the day and you have to sell enough of your hours in the day for enough money to equal a good living\nAnd I can be done\nBut are coming straight out of school difficult to do\nI'm not saying that can't be done but I'm just saying it's not it's not a slam dunk okay it's not an eighty thousand dollar your job your first or two years out\nIt's going to take you a while to build up the thing you could do is you could go into the financial services world like on the brokerage side and work with someone like one of our smart Mr prose as an example and those guys are in the business gals are in the business of selling investments\nAnd there's nothing there's there's nothing that preempts you as a matter of fact that it's almost paramount that you do coach\nPeople while you're selling them an investment so that they don't get into the wrong investment you're teaching them you're helping them make decisions\nBut in the process of doing that then you know you're making a commission and there's nothing wrong with that it's like when you're selling so I'm On a home you're coaching them and this house was gonna you know it's going to be pretty you know based on your income is is a really out of your ranger coaching someone if you're a realtor and telling them that you're in a sense your financial coaching them\nAnd so but you get paid a commission when they buy a house and so\nBy gets paid a commission as a conflict of interest and keeps them from doing the right thing by their clients is absolutely absurd there's plenty of people on strike commission with high levels of integrity that do the right thing so you might explore\nThat angle because truthfully you can make more doing that then you can just\nDoing a book billing by the hour and I'm not saying making more

and by the way it ever going to get into that I can spend it all\nA unlikely you'd probably right our ... like I said I Am parking\nAnd the culture in people think we're in the state because you're bringing their backup quarterback could mistreat charity to one trick pony you can't throw the ball down the deal it can't be short packet do I think when it first happened to be close\nBut when you bring that back in the second half I think it's going to pull them out and it scores and be like at Seventeen fourteen to like thirty five or forty five\n... because in the first half of the game but anymore polling second ... all of them out\nThe ... of them can get this when I'm I mean they have I mean I realize or some big games left Auburn in right now about you but this this is this when

question today is Arkansas football do you think shed Moore's can really turned the program around and make them a top for salt in football say\nYou tell a top ten in the country this or\nAh I don't have an answer for yet because ah I just don't think we've seen enough I don't think he's had a chance to put his program or or implement his program at some point we'll get to read but right now I I think I think the work is way too incomplete for me to make a prediction like that\nOkay well do you know how long you might say there you do think he has success or whatever\nBut I mean I I think he'll he'll say there are a considerable time or if he if he can get it going it's a really great place to be the fan bases phenomenal the support there is\nIs is as passionate as any place around but but but and I I don't want to just keep harping on what I said a minute ago but\nBut hey we don't know yet I mean he inherited a mess he's trying to change the culture change the direction change the the the scheme change change the overall philosophy and it's been a difficult turnaround but er when Saturday and\nUh it sets him up at least maybe even try to get a couple of winds down the stretch thank you very much for the call good to hear from you Shelly in Mississippi is up next\nHi Paul how there I have a couple of comments about land\nOn behalf of gator nation I like to apologize [laughter] listening to his rat I don't know he he's watching the world all all by itself we are a very good team right now we're not great we got a way to go but\nI like it to her head to flat land I Need him to bring it down a notch or take\nWell he's not going to Shelley because Lance uh only wants to hear him self talk\nI gathered that and I just cringe every county town because they just I feel like he makes us look like we're all fired up and thinking we're going\nWell that's what Missouri needs that they haven't had one of these in a while a program has been beaten are ranked team since uh back when Gary ... coach and in the last game that he coached and then and we talk about that's the next step and how you you become a more competitive team that\nUm you know the gains a little bit more notoriety when when you beat her ranked team in Missouri just hasn't done it yet\nUnder under Barry I mean this is a this is the best chance they're going to get the rest of the year ... next week they go to Florida and um it's a lot easier when you're at home and I I think they match up okay with this Kentucky team that Missouri favorite by touched on what kind of surprised main surprised a lot of people and\nThis is the opportunity that they want and and that drew lock needs to to Peter ranked team for the first time\nYeah I I listen to Vegas comes up with his own ideas but this Kentucky team has been undervalued all year long and\nEven a even in the a and M. game they lost a brother went over time so I mean it's not like this team is losing when even when a lawsuit is losing badly but let's talk about Missouri because it seems to me are you covered the team that they really let we'd get away\nAnd South Carolina beyond that I I Can't find much fall to winter Purdue looks really good now to\n[noise] yeah it does that South Carolina game it was such a weird game or the way that it on unfolded I mean really it was about seven minutes stretch where Missouri just kind of fell apart and and dug themselves too big of a whole a and and really that loss\nIt's sort of um it it gives you a different perspective on the whole season had had they won that game and you're looking at a schedule well you know they lost to Georgia and they lost at Alabama there's no shame in that um you know they've got winnable games down the stretch but but instead they had that three game losing streak and I and I think\nIn a year where they had to really went over some of the fans that they may have lost the last few years kind of at the bandwagon I'm part of the fan base\nThey just looked at and set off at at St Louis Missouri they they can't you know when a a a winnable game against a quality opponent or so it kind of it just pitch shifted the perspective on everything at that said they can they can change that sort of narrative if they win this game Saturday and then go down to Florida was a little bit of confidence but\nUm it has been kind of a strange here\nTo talk about let's say they win that's five when there's a you mentioned Florida a Tennessee remaining where in Arkansas by getting the schedule\nCorrect and then Vanderbilt yeah and so there there were there will be an opportunity I see where you see the path now that a wind here could give them a chance to have a pretty good year yeah\nI think it was always looking for progress you know they want seven games a year ago the schedule this year it was tougher when you when you go to Purdue instead of playing pretty at home and pretty obvious looks a lot better now than anybody thought going into the season or even back when he beat them\nA with a last second dries um you know and go into Alabama's is tougher than at any game you can have on the schedule so I think progress winning eight games in the regular season would be obvious\nProgress for this team anything else and you're you're kind of you know spinning your wheels a little bit and when you get a quarterback luxury locked to come back for a senior year\nI think you'd expect progress you expect to get better and they they still can obviously with the games ahead of them but\nAgainst the teams that they should beat and and right now I think you can probably say that is true for tendency Vanderbilt in Arkansas now you've got to game stretch here now against Kentucky in Florida\nDrawl I came into the season many believed it could be the top and the film pick a pies in conversation probably muted but still we all know what ... what he was and what we expected or how would you assess the season so far\nIt's been a little disjointed and and it's kind of follow the path of his career or he's played really well and the games where you expect Missouri to win or expect him to play well and then when he ... he didn't have a good game in Alabama and by no means as the the first quarter back to say that\nI thought he struggled at times against Georgia and and then at South Carolina\nIn that weird game where they just got hit with a monsoon and the second half he wasn't as best either but then he does what he usually does against a team like Memphis any bounce back and look great last week so\nI'm you know he is he his career and his sort of perception of his career is very much intertwined without him because he's the only starting quarterback modems ever had and Barry hasn't beaten rank game yet and and neither is drew so they're both kind of looking for that to\nKind of sad that label off of their reputation to get that kind of signature when and uh and obviously that would that would be true if he it'd be a really good defensive team in Kentucky I mean that there is no people out there maybe Missouri fans that I\nHaven't seen Kentucky play this year they're really good on that side of the ball so this is a big test for\nMissouri is respected day but but you you made a good point about trajectory and I was talking to one of your colleagues oh I don't know two three weeks ago and he was concerned\nAbout the the projections in the future is especially when it came when it comes to the fans are attendance or enthusiasm a frame all that for us and maybe what what is at stake here the rest of the way\nWell you know things changed in Missouri a lot in two thousand Fifteen when when Gary ... a retired you had the the protest on campus which included the football team that alienate apart the fan base I think they lost some fans that you're that that maybe they'll never get back and then it coincided with\n'em all of a sudden the program wasn't very good and they were losing more games and they had been accustomed to\nLosing under the peak tinkle years uh and so now you've got this rebuilding scratch with a new a e and a new new head coach a and you've gotta when people back and that's that's harder to do it a program without a great history and a great tradition\nAh when when you're when you're kind of rebuilding your roster and that's what they've been doing here\nYou know I I thought very made a great point this week uh and and the subtext was was obvious deceit and he pointed to what Kentucky has done under marks due to the patients they've\nThey've had with him or the resources have been given the disc facilities he's been given and now you've got a top Fifteen program there um so you know it's it's not always easy especially in this conference when you don't have the kind of resources and\nThe money and the tradition like the teams that you you play most weeks in this league or some Missouri's got kind of an uphill climb in this conference a but they they you know they proved in two thousand Thirteen two thousand fourteen they can be competitive\nAnd they can play meaningful games in the month of November in this league or it's just a little bit harder when you don't have necessarily the same traditions that resources and as big of a fan base as at places like Georgia and Florida and Tennessee\nWoods let's in to where we began and new it's talking about this game and I I think you you you've ... you've said it a couple of times reading are ranked team and I and I realized Kentucky is ranked in a a loss this weekend the last next week to Georgia and they may not be ranked for long but\nIs that really what's at stake here because it just seems like this program ... takes a few steps forward\nVery big steps are under Barry owe them that that could change yeah they're not\nI I you you just need to win games and you know whether the rank or not um I think you just need to show progress and you can't you can't go backwards and that that's something that Kentucky is done I mean they've they've they've always won more games or at least maintain what they've been doing under stoops I think\nIt's because they can do that they can build something here um you just can't take steps backward ... and especially when you have a dream come back\nA first senior year so I'm you know what that means they've got to win this week or go down and and upset Florida in the swamp or you got to show some progress here or can you can win seven games you can win ... games with Missouri schedule without beating ranked team but you know these are the kind of winds in it you know maybe you can\nEarn a little bit or respect that you might have lost during the losing losing ... recent losing season so I I think they've got enough talent to win this game I think they match up okay against what Kentucky to sensibly but they still got to go out there and get it done\n[noise] what's your thoughts are going to get it done this weekend\nWell good luck out to play really well you you can't turn the ball over against this Kentucky deep bench you're probably not going to see the ball very often because Kentucky likes to to run it and uh you know long without a car drives I I I think as you\nCan win this game will they haven't quite made a prediction\nYet um but I was trying to go to hell with help from you I\nI Do think that I'm I think they're kind of do to win a game like this you know that it had been closed in Sunday's game against better teams ranked opponents they just haven't been able to pull it out but it's going to be really close I don't I don't see their team really pulling away from the other one\nGood so great to talk to you again we will see you soon\nOkay thanks Bob de matter great journalist out there in Missouri from the St Louis Post Dispatch\nTalking about the importance of this game and and I'm I'm a I promise you I have great respect for Kentucky but I think it it is an indicator of how far Kentucky has come when Missouri is now is pointing toward a home game against Kentucky in saying that would be a signature when\nThat's what they're trying to they're now trying to emulate Kentucky\nWhere we'll be back much more to come\nThe fall five I'm show is brought to you in part by Schneider\nWhich has led the trucking industry since Nineteen thirty five Schneider is now hiring

an open book for anyone who would like to look deep into\nA my pastor even as recently as two years ago\nBut this made up perception\nOr or or costs as someone said something about something on on a on a Web post doesn't make it true and and when we're gentleman that called\nIn earlier and he talked about all these terrible officiating calls and I just didn't give me one and he couldn't do it couldn't Amy one I could have helped them by the way I I knew three or four that that were bad but he didn't but he but he's you're carrying on an area\nOf poll I have no problem with public debate I think it's part of the the greatness of your show your personality but I Do have a problem when it moves in to challenging people's integrity\nAnd their livelihoods without any proof and and that's the point I'm trying to make\n... and that I just think it's it's a slippery slope it shouldn't be allowed shouldn't be done by people can disagree with you in the civil way unfortunately we've lost a lot of civility in our society which is which is very\nYou know where you might think we've lost almost all of it frankly a criminal and it it will get worse over the next twelve days and no doubt about that and that's just the way that's the way people roll nowadays it's a it's a scorched earth uh\nAnd and again I'm I'm not going to get into\nThe rest of it but uh but you know the word tribalism probably overused in college athletics but it's certainly a political in this case\nWell you know it's funny how what am I good breakfast ... than he tends to blame things on play play calling from less miles a day which is almost like the curse of less models but uh\nUh uh I've never heard him blame any you know anything about fishy aiding and you know I liked I liked what Germany flu Pruitt did after the Alabama game which was talking about young men all on the table that was thrown out and said yeah he did it right in front of me and it you know he didn't complain about the call and\nAnd I again I just think that personal attacks and blaming people by name and attacking them as an appropriate as as my mentor from your home town of Memphis told me one job\nIt was a judge in North Carolina he said you know the the problem we have is a lot\nOf civility between strangers and I think we need more civility between ... between strangers\nWill say I'd always great to talk to you William\n\nI'm just looking down to the next car and taking holding my breath uh Darryl is next\nWow Daryl is still alive how about that huh the ban was a ... year like you're like I'm\nStuck his taken like a ... bed\nYeah have you say oh yeah that's what that's what this has been like okay I have a good evidence a lot I didn't realize how many cameras actually heightens your I mean you get your head on his too I mean I'm like what the hell no matter what the holy book\nBut um it's all good I just wish they were just lay off the death rate and that's what I don't play at the University of Alabama would agree with that at all nor would you like and that's beyond ... but you know it is what it is called the reason I called in mainly want us to talk about Georgia part of this but we know we do\nWhat what's your thoughts on the game we think will happen\nI I had a had a slight lean toward Georgia from the beginning of the week I was you know you I'm a broken record I like to get down there tomorrow and just go away the land spray was trying to talk me into into Florida so I have to listen to him before I make a macro final call but I I'm open you ... you got any help for me\nWhat I mean the only thing I Would say is Georgia's coming up laws okay and I think you just just just I really don't think George has eluded by Paul George because we're not that you're right now yeah I think George is with football game but let me say it it will tell you about Florida Islam operate at Florida losers withdraw do they all stay stuck around all the other thing that's about\nIt they went out and they go to an end to enroll his first year I think that is absolutely essential that is bad as I hate to admit it\nI Love seeing that because if we can get back to where they were at one time it torch maintain it which tells me back up there that will might be that much stuff\nRight now you're right that they've been on weight just sheer Darryl because of the the ineptitude of

all let's yeah well the strain probably a reason why the offerings per built bold tweeted at all and so I guess that's probably where we're heading without some of that right\nI I don't know right now I think there are a lot of the bowl games covered in Auburn Greg is up next Greg already had\n\nGreg you their garage while we're doing great thank you\nOr LSU by and I'm I'm not a conspiracy guy either so but my question was uh you know to the pre season polls come out every year and especially this year\nHow ah teams or talk the talk down up and down like are are bringing up three teams from this year that were uh\nI think a very uh but they didn't see what the same for going to be and I know is pre season poll but right you'd try for Florida this year and then all burn not not to my favorite things and then LSU and then\nThe talk about Florida was you know rebuild and you're a yadda yadda yadda not going to be very good my not my bowl game from all the different talking heads but you know then you get to Auburn man Auburn was going to be wrapped their neck and neck with Alabama\nAnd I hear all these guys they analyze this I guess what I'm getting at is you know here's what they said about all Bernard albums got a great quarterback got some good wide receivers in the defense is great but the whole time I'm sitting there going wait a minute you all are just also talking about they're open supply and about three to four guys\nLike a a I have a colleague who told me I'll be careful how I describe this person [laughter] this person had been to Auburn had said you know what I don't like their off into line or unless it gets significantly better this team is going to struggle and that same person\nWhat what what let me give you a secret from commentators like me and everyone else we tend to over in his late in the offseason hey South Carolina when ten game that I mean where you don't want to say help at\nAll because you know you're you're you're you got a dead time really offering foot ball all the way to a game start but what are\nYou know I'm listening to some of these guys not necessarily you or I mean you're an expert but some of the oddball murder or an ex ex guys but you know they they sit there and they look at all for it and they say all these things but I never hear him really come back and say oh man I screwed that when the you\nKnow here you know or the worst people are the ones who know the most [laughter]\nUm yeah because they they have become so in that in in certain things I mean ... if you go back to July South Carolina Mississippi State Auburn we're all going to\nBe contending oh yeah oh yeah Arkansas always going to exceed expectations Missouri under ... that's what we do we ... we really spend most of the season propping everyone out now the only thing that we didn't get wrong\nWas Alabama\nOh now you're you're out every\nYear we got we got that way so we got most wrong was allies you\nWell you know ... that's what I was gonna say I'm I'm a lifelong LSU fan I'm I'm fifty two years old I've been watching them ever since I could but here's this here's the thing I thought about it unless you you know ... hours at a high to include you in this I don't it doesn't really matter but\nI'm just looking at him and go and you know I don't think they're going to be as bad as everybody thinks they're going to be but I'm I'm objective and I'm sitting here thinking\nThey're not going to be as good as I Want him to be so if they can settle out somewhere in the middle I think that's probably where they're going to end up you know seven to nine wins this kind of what I was thinking maybe this year I'm hey we've exceeded what I thought we'd do already but I meant thanks for taking my\nCall thank you very much yeah I mean right now if you look at the exceeding expectations were but you know there's there's a quarter of the seats more a forty percent of the season left to go at a and M. or has exceeded\nOr LSU has exceeded they'll play each other late in the year that the winner that game is really going to be in the probably the tremendous position to be the winner of that contest ah Auburn has underwhelming Mississippi State\nHas been pretty flat they could still turn it around with a when Saturday Night South Carolina up\nLess than what we expected Missouri schedule has gotten them a little bit with

T. in Florida you are on the air go right ahead\nHey how you doing All right thanks for the call a yeah I have a I have a comment for\nChefs to James Carville yes uh who who was on your show he he made a comment about the Florida in ... she play every year in Alabama is stuck playing tennis the\nFirst of all we can help to Tennessee is not as good as they used to be when I mean when the when the conference we set up with the championship game Tennessee was actually winning compressed champagne\nI you know that a JC that terrible tendency team a under Philip former ran off seven straight against Alabama\n... exactly so so it swings both ways Alabama's played Florida or six times since two thousand five I Believe and a Alabama's women\nSo a championship so slow to uh so I I don't understand why his fight is if if that's the issue\nWell in ... and I mean is that just twisting and turning the facts the facts are they play every year but the and the facts are that tendency has been down but you you can take a ... uh I I used to be a newspaper columnist\nAnd when I was trying to make a point you just look for whatever number support your theory and if you want to go back nine years to support it better than Twenty years you knew it it's is it bogus yes to a certain degree but\nThat's what newspaper columnist in the political strategist do they they find a way to make their point\nTend to simple fact or LSU and and Mr Carville is is they just simply need to be out that if they beat Alabama their problems\nAnd we uh we had a ... on on the program back at media days and as I said what what's what's this all about you so we've got beat Alabama it's it's not about anything else that's how al issues measures not about being late night out\nRight it shouldn't be about who Alabama plays now down but that in play we play Florida in the FCC champion Syria Ellis you just go to the go to the SEC championship window ... as simple as that hey thanks again

points for Alabama or\nA mom does not go that far back\nSo I think I think it up there on the plane that conspiracy that Alabama and the and and the honor to get that from happening to the un often

Hughes playoff found has to be a good feeling after going through\nReally such a tough schedule to see [noise]\nWell it's a it's it's something that we are new one on friday not that it would it would but at the end or to put his hand in a you know we've tried to not talk about it in our program and didn't want to add pressure to our kids\nBecause I had enough pressure on them just playing a great Feynman republic um and it's something that we're very proud of being able to decide that we're in the postseason\nYeah it's been a tremendous turnaround for this football team and quite frankly it's been really fun to watch I mean obviously had your struggles earlier in the year but it's such a tremendous schedule you guys play but the turnaround really speaks volumes about the way this football team has pushed forward\nBut I you know I I've said it all year I've got a group of young men fight I've got a group of young man that that are very proud fully in our program and in their school and we went through some definite struggles are and it's one of those things that\nYou know the schedule a is what it is in a way we knew we were going to have to point of scheduling new we're gonna have to fight whale every week they have an opportunity to be competitive and uh you know we we returned a bunch of guys that\nUh I never really been in the parts that they are and and work and it was something that we had to go through some growing pains and and had to grow up together and ah they they really have a\nHave really grown up in really matured at the football thing\nThis schedule and it's tough as it was but that's something you anticipate it as you were putting the schedule together is this just something you'd like to do going out and finding opponents who who are talented in tough a as a way to kind of build your team\nBut if you if you go back and look it at the history of of our our scheduling since I've been at Monterrey a\nMelbourne whoever said that we played a thaw schedule I mean we we've not recently played a Cookeville we played up or mentally fight white county I said you know you look at the non readers schedule that we have now\nAre you know playing hunt in Mount pleasant in white or who are all great programs that have either been right in the top in or are still ranked in the top the uh uh you know we were going to challenge ourselves and sometimes it it you know\nI don't want to say it's not good for a program but sometimes it puts a lot of pressure on him and it puts a lot of pressure on our guys\nTo learn and be able to play at a high level right off the bat there's there's not a buffer zone\nAnd this was one of those years uh you know Mount Pleasant returns and photos on both sides of the ball or mid way is ranked in the top ten still currently and I think that return nonsmokers than and hope and returned I think nine or ten folders and had the same thing is\nUm and so that you know it was a huge salaries and and we had to learn to overcome those out\nAnd you know as far as the region goes you're just a couple of plays and scores away from from having an undefeated record in this region I mean you played a Gordon spill team very tough earlier this year so you've done really well in the region as well\nI ...\nPhil back uh you know we've had some things cannot go our way at times and uh you know we did play well against ... such a tremendous\nFootball program great history great coaches or you know tremendous ... and we put them down to the wire and uh you know they thanks for the last second fair to win in and they just thought so too and uh you know we've pushed yo Barnes and other traditional when I came down to the wire and we found ourselves in the foot in that game and\nUh that's one of those games I like to have back in the you know what I like to have had my quarterback the whole game he got hurt miss\nAbout two quarters that game and and I think that was a a pretty\nYou know pretty big impact on our football team during that time frame\nOr but it's something that I Hope that our football program can learn from um you know not only moving forward for the rest of this year but I'm moving forward into next year that we can learn through those offices and and we're both through those are tough times in and close games and and then hopefully not have those instances happen again\nScott he used his head coach of the Monterey Wildcats knowing that you are in the playoffs now what has been your message to your football team coach\nUh we're still growing still working hard um we've got a a huge not probably not what they're being senior night\nUh we were playing Red Bull and who is getting better every game when you watch them all feel they're getting better every time they go out\nOr they got some good athletes and and they've they've had some explosives place last few weeks and and that's scary for us because we've been acceptable but given up big ... or so for us it is just continue the progress that we've started in July and the miles and miles if we've made it in and got to at this point\nAnd did not facts or just because you ... you check one box that mean that you know all the boxes are fielding and we're building\nNot only for a Red Bull and this week and ah you know the play offs that if we were building every day with a group that uh you know look into the future as well and and there's as sad as it is to see a\nSix or seven seniors leave your appropriate and you know you're turning about Ninety percent of your saying hey you know so every day is just the concept of cost of a work day to try to make a program that\nHow much of those seniors meant to this football team that's really young everywhere you look\nOh they're they're tremendous I mean they're just they're ... kids are they that demonstrated great leadership on and off the field and then the white room and then the off season ... and it's something that uh you know cannot be replaced their their skill set their personalities they're characters from the kids that that will never be able to replace\nThe late in the season I've talked to a number of teams that are there are teams are dealing with some players who suffered some bumps in bruises as we get into these final week of the regular season ... are you all in pretty good shape\nOr worrying right say ah been very lucky knock on wood
