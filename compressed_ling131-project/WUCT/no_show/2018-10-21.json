sometimes called juice plus or a\nDetox gain popularity\nAnd juicing as a term that refers to combining proved and or vegetables in a juice or or juicing machine and you grind that step all up into something you can actually drink\nWhile juicing may help you get the five to nine recommended servings of fruits and vegetables each day that alone is not a balanced diet and I don't think that that even really counts we'll talk about that\nHere to discuss the benefits and drawbacks of juicing and I should say a lot of other topics as well as Mayo Clinic dietitian case are asking welcome back to the program Kate thanks for having\nYou know it's always good to have a dietitian the program but what is a dietitian normally have for\nTo certain foods like any I you know we want to respect that and we would want to be kind of systematic about our approach to removing foods from one's diet but you know what a sensitivity to elect and is like\nI truly haven't had many people come to me and say that they have elected and sensitivity and I think it it would present probably like most other GI symptoms or there might be some um discomfort loading and maybe some bowel issues with them you know along with it um that said I think um\nIt's a it's maybe not as much of a concern as it's made out to be because most foods that are higher and let them like\nBeans um I generally cooked and when they're cooked that leptin is broken down and so it's really not an an issue um and truly that the benefits to eating beans is is is known and in quite good for us so I Would I Would recommend people to eat beans\nFor there are a lot of people do you think the electrons are a problem\nAnd there is a or a best selling book on uh I saw it on Amazon I looked it up when he started talking about when I knew we were going to talk about like ... 'cause I'd never heard of him and it's called the plant paradox the hidden dangers in healthy foods is cause disease in a way to gauge\nHow to buy a cardio vascular surgeon okay um and he says you've got to avoid these like to read\nIt and doing this to sell a book and the ... with a simple and daunting factor is elections are everywhere thankfully Dr ... offers simple\nWe easily can employ to avoid them including peculiar veggies oh ...\nYou ever heard of that I Would recommend not doing it if you don't have to\nPower I shop for prudent season I guess that makes sense because he says that a fruit when it's not a completely ripe can that contains a more electrons and you want to avoid those and swap you're brown rice for your white rice I guess that's probably okay\nSo well and if I Would say if someone truly doesn't think they have an issue our sensitivity to mountains again which I don't know that we can quantify\nIn fact having brown rice having a whole grain would actually be preferred unless you have a reason um and hopefully a medical reason not to\nTo have that so we were in unless indicated otherwise I Would say people should have their whole grains I'm so I Would prefer that people would eat their brown rice over their white rice most of the time you buy this\nBook to know I didn't but there's all sorts of cookbooks\nTo or the will avoid like horrors your diet ... those are actually like it's impossible but they're out there [laughter] and those Kelly Clarkson says I read this joke at issue singer so she said my auto immune disease is gone and I am thirty seven Brown's lawyer\nBecause if she's been on this lower the lectern\n... another fad a type of fat diets that if you limit some foods that you ... you're going to lose weight\nRight and I I think if if you are to look at the computer to look this up and looking at it like many fad diets it is restrictive in nature and so there are many foods that are eliminated and so when you start eliminating many foods\nThe likelihood of someone losing weight is you know ... is probable and unlikely to happen and oftentimes when people lose weight and their their body responds differently they do feel better uh so\nThat said a lot of the foods that are suggested that be eliminated in this election free diet are very healthy nutritious foods and actually our foods that\nAre thought to be anti inflammatory and and that it's kind of a counter argument that that they some will say they're inflammatory but there's other substances in that food that are actually known to be anti inflammatory if we accept that I I Would say it's a faster than\nYou do think there's any good evidence to suggest that you ought to be on a\nLow relax and Lola to diet [noise]\nNo I don't think anyone should be on a a low ... diet absolutely because I don't I don't think it's possible\nTo eliminate license because they're in all plants and we want people to eat plants now within the plant family there are certain types of plants that people may have sensitivities to and I think if that's the case again we'd probably want to take a systematic approach to looking at one's diet and and trying to eliminate foods\nI'm In a way that doesn't eliminate all and so and there would be a re introduction of it's because we don't want people to be an overly restricted diets\nUm because that's not um an easy way to live life and I and in terms of the long term healthy diet and so we want people they just as many healthy foods as they can and to avoid the ones that truly give them problems and it to for some people that you know just in terms of food sensitivities that might just be\nHow it it might be how it's cooked it might be the dos and the amount that you eat in any one time so often times there's there's ways around to include foods but maybe just within a reasonable way of doing it\nAll right so now we have to talk about probiotics that our last few minutes as long as we are just ... you have a rounded afraid that she's going to die because of all the robotics for what she heard on the news this morning and so again when you're talking about fads but circling back around that probiotics are bad or is that what the message messages\nAnd I think that the messages that it's an emerging science and I think as as more and more research is done in this area where we're seeing maybe a study that is showing benefits and then we may see a a study that shows the opposite and and and does not show those benefits and so I think\nThere's much to be learned um about ah the got micro biome that's the the bacteria that naturally live within\nAnd our health and disease states so I think more to come um that said when we talk about probiotics as being a dietitian and I I Would bring the conversation back to food yeah and in your ear and yogurt and there's I suppose that made me naturally have some ... and then there's foods that are considered pre by addicts that may\nOr help the set up the environment within your got\n'em to be healthier place to maybe promote a gut Flora that may be healthy healthier beneficial\nSo the story that your friend her this morning and um that were referring to there is taking the capsules pills that are labeled as probiotics that's one thing and then there's eating a serving of ... or sauerkraut and isn't that line getting blurred\nRight and I think when we step into that arena of taking a ... a probiotic or even having a drink\nRecognizing that this is an unregulated industry and so you can say that you have\nThis strain of of bacteria or this much of this bacteria but quite honestly\nWe don't know that that's absolutely true and we can't say with certainty that that's the best thing or that's going to be an benefit you and I again we've just I don't think we have that science yet and so I think it comes back to\nBuyer beware um and there are some people that report that they feel very well when they take a probiotic capsule or that they may have a drink and that contains a pro via addict\nNow whether that's a true affect our sets a placebo effect and we don't know um I think if it if they're an otherwise healthy person they can they could they can probably practice that safely but that's not to say that that's the case for everyone\nAll right well let me tell our listeners what we're referring to hundreds to report that came out recently in the journal cell which is a peer reviewed journal by the way\nIn which is called a cast further doubt on the benefits of the highly commercialized probiotic products\nBecause they are marketed as dietary supplements not drugs ... do not need to be approved by the FDA for claims that they\nPrevent or treat any health conditions and basically these two studies said they did nothing most of the patients who took them they all went like what in one end and came out the other than the other was a concern that your friend referred to was the fact that if you have taken an antibiotic\nIt may actually take your got longer recovery if you take ... robotics a versus loaded Mother Nature ever away and do it that way\nAnd all that ... back to food yeah I think that's exactly right and and eating nutritious foods like fruits and vegetables and whole grains\nAllow your body to have the ... the proper environment it and it can play with the ph or how the foods you know the fibers and and how things are digested there to set up an environment that's going to promote maybe a healthcare Flora are juicing as good\nWill decide that we flood [laughter] All right for them to or good we've just filled them is about probiotics are certainly some question about whether the claims are true and leftovers but probably not to worry about having to wear their lessons in your diet\n... ... so much for being with thank you feel\nLike I'm On male clinic radio to learn more about poly cystic kidney disease and later on in the program common diseases of the hair [noise] do you have a health related question you'd like to answer for a topic you'd like to cover [noise] you can tweet us anytime that hashtag Mayo Clinic radio or send an email to\nMayo Clinic news network at Mayo dot EDU\nSo how do most patients find out that they have this disease and if you ever seen a case where there wasn't a family history [noise]\nAh so mostly are the majority of the patients will have someone in the family that has the cities and they've been so familiar with that usually we diagnosed by screening with an ultrasound\nOr so you actually look at the kidneys and see this is exactly so we look at the ... and we have kind of criteria is and how many cyst and depending on the age because the ... the older you are the more ... you'd have\nA so to diagnose first we do the screening by ultrasound and then we can do as the tea scan or MRI to look more\nAt that kind of the the kidney is and how big is the kidney and then we can ... um\nGive a prognosis or how the patient will do depending on how big is this are in it that Beijing wasn't aware that they had a family history of poly cystic disease what might be their first symptoms what might lead them to come in and see\nYeah there's about five to ten percent of the patients that don't have a family history so that could be either a new patient so new defect in the gene\nThat just happened in these patients and usually the first sign of either high blood pressure or they get some kind of bleeding from the ... so they see blood and urine and they get paint and the ... and they're back\nOr or sometimes and infection in these tests and they get a fever and then the pain and then uh they get to imaging and that you are probably and then they got the CAT scan or some kind of image and they'll see the system\nFor uh people who have poly cystic kidney disease or there's a whole family history and um what is the takeaway what are those patients need to know\nSo it's really an exciting news for all these patients for example yesterday I offered the treatment for one of the patients who ... who kind of told me the story that even in the Eighteen hundreds they know that they have some kind of ... this was some kind of can you disease and actually when she knew that there's an FDA approved drug\nShe started crying actually for several minutes it was very exciting you saw for these patients first they need to make sure that they're getting good health care so\nUh in terms of blood pressure and then see if they are eligible for this medication\nOr so not all the patients would need to be treated in fact so some are slow progress or so\nThere's this or some small enough and small number that they don't need to be on any treatment except just being healthy and ... a treat the blood pressure but some patients would progressed very fast and they wouldn't need a the houses in their forties fifties at least patient would benefit most from the treatment so it's important for these patients to be checked\nTo know where they kind of are\nAre they slower fuss progressing and then uh probably screen their kids as well now that there's a treatment we're recommending that we checked for for this disease because there's something to do about it in a drug widely available\nIt's very unusual just got approved in may there's many logistics around this medication it's regulated by the FDA and we need a lot of luck testing every month for the first year and a half that is available it's kind of expensive drugs so probably is some new and how the insurance would cover and\nSo forth but we're working with all the patients who are asking about it and we're kind of uh doing something that we're in is to kind of for these patients come to their uh can you doctors be checked and also check their kids and what's next in the research\nA lot of things are exciting actually a male so we have well great may be kidney center and we do a lot of translation of research in a way that we do a research in the lab and try to translate that to the patience to to get new treatments so we have a new targets actually we're very excited about\nAnd a couple of drugs or medications that could be effective so hopefully that would be the next the good treatment for ... um to help not only slow down the tofu cure the disease and not have any ...\nWell that would be fabulous wouldn't already the new drug is called ... and our guest mail from ... kidney specialist ... should be death or shape but I mean what is that your food but\nWe're going to take a short break and when we come back we'll

because we have a special guest coming up a volt too long ago he is the author is the longevity diet among other things and\nI just can't wait till he comes on but before we bring him on let's talk a little bit about fasting because its whole show is going to be about nutrition and fasting and how to live longer and how to do that and then kind of lets go through the fasting history\n[noise] well I think the first mentioned in a fast thing is in the Old Testament the book of Daniel which came up with the Daniel Fast which many religious congregations due periodically\nYeah they do they called the Daniel diet today you'll die oh All right Daniel shocked as a hunter [laughter] he had\nMade excuses and said you know what I didn't do anything to do we're going to do this thing called fast to all the good owners are there are munching on barbecue\nWe don't do fast we have our because I'm not sure that there's a real good at it became farmers [laughter] All right so let's talk about fasting as it is been with your practice world\nHey I'm part of we we we fast and and I was talking to push a day we have a day and night cycles of you know growing and left and working opposition way less\nThan ... left in our so let well an absolute\nInsulin you know you eat the body puts out in ... ah when you're not eating or you're in the fasting state than you put out\nA book or gone to keep your butcher so you know there's hormones that are in opposition there's muscle groups that are in opposition biceps ... says you know triceps extends so you know nature has this way of having opposite equal and opposite components to something\nAnd with nutrition it's the same you know you should eat and then then you should not and you should not right and you know just like there's day night cycles and things and the problem is uh\nWe've gotten to where a lot of people grays and they're not ever in reading your entering a true fasting states are and so they don't get that you know ancient man sun goes down wasn't a good time to be all wandering the forest you have probably not stage still and didn't need\nAccess to all the good animals come out at night right\nNow studies have shown that prolong fasting uh affects her telomeres Senate beneficial way a so people that have um been starvation mode their telomeres stay longer and don't shortness quickly\nThat's not a good reason to fast for a week on end but\nI think that a lot of uh current fasting schedules including intermittent fasting do affect telomeres Senate beneficial way again for our listeners telomeres are the part of the DNA of their control cell replication and when they stay long you live longer when they go short you don't live with flunk\nSo All right I Want to ask you a question do you ever fast\nEvery day from what you say when you sleep boy beyond that it's OK prolonged intermittent fasting yes you do that do you do the diets you've done these died of fasting mimicking dies yeah there's that long ago but our gas who's coming ... been there done that but\nGood role I Can't wait until he's on until we can kind of talk through your experience going through what he says to do you

specialists and he'll be joining us from Italy\nScientists have been searching for the secret to immortality probably say first grasp the concept of death time for the mortal man some woman or we\nHave an article that's coming out of the University of Carolinas\nAnd what this article deals with is just showing what is the underlying causes for obesity could be linked to a specific protein in L. A. R. P. twelve that protects against obesity and insulin resistance\nIn the study showed that the folks who are deficient in this protein were at higher risk for developing a obesity and this is a protein is produced\nBy gut bacteria or certain factors yeah tight in obesity I got back to ... go by a certain bacteria produce the protein which than binds with the receptor and reduces the risk of one developing obesity so\nAre there may be a you know again obesity multi factorial is not always as simple as I overeat\nOr sometimes it can be a\nBiochemical bio physiological even got biome issues that contribute to it so that\nProbably more and more so than not I would assume well why don't we ask our guests because we have all too long ago in and he is\nActually on the phone from Italy he's the ... and the judge professor and gerontology and professor in biological science he's also the director of the U. S. C. longevity Institute you have probably seen around he is very well published she has a book out the longevity diet\nAnd I were so excited to have you on with us Walter\n... and I think do you want to comment on what Dr ... said before we get in\nThe ... Thanksgiving they'll be and um\nYeah so um there's some report or something that's something they can and um and of course\nIt can affect it it was called the microbiology in microorganisms that when it got in a in my ... and ... are no good team that was\nAnd I'm surprised that they are getting so many different functions including\nThe example uh but I also have an effect on the nervous system and in this case a potentially Andy On the function of ... in the crime\nThe you know some of the questions by the way I'm going to be seen you the conference in California you're in November\nAnd a new one of the questions and I'll put it out now is a when you modify the guy with the fasting mimicking diets um does that has the biome study does how does that modify one Scott bio\n... well we're doing that right now and so that's um that's one of our next publications and I I I can talk too much about it but let's say that that um as a big impact on the I'm I'm the micro biome\nI Would think so I'm just curious what got you into this uh this field why is this so important to you\nWell it's I'm I'm I've been doing this since I in fact I was in Texas studying in banked on a as the notion of Texas and I was a music student and and I just thought that are aging and longevity was such an extraordinary field that I I'm\nNow this is really you didn't take the course and how to conduct a marching band [laughter]\nYeah that's right that's the way they said they told me that I had to do that and um I told them there was no way there was going to do that [laughter]\nA Shaw told me that you have to find something else to do that [laughter] I I just\nWanted to do um I just had to be in the back of my mind because I switched to just biochemist city streets the biochemistry departments for the purpose of study you need you saw this I was very clear on what I wanted to do\nIt to universal disease right aging yeah right [laughter]\nYeah I just felt that it was surprising that I'm\nNot alone was really I mean of course lots of people were working at it but it really it's really unknown field you know back then I'm and I'm In and it was just surprised that people were focusing in on people that had diseases and not on the fact that most of the car when you're older\nAnd I'm In saw yeah I thought those are fantastic science a challenge but also an incredible opportunity for medicine\nWhat year was that volunteer\nUm it was it Nineteen eighty\nYou're still had to go to her I mean you honestly were way ahead of the curve did did you have colleagues or other people in that in science and medicine like kind of shaking their head wondering why why you thought this was so important\nActually these when all the way to almost ... at the end of my a PHD at UCLA and we pretty much had to hide the fact that we're working on aging everybody thought it was that the government\n[laughter] which is\nSurprising right now it's almost like surprising to say but uh yeah we we we will say something else we would never say working age\nIt was abuses and it can embarrassing a field and change but are they getting older way to to assure undergraduate a commander graduate years but also UCLA remake PHD years\nIt was just like a ... the um subdivision or a sub or a field that that was not that interesting or or something he was so\nComplex and a\nAnd a slew of uncertainties that\nAnd no one took it seriously\nWhen now it's like all their age so I you know I Know we're going to have to go to a break since I Want to get started on this topic I might have to cut you off in the longevity die you\nAnd he maybe you can give us the first one before we got to break\nThe first one is certainly a research my six set ourselves focused on ... and ... and ...\nAnd so taking the basic sciences than uh you know what you find out in the research lab and so using that as one of the pillars to\nSupport or not just diet is is a form of age management but as a a a way to prevent disease or disease prevention\nBut about diet but about ... about\nJean drugs so it only let's say I ... and and\nIf you look great but um it's much much much more important to say if I put him on and then the next Thirty years\nIf you were gonna live long and healthy\nAnd that's something that you can only guy from basic research right now because you can't do a human\nWe need to think about that but certainly in in most cases I don't really like human longevity oh so you have to realize they resemble if I think he's a he's going to make a mouse longer and healthier\nAnd how it is that oh that thought no direct we got to go to a break when we come back we're going to pick up right there for our listeners were on was volunteer long ago he's got an amazing book you need to pick it up the

should then compare to southern Europe or during the older years maybe not earlier but after\nNot Celine Dion she's seen staying home all the time right then and ah so there's a big change between ...

history\nBut then you want to find a common denominator with the science and the clinical work and say okay this makes sense ... seems to be something that I have six three million likely that it's going to do any harm and it's very likely that it's going to optimize healthy longevity\nSeveral I yeah some people say that he's five or six times a day I I I don't think you agree with that haven't read your book but how many hours a day should we plan on eating how many hours a day they plan on passing\nThe deceased but way seems to be twelve twelve um you'd go shorter you start seeing problems metabolic problems are the problems and\nIt it should go longer you start seeing prominent free example Goldstone formation and the need for a cold blooded operation people that fast sixteen Eighteen

Virginia Joe you're on with mark\nMark the morning [noise] hey I'm real good topic I I'm I'm actually calling into a little story about my sister but I wanted to also say you know on Facebook I've I've shutdown Facebook just because\nEven if I had it with my friends and family only I still found\nEndless arguments on there for I mean just\nFor no reason you know it's almost like they were troubling me waiting for me to say something and then they were all along you know um it it almost feels to a point sometimes when I'm Talking to people I Can't even really say what I where I stand because people just get annoyed at the name Trump sometimes you know\nA ... but with my sister even before the election actually happened um I I don't even I don't even think I think he was still between a cruise and Rubio said\nI'm going to I'm going to put you on hold I don't want to lose\nAnd I want to hear about your sister a sister in law whatever it is and I started till you also so let me know what you guys were thinking he's six six Ninety red eye Marcus filling in on read I read it [noise]\n\nHello\nFriends are news talk Ninety four point one special event\nAnd she didn't even know it and I had to tell her the news and she said\nA whole wow I never got a chance to say goodbye so they hadn't talked to her I think it was at least Twenty years and you think that it finally when he passed on but it was too late to say goodbye to him\nBecause she disowned him all those years for personal reasons so one has to think that eventually you hope people come around before something serious happens and I always tell my students you can never tell someone you love enough that you love them because life is very short\nBut when you hear the family stories a brother and sister daughter whatever that because of politics\nThey disown their parent\nOr their brother who they know their whole life assuming there's nothing terrible going on in the relationship just over politics and you see that almost always on the on the left hand side\nVery discouraging but are brought up the topic because it does happen it is something that needs to be talked about like let's go to Amanda in Woodbridge, Virginia you're on with mark\nMarkets crickets\nA Republican and conservative my whole life so I went into the military right after high school and I'm here most of the people um\nThat I met in the military were bitter because they felt like the Republicans were the only one that would ever support\nA raise for you know the military pay as I kind of you know it's just that OK well they're there for me than I Am for them um and then as time went on um when\nI'm the first I'm a Gulf walk him about um I just remember you know listening to on the radio and and just being like I Need to find someone that talking about this too\nMuch time I was driving a lot and in spending a lot of time the car and I'm just wanted to listen and you know he's found conservative radio and\nYou know I haven't really talked about it with other people until people started asking me who you're going to vote for oh why are you going for them and it was like people started\nComing to me and pulling it out of me I wasn't I was pushing anything on them and\n... when it came down to trumpet was like for a lot of people around me it was the straw that broke the camel's back and they just walked away from me friends and relatives just stop paying my friend and I and they just said how can you you know I think he's for someone who's just you know\nTerrible and I'm just like you don't understand I've been mad at Republicans for Twenty years for letting the media and the and the Democrats walk all over I mean this guy won't let anyone walk all over him and he's doing conservative sing to make our country better and\nYou know I still see people rallied against him and I'm just like wait a minute we agreed to count on me in that we in the country's ever seen you know we have I mean I'm see jobs for truck drivers or the\nFive thousand dollar bonuses for someone who starts a child you know I mean\nFor construction jobs that are just they don't have enough people to do them I mean you know these tech jobs that pay huge amount of money ... you know if you get the right degree you can get a great job if you if you don't have a degree you get to Dr driving a truck working construction and\nYou know everyone seems to be still upset and close the stand back and look what's going on but you know I I had a friend telling me right to my face that I get so mad at you when I when I read the things you oppose\nThat I just want to shoot you in the head and she made the hand signal like he was pointing a gun at my cat and I I just was so hurt by that and you know I I haven't talked to her attention that was you know nine months ago and\nIt just seems like a lot of my friends are just like you know we can't be friends with demand that because she likes tunnel Trump and I I just don't want to be around her anymore and it it is hurtful and um\nYeah I had some time I just felt like I was the most hated person on the Internet because on top of this I'm a transgender woman so a lot of people on the right hated me for the trans up people in the left heated me because I like Donald Trump and\nYou know my family a lot of people my family disliked me because I've transition and and also because I'm a Republican and then I have a trans people that looked at me like how can you be Republican nephew chance he hates us and I'm just like nobody does it you know and so it's like all these angles for coming at me\nTelling me that I'm wrong for being who I Am and I don't think there's anything worse in life and people telling you they can't accept you for who you are\nAnd and it's it's\nClinton line but I can hear the sadness and you know my heart goes out to you I Can't imagine what you're going through a ... it's tough enough ah the challenges that the regular life holds for all of us let alone when your friends or abandon you and maybe some family members to [noise]\nIt's pretty discouraging I think you need to find new friends you know people who at least will share your Republican views or to begin with\nAnd I think you're going to find a not everyone but a lot more Republicans are tolerant despite the fact that we have this view that we're not tolerant people uh that you know we're racists bigots and home of ... all this kinda stuff\nWhen we're not you just have to find the right people and and maybe it is that time to do that and maybe joined

people it's hard to find special people I just want you know you're not alone that way that we all have those kinds of challenges maybe not your particular challenges but we all have our own Lincoln I think said\nThere is someone I don't like I'll have to get to know them better\nUh it it's tough life is very challenging and and can be very stressful and it's hard hard enough now we have a different colors are set we've reached a new level where your political views are enough to lose your friends let alone anything else so my advice to you sound like a nice person just keeping their don't give up and and try to find like minded people\nOkay and you have you have a great night [noise]\nUm ... the thing I just brought this up because I Know it's a real issue\nJust imagine the aside

wouldn't do that so you don't know who they are\nLet's go to well I don't know if we have time for one more call it wouldn't be that fair to you but I'll tell you this\n... is a new time in America and I got to admit it's discouraging when people get on the air and say I got to be careful what I say my neighbors ever knew my point of view if uh my uh friends ever really ... or the when they found out what my views were I was in big trouble\nI've been to a friend did I mean is this the McCarthy Era of member McCarthy who is you know calling everybody communist and ... whatever you thought of him it was unfortunately ruined a lot of careers\nIs that what it's come through and let me talk about myself you've probably heard me say this I Am a part time teacher and they don't know\nThat I'm a talk show host let alone on national radio if they did they could figure out that I was probably a conservative talk show hosts are some liberals are most\nOf them are not among many good you know what jeopardize being what what kind of America to we have in twenty Eighteen when you can express your point of view that's what America was supposedly about All right let me know what you think but now you're national forecast for video roadblock\nNo was climate Prediction Center has issued the winter outlook you will be warmer and the west with no change in the chances for snow\nAccording to the national weather service in the Northern Rockies it will be drier and warmer the great lakes region is expected to be drier the southern quarter of the U.S is expected to be wetter than normal\nBut no parts of the country are expected to see a colder than normal winter\nNow NOAA warns the forecast should not be interpreted to mean that periods of prolonged cold or heavy snows won't happen most of the country will be dry today with the exception of a place where we don't need any more rain and that's in Texas\nWhere we could see heavy showers again today on the order of two to three inches for extreme southern Texas\nAnd portions of West central Texas set to receive at least another inch today your winter outlook on today's forecast from red eye radio I'm meteorologist John

thousand\n[noise]\nSupport the peach tree Christmas market place that far north long I mean they come down each week from November nineteenth street became a fourteen nine AM to four pm Monday to friday just for you\nIt was revealed on Facebook how I felt you know\nBack when Obama was still president and it just I I think the damage social media has done in my eyes far outweigh the good a with a lot of relationships you know\nWhat I started to go in your direction first of all I got to say my older brother has never signed on in more than one way obviously and was always afraid about privacy issues and that kinda stuff he winds up being right\nOr if I wasn't on the radio I probably wouldn't use faced with that much although I I got to be fair it is good you can reconnect with people when I was a teacher years ago they find me or you find out about someone's life is they just use it for that\nBut I've learned to like you kind of indicated\nI've learned not to say much about politics because when they know I'm a talk show host and if they know me already good luck they'll never leave you alone it's their chance to you know trying to say all kinds of things that they can say if they can't get through on radio so people have no limitations there so I just about I kind of control myself sometimes something gets me so sad\nAnd I think I I'm going to comment on this but in general uh I Try to stay away from it I think the social media you're right\nThat that does some good but the uh like I said I don't even use Twitter hardly ever used Twitter anymore if I wasn't on the radio there are a lot of things I wouldn't do including like I said Facebook\nSo I I think people should be cautious with the social media special we're finding out that they're you know so many things were hacked and they're finding out a lot of your information so I think it's smart you said you have ... five years and I admire that\nTom in Port Angeles a Washington You're on was mark\nLittle mark I want to do a show Dr you're Canadian caller okay you're still listening\nGo up here where I'm at and she's right it was a it was pretty horrific the way that they you know all that up KBC CBS NBC or just regurgitate it everything [noise]\nThere's a bright spot and let the Canadians weren't\nAware that the U.S electorate we're going to do its best to not get the candidate that the media was trying to and us and that worked out in the end show all that horrific stuff that came off of a\nA Paul Kennedy and I'm a\nAt a Charles Adler and uh and right and uh in in green or\nAll of that probably helped a jet of Obama or get a Trump elected because he was trying to hurt for when we're coming down from Canada like that\nAnd uh but the reason I called was so we'd already been told a for your Twenty years Thirty years that uh you know nobody was going to be able to fix the inner cities and you know the racial issues that we had to confront\nAnd a lot of people a lot of white people voted for President Obama and then when he got elected he ignored his mandate and he went\nClear off on another change and things got worse so we were very very disappointed a\nYou know the people that voted for the white people that voted for Obama were review review disappointed and it damaged the Democratic party for a long long time [noise] [noise]\nWell I think if they voted for him because\nThey want to show they weren't prejudice that was a mistake you know color should never be an issue but I'm sure some people did\nBut the fact is than he was a didn't disappoint me I knew he was I knew we was when he first came out\nI Am not to mention his personality in terms of dropping a bill ... who is the rent Reverend Wright and pretended that the you know they weren't as friends any more you can see who he was\nYou get to know someone sometimes by a their character I mean people can pick on Trump that from the things he says and does so it's not foolproof but I knew he was far left he he really has got closer and closer he's in high def for half a second\nI'm no disappointment to me I I never expected much from him and that's what I'm saying the other side the left

times\nThat we live in that people are so angry on both sides that they couldn't even sit down and have a cup of coffee with them All right so that's the news and that's the one or the day\nAnd you're supposed to pick both you have two choices there to make let me know what you think and you can call it an eight six six Ninety red eye eight six six nine o seven thirty three thirty nine and we go to John in Seattle John you're on with mark\nHey mark are are you there I'm here a K A lifetime is the John Cage sick I Believe he ran for president as a Democrat and I know it's a public and yeah\nHe did oh boy [laughter] well you balance the budget\nAnd you know ever going to balance a budget that's who I think should run against Trump or you know ever since two thousand eight we've had quantitative easing we had just government spending that's gone on and on and on with no end in sight\nAnd some well you know the somebody's got to pay the piper on that sooner or later and I think if somebody could make a case to show that they really know how to balance a budget\nThat would be who probably would stand a chance against Trump although I probably wouldn't vote for him on pretty much of traditional values\nCan serve you know it's to me a word that is consistent with conservative and you know if it works but it ain't broke don't fix it you know something that works it's a good thing\nOr you have now I don't have ... who it is Nikki Haley I Believe she has an\nIntellect that has a global perspective and I have a degree in anthropology\nAnd I would really like to sit down and talk to her about where she thinks waste and and the family of nations on this smaller and smaller planet but we have to learn to get along with each other and so those are my thoughts what do you think mark\n... first of all mentioned Nikki Haley is ... is amazing because the ladies\nSouth Carolina but she's been a phenomenal\nAmbassador to the United nations really letting them having an a very courageous not being afraid to say like it is she's a very impressive lady I think she's going to run for president maybe you know obviously not this time but in the future\nYeah yeah yeah\nI I Will have someone with a very large perspective on who we are as a nation and clearly\nWe can be a good a good companion a good name for a good partner in a global perspective I think that's very important\nSo thanks for those ideas and we'll let you hold\nOn one second 'cause I'm going to ask you your ... your answer ... question but\nI don't like John Case if there's something about the guy\nUh didn't come across well he did run as a Republican last time against Trump and the others there's something about him that irritates me something I mean I I don't agree with him on everything he's a little too liberal for me that that's fine that's neither here nor there but the something personally about him\nI think he's arrogant I think he comes across that when I've heard some things about him I had a former a producer my TV show who said something about women or something like that was years ago so that's not fair that is a rumor but something about that guy that rubs me the wrong way but you don't feel that way you like\nThe balanced budget I mean we we can go on with the kind of spending I mean I Love this country and we have a lot of good programs like agriculture and you know we need to defend ourselves and\nSaid you know we we just can't keep going on every time somebody as another hobby is that you know want something that they just get it because they have enough money for the next campaign\nI mean that's both sides of the aisle it all and it's just been going on and on and on and they can't go on forever I mean when you get to the point where the debt\nAs big as the gross national product you know theoretically that's bankruptcy\nAnd we got to find a way you know we've got to find a way to to to have a better reasonable expectation about what kind of ... we can have in this country\nOne of the things I always say is people do not understand that the government\nHas no money of its own you'd be surprised maybe how many people think oh you remember that a woman or during the Obama campaign the first ones that\nAre Obama's going to pay for a mortgage and pay for gas and they said where are you going to where's he going to have his stash stash you know same out of his staff ... he was going to personally pain so people don't know that based on something that the government has no money of its own\nI thank you very much for your call very well said and\nI appreciate it very much and we'll take the rest of your calls at eight six six Ninety red eye or right now\nYou're a national forecast for how many trucks\nNo was climate Prediction Center has issued the winter outlook you will be warmer and the west with no change in the chances for snow\nAccording to the national weather service in the Northern Rockies will be drier and warmer the great lakes region is expected to be drier the southern quarter of the U.S is expected to be wetter than normal\nBut no parts of the country are expected to see a colder than normal winter\nNow NOAA warns the forecasts should not be interpreted to mean that period of prolonged cold or heavy snows won't happen\nMost of the country will be dry today with the exception of a place where we don't need any more rain and that's in Texas where we could see heavy showers again today on the order of two to three inches for extreme southern\nCentral Texas set to receive at least another inch today your winter outlook and today is forecast from red eye radio a meteorologist John trout\nAnd I'm more ... and I want to know who you think should be the Democratic nominee\nAnd who you just sit down and have\nI think that'd be a good idea I have six six and nine year in March ... billion on red argument [noise]\n\nIt's easy to help homeless heads nice area and Shelley's angel

calling for their impeachment he's not going to be fun\n[noise] no I think it's going to get ugly I personally but that that happens I think that uh nothing good will come out of that I promise you that that wouldn't be crazy I mean I I honestly didn't do anything\nFor that to me I didn't really do any of its critical to me um [noise] I mean I did a lot of background I have it all and he just seemed like the most\nHonest I was at one of the what the best judges that are on there as of right now in my opinion I mean he got all these other you\nI was going to say they he seems like a decent guy and you as you started to say over three hundred opinions\nI just think they were using her as long as we're talking about\nWho should run for president Democrats side uh Spartacus Booker and I call them that because of his own name to Kamala Harris they they were just using that woman maybe maybe she imagined it if someone didn't do that assault on her\nAll those things are possible but they use their for their own purposes it was disgusting to watch\nA little difficulty with\nThe horror of what was it really was that well then we live in Oregon was he was [noise] yeah that's what Lindsey\nGraham was so good when he came out and said that I'm not going to put up with this stuff you guys are doing this for power you yeah you know now it ought to be ashamed of yourself what you're willing to do a but that's what they are they ought to be [noise] yeah well thank you so much for the [noise]\nAbsolutely all all that being called back again\nThanks so much time and uh yeah Joe Manchin would be good picky seems like a decent guy ah like I said I don't it's not fair for me to take away some of his courage uh when he seems so nice and and reasonable and I think he is going to win but someone who is less than these and I said I'd mentioned this\nIs Hillary I'd love to see Hillary run again a for selfish reasons I think she is going to run again because these guys\nMeaning Hillary and bill they can't keep away from power\nThat's what the what is an aphrodisiac people say so and the Democrats even have figured that out they don't even want her to enter the fray she's viewed as the kiss of death for democratic candidates in the upcoming midterm election\nForcing the former presidential candidate to stay low and campaign only behind closed doors by the way that makes sense because I sit on the air for many months now you know she's still looking to see a why she lost\nLike she's going to come out I suggested she'll come out with a book a hundred and one reasons why I lost in none of them will be her I have nothing to do with her\nAnd I said she could join the OJ Simpson as he looks for the killer to figure out who killed his wife\nBut few Democrats are willing to embrace Clinton on the campaign trail despite the party's near universal support for just two years ago\nWith many concerns that a high profile Clinton presence but only dampen the party's prospects of retaking control of Washington from Republicans yeah they're worried about her throughout the mid term elections Clinton is rarely rally together with other candidates appearing mostly at low key fundraisers and little secret she can't get many people to show up\nShe's the kiss of death won a party official said I'm telling the Washington Examiner Democrats don't want her to campaign for them because everywhere she goes she carries the stench of death well it's worse than I thought\nAnd it's the only political figure in America that has less popular than Donald Trump stretches that and that's a real testament to her\nDemocrats were relieved that the bill and Hillary Clinton announced that there international Thirteen city speaking tour wouldn't begin until after November now that\nThat was a clever move I think they're measuring how they can have the best positive impact and have kind of decided to wait until after the election and that's what Dick Durbin of Illinois at a house Democrats segment of that saying when I think uh people who've been part of our pushed to retake the house\nI just don't think of them at all I think it's a very good thing that they're not being visible it wouldn't help our cans age\nBoy one minute you're the nominee for the Democratic party and the next minute they don't want to see anymore maybe that's part of the problem these guys don't know when to get off the stage\nActually but I liked that Hillary can in twenty twenty I liked the sound of it and I like our possibility that she could run up you know like our stamps she can run forever right but don't we have forever\nCould run you never get rid of them actually I can take them a lot better than Brock Obama right most presidents when they leave office they they're quiet and give that credit to George W. Bush but not for Iraq Obama he's in there he can't sit still he can't keep quiet\nSo maybe Hillary bill they do have some redeeming value for those of us on our side because if they run again if he runs again\nI think she's going to lose I think we got to get something going on our side Hillary for president in twenty twenty tell me what you think eight six six Ninety red eye eight six six nine

political beliefs figure into these identities Emily ... writes for up shop at the New York times looked at a brief survey Emily would look at\nYou know we were talking about the topic at the upshot because we came across some survey data from the early to thousands where people were asked okay here's a list of identities which one is most important to you and you know the options are your gender your race your religion to political party that you ... with\nA part of the country that you grow up and and and you know we were sort of surprised by how Americans have answered this question in the past a religion ranked really really highly for a lot of people it's one of the most prominent things\nUh you know sort of ... people's family affiliations whether you identify as a mother or father or life ranks really highly\nAnd particularly like all the way down at the bottom of this list and we sort of suspected that perhaps even see something different if we ask people to question again today because it feels like a moment when everyone is thinking about politics politics there's like a pro bathing everything around us\nSo we we surveyed this question about two thousand people and found once again that politics really aren't as important to people as we thought if you sort of ask them this question about you know thinking about your own identity which parts of your identity are most important to you\nAnd it's interesting because as you found out I guess from the surveys you say in the piece most Americans don't live in brief politics the way Washington news beans who\nRight right we have to remind ourselves as is constantly you know those of us who write about these things for a living that most people out in America or not is obsessed with them as we are\nSo what what other changes I guess from the ... the last time survey versus the this time survey\nOne thing that hasn't really changed and and it's been accelerating over the last several decades is that\nA lot of these other identities that you know are not political in nature your\nReligion whether you are religious or non religious human race they have come into alignment with political identity to a degree that really was not the case you know twenty thirty forty years ago so for instance you know if I told you I'm\nIn the Nineteen nineties that\nAh I'm I Am a non religious white woman that wouldn't really tell you a whole lot about my politics but now it is increasingly the case in non religious people are much more likely to be Democrats religious people are much more likely to be Republicans a you know we're seeing a much clearer\nYeah and that's always the big issue daycare daycare on that day\nAnd what I found is a lot of these districts that go to a four day\nThey typically have something in place rather they open up some of the schools on that friday and they offer like a discount at day care and some of them actually offer free daycare or there's nonprofits that have like relatively cheap daycare and the and the school district might provide the meals\nA doodles nonprofit certain in some cases the school district actually might open up on that friday just to serve meals because there are some very poor communities where that might be the only meal the child might be getting you know during the during the school day period so a daycare has been\nA really big issue but you know and I went to Colorado where a more than fifty percent of the districts that use for day\nAnd and talking to those parents there were a lot of them I talked to that initially did

yet\nYou know and I've looked at study after study and from what I can see academics just based on these studies academics are not suffering under the four day and there's actually school districts to say\nThat they've noticed higher test scores because the kids just come back well rested and ready to learn and they're missing fewer days so they're in school more that's how that's how they feel\nUm

... he argues talk anymore point one\nTo listen this is parroting today's teens with ... and mark is the author of several books including when your team is struggling recently revised an updated you'll find a parenting today's teens dot org\nMark let's talk about giving your team the power to make decisions that sounds kind of dangerous does and why would we ever do that because they all let's let's choose another topic that you know make as good at this\nIt just for just a minute who thinks it's a good idea to take five thousand pounds of steel but four tires on it and give it to a sixteen year old young lady\nYou know this this hunger still can go a hundred and twenty miles an hour and say here\nGo drive in the streets of New York and Miami or Dallas or Houston or as crazy Chicago it is crazy but you know what\nWe do in ... and when we do it they step up to the plate and did they make mistakes along the way it was sure they do because there are kids that you know it's interesting to me in between the logic of our thinking and a child actually being trained to take on something and learn\nThere is a little piece in there of the equation that I Would say\nIs risk and that's what keeps us sometimes from from allowing a child to make decisions were just fearful that we're getting a risk something in the process of that so we're going to be talking about giving your team the power to make decisions\nI look forward to this conversation okay we'll get started in just a moment later a young lady named coral will be in the studio to talk with mark so stay tuned for that is a part of today's program\nParenting today's teens now when you go on line to hope your request information about the book when you're Tina struggling written by markets actually been revised and expand it as I said and it includes a section not allowing your child to be in control so it fits right in with our topic today look for when you're Tina struggling hurting today's teens died or [noise]\nLearn together to parent our teens here today are making decisions so [laughter] it's a tough one but you know you know what the top two reasons that parents struggle will let things begin to make their own decisions well they're afraid we'll make a mistake throughout it true true\nThere's there's fear okay and and that fear is that they're not going to make the best decision and we decided that they're going to make the same decisions that were going to make and and usually you know there's good veteran best\nWere the best of course where the best standards have been around longer and and there's better which is okay there's good which is adequate but there's a tendency that we always want the very best and sometimes you have to go through good and better to get the best but the other thing is is\nIt's control and it's just sometimes hard for a parent to give up sitting in the driver's seat or yeah why because there used to it's like allowing your daughter or your granddaughter\nTo drive and use it in the the seat you're so used to driving all the time you guy on it for what ... eleven twelve years or more ... fifty [laughter] you know what I mean there's just a part of it you know go maybe you like being in control\nAnd you know this is all about helping a child both of these regions had everything to do with the mom or dad they don't have anything to do with the child so if you're going to train up your team to learn to make good decisions you're going to have to give up control get over your fear\nYou know our ... our learn how to work around it but you're going to have to take a risk and that is to help them make decisions but we get\nThe idea that a good parent as a parent that prevent teens from making mistakes\nKnow that's not true I Am in it's it's not true in the fact that that I Want kids to make mistakes\nBecause then they learned the value of wise decisions they they learned the value of what I'd been telling them what a child comes to me and says I shouldn't have done that I just kind of just look at him and I never say I told you so I never say you should have listened I just let them learn the minute then I say\nThat what you should have listened to me why didn't you think this thing through you could have done better than that\nI'm shaming them and shame as an amazing way of pushing them back into their own stuff good this\nYou know a couple of months but I Know that you know and I go to your very happy go lucky person I don't see this anger that that you're talking about so what changed\nI don't know just like one day to sink started changing and I don't really know what happened actually they just\nChanged and like I got a counselor switch so that was probably a good part of it 'cause I didn't I wasn't like making any progress at my old counselor yeah so when I got a new one like things started turning around\nYeah you think it's important to have somebody to truly speaking to your heart and asking those deeper questions that maybe somebody else can't\nYeah I think it was really like beneficial for me and my program yeah\nWell I think I I think this kind of normal and quite honestly I think that I tell people all the time if you don't have a good counts or you're going to know it find a good countered that you can connect with not everybody can mix with everybody you're going to find that special person that you can talk to and stuff\nSo how is that counts for help to change things\nWell like we've just recently got past the whole like getting to know you stage as we spend a couple sessions on that but now we're like\nIdentifying like different issues and like ... helping to like understand then and different like coping skills so that helps them in a new house now so it's like ... ... different but like that's also halting 'cause I like and moving along and that program\nYeah and and and just for everybody that's listening and you want to know what we do when kids first get here to hardly they live in different houses and as they progressed and they move up into houses that have a little bit more freedom and they have\nSo the kids that are in those houses and so that's why that when we saw the progress along they go through a series of four houses and so um so which house or you know\nI'm an old ... you know like a house\nYeah so it's easier to to be there than it is at the first house 'cause first sounds kind of a crazy how sometimes he as everybody gets er and everybody's angry for being here so okay so what's the biggest change you've seen in your life since you've come here\nI'm probably my relationships with like my family and my friends like well now my friends back home because I haven't talked to them but my friends here because I used to have like a lot of unhealthy relationships when I first got here but I've been working on my relationships have developed a lot\nYeah do you think you've had relationships develop here the ... like you haven't had relationships at home definitely and why is that\nUm 'cause he like many people here that are like struggling with the same things as you are and and it's just like nice to know that there is like other people besides the people that are being paid to be here too it's just nice to have someone and they like understand what you're going through\n'em and you still need like the staffing your counselors and stuff but it's also nice to have someone like up here yeah there\nYou know I think the other thing too that I think you probably sell yourself pretty short on is that I I think you've learned how to become a good friend other people it's not just what you're getting from everybody else but it's what people are getting from you this changing the way that you kind of engage with everybody you think\nYes I mean you're you're just kind of ... are you I mean do you have to think about that one from it\nYeah well I like before\nI was in toxic relationships by like Taylor toxic but also I recognize that the time but so it's I so I definitely come a long way to\nSo how do you realize that you're in a toxic relationship\nAnd it's just like people are always telling me that I was in an unhealthy relationship and I need to set boundaries but like now looking back on and now it's like trying to influence people to do bad things are people influencing you and like not being like a positive influence and\nJust not create in like a good environment for\nLike me working on myself and then working on themselves yeah\nMost school you're getting along with your family OK mhm have you seen that change\nWell I haven't really had any like deep talks with them yet\n'cause my phone calls have kind of like just now started like studying and lying so we just kind of talk about like daily stuff that I'm working on or that\nUm I've just done during the week and break is coming up and I've ever been on a break before so that's exciting so we're talking about that like a lot 'cause we're all really excited\nTo see the rest of my family\nIt's going to be important for you to go home and not just\nUm entertainment another ... look to have some of those deep discussions yeah just like you have a beer with other people that are here you know I think that's important for you guys stay well thanks for coming in and and uh sharing a little bit about what's going on in your life\nUh it's always interesting to me that the uh our listeners love listening to you guys a lot more than than they like listening to me so it's kind of a cool do thanks for coming

you get a donation to this ministry you were in that channel directly into providing resources for it to join us in the ministry of passion the one line to parents today\nDot org and quick I donate now that I think today the doubt or parenting today dot ORG [noise]\nJust for the record we're listening to you to mark [laughter]\nWe have some questions from listeners here but they fit into several categories let me give the categories and then you get to choose the category ... and I read the question will give us the categories are like a game show music modesty marijuana pornography money these are areas where\nTeams need to make good decisions so where should we start modesty modesty parent question\nHow do I encourage her to dress modestly and still give her control what you know at age twelve you pretty much pick out\nWhatever she's going to wear and she's going to do it that way that mom dad you both have the influence at age Eighteen she's going to be doing things on her own so maybe at Fifteen or sixteen you let her start making decisions because if you're making the decisions\nThat she's going to be taken close off on the way to school and doing what she wants remember she's trying to fit in a lot more than she's trying to be subjective and so I think what you do is allow a child to make decisions about close at some point in their life that you breathe determine hey it's sixty and you get to do all that\nRight now I'm going to have the approval and I mean you may sit there and go oh I Can't believe she's wearing that she's going to have to learn and you have to remember the definition a modest he's a little bit different\nToday than it was even ten years ago and remember loved your child or a guard with server choice it this is all about teaching them to make good choices\nAnd then if she gets sent home from school because she's not wearing something that's appropriate and let her suffer the consequences of that and fail a class or miss a test or not be able to go to school or go to a special you know let let her figure that out you're just sitting there helping her along the way\nAs I Know this is a very difficult for parents and teens to come together on art and other category music music the question I feel like the lyrics of my sons music are negative negative influence on him do I let him chooses music even if it's depressing\nWell some age you do I mean at at sixteen they can listen to just about anything they want on a on a car radio or their own CDs or spot fire or anything at age twelve I have control as a parent\nAt age sixteen I don't so what I Want to do is influence them in a positive way I I just found that that music is more of an expression than it is an influence and so if if they're listening to music that's pretty hardcore and I would consider just rotten then there's something else going on\nIn their life that I Need to pay attention to do I let him chooses music even if it's depressing I think this is one of those lights that are lighting up on the dashboard of your son's life that what you need to do is say OK what's causing him to get depressed music is just the expression of\nThat one more quick one yeah money money I give my daughter an allowance but she blows it right away and closing doesn't save it for necessary things how can I help her make better\nDecisions that's right don't Baylor out when she doesn't have money to buy those necessary things I mean don't spend a penny on her let her figure that out and what she'll be forced to do is to make better decisions because she's making a a few mistakes right now All right\nThank you for that and if you have a question our website is open to you you can reach us through the website parenting today's teens dot O. R. G. every few months we put on a three day event called families in crisis conference it's held on the heartland campus in east Texas it includes a small group of parents all the same spot looking for help for their family\nFor instance the information is online at parity today's teens dot org recall eight six six seven hundred families for information which we had more time mark but why don't you wrap things up\nNow the moms and dads as your teens get older and older let them flex their decision making muscles that's the only way that those muscles are going to get any stronger and it's much more important for your team to develop discernment and learned to make wise choices than it is for you to be overly controlling to protect\nIt's frustrating to ask a direct question without getting a direct answer\nSo I Apologize that adds is the case so often with politicians doctors and lawyers where many significant statements are made but few direct dancers are given\nWe also have this scripture lesson from the thirty eighth chapter of job well after job asked a direct question did God\nWire law must the innocent suffer\nNot even God seems willing to give a clear and direct answer in response\nIt's frustrating\nWhat Joe wants is the truth but God seems to be echoing those iconic words of Jack Nicholson when he starred in a few good men you want the truth you can't handle the truth\n\nAre passage begins then the lord answered job out of the whirlwind who is this that dark and counseled by words without knowledge\nAnd I will question you and you shop declare to me\nThis\nIs not a gentle response nor is it a direct answer but anyone who ask questions has learned that sometimes you get an answer and sometimes you don't\nI don't remember well enough a day in Sunday school long ago we were in fourth or fifth grade and had just read the account and the gospel of loop chapter to after eight days have passed it was time to circumcised the job\nMr Farah I asked my teacher what exactly is circumcision\nWell that's a question you should have probably ask your father he responded\nNow that was an answer I was looking for but sometimes an indirect answer is what's most appropriate and while it's disappointing in the moment there haven't been times when non answers did more good than a direct answer could have I remember sitting in my grandmother's\nKitchen I was in the middle of my first year of college and having spent most of high school goofing off college pose more of a challenge for me than it did for many of my classmates\nKnowing that I was discouraged and wondering whether or not even make it my grandmother started telling me about long nights and nursing school\nShe was about my age then Eighteen or Nineteen away from home for the first time asked to cram more information into her brain than seemed possible especially during daylight hours but\nLights had to be turned off in the dorm by ten o'clock at night the only lives that can stay on one of the ones in the ladies bathroom\nSo she would study they're sitting\nOn those cold tiles reading on the night before test an after graduating she began a fifty year career in nursing\nNow that's perspective\nThe kind of perspective that only my grandmother could have provided and every time I'd be tempted to complain about studying hard out imagine her there on that bathroom floor and she didn't seem so far away nor did my lot seems so pitiful\nShe my own flesh and blood had made it through worse the perspective\nOf grandparents they'll they'll tell you that they walked up hill to school both ways but nothing can help us see the sufferings of this president age clearly like the experience of those who made it through worse\nAnd if the perspective of a grandparent is beneficial imagine how helpful is the perspective of God where were you when I laid the foundation of the earth the lord asked job\nTell me if you have understanding who determine its measurements surely you know or who stretched the line of punted on what words bases song or who latest cornerstone when the morning star sing together and all the heavenly being shouted for joy\nThe lord answers Joe this way\nAnd in one sense this stands up of God's poetic non answer makes job and all his problems seem so very small the death of his family\nThe destruction of his home\nBut this account of creation and the thirty eighth chapter of job\nIs more than that for in this testimony\nIs the account of the guards who laid the foundation of the earth\nDetermined it's measurements and stretched align upon it\nIt is the story of how God has been in the business of building a beauty out of nothing since the beginning of\nTime the foremost mass of that nothingness\nThat existed before creation\nWas the Lord's building blocks and when there was darkness before they were even lights to turn out the lord laid the cornerstone in the morning stars were born to sing together\nJust as my grandmother helped me to see that I could study I couldn't be successful in college\nSo the lord is helping job just see that you can make a live out of nothing you can rebuild but I Am with you and I have done that and much greater things before\nNow this isn't a direct answer to job was question of suffering but there is value in God's perspective there was always value in perspective\nBack in twenty Thirteen researchers from Boston College analyzed data from a long term study called the longitudinal study of generations\nThis study gather data from three hundred and Seventy six grandparents and three hundred and forty grand children and concluded that\nAn emotionally close grandparent adult grandchild relationship was associated with fewer symptoms of depression for both generations the greater emotional support grandparents an adult grandchildren received from one another\nThe better their psychological health\nAnd you can already imagine why that is the case that grandchildren benefit from the perspective their grandparents provide because they teach you to appreciate the restrooms that every gas station on the interstate when you travel with them\nBut you also value those restrooms because you hear about your young grandfather who as a boy drive to relieve himself out of an old model a while it was still moving the story goes that the windows were down back\nWhere his sisters were sitting and unfortunately the wind was blowing the wrong way and you hear this story and you remember one who has made it through hard times all ready\nTo pass through the rough waters of the great depression\nWorld War two unemployment and still maintain his sense of humor his\nPerspective alone gives me strength to overcome obstacles that live before me he is one who has gone before\nBut my grandfather's perspective is dwarfed by that of my God\n[noise] think of the stormy sees of life and then consider the lord who shot in the sea with doors when a burst out from the ...\nThe lord and gives an account from the memory I'm One who is in finance and remembers the sea when she was a little baby when I made the clouds it's garment\nThick dark miss it's wobbling band and prescribed balance for it and set bars indoors and said the U.S for show you calm and not for you\nStopped\nCan you hear the lord say the thing was like chaos but I grab that great chaos up and changed diaper\nSo even now the chaos that you face the victimization the sadness the despair and the heartache just as I tame the sea so will I bring order to your life once more\nPerspective there's some\nComfort in that\nBecause when you are facing hardship for the first time it feels like the end of the world\nAnd fifth grade my nose started bleeding right there in the middle class some kid called me a blogger picker and the rumor spread\nI went home that afternoon and made the bold announcement to my mother I Know you like it here mom but we're going to have to move I Can't go back to that school ever again\nPerspective in that perspective gets his perseverance and veep and surfing [noise]\nJoe Evans thank you for being with us so proud to be here Peter [noise]\nGame one is the

Was a lost the man\nHe lost his after ... she but he also committed an affair with her he had ... she was husband killed\nAnd he didn't tell anybody\nThese are things that he hid from everybody\nYes and then also I think about how many wives he had and how many children he had and how it's impossible to have been a good father to all of those at one time it came back to bite him when there was a two and he was thrown out as king\nYes David knew his identity was a scramble\nWith us how you arrived at a solid identity one that has found a totally on something different\nNot based on fame or fortune not based on one's achievements not based on titles and definitely not based on one's experiences that they've had in their life\nWhat is the one word that we see in the first three versus let me read them again to you\nOh lord us search me and you know me you know when I sit and when I rise you perceive my thoughts from afar you discern my going on in my line down you are familiar with all our ways before a word is all my town you know a completely what does the word that said three times\nGod Knows us God new David this is the first building block to a proper identity now how can\nI express this word no well in the Hebrew it's the word yet die and\nI grew up in Miami so I took Spanish and there's two worst to express the word to no one is a bear which has an intellectual knowledge of facts and figures to know something and then there's the verb kono Sarah which is a personal or intimate I Know you\nWell this isn't the same kind of bird the Paul I mean David is using here in this first for versus when he says the word no it's the same verb that you find in genesis chapter four verse won when it said had on New Year's eve and she can see it and bore a son\nHow much knowledge does that entail or you figure it out but it's pretty intimate when did you say yes God Knows us even in our birthday suits not just our actions he knows is in the way we are\nBut notice what he also says before word is on my tongue you know it completely oh lord\nDavid is expressing what Hebrew is meant when they said the words that come out of your mouth or really holy expressions from the heart and before David could even say a word from his mouth God new is hard\nHow intimate is that\nHave you ever realized that God notion that well he knows you and your birthday suit he knows you and your actions he knows your thoughts before you even think and\nThis is the kind of God that we worship [noise] he knows just so intimately\nYes that's an amazing thing [noise] yes [noise]\nBut you know just what he doesn't do he doesn't do like\nAdam eat where's my ... and he doesn't do that and he doesn't\nSay oh I gotta go hide because God might see me\nHe doesn't run away from God he's realized this is a good thing that God Knows him and so he goes to God because God Knows him\nThat's the first building block of a good identity is to know that God Knows us\nAnd then the second one and if you are correct this comes from versus seven through twelve his God pursues us or God chooses us\nInstead of being scared David says\nI don't have to put on clothes I don't have to put on makeup\nI don't have to pretend to be insane anymore I don't have to run away and hide from my children because I Know that God Knows me God has chosen to pursue David no matter how successful or\nHow much of a failure David Was God loved him so much that he went after David noticed what it says ... five you hadn't been behind them before you have\nLaid your hand upon me God pursues each one of us\n\nHe doesn't just pursue is when you knew it he pursues you when you done badly\nThink of verse eleven if I say surely the darkness will hire me in the life becomes night around me David is probably thinking about those times when the things that he did with ... or the things that he did to her husband or\nBad and my father he was to his children those weren't dark days in his life and yet God still pursued him and knew him and God does the same thing in your life\nGood or bad he's there\nI think of and Lamont a best selling author and speaker that I just learned about last week as I watched her give her testimony on YouTube you can look her up it's L. A. M. O. T. T. in Vermont she grew up on an atheist home\nHer dad said that it was foolish to believe in God and yet as a teenager she struggled in high school and she decided to her choice should be come a perfect child and she tried that\nAnd eventually the pressure became so great that it she caved in and when she went off to college and got into all kinds of activities that she's embarrassed about drinking and drugs and\nDoing all kinds of things even said she tried eastern religion because you figure that wouldn't get mad at her if there was an eastern religion but oh no not the Christianity that would be a anathema to her dad\nAnd yet she got pregnant to with a man that she didn't even love and she's about to have this child and she's drinking and she's depressed\nAnd in her depression she has this crazy idea I Need to go to church\nSo she runs off to a little black African American church and she sits in the back and she hears the gospel clearly and before the pastor finishes you can't stand that she runs out and she goes home and that night in her bedroom she felt a warm presence\nNews talk Ninety four point one brings either the weekly worship survey of heavenly hurts

by it I Will go on to visions and revelations of the lord I Know a man in Christ to fourteen years ago was caught up\nTo the third heaven weather in the body or out of the body I Do not know God Knows and I know that this man was caught up into paradise\nWeather in the body or out of the body I Do not know that God Knows any hurt things that cannot be told which man may not occur\nOn behalf of this man I Will better spent on my own behalf I Will not those except of my weaknesses do if I should wish to boast\nI Would not be a fool for I Would be speaking the truth but I refrain from it so that no one may think more of me then he sees in me\nSo to keep me from being too elated by this surpassing greatness other Appalachians are soaring let's given me in the flash a message or a saint to harass me to keep me from being too late in three times\nI have to do with the lord about this that I should leave that nature leave me but he said to me my grace is sufficient for you\nFor my power is made perfect in weakness therefore and I will post all the more gladly of my weaknesses said that the power of Christ may rest upon me\nFor the sake of Christ than I Am content with weaknesses insults hardships persecution and around the days\nWhen I Am a week then I and strong this is the word of the word [noise]\nThe holy gospel according to saint Marc the sixth chapter ...\nJesus went away from there and came to his home town\nAnd his disciples followed him and on the Sabbath he began to teach in the synagogue and many who heard him were astonished saying where does this men get these things what is the wisdom given to him power such\nMighty work's done by his hands is not this the carpenter the son of Mary and the brother of James and chose this\nAnd judicious in Simon and are not his sisters here with us and they took offense at him\nAnd Jesus said to them a profit is not without honor except in his home town and among his relatives in his own household and he could do no mighty work there except that he laid out his hands on a few sick people and he ... he marveled because of their own belief\nAnd he went about among the villages teaching\nAnd he called the twelve and began to send them out to buy to engage them authority over the unclean spirits you charge them to take nothing for their journey except the staff\nNo bread no bag no money in their belts but to wear sandals and not put onto to nix and he said to them whenever you enter a house stay there until you depart from there and if any place will not receive you\nAnd they will not listen to you when you leave shake the dust that is on your feet as a testimony against them so they went out to proclaim that people should repent\nAnd the cast out many demons and anointed the oil and and anointed with oil money who were sick and healed and this is the gospel love the lord Mm\n\nChris Murphy and peace you forgot our father and our lord and savior Jesus Christ or even\nIf you would open your shoe Bible to second Corinthians eleven if you it is hard to find the smaller into estimate books in the back\nUh nine six nine page nine six nine if that helps you find that easier we're going to look at chapter eleven the whole the chapter before we get to chat for twelve [noise]\nSo we're looking at chapter eleven oh second Corinthians chapter a Saint Paul writes I Wish you would all bear with me and a little foolishness\n[laughter]\nI've given this a shot I Wish you would all bear with me I'm not going to be a full don't worry just um but to bear with me or for pulses for a few of John jealousy for you since ... to one husband to resent you as a pure version of Christ\nIs biased cutting your\nThoughts will be led astray from a sincere and pure devotion to Christ for someone comes in proclaims another Jesus then the one we proclaimed or if you receive a different spirit from the one you received or if you accept the different gospel from the one you accepted you put up with it readily enough\nIndeed I consider that I Am not in the least inferior to these super apostles\nPaws being a little snarky there by the way\nEven if I Am an skills in speaking I Am not so in knowledge and then in every way we have made this plane to you in all things or did not commit a sin humbling myself so that you might be exalted\nBecause I preach to God's gospel the free of charge a Rob other churches by accepting support from them in order to serve you and when I was with you and was in need I did not burden anyone for the brothers who came from Macedonia\nSupplied money so I refrained and we'll refrain from burdening you in any way\nAs the truth a crisis in me this boasting of mind will not be silenced in the regions of Cairo\nAnd why because I Do not love you God Knows I Do and what\nWhat I Do I Will continue to do in order to undermine the claim of those who would like to clean but in their boosted mission they work on the same terms as we do for such men are false apostles deceitful workman\nDisguising themselves apostles of Christ\nAnd no wonder for even Satan disguises himself as an angel light so it is no surprise of his servants also disguise themselves as servants of righteousness their end will correspond to their deeds\nI write\nI repeat ... no one think me foolish but even if you do accept me as a food so that I too may boasts a little what I'm saying with this boastful confidence I say not with the Lord's authority but as a\nFool since many boast according to the flush out you know boast for you gladly bear with fools being wise yourselves\nFor you Barrett if someone makes slaves of your devoured your takes advantage of you or puts on airs or strikes you in the face to my shame I must say we were too weak for that\nBut whatever anyone else dares to bow stuff I Am speaking as a fool I also dare to boost of that\nOr the Hebrew is so am I on the Israeli lives so am I why\nAre they offspring of Abraham so am I. R. they servants of Christ\nI'm a better one I Am talking like a madman\nWith far greater labor's far more in prisons with countless beatings and often near death five times I received at the hands of the Jews\nThe forty lash says lashes less won three times I was beaten with rods once I was stoned three times I was shipwreck a night and day I was drifting sea on frequent journeys in danger from rivers danger from robbers danger from my own people danger from gentile danger in the city danger in the ruins dangerous see\nUh in our world but but but also as we look at the Christian life pulses I think that the Christian life is is not meant to be chasing the next revelation or the next vision because it goes on to then say my grace is sufficient for you my powers made perfect and weakness Paul had these tremendous visions he was caught up to the third heaven\nAnd and we're supposed to think that yes he's some sort of a super apostle that he would have this kind of experience but he's really more spiritual than any of us\nBut to keep me from being too elated says the text God gave him of foreign in the flesh now who knows with a thorn in post flesh was nobody does there's endless speculation about what it is it could be an illness it could be that he never fully\nRecovered from the the blindness that he had when he was on the Damascus wrote it can be a number of things about one thing we do know is that he never recovered from even after he prayed three times for it to be taken away\nNow\nHow many how many stories that we heard with I prayed once and it didn't happen afraid twice and it didn't happen but I've heard the third time and\nIt happened\nWell Paul saying look I pray three times and it didn't happen the lord didn't take it away he did give him a word though and in my fancy Bible [laughter]\nNot are few Bible but in the fancy bibles there's red letters there where it says my grace is sufficient you for you my powers made perfect and we that's the lord speaking that Jesus speaking to Paul with this war\nAnd So Paul then says therefore I Will boost all the more of my weaknesses\nSo it was a power cries me rest upon when he's talking about is the surpassing power of God\nAnd that's what we boasting not her own spirituality not our own experience of visions of revelations but in the all powerful God who has worked something is by his grace by his love\nBiased mercy and all that we've all had an experience and that's why he says the very end for the sake of Christ and I'm content with witnesses insult\nHardships persecution and calamities from when I'm week then I'm strong if polls making this argument in this larger context which I Believe he is um\nBut ... thinks the Corinthian Christians were trying to say that Paul's not worth following\nBecause good things don't happen to him he just seems to be one of these kind of guys it's always beat up and Paul says no you've got the exact opposite way in fact amazing things happened to me and yet I still have this thorn in the flesh so that I can confess my weakness not my strength\n\nHow do we apply that to our own lives well I mean I\nThere are some people I Know who say they have a wonderful per life\nUm but I got to tell you sometimes I struggled to pray\nAnd and it's a weakness or sometimes it's hard to see the end of the week uh it's it's hard to see any result ah it's hard to see any movement and people's lives are last week when so few\nPeople were here I went home depressed okay that's my weakness this week I'll go home happy because so many people were here\nAt least relatively to last week okay but those are the kinds of weakness is I think that we all have in that we all share and yet God says you know it's Smith is not about you it's about my word and people's hearts in lives and so the whole point of the\nThe whole point of the next steps that I've been trying to do for about two years was to free to take one part of the message home with you and sometimes they connected with you and sometimes they didn't and that's fine\n\nBut I'm I'm running across more and more former Christians\nWho didn't really get it while they were there\nDidn't understand what they were doing in church who heard things that the pastor said and it never really made sense to them and so um I I I don't believe that Jesus stood up on a\nWell he did sit down and when he gave that a certain amount but I I don't believe that\n\nI Believe that the faith has caught not taught and so uh one of the things that I'm going to try to do is to create a little bit more of an open ... or in our in our time together or during the message time because I think it would uh maybe you appreciate the\nFormat maybe you're mad\nAt me let's just try it and see where it goes\n\nPower made perfect in weakness Paul says grace is sufficient don't look for everything to go from strength to strength to strength boasting what God has done for you in the name of Jesus\nI

there will always be lines to defeat\nThere's always going to be pitch to conquer and there's always going to be lines to defeat let's break that this break down the enormity of the situation that big bands under let's just look at it number one he is he he he but not chased a line now let me just stop who does that\nWho does something like that who just deliberately says I'm gonna chase chase meal a day\nYou know what he gets up one morning and he says you know what I'm gonna go chase male line\nI'm going to go knock him in the head and will stab him with a spear or steak or something you know you know and and for those few place we have some listening audience we may have some of my granddaughters one of them well what about the poor line\nSome of us are some of us are are are are animal lovers and what about the poor line well you know what I'm going to just kind of throw out a scenario or what if what if this line was eaten somebody every day\nYou know we've got a threat and the line is eating one of our children every day I woke up this morning I'm a kill that dude I'm going to put him where he belongs so let's break down the enormity of this okay he's they line chaser that's crazy but that's what he is he ... it was cloudy that day\nWe know it's cloudy because the word says it was on a snowy day it don't snow unclear days so it was a snowy day\nThere was snow on the ground it was cloudy visibility was very low he goes into a pet which is very dark anyway any ... and when he's in the pit he don't have good lot anyway because the snow in the clouds recovering the son he is he has all kinds of disadvantages\nA hillside into a pet is very slippery without snow on it so now he's got snow on the slope his footing as I'm sure a lot of this has twice the ...\n... but now I've got two feet on the ground the lions got for the launch two maybe three times the wake of big Ben he's twenty times the grape he's got a call ... everywhere and he can dig it into the earth and hold himself and he runs this thing into a pit in the ground it's dark it's\nWhen the spot nobody says oh yeah but now it's going to win this fight they man this has got my favorite he's gonna win the thoughts nobody's saying that let's just put ourselves in the crowd that day let's just put ourselves in the viewing audience that day you know but I ain't gonna make it\nThat's the dumbest guy I've ever seen in my life look at that guy chasing that line now for one thing was that line running when he could turn around and eat him he was chasing ... went whoa\nYeah he coming out he coming out but I'm not coming out y'all he's ... he's dead he's gone he's not coming out so this is the scenario that picture\nDon't do it then don't do it you can when you can't do this don't do it see\nNow it's something that no one else would even dare to attempt any one he come out that pet with a line skin coat he come out looking pretty good that day you know everybody thought he was going to be men which but he wouldn't he come out of there\nWith us Ron skin ... any one see I just want to mention trials and trophies\nSay everybody wants a trophy and nobody's really wanting the trial at all I'm I'm One of them and everybody wants to look what I did on my shelf\nNobody wants to look what I went through on my shelf huh look what I Would I don't ever want to see that again everybody wants to look what I did see trials in trophies everybody wants to trophy nobody wants to trial but get this but not as high as ... and counter was not defensive\nShould we automatically think well well there's a line that's attacking him no he attacked the line he chased the line it's not offensive he saw this as an opportunity not a survival\nHe went into all fits mode we're on off it's our job is to score by the way don't big ball big aren't we say about that go tigers too I think huh yeah OK but anyway those have you on hold them of fans I'm Sorry\nSorry that you won a\nBut big band saw this as an opportunity not as I survive all this was one of ... greatest opportunities and he said that\nThis is one of his greatest opportunities and he sees that how does ... line encounter relate to us today how do we equate that into our lives today how do we learn from his encounter\nSee we can choose to see our pets\nIn the ground and our lines\nWith her claws into different ways one in fear and one in faith\nSee a ... a friend of ours spoken to our lives back Thirty years ago twenty five years ago one of the godly man I've ever met in my life he compared fear to devil faith fear is devil face he would say and I believe in\nThe fear is the opposite of faith lines are many times opportunities in the skies\nLines opportunities many times in the sky's the crowd will always screamed don't do it don't do it this makes no sense do not do it fear will always make the lines larger and the pitch more slippery it will always make them that way and fear is low risk\nWell if we don't take if you know fear would say let's not take a risk and we won't lose anything\nWell if we don't take a risk we ... we might not we may not lose but we may not win see fear may say fear may say well it's not worth it\nLet's just let's just let's just look at at our Smith campus fear may say it's not worth it\nBut that young man two weeks ago that gave me it's hard to the lord was worth it to you\nThe to the folks that are showing up looking for church in a new community it's worth it fear would say well we can't do that\nBut ... says it's worth the risk\nSee sometimes

pretty much a free fall decline now that is very complex and a lot of reasons that we don't have to cover today\nOur nation has become far more secular a young people especially are not attending less people are in church than ever before in modern history\nSome of it as much of it is self inflicted from harsh judgmental mean spirited Christianity all among some churches to pedophile priest and a Roman Catholic tradition and on and on very complex but ultimately the root cause\nIs a failure of churches to engage in effect of the vandalism for the twenty first century\n\nNow there are churches they are a minority but they do find ways to reach new people they're willing to adapt and to make changes and to make it a priority and work hard and a few of those are thriving\nMost are not they are not making a vandalism a priority they're not willing to adapt to make changes to a changing world and they are slowly dying\nOff by the multitudes\nYou know if you really boil it all down there about three reasons why they shouldn't matter to you and me as Christian believers and members of the church three ways reasons why we really should care about reaching people for Jesus\nAnd a community of faith and won't take me about a moment or two I like to share with you why it matters\n\nAnd the first reason out by far the most important is because God has challenged any even command at his church\nTo reach people for him\nAnd our Lord Jesus Christ we see that in this very interesting strange text today this parable Jesus tells him look for teen climax thing with the master saying go out on the streets and invite\nAll the ... even the poor crippled the blind the lame so that my house maybe full\nSeeking people for Christ and for the community of faith is a major gospel mandate it comes from the heart of God\nNo the grace and love and teaching and our ... samples of Jesus Christ who wants people connected to the family of God this was a huge concern for Jesus\nIn fact he said it was his mission\nOur lord wants that I came to see can save last last words of Jesus you know them I'm sure going all the world and make disciples of may\n\nSo the first reason why this matters why we should care it is the heartbeat of God who challenges and calls us to reach\nOut and bring others into the kingdom and the community safe\nSecond reason we are called to reach people and very much related to the first reason is simply that people needed\nPeople\nNeed Jesus still today people need a community of faith still\nToday regardless of how much education they have regardless of how much money they have all of us are complete without knowing Jesus and without being part of a church family it is just too hard of a journey not to have comrades along the way\nPeople that love and support people we can laugh with and cry within and walk with us on the path away people we can worship within serve within\nAnd love together as family and we need this and what concerns me about many things is that in our part of the world in the Bible belt we just assume erroneous light\nThat everybody in the Bible belt in Cookeville, Tennessee is connected to a church when the research shows when I looked at this not long ago [noise] fifty seven percent of people and putting them county on our region around here are not connected to a church family\nNow they may be on the role of some of his church for Thirty years ago but fifty seven percent are not actively involved in a church in anybody's\nAnd got cause us to reach them because they need that spiritual connection in their lives so God commands that people need it and finally I won't mention this is not nearly as important but it's worth noting since we're talking about it today\n\nThe third reason why this matters is that if a church is going to have a viable future we absolutely must constantly reach a\nAnd brand new people and just let me give you one example\n\nThe research is pretty clear especially in larger membership churches like ours\nYou can expect to lose about ten percent of your worshipping attendants every single year year after year decade after decade our congregation on a Sunday about five hundred people show up over a year's average most of them are at the early service but that's about how many we have\n\nWhich means we lose fifty people a year twenty or more die the sheer gosh twenty seven or more of a\nTen or Fifteen become physically incapacitated and can no longer connect and I could call a lot more names than Fifteen or twenty over this last year\nAnd another ten or Fifteen just move they they go to another town to take a job or whatever a few others become an active for different reasons but the point is if we do not continually and ... and welcome new people our future is no future\nTo Tennessee tech it'd be kind of like a Tennessee tech quit recruiting freshman well it wouldn't take too many years before there would be no more college\nAnd so this matters because the heart of God is to reach people for Christ\nBecause people need a community and\nNot nearly as important\nBut our future viability depends upon it along with every other\nChurch in the world and you know when the and even in these kind of strange days we live in an America where religion is losing ground rich people\nAre still not all that complicated I'm not saying that's easy but it's not complicated the most effective way to reach people for Jesus Christ and his church is the same way it has been for two thousand years\nIt is by inviting and welcoming that's it really\nCamp Programme that she can't do it on a website it's person to person inviting folks maybe to worship but there's ... billion other ways to do that invite them to a Wednesday night male invite them tonight to a concert we have those events all the time\nInvite them to your son is go class or men's group or women's groups people want to serve and make a difference invite them to help you serve at the food pantry a jury what's in her all the other ways we do around here there's so\nMany ways breakfast with Santa will become and before long there's something every week that if we made it a priority and we both we engage in invitation many of those people would indeed\nCome and check it out\nAnd then after you invite than we welcome\nAnd I may have big welcome we're glad you're here what is your name so happy to see hope you will return to let them know they are loved and appreciated that\nIn a nutshell is the best way we ever make this happen\nAnd I share from a pastor's heart that I Am so proud of the congregation on so many levels we do so many things so well you give up your time and your money and your energy and we serve and there's just dozens of things that we do extremely\nWell but not this\nAnd the greatest need a first United Methodist church Cookeville is that we gain a heart and a burden on a passion for inviting and welcoming especially the next generations and made a church home\nAnd who need a Methodist connection church on\n\nIt's been a few years ago now I heard a story that I like to share with us I wrap my thoughts up today

and don't bother to look beyond that what'd you can't miss the stories that even a sore throat might be blamed on a person's weight ... says many people seem to think fat shaming has value perhaps especially with the doctors doing it\nThere seems to be this ongoing public perception that maybe wait bias or stigma not such a bad thing maybe it will motivate or incentivize people to leave right\nWhen you look at the research on that we actually see that exactly the opposite is true that being a target of weight stigma are bowling or discrimination leads to a range of negative emotional and physical health conscious\nThings like depression and anxiety suicidal thinking but we also see that it leads to a range of maladaptive or unhealthy behaviors like increasing calorie intake disordered eating binge eating bought into physical activity\nThere are now longitudinal studies showing that over time people who are discriminated against\nBecause of their weight actually have an increased the likelihood of obesity weight gain over time and we also see that this leads to heightened physiological stress\nSome people actually kind of believe that shaming someone and I don't think that doctors intentionally mean to shame\nSomeone but that is the end result that's simply not an effective motivator and in fact it leads people to feel like well why should I take care of myself I'm really not a very good person anyway and my doctor already assumes that I'm not doing what I should be doing\nStudies show that there are medical consequences as well\nPatients who perceive that they have been stigmatized about their weight\nBy a doctor have less trust and that Dr they tend to have really impaired treatment outcome for the for example they might not news as much weight

have the kind of from the provider aside evidence that\nDoctors may actually spend less time in appointments with patients have obesity compared to us in our patients that they provide less health

first presented with it it was very far advanced and she died very young of medicine at breast cancer that could have been caught early and treated if she'd been going to doctors routinely and specifically because of the harsh treatment for weight she didn't go\nSo what can medicine due to break the cycle gets in pools so you'd have to start in medical school my teaching would be doctors to be more aware of personal attitudes biases and the causes will be used to be or a lot more complex ... personal responsibility cater says doctors also need to learn to focus less on weight

well bodies are born to be\nDiverse some people are no matter how they take care of themselves will probably always be center people some people no matter how they take care of themselves are always going to be larger fatter people so that goal really is\nTo encourage positive behaviors\nBut ... says all of those changes would amount to swimming upstream if our culture doesn't change\nMaybe we have the expectation that physicians are going to come in and fix this but are greater culture is actively propagating obesity right America runs on Dunkin' we market multi colored marshmallows is part of a complete breakfast McDonalds and Coca Cola or the sponsors of the Olympics\nCulture there is massive propagation of confusion about what a healthy diet is about what it's okay to eat about

author ... printer and strategy coach how we are and Tennessee's leading strategy business specialist Johnny sites\nThen his business work [noise]\nWelcome to business works this is how we are along with Johnny sites and we're here today we're going to be talking about collaborating and cooperating\nIn terms of running your business the idea of having a business\nFor most people translates into getting caught up getting inside their own show and focusing on their own business to the exclusion of everything else around them many times that happens and especially for entrepreneurs um and what we're going to be talking about today\nIs that there are many other ways to build your business to recruit people to do all kinds of things that doesn't cost any money\nAnd you can do that by reaching out and building your own community as well as taking advantage of the communities are out there so drawn to you have a\nA couple of the standard type communities that we all tend to get involved with especially new businesses jumping to\nRide um it's not uncommon for business people and they joined a community to go to the chamber of commerce and joined there\nUm because you get a lot of other business people who were there and you can build your network fairly quickly\nAnd other than that I participated in for years the Rotary Club because Rotary Club requires attendance of all their members so you can feel fairly confident than the road remembers you're going to be there if you make the effort to come\nSo I thought that was a good club as well\nAnd these are both national organizations but they are run locally and and they are focused wrote locally built for also of course better Business Bureau people get involved with the different kinds of social\nSo she Asians entrepreneur centers women in business centres all all those kinds of things exist so it's worse when you're starting up to look around and see what's there and take advantage of those things\nUm and we tend to get caught up in that and sometimes we stay with that and don't do anything else and so what I guess we're talking about today is that there are lots of other ... there are other directions we can take\nTo to build our own businesses and to book basically help others in our business community and that that applies to professional practice to if you are for example a doctor in an office complex that houses lots of doctors\nThere was a perfect opportunity to ah collaborate and and build a some kind of\nAn structured and may be unofficial organization but to build a relationship that produces um increase patient volume for every one ... that because you're not all of the exact same specialization and so that is true is business as well I'm\nNot sure you want them at the best organizations I was ever a part of was an organization where five hundred contractor from around the country men together three times a year um started out two times a year and I wouldn't go down and meet with them and they were so welcoming\nAnd so a happy to share ideas that's a\nPerfect example of what kinds of people were were going there\nDanger all contractors general contractors so they would come there with ideas of how to deal with your subs what kind of contracts to use every question you could ever want\nAnd the money you know and that's why it's important because it's a it's an instrument it's a tool you can use without having to spend money I'm beyond anything you're already doing you and and so it takes energy and it takes some time and it may be that you have one\nSuper employee working with you who has the ability to follow up with these ideas and then build those kinds of relationships of for you if it's not something you want to do personally\nThe bottom line is it's going to help your business\nAnd our real estate friends to understand is because you hear you know what I'm saying what's important in real estate location location location location [laughter] those are the top three at him\nAnd it's important to understand that and they do because if you get into an area where there's not much traffic and you're retail business you're killing yourself and you might have a cheaper brand\nBut you're still going to have difficulty every building your business because nobody really knows where you are in ... only your existing customers will come there and if you continue to do um get business with them but then when somebody\nPasses away or somebody moves out of town or death something is going to cause them not to be your client anymore if you are bringing in New people all the time your business is ultimately going to die she had to take take charge of that and make sure that you're in areas where there's a high traffic cat if your businesses retail\n... another an instrument here a specialized sponsorships which ... which concerned with what's around he's talking about because if you build a base besides your customer base that you have because of beer the nature of your services or products\nIf you build a base that ties in with for example of veterans or public services or environmental issues or charity groups\nUm ... you are expanding the length and breadth of your business a market you are opening doors to new potential business and some of you may know this already and maybe have been doing it but you might be a good time to step back and see whether or not it's really being effective\nAnd if it's not how what do you do what's your quick fix on without spending money is it a matter of making some phone calls or walking over and visiting with another business and and introducing yourself and what you're doing and talk to them about it\nNot bad stuff to do\nSo there's another consideration to ... and that is often times are traffic engineers think that it best thing for traffic and two for business as to stop people on the highway and put a red light up there and make sure they stop and look and see\nBut we have examples in our town of where people have come in big chains have come in and located at a place where a red light backs up to traffic pass the entrance and nobody can get into their place so it makes it difficult and people don't\nPeople don't try to get in there it's too hard and then the business news out of town and we need to have our traffic said after where people can get to where they want to go not be stopped in the hindered and kept from doing that so it seemed like every time we have um\nA some change to the traffic patterns answer is to put up another red line and we're\nTalking during the break we were talking about an example where the fast food entity in one town\nThat had only had\nAccess in and out into a main thoroughfare and there was no\nUh and and yet the the the plays back up to um a a hotel complex had there been some arrangement to open up a drive area\nUm they would probably still be there and not have moved out of town because there would have been more access it will probably would have helped a hotel and the hotel where to help them but you know it and it was a matter of maybe twenty feet [laughter] you know so it it seems like when you have opportunities like that trying to take advantage of them\nUm we're going to take another quick break here and we'll be right back and uh we we hope you'll stay with us because next is the all of the keys to how to make this work\n[noise] business works news talk Ninety four point one sponsored by board Lincoln after battle you'll get by dark popular service that board Lincoln up Cookeville

in order to build your business\nCommunity a type considerations\nIs your access to a wealth of information\nSo you might have all the information you need 'em one place and in many communities provide that but maybe need to go out and look for a little more maybe there are ways that you have not thought about the would be good directions to take and and that goes for getting support that you didn't know you needed maybe joining you can address\nSo as I said one of the most effective organizations that I've ever been a part of was one where uh people in line can businesses from across the nation met for the express purpose of sharing ideas to explore and new opportunities\nThere were many things that I picked up from that and brought back to our company and used and it was very helpful and I know others have done the same thing and you\nBuild relationships when you're doing you know the network on your own\nWell we ... we started meeting with justice private grape Fifteen or after we built these relationships and we started sharing financial information which we didn't do it in a bigger very\nBut we shared a lot of other things with a bigger group by what they're smaller group we really got into them in helping with issues like family issues that we were experiencing a among the group members\nAnd it really did help and we learned how important it was to be\nOpen and win generous with our knowledge sharing what we had\nSo sharing what you have also comes down to sharing I'm your sense of your purpose of your business and your marketing\nWith others as well and how to pull others into a marketing framework that benefits all of your um ... that's not necessarily going to cost money it has to do as much with an attitude that you represent to the public as it does with a media buys you make\nIn you know a lot of times how we're nervous if people steal our ideas although many others across the country have the same idea of using it and we we get very a close to the vast we don't want to share with anybody know what we're doing\nAnd the truth of the matter is those people that would steal your technology\nMany times are just too darn lazy to go out and put in place it takes effort to put in place I had a man one time he was working for me and he stole a lot of our documents to go start his own company and be in competition with us\nAnd five million more than tuned into the designs game seven of the NBA Finals urban says whether we all know does it or not video games have become as major and entertain been medium is anything else\nThere is perhaps too easy parallel to draw with the history of cinema that's\nA useful analogy and it takes us pretty far but not all the way where the early days of cinema it was merely a\nTechnical achievement that cinema was great because all the sudden they're moving pictures and then all of a sudden they're sound with them than bench there's color and all these different technical advances\nHelped people who are thinking in terms of artistry and self expression they started to use these tools to their advantage Orson Welles certainly didn't invent cinema but he revolutionized it he demonstrated that it is a valid artistic platform or art form\nWe solved the same sort of development with video games where beginning in Nineteen fifty eight at a government lab on Long Island we had a game called tennis for to that by any definition today's is crude and\nFrankly boring but every generation added to the technical prowess at our fingertips\nOf course we growing popularity video games are very famously been score and the game doom has been blamed for embolden ing Columbine shooters in the months leading up to the massacre\nMore reasonably parenting groups have come out against games like call of duty and mortal combat for exposing children to increasingly realistic violence\nUrban says this isn't so much of a problem with video games as it is something the entire culture indeed still reckon with\nPeople don't understand that video games are just another form of expression and they're still seen as\nSomething other than what we're accustomed to from our storytelling media a large part of that I think has to do with the perception of video games as violent most people when we think of video games we think of guns and militaristic shoot 'em ups first person shooter games\nAnd it's true that those are often the most popular and best selling games every year just as the most popular and bestselling films tend to be you know quite violent but at the same time just as though there's a lot of violence at the cineplex\nThere are also the local our house theaters showing great thoughtful quiet contemplate of films video games work the same way there are an enormous number of really beautiful smaller games are independent games made by individuals who are just trying to get some idea across\nUrban says it's important for people to see video games as more than just violent ... there's so much more to the vast library of games then just first person shooters\nGames can teach empathy they can teach social skills video games can teach high level of problem solving they can be as maddening in some regards is the most difficult crossword puzzles they can teach us motor control in some regards\nThere are frivolous video games they're our video games that are as junkie as brain candy like as the worst Hollywood spectacles but there are also video games that are\nAre working at a deep intellectual\nOn assumptions about it ... it was a child in the Nineteen seventies the light ball that video games could be more than just disposable entertainment wind off in his mind when he was just a kid\nIt's one of those experiences that right now we take for granted it's so mundane that we no longer think about it\nThere was a game called adventure on the Atari twenty six hundred and this was the first game where there was an avatar on the screen and that represented us as players and of course this is obvious now we have avatars in every game we play where all these characters and all these games\nBut the first time that we saw that I saw that was this little innocuous square on Atari twenty six hundred that all the sudden that was me somehow on the screen and I'm also sitting on the floor the living room with the controller the joystick in my hand\nThat represents a fundamental shift in what it means to be human and that sounds like a grand statement but I I think it's true\nThat Walt Whitman famously said I'm large I contain multitudes and he was speaking about how each of us as an individual\nHas all these different voices and personality is an attitude and we are complex difficult creatures\nWith that little square and adventure for the first time it wasn't that I contain multitudes it's that I Am multitudes I Am more than one thing at one time\nAnd time has gone on bourbon says that experience has become even more engaging is the video game industry has grown more and more vast\nThe greatest strength of the video game medium is that diversity of games and kind of games and that goes along with the diversity of the players themselves everybody plays games now every demographic every age group it's a very exciting thing\nAnd I think that speaks to what makes this medium slightly different from books which I Love obviously I've written a book there's an inter activity to reading there is an indoor activity to watching a movie I don't think we're merely passive viewers\nBut when we play a video game there can be a social aspect that is enormously rewarding and I think that communal experience of telling and sharing and experiencing stories together is very exciting\nUrban says that ultimately light films before them video games in Prince ended their status is the technical achievement and become something more powerful\nThan general idea that I started with is kind of videogame be a work of art\nHas the definition of what we consider art broadened enough or had video games progressed enough as a medium that they've become artful and what I've discovered is that the ladder is certainly true that there are video games right now that are\nDoing all the things that great movies do and great books do great TV does\nWe're seeing that more and video games now\nAcross any platform you might have at your disposal their artistic games that you can find that are going to make you think about the world differently and think about yourself differently even on your iPhone or your cell phone there's a game called passage\nCreated by a man named Jason ... or\nThe museum of modern art in New York has added this game to their permanent collection which I think says something\nIt takes five minutes to play the game and within that five minutes evil experience an entire lifetime and the life of a character it starts and use the game ends at old age and eventually death and to have what seems like a simple video game raised questions about mortality itself to me is tremendous\nAnd passage using alone bourbon also recommends the ... monument valley and the PlayStation regained\nFor people looking

E. and Bernie Marcus go Home Depot they both credits her mother was having a strong influence that impacted the life for many years to come you found that is well did you not\nHas certainly in my case as well uh my father was a manager of construction project ... many of them were you know in Europe or in Asia and so he was gone for you know six months or a or nine months or so at a time\nThough my mother probably the biggest influence and I'm putting my goals and values and\nOne thing that she was killed on him is that knowledge is key to progress you know and you should learn as much as possible you should do well in school and you should use your other time to learn and so I became very active member of the local public library and going in there\nLooking for all the exciting new book that would come in and I remember one time I tried to read all\n... volumes of the way they pretend to be on the basis of what I Would have a database of everything that has happened in the world but then I realized that\nIt would have everything that happened before or the book was published though I realize the important thing is keeping up to date with the new trends in the market\nSo I I Would tend to think that that paper route also talk to the value of delivering information ahead to influence you a little bit\nThe I've certainly made me impressed by people's enthusiasm for the information I was a diver and how they were I was anxious people working for me to come around and drop the newspaper of the day off if they're\nOn their front step um and and then I could tell from um you know when I was coming in to make their collection on Saturday to uh for the deliveries as they know who would be polite and say thank you and I you know really\nA greatly value getting in the newspaper a timely basis at every day every week\nOr ... moving on hum you went to parochial schools as a young man as a boy and I'm telling me a little bit about the St Martin in Philadelphia was there an advantage or disadvantage going to a parochial school would not do for you\nWell I think the um the nuns were very dedicated to education and so they put a lot of stress on the quality of education and I'm making sure that we were learning and doing well in our uh our past the going forward so that was a\nA helpful and they certainly instilled the no ... of belief and the\nImportance of living on moral and ethical wife and ah you know than a that real that God is an important\nA factor in your life and that you should follow the commandments and should treat people with respect and I'm I'm that you should make sure that you do nothing that you wouldn't be a you know that you're not going to be proud of and I do it right in the long run you'll\nYou'll wind up having the best result\nIs that what you're saying to counteract a lot of the scandals rather unfortunate through there but there's so many more stories pat or they're not of people who do the right thing to make it to the top\n... exactly and that usually a pay it pays off I think you know what goes around comes around with you\nAnd they have a you know ways we start to the see other people pretty soon that a deception is known and then people you know you lose their confidence in you and if they\nLose you the confidence in you then you have a tremendous a weakness in terms of they're not willing to trust you and follow your ideas is ingestion so\nUm it is a very counterproductive to you know take shortcuts that are unethical or in Morrow\nHad during your time and St Martin school um that was a pretty competitive environment was not\nA Oh yes it was they had the various wars the medal for the best and it's a subject than the\nUh the star list on the wall so there was a lot of the rating and ranking and the ... I was a you know wanted to uh get on the top of all the lists are so it was a good motivator for me to study extra hard\nWell one of the things I was going to look to eventually you went from saint Martin and you've got accepted\nTo MIT my records told me you were the first student from St Martin to ever get accepted to MIT tell the listeners what you did this is so creative um the project they got the attention of ... MIT\n... mentioned I'd go to the public library of several times a week and a one day I went in there and Nineteen fifty three and there was a new book that has just been published and was available called giant brains are machines that think that was\nThe first book that tried to explain how these new computer technology would really enhance the power of the human mind would extend the memory facts available to people greatly would be able to see\nOh I Do is make more insightful decisions and be more productive so I got so excited about this that I took a about two months of savings from my paper route to the library and went down to the hardware store\nAnd bought strip civil blooming them for oil and a bell wire and a small light bulbs\nUh from flashlights and plywood boards and and a bill to pay a handmade computer system are made up a little relays or that are played an unbeatable game of tic tac toe ah so ah\nAnd then I found out when I gave it to my friends that are so excited about this apparently interact intelligent interaction with a machine but then they noticed they could only time they would never win so\nI put a little counter in the back of every uh fortieth move would be random and occasionally they could win ... found that a factor of hope I made the machine very very popular and it was always lots of people queuing up to a play at\nThe biggest would love you and\nIt was you know entered into a science fair and what a prize and that attracted the MIT alumni association in Philadelphia\nA now to get me a full scholarship to go to MIT to study a more seriously computer science and\nParticularly uh uh I was excited about the idea if you if you understood the organization of human mind\nThen you could actually designed computers more effective for more effective it and they use for people because you would see the analogy between the human intelligence and then the intelligence created through uh the electronic designs of these systems now\nPat when you got accepted to MIT prior to that were you encouraged or discouraged from the wrecked or or the new specials at your school\n[noise] ah well that was it's an interesting point when I did get a scholarship I previously um gotten scholarships to a number of the Catholic schools and of course the rector says you know why didn't you go to Notre Dame or a villain over other schools that are\nThe Catholic tradition and ah I said right now appreciate that but uh\nI Would like to know ... get myself I'm interested in technology and I want to go to school that has the best reputation for teaching technology and you know the the course they'll have a chaplain there and I'll be able to\nContinue to attend religious services so I uh I said I wanted to follow that course to get the best education I could of the subject\nI was interested in and they just try to discourage me a little bit but uh I just stuck to my commitment\nTo being kind my research said the the way you're going to get in the ...\nThere were um [noise] I think a much uh twenty thousand students before me that uh and several had applied but had never been accepted so I was the first one to accept it to MIT\nYou are very humble man of folks are going to find out you know packets accepted an MIT takes biophysics how old is a ... student make the transition in the business and build up

checks I rushed to the bank or because I had made up a name called international data cooperation and it just about just for the proposal purposes was just going to be a shot in the dark and then\nThe bank said oh that's a corporate name you can't put that in your personal account you have to form real corporation get by laws have directors authorized the\nA bank account and so I thought oh my goodness what happens if all this name has already been registered to be stuck but fortunately it was in and say formed the corporation and\nAnd that that was all the capital that we ever put into the company was that two hundred and twenty five thousand dollars and so I'd become a big advocate of what we call customer base finance thing if you can go out and presented an idea that people it was interesting enough you know they will they will have makes an advance payments\nAnd uh when they do that they become a real advocate for you because they want you to succeed and they encourage their

consumers will\nUse online you know order stuff um\nPossibly ship it to to the store we find fifty seven percent I'm a likely that option on as well as going in the store so we really see a lot of blending of options with so many um available\nOr so we do find that that still Seventy three percent of consumers say they enjoy the experience of going into stores they liked the decorations they like the holiday music and that can help them sort of get in that mindset to stop to start going so it's really about\nOptions um and about using you know all those resources available\nYeah and I feel like when it comes to the holiday music whether it's playing on the radio really earlier or in the stores people either love it or hate it\nBut like what they're the Christmas decorations already we're not even on Halloween or are they really like everything's coming up so what are some other you down from the lifestyle monitor survey\nSo we do find that consumers are planning to spend about six hundred and eighty dollars on gifts this holiday season\nUm they buy for an average of seven people so that that totals up to about a hundred dollars per person so you can expect to get some ah some nice gifts this year hopefully and of that too yeah I it's it's a big chunk of money um\nAnd I've got about two hundred and forty dollars is going to be spent on clothing uh so so we do see those um\nThose categories being very important um inn and holiday shopping being very robust this year\nOkay now I Know sometimes the people who are closest to me I have the most trouble finding gifts for are trying to figure out why should I get them where people turn for inspiration\n[laughter] so you know ... ... fortunately my brother does not follow this but a ... a source of inspiration to ask the person\nThat you're giving for giving to so forty one percent of people say that that is their sort and what about as a source of inspiration um\nOther people family friends colleagues are are are remain a very important source\nAnd then of course new a new source of the social media the websites of retailers and brand um we find that planning is an increasingly important part of people's shopping so that while they still like to be you know very much like going in stores they like to plan that out before\nTo do that right now I find you know Black Friday is coming up next month and I know I used to line up very early in the morning I have not done that in a few years because I just thinking the and also we can do so much of that on line now\nHow are you finding people are shopping according to sail stays and how are they taking advantage of promotions throughout the year\nSo we you know sales are still eat a a great catalyst for people whether it be because they they like that experience of getting up early and going with friends\nOr because it's a reminder that it's time to to get in the air raid us so we see that forty one percent of consumers say they plan to shop in store on Black Friday\nOn and forty seven percent say they plan to shop on line on Black Friday a but of course we have the you know Amazon Prime day Thanksgiving a day\nAfter Thanksgiving small business Saturday we have lots of days and we find that each of them are popular time for consumers to think about plan shop in and and and finally make us purchases\nYeah what would you say or some of the high products that share that people are going to purchase for the holidays\nMhm so you know we ask every year about the clothing or the types of products people by and clothing and gift cards at the top on the list to look so fifty six percent of consumers say they're going to buy clothing as gifts\nAnd gift cards or as a write about their toys and electronics are also a favorites for particularly my nine year old\nSo [laughter] so we\nDo find it a bit of diversification is people kind of try out new products um and new categories of products that gift but those for our our kind of a year after year our popular choices for gifts\nYeah and you know what I used to think that gift cards there is so boring and you should be creative and your own thing but you know now that I have a baby or a toddler now I think have cards\nAre wonderful because they don't take it you could use them whatever you want to Catherine Bruce into so much for joining me today I look forward to following cut and incorporated lifestyle\nMonitor survey even further and happy shopping I Hope it goes well\nFor you and really this sounds good you too thanks so much\nThank you coming up next I'm willing to talk about the shows deer Evan hands and I just saw it on Broadway it was amazing and we're going to also talk to a psychologist about anxiety in children as it related to the show more coming up I'm a shelter than\n\nBring the kids out for a fun field night of games prizes and trees it's the annual bluegrass drunk or treat that first United Methodist church parking garage in Cookeville It's Wednesday October thirty first from six to eight thirty PM at the corner of the broad street just\nIf you are based emotions anger based emotions and then with with certain children again every child will be a little bit different but sometimes you may also see\nThat in moments of of great overwhelm as a result of this anxiety children may shift from showing 'em anger even fear to showing sadness this cleanest again that I mentioned before um and withdraw as well if it just all becomes you know a little bit uh uh too much for them\nRight and so what kind of parents do what would be the first step that a parent can take if they see this in their child and they're wondering is this something that they're going through\nRight right so one of the the things that I think parents I'm also need to to keep in mind especially if they have a more than one child and if they have boys and girls as well as at girls do tend to experience things id more\nThan boys do and this is true for depression as well and we would need kind of a whole other conversation to go into the biological and are mono developmental reasons for that but I think that the first and most important thing for parents to to\nReally do is give their children the benefit of the doubt so I listed a number of symptoms are just now and there's also many more and many of them can be a result of other causes as well and so parents and teachers sometimes were dismissed these behaviors as\nYou know either laziness bad behavior\nProvocation defines and so on to the ... the first thing is we need to to trust your child to give them the benefit of the doubt that something really is going on and then if you notice any of these uh symptoms you'll behaviors emotions happening follow your child's lead for\nA few days and just to observe them see how these things play out and speak to them about it of course in an age appropriate ways so you could say something like for example you know I've noticed that you're not quite as excited about going to soccer\nSoccer practice and more as you were before and I was wondering\nWhat might have changed for you that is taken that excitement away or something along those lines yeah and then after that sorry go ahead\nNo go ahead that's very helpful gone sure and so then the then the next thing really is to be very patient\nAnd you know if you have a shy child or if you haven't and interpret a child\nUm those parents will will know what that can look like they may not open up you know their heart and their mind to immediately until you exactly what is going wrong as compared to you know more chatty more talkative open extroverted children so if they need some space and time give it to them\nAnd really give it to them freely and nonjudgmental early and\nSee what comes out of your conversations you know and notice if your child is and this is really key for anxiety if they're making interpretations or assumptions about you know their environment they're not accurate and that are causing anxiety because the these these kind of skewed assumptions are often at the ...\nSee if you can help them take a more balanced and unrealistic view and work to generate some ideas together with your child about how you can tackle some of these issues and then of course ultimately it's none of this is helping and your child is still feeling the same absolutely seek\nProfessional help and I can't stress enough you know don't hesitate or be embarrassed because these are treatable issues as with everything else the earlier you catch them\nAnd to better the outcome will be and they're definitely not a result of you know your inability to to help your child\nRight and I feel like that there can be such a stigma on mental health and there shouldn't be like for instance on October tenth that with mental health awareness day and it is so important to just know that\nIt's much more common than you might think there have been Hampton works closely with mental health nonprofits including child mine it just dude and the ... foundation because we know that this is so important just as important if not more than a child physical\nHealth and we need to pay the most attention now talking about paying attention to all of that I feel like a lot of parents may miss the sign because children are so distracted by technology nowadays that they're not really having as many conversations as they do\nYes yeah definitely definitely one one aspect of\nUm the story of of technologies which which I'm very focused on in in my work and parenting in the age of technology in particular\nUm one aspect is is a distraction of children and a few years ago when two really started paying attention to the impact that technology has we were at first only focused on the kids and then about a year or two into it we kind of turned our gaze into the direction of the parents and asked\nWell hang on what are the parents doing and and we realized with the parents are actually quite distracted themselves so absolutely this is something that children themselves are reporting um as well according to some recent findings from organizations such as common sense media so we're seeing reports that or fifty percent\nIn some cases over fifty percent of adolescents have some experience of it trying to get their parents' attention and failing to do so feeling ignored so there's definitely a kind of distraction on on on both sides of that relationship\nAnd this is really is a serious issue and I think many parents do realize this and and they're realizing it more and more but I fear that many also don't um because our our ... Hughes is the\nBest interrupting and at worst severing are connections with the people around us and we have to take I think a very hard an honest look at our behavior in relation to attack and then begin making some repairs um as soon as possible because\nThere's nothing more important to a child's social and emotional development\nThan to feel seen by their parents and this is how they know that they matter\nUm that they are relevant in this world and when they're very very young and this is how they know that\nYou know that they are ... that they actually exist you know by being seen and this is what provides the the very foundation of every other healthy developmental mine milestone that uh you know your child will reach but if you're too busy to make your child feel this way\nAh you're shaking up that that foundation I realize that may sound a little bit apocalyptic when I say that but you're right I agree with you yeah it is it really is that the just the simple truth of um of child development they know that they that they exist because we make them feel that they exist and that they matter and they're the focus of our attention\nUm but if we you know shift our focus on to a device\nOf of whatever kind you know there's only so much of our of our attention that can go out so I think that might be one of the helpful ways in which parents can think about that whatever attention you're dedicating to to the device or social media to text seeing you know whatever\nIt was that that that's you know the attention and and the time and the connection that's taken away from from your child at that moment yeah a hundred percent and I know that when\nMy daughter was born I found myself looking at my phone a lot whenever I led to catch up on emails and I said you know at the top and it really does it has to stop from the moment your child is born thank you so much she adored have bitch this has been so helpful such an informative segment if somebody would like to get in touch with you how can they reach\nYou so there are a few different ways um people can find me on my website which is Tio so T.

you know a long time since I've done an afternoon show actually what twenty five years ago when they show first started over on W. only see it was a Sunday night show stay that way up until we moved the show bogus I guess about Fifteen Years ago to one of four or five then it became a\nA morning show we added the Saturday show it a little bit later anyway and here we are so welcome in we'll be back to our regular time of course next week a\nLot to talk about today gotta look at a lot of different areas or we'll talk certainly about the game uh we'll talk about some things coming out of the game uh I Do want to tell you this though I I I broke rule to for today's show normally always after ... when did the show in the morning at least\nUm I don't listen to anything after the game I don't listen to the post game comments by coaches players animal is anything like that nor do I read anything about it until after I Do the show the next morning I Want everything they've got to be my thoughts and what I've written down and take a lot of notes during games and try to look at it from a coach's perspective\nUp and then bring that to you well I I got away from that a little bit this morning so some of what the we're going to be doing is\nReacting to some things were set ... primarily I got to take a real good look if you haven't heard it yet again wash U N I encourage you to go watch Jeremy ... post game press conference you've heard me talk about this before\nOr his his a\nPress conferences are oppressors after practice are extremely interesting to me I tried to find a way to watch all of those\nUh by the way just so you know I'm pushing the athletic director to get those on the website uh I think he's probably going to do it it's interesting stuff and I'm Talking about the University of Tennessee website football at like ... website\nPost game I was always there needs to get those practice was up there to push them hard on that hopefully we'll get that but bottom line is is eating find those things you learn a lot of things about what this have coaches thinking because\nI'm sure he doesn't say everything he's thinking but he says a lot of things he's thinking and kind of some things he doesn't say gives you a little idea what he's thinking to anyway we'll talk about that today and let's get this out of the way right now now yesterday's outcome\nThe Alabama game was not accept spec unexpected by this show host\nOr you know I Try to stay positive in games and give ways it to the city can do some things can do some things but listen Alabama brought one of the very best teams that I personally have ever seen playing ... and I've seen some good ones\nI've seen some outstanding southern Cal teams come in there when I was coaching in Alabama teams Ann Arbor a Auburn teams just to mention if you uh I ... I saw an outstanding Oklahoma team come in there a few years ago and an Oregon team before that this was in and I don't really even think it's close\nThis is the best team that I've seen that the best I've seen in Alabama bring in and also the best team I think I ever seen actually play need I'm Talking about again that that I actually watch on TV or there may be some gays before Nineteen sixties maybe\nYou know why he was able to do that because it was on the road you can't do that at home because you got crowd noise a lot of crowds ... so that's\nYou know now again you'd much dresser he'd much rather play at home but that's just kind of a by product out of that but he ... he had players not looking over their young players that weren't doing things the right way he made ... are they asking about that said he got kicked that should've been kicked daddy hit a guide right in front of me\nAgain poised ... Taylor is an excellent player I think he is going to be once he gets in the ... a good offseason program\nWhen he you know he he ... he really hasn't played hardly any defensive back in his life\nQuarterback in high school may played little defense but that was certainly when he's ... he's learning how to play and he's going to be a good one but hey he he got ... and it hurt the team\nAnd I'm sure he's been told you selfish you punch your guy\nHad a running back number thirty three do it also he pushed the guy got kicked out and that hurts a team got eating ... game he got Fifteen or family that was more of a slap bottom line is though you gotta keep your boys\nHe mentioned in their defensively again these are answered the questions we must be able to play man\nWhen you play a good offense the football team we have to die the ball to their receivers the only way we can do that as plain man and he kinda ... with that but what was implicit in while he was saying was we're not good enough to play man\nWe don't have enough good man players got some we don't have enough\nKind of had some people I was asked three or four times about this today by people I saw I did not hear the comment that I heard what his reaction to that was he was asked pressed by some about players leaving and all this and getting new players he hears essentially what he said and this makes a lot of sense to me 'cause he told me this privately\nHe said hey we only got for seniors that are playing much at all we got more than that on the team\nWe only got four they're playing as he mentioned all for 'em by the way all former defensive linemen and all four of the center are working their butts off doing things the right way and his comment was I'm going to bring twenty five new ones in next Uri referring of course to the twenty five scholarships\nAnd what he was trying to say was again I've heard him say this before personally\nGot four guys leaving that are playing ram and have twenty five new ones coming in and joining the other players that are here you've heard me talk about this before this thing's going to be significantly better next year simply because of the year on the program no one had a practice known how to play getting bigger stronger tougher and the addition of some players coming in\nWait wait we didn't show that yesterday we didn't look like we were very talented team in some areas were not very talented again I'm On a ... a lot of that up\nTo how good Alabama was getting into just a second how we need to kind of as we evaluate where this program is and where it's going we need to keep in perspective\nThat are exactly how this league is made up right now again I'll do that in a in a future segment but what he was saying on that was I got I'm going to go than twenty five new ones on bringing twenty five new is\nOnly half full we're leaving and I took\nThat as a very positive comment now one of the things on that is is he didn't have twenty five scholarships gave Ryan has got Twenty one so what does that tell you that tells you he's going to sign for what they called blue shirts off the twenty twenty year\nAnd it also tells you he didn't have anything he didn't have near that many under the eighty five scholarships there's got to be at least twenty five guys leaving this team this year so he can sign and bringing those twenty five now that can happen at any point during the season by\nThe way I'll take some phone calls have you have a question six one five seven three seven or ... or one oh four or five six one five seven three seven one oh four or five I Will take a if you have a question about some of this as we are going\nThrough it uh\nMe go a couple of more minutes here don't have the church group that I got to worry about that ah I'm going to go just a little bit lower second half start he was talking about what he was asked if he was asking the press conference what do you tell them in half time he said let's go out and when the second half\nAs when when the second half and then [laughter] my words not he is the Keystone Cops showed up if you don't know who those Keystone Cops are your ask your mother or your grandmother grandfather about\nStarted the second half was just atrocious ah we've\nGot the second half they kick off he mentioned this this press conference tied Chandler makes a mistake\nMakes a big mistake he met the fair catch I think\nHe'll he thought he was the end zone I think bottom line is we end up getting the football at the at the one yard line Ryan let's see if we can get get get those phone calls are coming in will take those ah\nMe just talk about that just it was a mistake he also said this the tide Chandler is doing everything he's asking do and he's great he's ... he's going to he is an outstanding football player going to be better so that when the problem but let me just kinda hit that real quick here's what I don't understand about teaching that route coaching that rule I don't know what the coach him to do back there but it looks to me like\nAnd this comes from someone who a\nReturn kickoffs in this league as a player\nEars in this league kickoff returns now the rules were different but here's what I don't understand and I don't know it just seems to be pretty simple make you're either going to return the ball or you're not going to return to the ball\nAll right well there's one your deep or at the five yard line\nAnd it seems to me that you would have whatever you want him to do before he goes after months they diabetic catch it tai bring it out\nDie or if it's in the end zone or let it go 'cause you don't even have to catch it in the end so and so I I I think that's a little coaching to be honest with you know this is an experienced young man\nWho is an experience the who's is getting a lot of playing time rightfully so he's still young he's a sophomore but but I Can't take that off of it that's what I don't understand about that you're either gonna return it or you're not going to return it kind of like a ... block either ... or you're not\nSo to me you say hey fair catch the ball is taking the twenty five or if it's you don't ... bring it out the ... one of the two I think they can get things straightened out ah All right that that kind of takes us through that\nPart of it a lot more to discuss I'll take a few phone calls Marlon I'll start with you and I come back if you have a question about this program where it is where this team is right now uh we'll discuss some of the game a little bit if you want to uh the reason I'm not going to discuss the whole up personally is because there's not a whole lot to discuss\n\nWe got by outstanding football team in my mind after watching everybody else for about seven weeks there's nobody gonna come close to a ... they may be able to the if they're going to be the Alabama the ... better be able to score a lot of points\nCouldn't your team

this ranks I Know it's a great rivalry here that is highly highly respected so many former players have coached in this game you know Jeremy ... is the second Alabama player the spin ahead coach at Tennessee in this game\nI don't think Tennessee or albums ever since he got to be their head coach but what it is a great ball game\nAnd and nobody I Know nobody that I Know that I Know personally

let's talk about some individuals no\nParticular order here John Jennings anybody that love this guy needs to find the other thing that I shouldn't go that far John Jennings is everything that the that that do you love and a player everything\nWe had several of guys that played like John Jennings when I was ... remember every one of ... of everyone and stuff fights forever yard\nA and I thought the uh uh Daniel since said it best I think it was him if you if you're in a street fight\nIn an alley fight you going what John Jennings on your side of that Jordan played well yesterday ran the bald good and hard basically we only play to a tie Chandler\nShowed what he can do is you have tremendous hands catches the ball welding runs with afterwards didn't get quite as many touches but I understand why that's not a not a big deal to me color Chris was mentioned a little bit earlier what impressed me most about Chris was his poised\nA man made made some good throws you know what he maybe he may be one of these ... guys\nWe'll see him some ah well we'll see what happens happens there and you know what there were probably some some are tied in or maybe an off in the lime and that that played pretty well it's hard to see I don't mean to leave them out here but it's hard to is it's hard to see that great defensively\nClearly a dandy but to lead being out because the targeting really a had a a bad effect on this deep and certainly not wedded to made any difference in the game\n... but a\nBig not was in there for him and then they played sap in there and they're not Danny but totally ... interesting to me as an official stats he led the defense in tackling the only played that the second half I thought that your warrior\nPlayed better is certainly on the run had a you know I had another opportunity to get an interception and didn't or you know what that's you'd love to see that you kinda cringe when it doesn't have these probably better you can\nI tell you I bailing Buchanan has become as as playing again as much out of his abilities any player I think on this day he is not tremendously talented he's a good athlete then I have great speed they were able to play in the nickel and of course after Taylor went out he moved out and played the some nickel they move around a corner they were moving some people around there\nLook good he's a good football player at that good and he he showed up good and\nIt's getting better and better and better and we continue ... rice Thompson playing well\nRice Thompson playing well you know that's the hope for the ... he was right there you would like as a defensive back coach ram to knock that first ... pass by but he was fighting he was there and it just a tremendous throw by a tremendous player and then the ... Jackson\nI don't know if he's you know sometimes in the games you're not watching a whole lot last\nMaybe quarter and a half\nHe really play that thought pretty darn well so those are just some guys that that that that that I saw there's plenty of ... there were probably others\nBut the guys that I saw a plane and I thought playing pretty well and then I got amazing ... to he took another ... hung in there ah hopefully he's fine then from what ... said afterwards it sounds like he is\nAs I mentioned the lifeguard position carbon hall and lock their all played all looked at it like they had about the same uh\nSame effect in there it's something's got to be down there I guess let's look at what we did game plan was we had twenty six run calls in twenty eight passes I now I Know there were ... remember I don't ... sex or passes or not runs a Jordan had fourteen carries Chandler had nine\nPasses fourteen ... six Chandler had three\nWe did a good job of getting touches of the guys that can make plays an entire bird what a catchy made on that touchdown pass their at kids ah that that that kids have been working his butt off to an excellent blocker so where is this the fence right at this defense in office right now let's let's let's let's just look at this on defense\nVersus this quarter back\nTo the end this offense Alabama's well they have so many things to stop that you really don't have any chance not really\nBam ahead forty one runs in thirty three passes and over a dozen of those were our PTOs run or past depending on what the defense says and when you have a quarterback\nMario too is like this in college we've seen others when you have a quarterback that runs that are appealed to run pass option where those places you can either handed off\nYou can either keep it running or you can pull it and throw it when that line backer or a safety or nickel comes up to support the run you can throw it in behind them\nIn this amount of pressure on the defense that is why the our PTOs the run past option and then again it all depends on what that secondary does the run past part of it\nWhen you have a team that can do that it it is a must that you're able to play man press man coverage to take those away and this ball secondary which is getting\nBetter does not play press man coverage very well so in ... ... is like for a better term we're damned if we do and we're damned if you don't need you know again I I I've called defenses against games like this I was doing his coordinator secondary\nCoach when Tommy hides and set the all time FCC passing record at LSU and Nineteen eighty nine a four hundred and some passing yours now the good thing was we somehow when that football and well we want to cause Carl picking returned to kick off but\nNews talk Ninety four point one am sixteen hundred [noise]\nDot com Oscar price of rivals and ... dot com presented by mortgage investors breaking news is giving expert in Mexico and preserve Austin will take your calls on college athletics around the SEC Anthony college football\nSurvive mortgage investors group and Tennessee is number one choice for\nDot com by Texas Roadhouse homo hearty hand cuts to expand\nFall off the bone ribs by marathon want to get a full tank of freedom\nBy your neighborhood marathon station marathon fueling the American spirit by blue ice cream now available in the stadium and\nTom shoveling arena by Tennessee lasik associates supporter of the Tennessee Volunteers\nSee the difference was Tennessee lasik can buy Coors Light what it comes to Rocky Mountain cold Coors Light Twenty one means Twenty one great beer comes great responsibility corps Brewing Company in Golden Colorado distributed across the volunteers state by Cherokee distributing the nation and it's also brought to you by\nFriday Duncan and sons moving and storage flat praying his team simplify everything by ... seven screens on for every Tennessee football game\nNational highway Smith fail ...

some of the winter which get run over follow\nNice and sunny course a sunny for most of the day yesterday even stadium rainy in the morning but rainy all day if you're a tendency fan is Alabama just comes in and that's certainly does the Tennessee what ... what they've done every by the season they score fifty eight points the most Tennessee has ever given up a new stadium\nBut Alabama has scored\nFifty on just about everybody in that and I tell you what\nThat is the first time I had a chance to watch them\nPlay a lot of this year and I watch the practice several times this year and before you blink your ah they're so explosives in their second best receiver to the point of on the Smith employees say to make the trip with a hamstring injury\nBut the gap pulled the trigger a suicide by law is a as good as I've seen that the collegiate level with the weight and throws the football field the pocket\nHis touch the way to put in tight windows is in steaks and to be six foot eight six one worry as I stood who I was talking about the game I'm five eleven he's about\nMaybe two inches taller than me all the Harry girl they're little and I thought you know the ballot ... will give him the benefit of the year and it doesn't matter what color the way he\nSees the field to be that high is unbelievable he can see everything he can make every throw the first touchdown to see it pretty good coverage yeah what\nAnd he dropped that ball exactly where are you to\nEl Grillo the off into one problem in that way but I mean that was that protects you want to protect send it to be able to throw that route you got to be able to protect the yeah\nThat's the first thing they did but boy they\nHe is good and they are so good around him I spent some time ago saying that the game\nAnd he could use that to say because you know we we've had Julio Jones and we've had a more a coup ... read like we've never had this many guys can make place at the receiver position and Josh shake ups that are running backs football players\nHe's right I mean when you look at it Chris\nAlabama ed wide receiver for his always maybe had one guy and then a couple of just kind of\nYou know complement guys they got like three ... number one\nNow that you know if anybody went down you know you miss Smith yesterday's and miss it\nYeah and uh I mean again before you could blink it was Twenty one to nothing and then it was twenty eight nothing is the first quarter and it was over I mean you know the Arab world out of the stadium and really Alabama\nCould scored six to seven to one then they can do that against a lot of people and and again that's not\nThat's just the bottom line or Alabama is right now and it's funny because\n... how how scary is that\nWhen when I talked to our talking in Alabama but you know how scary is that\nIt's just not on this is not one of his top three or four defenses I mean like you know what I'm saying I mean like can you imagine that they had a legit juggernaut the defense\n... and he he told me again last night he said listen you can sort of see it when he said that because it looks and he he likes to win Twenty one to ten\nYou know twenty ... twenty four to Thirteen he's a defensive guy but he likes to win that sets your body thing and I think it's a little weird for him to be winning like this to have this kind of ... it'd be so explosive\nBut he said it's a different kind of team but here's the thing I think it's good for Alabama is if they get into a shootout which ... they're going to place the better team he said he's a list we got the best things were going to tell us you will clearly be the best team and the toughest essay was safe to go to tiger state to no doubt and whoever they get the playoff Clemson [noise]\nBut they are equipped to win\nA forty eight forty one game a fifty one to forty one game if they have too much more so than they've ever been and clearly tendencies not they've they've got\nToo much credit Clemson yesterday and you know in the states pushed in the last couple of years not yet heard it all week long about how this is\nThe trap game for them and then the state could potentially bully upset no\nOne to cause anyway Tennessee uh loses the ... time the most that anybody has ever beat in Tennessee in consecutive times twelve strike I think the ... done what eleven\nBeen a long time how old were you last time tendency beat Alabama in the\nSix hours a twenty three just out of college young\nKids probably had very little facial hair ...\nAnd I still don't have very little facial hair\nWell it's a um ... and you know what it's it was really cool for me I was at the game yesterday I had a chance I was on campus surely walk around and and we're down to count who'd walked around and talk a lot of Alabama Tennessee fans\nThe third Saturday October is it it is a special special scene and environment but it just hasn't been much of a robbery lately on the football field and I think it's tendencies responsibility to make it a robbery and this has been a series\nIt's been very cyclical you go back all the way back to the seventies your tendency would Phillip Pullman was there pretty much all the Alabama\nOkay when Barry ... was there and to a coach majors and beat him in eighty two or whatever it was the tendency rose off for all this has been a cyclical series but now it really feels like to me that it's just there there are there's an entire really always generation my son Adam pricing Tennessee\nI mean he went to the game yesterday and and he just he doesn't get what\nWhat other what was the last ... what do you remember anything that happened in your life before you were fine and that's just what I'd do it like\nThat but my point so it's you know Tennessee God's work to do list the tendency is not the only thing that I met him has beaten up on I'll look this up since two thousand Fifteen I think a key there since the start of two thousand Fifteen there's thirty two\nAgainst all SEC opponent thirty two and they won those games those thirty wins rub on average margin of about twenty six points a game so they have separated themselves from\nOf the league and it's up to everybody else to catch it I mean let's face it outside of LSU an Auburn\nOnce in the last Fifteen Years there's not many people you know South Carolina gotten to one time with with a with a counter Shaw though that was Steven Garcia said yeah yeah that's the last time it used to be yeah and so like you know it is it's just so few and far between I mean it's really kind of I mean and that was used not been closed last few years\nYou know so I mean there there are a whole different stratosphere and that's what that's worth Jeremy wants to get to that right now Germany just trying to you know he knows like yesterday was was an impossible task he still doesn't like it let's face it I mean you know he made the comments to\nCivil network at half time they made the comments to CBS at half time he doubled down after the game you double down on his coach to show that you know if he's got us you know a group of kids that do it the right way\nThose kids go get behind him and then he will bring in twenty five more they're going to keep doing the right way and the rest of the the L says you know can be on the outside looking in but the point is is like you know go back to the Georgia game they lose but they battle okay after the game hugs and kisses down on the field ... ... you know you know\nVery talkative with former players you know he always he recruited a lot of kids that ended up at Auburn even though they you know he wasn't that all\nYou know he had to hit battles\nAfter the game they when he's you know what I'm saying

South Carolina Alice Johnston Alice former defensive coordinator in the SEC the number of different stops including South Carolina all run Alabama Alice we appreciate your daughters my friend how are you tonight\n[noise] like they all along and have a say in you know when you're coming around on the circuit and as the safe side in a really has to say oh well it's\nGreat to be with and I know you've seen the south Carolina team up close you worked on that staff\nUnderwear for a while or coach Spurrier\nWhat are your thoughts know coming off a by week I'm lost a couple of weeks ago and then this is it a figure saying gutsy when at home and gets Missouri before that where do you think this game type team is now as they head into the the whole half of their seats in Providence I like\nA little bit of a roller coaster it's you know they've had some up and down I think they've done for men this job was player development and endgame controlled and some of the other issues to to get out and wins I mean they beat Missouri without the starting quarterback rice and though that's a very dangerous thing that terrible weather to dress and\nSo they've had some time for the British show a lot of\nGrit and prove it and so forth but if I make some expectations beginning of the year ... little little out of ... fan base so the biggest thing that happened ... receivers have played well they've been very spotty they dropped a lot of big fast is\nA debo is not as a seasoned everybody predicted you know he was talking about is the highest candidate\nAnd he's not had much much of a ... year in return game which was last year all the receipt and he's he's got some big ball form and critics um or the other thing that's hard on the defensive tackle they don't have any ... and they don't have real good death\nThan safety physicians has out in the middle of the day and when they get\nThey get tired of they play against some of the better things in his leg to have that\nIs really tough for them to finish out a sixty minute game they ... they they just haven't gotten to take away so that's something that really put a lot of the song they did a great job of it last year\nBut they they are way behind in that department and its foot ... plays on the board formal they sent packing plays off the boat on office and just something that's got to improve their just not good enough talent lies to dominate in that conference they're going to have to just take away red zone and third down us know how to where they're going to stop\nIt [noise] to LSU seen this league from all different sides you know I just said you you've been to a college kid you know it's easier to count the schools you hadn't ... coach that and the SEC ... woods your hand you know you've seen it and you see the ball and you see the chains you see what makes done as he's coming into the SCC and just really short run away from every body\nWhat kind of challenge and I know you know did you hear me very well\nWhat kind of challenge you think Jeremy has here a tendency to get Tennessee back\nTo where they're competing for at least ... east championship on a regular basis [noise]\nWell the the biggest challenge he's got to get that Ross to build back that far I think it's obviously anyone who watches football that don't have a real good roster right now in a good tip jar\nI've seen some players on dates and it's tackle technique wise is Parker contagious and they get run over or they get ... broken in this league and that's just simply got to be skill set and talent level\nJeremy ... will get it done you're going to happen to have some patients\nAnd what's so hard is going to see that has a tremendous position and reputation than don't have\nThey're not used to being in this hot situation than it is it's it's hard biting them I mean [noise]\nIs not a school's just moved into the composition of the schools used to dominate\n... [noise] it was hard right now for them to accept the fact that they're that far behind but I think they are I think he's he's a heck of a football coach your great recruiter a he's got a\nGood staff and I think Jeremy ... will get it done but they're going to have a black hole we'll be quick change these folks coaches every three or four years bunch never going to get the\nHell are you surprised at the talent level and this is the you know just a difference in ... between everybody else in Tennessee [noise]\nOr some other things that are about this wide but you know what happens also a one year when I came back to Alabama know probation [noise] we had Alabama attitude but we didn't have Alabama skill sets that year\nWe couldn't convince our players play with the blue collar out of the you know they they were trying to play like there was a big boys on the block and frankly we followed the middle of the top that's what happened sometimes it's hard to get a bunch of guys who have been recruiting\nAnd to play with a chip on their shoulder and imply as an underdog is you know and that kind of a road so it's a little bit difficult sometimes demoted vitamin respect\nTells you talked about the fans need to be patient you think it's hard for Jimmy proved to be patient this because I mean he's won everywhere he began and all of a sudden it it I wait until you know you've been in the lay all your life and all of a sudden they their hand and you're just a regular hamburgers not quite the same\n[laughter] that's what I Would write point probably probably patience is not the right word I I was well I'm trying to say it's dry and then they're gonna have to have some fixed and for a while because you're not going to come ...\nAnd I think that's true for Jeremy group of coaches team and and the end up paying base and I don't I'm not trying to survive they have been since they fold besides just that they've had too much for dish and it's fast to be patient but they should be permitted\nAnd and the tougher look the more that needs to step up back problems and that was back to the pros and cons really be there you go out because again they keep changing coaches but it's you know it's like putting a new driver and a car you know just got so we'll just not going to let you need that\nBalances Chris again um [noise]\nYou don't want to preface this question by saying that [noise]\nWe we both the two of us combined seen a lot of college football we've seen a lot of great players and I knew the Alabama has not faced a great defense to okay that say I get\nWhat you see now to talk about ... the way he spread to football around the field\nThe plane makers he has around here that receiver their second best receiver developing Smith even play yesterday [noise]\nWhere do they rank where do they compare with similar the explosive opposites as you've seen this when\nI think there is good I Know it I Do know that ... have applied ... news conference yet\nAnd uh like I hadn't been tested that much but frankly part of that it was and then playing but basketball as much power and I did a few looks up little things Chris mentioned earlier before the show you want to talk about um 'cause I haven't been able to follow real close with\nIt probably what Alice ... there probably were a little bit the expectation robot too high because of the way they finished last year\nThere's still a solemn football teams really play a game that was a good solid again they played Wellington heated of course they beat Missouri Tennessee is going to have to play well but I Do think this is a game [noise] pretend to see on the road that\nIn a lot of ways can be a springboard you're an aid for them the rest of the that's\nThe word I've been using a springboard and and you know I think that it can if you can you win this game\nObviously like I said earlier you're going to be Charlotte\nYou're sitting there ... three games left I think I'm a momentum from that carries you do at least one the bulldozer building and uh and who knows outside of that I mean you've got that to gain homes than I don't know Charlotte's it makes it pretty and what I'm saying but Shawn Kemp Charlotte [noise] to get home standing conference win Missouri\nAnd Kentucky and um you know obviously Missouri I ... no matter who I've talked to I've I talk to you know\nCoach Texas a and M.\nYou know Kentucky [noise] all these guys are saying the same thing I coach a tendency told me that Missouri\nIs one of the best teams will face and outside of Alabama is probably the toughest thing will face the rest\nOf the ... well when I talk with David last night after the game he said he felt like Missouri was best humid places you across the board you said there are a lot more physical they're given credit for\nWalks playing you know he's he's a tough quarterback to deal with\nUh the last three conference games Alabama Georgia and and the Georgia game and then of course that that arcane game over there and ... he said he's you know and then and then now\nThat doesn't say a lot for Alabama schedule is going because they have clearly they haven't really thought schedule but just the ... the place that but but they told me last night he felt like Missouri was as good if not the best football team so he played at this point that that that take talk that will be a tough out for tendency\nPart time for our marathon question of the week discover how a full tank of freedom from marathon will take you where ever you want to go marathon fueling the American spirit\nObviously you're getting into was\nKnocked out of yesterday's game was a vicious here there and the\nSecond quarter killer Chris came in performed admirably a no win over a hundred yards and about half a quarter there I'm In the in the second quarter\nLook pretty good look better than any point this season if if you're healthy fully healthy I think he's the storm\nBut if he's not\nDo you play both\nThese ... these not fully healthy already maybe looking killer and maybe have ... is the guy reserved just because you want to get him help as well I don't want to I don't want to copy\nExactly what you just said but I watch a junior at very closely and practices and I think you probably\nMaybe you don't want to say you completely flip the reps but you give\nYou get ... and I want to see how healthy and how confident Jared is throwing the football because when you take a shot like that [noise]\nIf you're open ribs I mean that's ... that's tough so you're not ... you're going to have to play through some pain obviously but if you don't think he can protect themselves\nAnd the same zip then I think you'd probably get ... now [noise]\nThey go out there and and a jerk so wonderful fall and playing with confidence and he looks like he has that then I don't take them out of the game I have to put the football back with his hands but maybe you have a little bit\nShorter leash if things don't go way thanks [noise]\nSome ways I I I'm with you I I I totally think that if you know if he's fully held the he's your guy if he's not fully healthy I think you play 'em both\nAnd and and and kind of see we're you know see where they're at\nLooking Jared side see how he is he wanted to go back in yesterday and they're like no this was when I checked out and and and kill her like I said for full time really well I mean\nYou know he has limitations but what they asked him to yesterday was ... he would give them a little spark he got the ball out of his hands or you know which is something that Thomas's ... struggles with you know Jay Z hold onto a fraction too long at times because he has a little bigger arm and he can make up for it right killer camp you know and so he gets his hands quick\nAnd some of the throws he made yesterday were the metros he's made since he's been\nYeah well and and again I think that's why you you you see how he plays and how he looks in\nThe ... plays with in practice is what you can if he looks like he has I'm Talking about ... if you'd go with you\nI I think it goes a long way just to you know it'd be good to go and can play I think it goes along with Viking Abernathy is able to play right same thing with Dominic what Anderson you know you you miss some players against Alabama but you know we weren't going to change the outcome of the game but\nYou need them back for this run that you're talking about the stretch run because again I think this game is huge you know a month ago when everybody said well tendencies gotta be Florida to make a bowl game tendencies gotta make four to be voted to make a bowl game\nI just kept saying I don't think so I think you can ... you could lose the Florida and still be South Carolina and of course everybody's justification was well by the time you get through this gauntlet you're going to be so beat up there's no way you'd be South Carolina [noise]\nI just I never bought in the south Carolina being some juggernaut I mean there are a good team\nGets in the city does not play well South Carolina will beat the Tennessee plays well doesn't turn the football over and avoid those catastrophic early play by getting down early and then they can be right there and they can they can win at Columbia and if you don't think that the confidence that this group will take\nYou know having not wanna league game and almost two years to win two and two out of three well the only last me in Alabama and those two being on the road that was to me that would carry him into November big town\nAnd I can promise you I I Know that what you don't have used his fame they realize\nHow important is this for them to for\n... yeah they lose another one and that was that

invite you to do that as well we have another full uh two hours of discussion for you this evening is less than discuss discuss I Want to talk about Saudi Arabia a little bit later in the broadcast but something else that's going on\nRight now there are still even though some are who are on the uh the the bridge leading into Mexico all of them have gone home\nOr this afternoon on ABC that was a report that literally thousands of them continue to head towards the Mexican border or carrying the flag of their country which they have so much they're leaving\nA but they're carrying and their flag heading to the Mexican border\nAnd he's you know over the last uh forty I'm actually forty eight to Seventy two hours or the situation there when they arrive on the Mexican border they stormed a Mexican troops have been there to to try to stop them they use some tear gas to sort of disturbs dispersed or the group\nAnd the rest of the United states obviously has said that he wants to stop them in some way and he is threatened or to put US military not reservists US military on the border to keep them from coming into the United states ruin up there and let me introduce you you're a libertarian\nSyria or actually a historically a libertarian Republican yet but historically a uh your\nUh your your pro immigration generally I mean you and eat it illegal immigration you're\nYou're semi tough to and you're not as tough as some of your Republican colleagues but my question to you is\nGiven the visuals that we have now huh including the way that Mexico has reacted after the president asked them to react and now you have the president saying that there may be military troops on our border\nIs that a perfect picture\nFor people to see\nAs people go to the polls in a couple of weeks says that helped the Republicans\nI Can't see a scenario where it doesn't help the Republicans I'm I think it's pretty obvious that Trump has moved\nThe opinion on immigration slightly in his favor yes he's made mistakes with the uh separating children at the border and and some of those other things which he was forced to reverse policy on very quickly and the fact of the matter is that eat when when whenever Trump or his like David Frum\nAnd other Democrats are you know the the few centrist that are still left vocally\nOr saying stuff like well we do have to do something about illegal you know people coming here legally and we have to maybe ... recalibrate what we're doing an immigration I think you can make the case that Trump has moved the needle in his direction so when these people are massing at the border doing something you legally\nAnd that's the video involving the children\nWhich is also maybe a piece of video that will be available to the American people again between now and election day there may be others that are in Mexico that still want to come to the United states and they're not going to be turned away by the Mexican government or like\nDo like the Mexican president is turning away of the folks from under us in Guatemala well\nThe the whole child separation issue is actually like a precursor of this\nUm I remember reading the polls on it and and and the you know the president's policy and that was very very unpopular and he had to I mean I think he was forced to switch a positions on it but during that whole thing two things came out number one that there was child separation going on under Bush and Obama\nAre then I think Trump like brought the issue to the fore maybe on purpose even and then in the aftermath\nThe people who got the blame for the for the children being separated according to you know and I think it was like fifty two forty eight or it was a plurality but the people who get took who got the blame for that we're not was not Trump and the Republicans but the parents who brought the kids here legally\nI'm saying don't you know don't use your kids as political pawns that was part of it so I think what's going on here is yeah it's going to bring out the red meat of both parties and I think the red you know the the the the it's red meat for both extremes maybe\nBut I I still think overall given the direction the tide is flowing that it's going to benefit the GOP more than it is the Democrats on election day\nRight and what's your uh you want her to make a comment about the border from where you had the topic of the border and the president a\nAlluding to are putting out to the the thought of putting federalized troops are federal here on the border\nAnd I'm having spent three years of my life on the east west German border patrol in there and leading troops are pretty daunting task and it's not just something where you can snap your fingers and have\nThat be a professionally run without error situation for the military\nAnd there's a great deal of challenge because of all the private property that runs along the border on our side and then also even with the advent of GPS and in the wonders in a communications bad things happen to good people and an American patrol accidentally crosses into Mexico\nThere are a possible and plausible so I'm\nAn account of how the how\nPopular or unpopular do you think that move would be with the troops that they are ... that they are stationed on us property keeping people from sneaking are coming into the\nCountry illegally you know the the beauty of the American soldiers if they're given a lawful order they're going to follow it and they're going to do it to the best of their ability even if it's something that they dislike\nUm the problem with this when I patrol these west German border our job was to stop he used to the East Germans Soviet and check forces from coming across in harming west German and NATO in American people\nUh East Germans who were fleeing East Germany once they touched west Germans soil legally they were considered west German and we didn't\nAnd we had a a Soviet lieutenant defect indoor soccer one night\nWe were that close to getting in but uh the ... picked him up and said he was protected as soon as he crossed the border has a different scenario than what we have here so the the legal protections that are there for someone who crosses the border are the rules of engagement are going to have to be very stringent in very detailed troops\nDoes anybody see on the horizon or after the midterms that there's going to be a legislative a response or a some sort of a piece of legislation\nBut it's going to get enough support that it's going to go to the president is going to sign it on on the broader issue of immigration reform we've heard about it for for twelve years now we've\nBeen you're exactly right and those twelve years cover Brock Obama and George W. Bush and George W. Bush had what I thought were some pretty good ideas on the topic a path to citizenship and whatnot\nI don't think we're going to have anything meaningful proposed because it's a it's a ... issue for uh the the Trump campaign and the the right wing Republican Party and it is a rallying cry for the extremely progressive Democrats who see this as as a hill were dying on\nBut when when the president said that he was going to go he ... he was a lot for now we're going to separate out the immigration issue illegal immigration issue\nFrom the uh the dreamers issue because on the dreamers issue the White House was apparently ready to go or you know I'm actually going to make eight million people are not ... million in too many people the hundred thousand uh he was going to support as for a path to citizenship\nAnd then the Democrats backed away from that deal and the words the Democrats at that moment they seemed to will want they want to the issue\nMore than a resolution of the issue because right now they believe that you know all the Hispanics in or in America are going to be voting democratic\nAnd we're not we're going to find out later I whether that's true but\nAs you do you ... your your your progressive do you think that that was the case that the Democrats didn't want a resolution of the issue no of course they want a resolution on\nThe issue of but when you're talking about hordes than and caravans and and you're showing these pictures of of of humanity flooding into the United states of America\nI don't think the issue is even being couch tried to begin with I'm as I said earlier it has red meat um it's going to be used in order to appeal to a certain constituency that frankly doesn't\nThese migrants in the United states of America um and as an immigrant myself I'm all too familiar with that sentiment\nI Do and you do do you think those are only Republicans\nNo no it it it it might mean frankly you could have union members that are that are anti immigration rights but I think that by saying that I think you're suggesting that the unions what they want to protect that what they have to say okay so let me clarify little go you know it\nRegardless of ideologies I root here you're the host\nNativist issue right um you can be a nativist and be Democrat Republican independent fascist socialist whatever\nSo what I think is interesting about that that little exchanges\nThat um I I think yeah I don't remember\nThe exact fact pattern but I Do remember the Trump he he opted from eight hundred thousand to one point six million people yes\nAnd then he off and he said here's what I Want an exchange number one the minute they commit a crime they are deported number two I Want that I Want to change to family chain migration over to what's best what what best serves American in ... one of the wall\nAny one of the wall and you know so and I was I mean I was reading the headlines at the time and I thought you know he would really\nI I think I think there probably was discussion in the Democratic caucus was like do we go for this\nAnd I think the ... and I I'm not\nTrying to cast aspersions on the the Democrats here I think it might have been a reasonable calculated cynical position to say no no no it's before the midterms we can't give Trump ... I I think I think what we've identified here through this discourse\nIs the oldest trick in the book throw something else in there to get what you want when you're trying to make ... make a deal and the Democrats weren't comfortable with a lot of those things I mean you know this is this was not the first so we we had a governor in the state of Illinois who said well that income tax would be lower but when he got elected all make it higher if you give me these these are union crushing\nOf laws and and changes and when that wasn't coming he left the income tax go down in these states deficit almost quadrupled\nSo this is nothing new this has happened it was all the time\nAnd look I mean Tom is on one side of the Democratic race for governor obviously go in and and time characterize me as as progressive I Am progress that but I but I Do have you know their sensibilities deep down\nI'm now if I was going to pigeon hole myself I'll find out they um progressive and I will say this that under President rock Obama um we had more staying in rational approach to immigration now it wasn't perfect it was terrible but it was basically deporting people in a limited way on the basis and only on the basis of fraud\nOr some sort of drug trafficking or human trafficking what she was known as the reporter in chief he was absolutely\nOkay if you follow the law and while he followed the law or\nDo you want the law to be followed do progressive let's ask our progressive or semi progressive than I Do want because that's where I come down\nWe have we have laws laws are are are are are passed by the Congress signed by the president if you want to change the law changed the law if you pass a law I Want a law enforced\nAnd you have people that are not being their nose or at at at the laws we have Bruce\nAnd we try and trying to get a break them I Wish that was a conversation and I'm Sorry to interrupt you have something to say no but but here's the thing I ... you know I Wish the conversation was about that and not about caravans and hordes and these migrants\nComing over to our borders as if they're like this that thing there are so white who's ...\nThan the losers who's who's behind and I don't know but I don't understand someone is someone is writing someone is organizing a group of\nPeople to join into a caravan to storm the U.\nS. borders now come on come on I also any hanging some people may not find that\nIt doesn't matter does it look spontaneous you professor\nKind of given a chance to come to this country all day long [noise]\n... that's ... that's his view [noise]\nThe the cameraman who used to patrol east west German border and I'm going to circle back and say the the proposition of putting federal troops armed federal troops on our southern border to stop illegal immigration is one that is fraught with a lot of risk because well trained well disciplined will lead troops\nWho are under arms are carrying weapons with the munitions\nAnd they're told and I think your phrase was you know uh that they need to be stopped in and dealt with according to the law troops are not law enforcement officers a border control ice and local state and a regional law enforcement our law enforcement officers\nOr the federal troops are better if Mexico decided to make an armed foray into Texas up to stop that but it\nRyan I mean the average person listening to to that comment would say okay we have a military we ... we spent hundreds of millions of dollars a year for a military ... we have something that is viewed by some Americans some Americans as an invasion of our of our of our sovereign land\nYou have you have troops you have troops with guns okay they're not law enforcement agencies it seems to me that you could give an order to a military person and say OK any person you see you\nDetain him not shoot him and they had\nDetain them which could have been at but I'm In a detention center where the process takes place because there's there's there's thousands of miles or write some that\nAre articulate out the rules of engagement and the standards of conduct that go along with it and the legal protections for those soldiers because if\nForgive me calling me at the door and let me let me finish the ... comes at me at the border and it's ... I don't know if he's Hispanic I don't know where he's coming from okay up against the wall give me your hands handcuffs and I've just detained illegal us resident or a U.S\nBut with a difficulty all it it it would seem to me that that that that that would that should be a responsibility of the u._s.

M. A. Y. go ahead\nHyper oh yeah I\nI just wanted to say that okay so I don't mind the border and they're carrying flags and make a lot of Americans angry because you're getting her second our laws for one day so I think what they sit there and when they get to the border\nIraq and all and I am that the country where they came from it was David a lot of money and if you're going to protect the kind of learn without doing it legally and you don't want to be American and the first place out I think Americans are just sick of that because we're in a way to pay for all that\nTime share I think the optics of troops to stopping people at the border\nCan benefit or only benefit the conservatives and those who do not favor expanded immigration or I'm a reasonable path to citizenship for those who are already here it'll only help the hawks who won't help that does is it's a bad scene and I'm not a I'm not accusing the president of trying to force that optics\nThose optics rather and benefit politically from it\nI'm I'm I'm simply saying you might disagree because we have two Democrats waited all I'm saying is\nThat that's a bad picture and be the negativity we'll be cast on those who such as myself for such as ... who defend immigration it might even be cast on a gentleman who was taking a somewhat moderate but the you know reasonable uh\nA progressive of some sort of don't call anything I say progress okay well that's progress okay on the Thames gotta follow Kim\nMy my thing is when we come to the port of entry and then there you know here at the border threatened to depart answering as they cross the bridge and tree rats fan and put them on a plane right there and take them back no processing\nWe we have on hand so can you say no processing taken from the border put them right on a on a trans Harris lane and send them back\nTo the camera got 'em right we've got a break for a spot I Want to find out your reaction to it one eight hundred seven to three eighty went in and that's the phone number here cause we got lots coming in and we'll hear from them when we're all on from Chicago\nAre you headed the Los Angeles looking for the ideal place for you and your family to relax and enjoy yourselves plays that combines a board diamonds hotel experience with the convenient location hits the hill to Los Angeles universal city just steps away from universal studios\nHollywood anyone at NBC Studios just a short ride to the Hollywood walk of fame PC oh Chinese theater Warner Brothers and other popular retraction\nEnjoys spacious rooms offering them taking views in a world class Las Vegas style seafood and prime rib say every weekend of holidays [noise] share family fun and enjoy the away some of the palm trees\nPrivate side with a cocktail or stack of ... to to reservation today at Hilton universal job more call one eight hundred seven seven for Fifteen hundred\nHill to Los Angeles universal city\nHe'll do universal dot com they let you be a star in Hollywood\nAs do mercury drops your mind to cool needles right now at Cumberland\nTake off on your road do adventure in a twenty Eighteen ... scores zero down and just to Eighteen among the all new redesign hatchback was the highest ranks small jar\nAnd initial quality by J.
