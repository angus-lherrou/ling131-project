play on the show what was your suggestion I said anyone anytime someone mentions transparency we door shot okay that's the word out and said you know everyone wants to be hurting\nEveryone in the early ... abilities ability civility then we can all\nCivility civility is is what we strive for half but again or even in a civil discussion you have to have someone that's listening as well as just talking some of that is usually the the challenge by the way the other a huge story last week which dominated news for several days\nOr was the uh the bombs or the alleged bombs that were sent\nAnd uh they came in and very almost identical packages\nAnd are they look or you know very much like this if you're watching us on television\nThey all sort of look the same they all ended up coming from a from a Florida South Florida and then uh when the FBI finally made an arrest or with the assistance of a local authorities or this was the van that was used by uh the bomber\nWho sent these a package bombs all over the United states and again it had a Donald Trump or supportive a a a bumper stickers all over it and then the FBI as they moved it\nTarp over to keep it hidden from a a for most of the uh we'd love to take more pictures of it and uh the Democrats loved taking the pictures that were available on the Internet and spreading them all around and say oh we knew that it was a a right wing\nBut my question do you uh when I asked him a shirt with you Jennifer before a rich guy the mad bomber was arrested with his background mhm who apparently like Donald Trump\nBefore that happened on ... on the Internet there was a lot of speculation as to what was really behind it\nAnd tell us what you\nWrote and fought during that period of time\nMy position and before we knew anything about this guy was that this was a false flag and that's something we're not right um\nBelieve it or not um I still hold that position um and let me explain why um since becoming aware of WikiLeaks the FBI investigation and everything with Hillary Clinton James Comey is on and so forth I become a huge believer and conspiracy theories so\nWhen I look at this particular situation um he's a crazy man he's been crazy in the early Nineteen nineties making terroristic threat before Donald Trump arrived on the scene politically so we have to put that you know he's you know have put that into context\nBut it does not make sense to me given when this happened um we had Donald Trump I'm kind of making hay and get some traction most dependence thought with his the left as the mob left is akin to a mob then what happens is\nThese are fake bombs or a bomb that did not go off start coming to all these the particular individuals the timing\nAnd as the van being almost a caricature when I saw this van is could this be any more obvious it's like arrest me here I Am over here none of that man's unemployed but yet he has a new van he has a the FBI said the parts that he had the bomb made the bombs that they're not a cheap it's expensive to do\nWhat is the story behind us so my point of view on this is that\nYes he registered as a Republican and twenty sixteen in the primaries along with a lot of other people yes he was at a Trump rally I don't know quite what to make of that right now we don't know a hot a whole lot more other than what we've already been told he did not act alone the FBI is already said they know there were other people behind it\nThere frequently is a there's a cover story there's a Patsy at Pepsi has all kinds of ... background\nThat's what happens in coverage stories\nSo what you're saying is do you think this guy needs to have the practice got big investigation by by journalists and the media and the FBI and CIA to find out whether this guy is real\nOr is he a fake I don't know if I'd trust the media to get to the bottom of it but he certainly needs a thorough examination by the Justice Department and what other agencies and ATF\nUm what other agencies that you would use and if he was an accomplice which I think at a minimum he's accomplished I'm too that he needs to be punished I'm as he should have been punished\nBack in the nineties when he also committed felonies and got remarkably light sentences for so yes I Do think if he's involved which it looks like he has to some degree or another he certainly should take punishment\nI Love how you loaded it up like a Raymond Chandler novel up you know I see this either I don't agree with Jennifer on this with regard to the investigation but I thought it was interesting that this came just\nThis wasn't that long ago that Hillary Hillary Clinton made that comment about how civility cannot return\nUntil Democrats take over the house or at least get back in power\nAnd I remember the idea that we can't have stability until a certain team ended up from a libertarian prospective until team eight or team be until the cubs or the White Sox whatever that we cannot have stability that that's not going to be allowed and that therefore it gives a justification to\nNot seeing the bombs are just a ... or any kind of thing where there's going to be a problem going on\nMichael what did you think of of Hillary's comments are when when basically should uh we can't have civility until the Democrats to control the\nHouse so I have a quick merit through toward Hillary I Wish he would just go away third and and and I buy his mother however\nComments by Hillary Clinton or comments by\nSenator or a member of Congress to not have the same way as common spar the president I Would say is\nThe fact of the matter is the person that I was on a totally different level but everyone else one of the states leads his campaign rallies and shouts of lock her up or prisoner congressman for body slammed me reporter\nIt's extremely on presidential destructive to our political process and it shouldn't be happening\nI agree that those comment by the lock her up you know what I'm Hillary as a criminal and she does that there'll be locked up I don't I I Will always stand by that time not going to say you shouldn't have said that and the crowds have been many Trump rallies yes we chatter that I'm proud of it I Do it again it to her face so no I'm not going to retract that ... reporter said that\nThere have been many times Trump had said something and I said to myself did he really need to go down that road because anytime he does something that damage is that the gender in any way shape or form it bothers me but to say that those comments that he made in some cases a couple of years ago comparing yep he's depressed\nPeters there have been leaders said the most horrible things about Trump including that ah somebody out of that the head of the Democrat Party Minnesota saying that the Democrat the head of the GOP she'll be the Eighteen I mean we have had\nIncendiary rhetoric getting so tired of hearing about this lock her up and this body slammed thing those were two comments that were whatever you want to say about them to me it's not\nCompare to fix the president I got a totally different level than everyone else in the country\nAnd they asked me ask you this question if if you will acknowledge him by the way if you will acknowledge that the president of the United states through his words\nCan say some things that rile up some of his more extreme supporters and they go out and do something illegal stupid or potentially harmful\nA lot more harmful than just you know sending a you know uh you know packages that don't explode I mean someone really harmful liked like shooting eleven people in a synagogue that so there's a there's a big difference between the stories that we were telling them talking about last week\nWhen you also acknowledge that words\nComing from a TV commentator\nOr from a reporter\nThat at least in the mind of the receiver is perceived as constantly being against the president against their particular politics\nKen ... a person up against that reporter or against that TV networks that they sitting there they they say you know what I'm instead of just throwing a shoe at the television set I'm riled up\nThat they aren't there as riled up as something that Jake Tapper might have said\nOr says for any one of the commentators on that stage show or on Fox we go either way they get so riled up at the commentators on TV they could do something harmful to them because of the words uttered\n... dollars if that's a possibility sure if the president if the president can can move people to act\nBecause of their words right would you agree with that or would you agree with that or even a different categories though of course there was ... ... ... a level of your stories of building her\nThe receiver of that message is receiving the message and that is those words are his or her trigger\nTo do something better and the and and and in many cases\nIt it it's a horrible thing to do and ... and by the way that could happen left or it could happen right it could be the same thing you know the the the shooter of of ... and the Republicans that was a supporter of a Bernie Sanders Bernie Sanders he's not responsible for that\nBut he probably heard Bernie Sanders say some bad things about Republicans whether to Hillary Clinton says we can't even have civility\nWell you know now that now see again I I think that that's an exploitive ah I'm taking her ... her comments out of context in a in a very ten benches way because when she was trying to do and she was she was trying to do was\nTo mobilize her political base absolute trying to do it over time it out on the metro strategy yeah the Trump is a president of United States we as an entire country ... does she have a strategy to may have but that's beside the point that's a ...\nThe that's the political you know we hit his strategy is to be the president of the United states that's his daughter she appropriate\nI think that's you know I don't find a strategy of ... I get\nSo position tired of hearing about people saying Well Donald Trump like Donald Trump as a father figure in all these liberal and all these other people are gonna are waiting to take their accusing the president like teach them how to behave were all adults here OK\nUnless you want to celebrate the that's listening to me after the matter is I really bothers me when I hear people say that your leader Donald Trump is saying that the other end when very high level leaders okay your leaders you don't have a president but your leaders are saying the Democrat Party haven't had a word\nCorrect me if I'm wrong a strong comic condemnation of anti thought cause over three hundred thousand dollars worth of damage you can you live in Washington Oregon nobody kicked out of the wheelchair thoughts on television where's the condemnation so I'm just tired of the dust and genuine it from people saying that you\nKnow Donald Trump Joni watching language will move your comment made large\nPeople look at the ... violence happening now when they are not European down let that happen again we're going to stop it for that and we have to stop this rise of fascism that we see happen what so\nWhat about what about what about a little bit of it this is on the civility level ... this is on the level of of a a weather prominent Democrats that properly spoken out and chastised a Maxine Waters for her coverage\nWhich one's the ... the comments that said that she was telling everybody to get in the face of members of Congress about anybody based hurt a lot of these are groomed him that\nRemember her people condemn it who I've heard of ... just\nI Would just say more than I don't know who has weakened she's still she doesn't have a rally last week when Congress person well I mean there are a lot of people who do radical thing\nEric Holder saying that we're going to kick 'em and then human violent breaks out he says well I didn't mean anything by that they don't hold him to account I mean you know what's good for the good\nAgain or this is this is the things that you're talking about disingenuous why are you trying to you trying to ... ... the periodic comments by these demographic with Donald Trump whose entire agenda is to break down all ... all edited all civility\nIf Donald if that that's his purpose if you're Donald Trump pet ever said\nHis supporters should aggressively go up and and and do that\nNow he has not always you know as an addict\nWhen I finish violence we use ... urge virus and he said he didn't pay the bail downloading one incident in a rally you're actually in a way that we are it's not bad right off I'm putting it down it would have been talking about disingenuous and then I I I'm dying out of high I'm rod choosing that\n... I think that was wrong I think I said that on this program I thought it was hurting when you when you have a member of Congress and saying that supporters shouldn't let other members of Congress who she disagrees with even ever feasible to be left in bed day ...

all the shows\nAll right Shane let me switch directions and ask you about this one the Hollywood and politicos combination I've always thought is a very interesting one some people say oh it's strange bedfellows was Jack Kennedy doing with Marilyn Monroe for example how dare he but\nYou know Elvis has been in the White House we that all kinds of connections between\nPresidents and the Hollywood types there are benefits and there are disadvantages I Would say we're combining Hollywood celebrities with newsmakers\nPoliticians sometimes the combo can be quite costly but sometimes it can be very and then changes so let's just reveal that\nNixon had all this to the White House Bill Clinton played the facts on Arsenio Hall remember that a Ellen de de wonder party with Obama and as a just a few names on now Trump has cognac and Kim car Daschle and\nIn the oval so let let let me put it this way just coming up to Hollywood slams these days help or hurt\nA politician particularly a politician who's the president\nBut that's a hard call because it depends on how popular the celebrity is for example um\nSomebody like a Roseanne Barr\nIs very uh popular among a very narrow group of Americans but somebody like a con you a a who has a wide reach a can certainly help somebody what's what's interesting about this is this is a a coming together of a power and fame\nAnd its mutually beneficial for both parties and doing something like this and I think that's why president over the decades have\nBrought celebrities into the White House it gives them a photo opportunity it gives the the person the celebrity or a little bit more groggy toss when they go out into the culture and say they they danced with\nPresident Clinton or played sax you know that type of thing so um I think it's a mutual benefit mutually beneficial move on both parts\nTo happen well here's my take on it [noise] Ah yes it's mutually beneficial or to both parts or they wouldn't because they piggyback off each other's celebrity but here's what I have noticed over the years we were in the past\nNot as political as a nation there was Washington\nThey did their thing over there and we went about our business and\nIf Elvis Presley was Democrat or Republican I wouldn't have known it right is Arsenio Hall Democrat or Republican but then there's this shift\nAnd now we see oh celebrities are taking sides most are on the left as we know that there are people you mentioned Roseanne Barr you mentioned I mentioned cognac and there's others Taylor Swift wouldn't be caught dead these days with Trump in the White House\nSo in terms of being advantageous\nThe backstory to that is which side are you on\nFor Trump to invite Taylor Swift or even certain NBA players or soccer players from Europe or something to the White House day would who shall I say taken me maybe\nYou know they would put their step in the air against it um it's not like the White House of the olden days where it's a privilege and an honor\nTo be invited by a president today we have a ... public in President Don forbid versus eight Democrats president and I saw this happening ... a little bit with the Bush is certainly with Obama\n... ... exactly and I think I'm as we become more polarized in our political\nOpinions people are are starting to identify celebrities and sports athletes I'm as to who side of the aisle or they honor their Republican or are they a Democrat\nAnd therefore I don't like that team or I'll never watched that guy's movie and so the the polarization that's\nHappening in our culture it's starting to to bleed over into our celebrities and that's why Taylor Swift got so much of a bad rap over the last\nA couple of weeks because of her comments and weighing in in the election and it goes back to you know what you want somebody said was just shut up and saying just shut up and perform and keep your politics or your sports\nA out of the the two and do all\nThat was a book written for the audience that was a book written by Laura Ingraham shut up\nAnd saying I'm ... I understand it but you mentioned Taylor swept to her fans there on her side I wouldn't be caught dead in the White House et cetera et cetera so we do have this polarization quicker down here about a minute and a half but I Want to get to this particular shame show\nIs it important to be in the oval you know you can show up at an an wine and cheese maybe or in a big gala but in the oval does that help the office itself to have\nA celebrity in the oval office to me it doesn't look good it just doesn't I I don't mind if you take a meeting outside of the oval is so revered and my mind it's jarring for me to see that no matter who they are\nYeah I I'm I'm not sure I think it can hurt but it can also help depending on how highly respected a celebrity is a indicate to which side though yet and it depends on who they like Charlton Heston when he was a gift of of George W. Bush\nUm you know ... that totally brought in the second amendment crowd because Charlton\nI say stay out of the oval you want to go meet outside at some a function that's different but the overall is ...\nOh thank you very much back with my interview with they just\nGuarding the independent judiciary and this red for and came home with regard to John just around the nation I'm hearing younger you don't you think America [noise]\nNews talk Ninety four point one they are the early riser so hardworking neighbors planting the seeds raising the crops getting ready for the next\nTwo justices who are on the ballot for retention for the next go around because the next go around put you on the on the seat for six years isn't that correct\nThat trade we happen to be the two justices who are up for retention this here this is the year that people are upset and the result ah ah for for many in in the in the movement\nUh we are the targets\nAll right so how are you and the other justice\nCombating this I Know there's things you can't say you kinda have to just take it I'm ... and the voter doesn't know a lot of dance and yet they vote for or against justice is what is your counter to death because you just declared that the full court hasn't made a rendering\nAnd and so it appears to me and I'm sure to the naked eye that they're out to get the two justices for retention just in case [noise]\nWell I I think that's right and certainly a the everyone will know before the election which justices voted which way [laughter] um but you know\nCampaign and the reason for that is that I don't want\nPeople um who may have business before the court contributing to to my campaign I think that that would create a conflict so ah basically the main thing that I have been doing I put together a website with every single one of my opinions on it um\nAnd uh you know I I I Believe in in full transparency um we have a judicial review commission which asks every one who has appeared before justices\nOr on the ballot they rank them they rate them in terms of integrity judicial ability and so forth um and I'm happy to report that I got near\nPerfect or near perfect scores even from people um presumably who lost their cases before us and those you know those are those are not\nA sexy campaign ads they're not attack ads or anything like that\nUp but they're they're the best we can do to defend ourselves um and maintain the integrity of the court\nToday what are they think I Would say we're down to thirty seconds so I'll wrap now but one other thing is that you are the first and only independent\nJurists appointed to the ... the Supreme Court so with that and good score and being independent I think you'll survive pretty well just in my ball like we need to leave it there I appreciate your coming on\nAnd talking about the investigation and she didn't like in the next couple of weeks thanks so much Terry All right we'll be talking to you later thank you very much you're listening to think America with Terry Gilbert Arenas in first and then I\nThink America radio dot com is where you can find our\nYou know if you don't care who you live in your house call any heating and air conditioning company but if you want to life in the background check drug free check with all the tools they need a truck full of park showing up on time guaranteeing their work like gold one hour heating and air conditioning\nSo here's the deal with the wrong time guarantee from Benjamin Franklin Columbia gets five dollars a minute for every minute were laid up to three hundred dollars a year when Benjamin Franklin says will be there will be there you mentioned the cable guy offered this [noise]\nCentral tenet of the American dream there's always been that the next generation would do better than the one before it education was the essential key ... W Jackson president or staying staying true to America's national destiny my father had a sixth grade education\nI graduated from Harvard law school my dad drilled into me study hard and get a good education the public schools I tend to the working class just to Pennsylvania prepared me for college unfortunately the latter I cried as the wrongs ripped out for many children who attend not accredited schools in dangerous neighborhoods\nWhere academic achievement is often ridiculed the answer to the problem poor education in school choice\nLiberate parents to make independent choices for their children instead of holding students hostage to failing schools introduce competition for scarce educational dollars because competition always improves quality\nIt's time to restore the dream of a better life for the next generation by giving parents the ability to choose quality education for their children\nMy dad is a proud do are always building repairing or maintaining something\nHe

everybody how dare millennials rebel against their boomer parents by not getting divorced\n... nerve the nerve of them because most ... don't say during many complimentary things about millennials they remind us that they live in a homes in the basement and they\nSport many a tattoo and they get around on a skateboard and some of them and if they work they work from a laptop with ear buds inserted\nThey tend to be self serving there always late um what else do boomer say about millennials base and retirement funds on eating out or at Chinese food or take out and Chinese food or ... or ... or going to extravagant spas\nPlus they're not traditional I think that kind of says it all [laughter] so how dare they stay in a marriage I mean that's just really rebellious against the boomer parent isn't [laughter] Shane staying married isn't trendy so why are millennials staying married\nI think that they take their relationships very very serious um they tend to be a little bit more sensitive than than\nOther folks ah I'm I fall into the category of a boomer and I also have a child who is a a millennial and ah I actually have several but that I think that it comes down to they take their relationships very serious they tend to get married\nBut an older age and from what I've seen it's kind of a status symbol to have a marriage\nA and to kind of put that on on a um you know kind of a trophy you know this is this is my marriage and I take it very serious\nAs well as they take their tattoos seriously and their piercings seriously and their children out of wedlock seriously and on and on and on I'm staying married of course\nIsn't trendy and you make a good point if they are serious about who they are and what they represent and how they work in the lattes that they slurp back you know three or four or five day whatever um then that's a very interesting analysis that they take it seriously however they do it you know\nBelieve them this is who they are uh Americans divorce rate\nJust fly has dropped Eighteen percent from two thousand eight to two thousand Eighteen this is according to an analysis I found that the University of Maryland a sociology professor named Philip Cohen who studies this uh has given out to the testing dropped Eighteen percent from two thousand eight\nI always refer to two thousand eight in my mind with the beginning of the Obama Raj for those Eighteen and for those eight years and now we've got two more years so we got out ten years eight ... percent\nOf that Eighteen percent\nEight percent is attributed to young couples who approach relationships very differently from their parents how could millennials possibly get marriage right well to your point they're serious [noise] [noise] okay I accept that\nAnd I tend to think that there are more sensitive about it is what do they make those decisions and they want to make sure that they get it right and maybe it's because they look back at their parents and say no my parents kinda screwed up a little bit maybe I don't want to go down that road\nPonder how their parents' generation which so many other things that kind of came at them overs thought\nA lot of things and in over thinking the marriage and bribes now they got two kids and then you know maybe they got wealthier maybe they got tour or whatever and then finally said okay I'm Out of it\nAnd sort of impulsively got out of it whereas millennials might not be over thinking they fall in love with that guy they met at a Starbucks drinking a ... um or that gal they met on the beach and\nThey're not over thinking at ... just happier as a result just staying in the marriage [noise] do you think there's an element to that\nOh the there's a certain part of it I think some of it as emotionally driven but I'd also tend to think that millennials um don't want to make mistakes because they've been\nKind of put in this this platform of you can do no wrong and therefore you have to live up to it and so there's a high sensitivity to it they tend to be in these relationships a lot longer\nNews talk Ninety four point one am sixteen hundred\nCBS News on the hour sponsored by zoom

Kate Snow ... who was her name she came out and tried to defend it but as everybody you know it shouldn't really from what I saw I should ever respond to remind us to match up are still a couple of days and there were she knew ... at ... at least one day\nAnd maybe as many as two or three days because she started talking\nOr to the uh the the ... the the woman who was a source weapon that he claimed and you know that uh she had seen ... uh these drinks being spiked and everything else and she said I did not I I didn't see that\nSo it's at least one day that they would one day that they would hold the withheld the story before Kavanaugh was confirmed\nBut didn't come out with the story until last Thursday right and you ask yourself you're quite because that would have blown everything to pieces now the interesting thing was Chuck Chuck Grassley because of the information that came out filed a second criminal referral ... his first criminal referral wasn't on that specifically\nBut now they're looking at this saying wait a minute this this source\nWho by the way she put it in an affidavit she she was under oh\nOr or evidence he was under oath in the evidence that he put forward about this woman source and she said that's not what I told him\nSo I so I don't know how you if that's proven I don't know how it\nA government causing the increase in prices in goods and services because the goods are going up\nAnd they're claiming that's a that's a good thing that will actually make an economy do better\nActually two responses on that on friday no no no no no tears makes the economy better know doesn't know we live in the ... and so people that were conservative around his delusional state of increasing prices helps the economy it doesn't\nIt helps the ... the companies or the industry that it's designed to protect beyond that no\nBut when we get to I mean we've been talking about the blame game and the whole civility thing because on many issues out there we talk about civility when we talk about look you need to get along with everybody well let's talk about the issues you and I've taught ... gone down this road before and we've looked at what the leftist promoting in this country right now and what they're promoting it's something that we can't compromise on there is no compromise\nAnd if there is no compromise what do you do as a nation on sanctuary cities sorry not going to permit sanctuary cities I'd open borders there is no compromise on open borders there is no compromise on sanctuary cities\nKnow where do you go there is no compromise on due process under the law there is no compromise on the presumption of innocence no there is no compromise on oh you believe this particular demographic or this particular gender there is no compromise there no you don't oh there's\nNo half measure to to border control you know in general you know forget about the the uh the the legal status\nBut we first have to have the

of kind of following that you know through the years\nAnd at the time that the movie came out there was a lot that wasn't no and then you saw the uh the authorities come out about a Pennsylvania Pittsburgh in Pennsylvania\nAnd then the latest about you know from buffalo and everything else um but that movie was kind of startling it was when I re watched it it was even more startling you know it was it but they said in the movie basically what we said one of the characters in the movie\nI'm just said you know can you believe it can I go back to church essentially could I ever go back to

point one where the upper Cumberland teams taught high school playbook sixty minutes of exercising does sixty minutes of football the high school playbook\nTheir heart ah then how do you predict whether or not because there are plenty of people filled with actual hate\nWhen we don't mean people on social media just talking you know negatively about someone we mean people filled with actual hate\nThat are potentially deadly while there are a number of laws we could pass to keep because uh you uh you know this guy was on a apparently a a social media site I'd never heard of a that was what was the social media site for white supremacists\nAnd\nOkay so your we could say the participation in such a site\nOr is against the law we could say that I'm speaking out with hatred in your heart real hatred for groups of people are based on their ethnicity or or or culture in bats against the law we could pass a number of laws send it out I mean how do you change for\nFreedom of speech ... part of the reasons that freedom of speech speech exist is so\nI think so you know who they are you know exactly how they all you do by taking away their free speech rights as what you send them underground that's what you do\nAnd and when there's pressure from you know society because the reason maybe I'm guessing the reason and I think it's a solid theory here that the neighbor wasn't aware of of this kind of you know hatred in this\nPerson's heart is because in our society\nWe don't tolerate it morally speaking forget about the legality of it all forget about what can be done legally morally we don't tolerate that because the overwhelming majority of people don't have this kind of hatred evil than there are no\nAnd you cannot ... and and that's what it comes down to there's there's no way of knowing for what ever reason whatever motivation a person might have\nI mean think of all of the reasons that might be stated a in terms of the motivation of of any\nMass killer in our history\nWell the list is very long [noise]\nYou know I I was just I was going through the headlines are just yesterday just in real clear politics and and it was a it was just really interesting\nA Donald Trump is a shameless liar that's the headline of an article written by former president for rock Obama got his by what is a no in Philly Detroit News be honest we hate each other\nBut the one I liked the most was just in Fox Bloomberg's headline if you ignore the news\nAmerica actually seems pretty nice if you ignore the new view ignore the news to seems pretty nice well I I just I thought it was you know I didn't even read the article I just I saw it but I but it it's something that you and I've talked about before where\nWe've we've said ah for and and I mentioned for example everything going on in the news and you walk into the voting booth everybody greet you how you doing what's going on you know you're voting location what's going on good to see a\nOh the weather's bad Oh thanks for voting pick up your thing thanks you take care of every now and that's I mean everybody goes and it's very orderly very nice but I don't think I've ever had a non pleasant time ever voting in my life right well that's actually the reality of it you know of of what goes on\nFor the vast majority tens of millions of people out there one thing we talk about you know the the news media\nAnd you and I have talked about this a lot that they're always you know and and it just because it's it's it's the news the news is what's unusual that's one of the first things I learned in journalism class is news is the unusual right that's why why murders\nAre new system because for the most part they don't happen to the vast majority of people not to discount that murder isn't bad but the fact is the majority of people the majority of the time\nNever encounter a a a murder right many ... some families do but the majority of families in this country do not when you look at the three hundred and roughly thirty million people in this country still mass shootings mass murders are quite\nLow but when you look at the uh\nPsychopaths that exist out there uh when I was just watching and how many the documentaries every watched on it but it was another one on on Ted Bundy yesterday ...\nAnd talk you know the going through the transcripts of his girlfriend at the time I'm telling you just haunting yeah she was trying to figure out\nIs he\nIs he not and then going through that progression of her\nSince he's brother ... the Ted 'cause the exact same thing shut the door on the FBI and you know how dare you this isn't this isn't my brother and then finally you know started thinking about it and said well okay I guess I have to deal with reality\nAnd it's not that it gives any you know um there was no owners or or or responsibility on the part of his\nBrother necessarily because it was as if you know he was learning it ... he really was learning about you know what his brother might be capable of doing or was capable\nThat turned out of doing a A N and that's the case with any of them you know the neighbor here of the shooter at the at the synagogue you know you think of that and I'm sure in in his mind is wondering wow is there something maybe that I should have paid attention to\nYou know close or is there something that I could have done we all do this and by the way this is how we get to this point\nI was saying there must be a solution because in our hearts\nThere should be one this in our hearts it doesn't make sense but we're trying to make sense of something that will ... the overwhelming majority of people will never be able to connect with\nIn our minds we don't think this way we don't have this kind of evil in our hearts we don't have this kind of hatred for people it's quite the opposite we have love and respect for people\nAnd we can talk about disagreements but I always put it like this it's like a family\nYou could sit around and and if you go spend you know enough time [laughter] with your family you can sit around and you can have debates you can have concerns and arguments and very passionate arguments on very important things\nBut the moment somebody else walks in that door and starts threatening interview and starts going after any of you that's when you stand up together and say wait a minute hold on here because\nWhen you put this all in perspective we're always going to have very passionate discussions about American politics that's going to be the case in all we should be the case\nWhen you talk about the the tactics right now being used do away with the process do away the constitution do away with the electoral college all of these things\nThat are ultimately about giving individual's rights and and instead we're looking at more and more taking away those the people's rights the individual rights\nOf Americans that becomes a real threat but it is not something that is in most people's minds something you respond to with anything else but a vote or a debate it's that simple and that's who we are\nEveryone greens most good people grieve when when there's a loss of life that's who we are as humans that's who we are as a society the the people the very few\nThat have these deranged mines that are that have evil in their hearts we'd like to be able to come up with a solution to try and predict it\nAnd try and stop it ahead of time and I I Wish there were way but as soon as it stands right now it's just impossible as you mentioned Gary\nSometimes in a society it is going to happen we can learn from it but it doesn't mean that will be able to predict the next one or stop or prevent the next one we looked to learn from it because we all want to stop the loss of life in the situation\nOpen eight six six Ninety right I [noise]\nEight six six on the radio [noise]\nBe a part of the conversation by calling to shovel it sell a hotline at eight six six nine zero

formation of this country a a big central big federal central government versus like smaller\nA central government has been the debate that's gone on for two hundred and forty years now and uh when you look now into modern times of liberalism over the last forty fifty years sixty years in this country Seventy years and go back to Social Security\nHas been about a bigger government role in providing\nFor all to the point now where we are at a uh a guaranteed income of free health care free college and now baby bonds already talked about last week yeah\nTaking care of you from cradle to grave not help not just helping those who truly needed but making it so all\nBecause the the uh\nCriminal here six thousand dollars of the guaranteed income I think would go to anybody under a hundred thousand I Believe it is yeah I think it was ... okay uh and and so it's not even about helping those in dire poverty\nIt's about the transfer of wealth mhm we've often talked about the um\nA huge transfer of wealth that has done and and how in the past that has a help to destroy many family businesses because they had to sell they couldn't afford to pay a the the taxes that they do but it has been over the last Seventy years in this country about\nA\nRedistributing income the thought process from the left is that week we are rich enough to take care of everybody\n\nEven know what they're proposing now as they scream about the deficit that the Republicans have created would be impossible to pay even if you tax the rich a hundred percent of their\nIncome ...\nEven if you're taxed a hundred percent of it you're still not going to still not going to be able to get what you want a up for it so it's not sustainable\nBut that's one thing having that debate for Thirty years we've had

position themselves as a party but you know that the president while the president owns at the party has the ability here to to get in line and say look something has to be done\nAnd and we need they need to position the Democrats and forced him to say we're for open borders so far they haven't done [noise]\n\nNews talk Ninety four point one they are the early riser so hardworking neighbors planting the seeds raising the crops getting ready for the next\nOf of ah the electoral college even if it's not going anywhere it shows the intent of where the left wishes to do when you see sanctuary cities when you see open borders when you see their leaders promoting lawlessness\n\nPromoting it yeah that's when you get to the point of people saying I don't know where I can compromise how do I how do I deal with you how do I talk to you\nRight\nHow do I how do I get I don't want to get across when when the cabinet thing goes on and you have the main stream of the Democrat Party the mainstream Democrat senators promoting that a certain demographic always has to be believed in this case a woman\n\nAnd that the presumption of innocence doesn't matter and that the person that the allegation is thrown against\nAutomatically is guilty\nWhen you had that exist when you have the belief of a major political party party the due process doesn't matter\n\nThe laws don't matter when it comes to sanctuary cities when the borders don't matter\n\nWhen the way of government that we have that protects the individual and protects the minority the constitutional republic not the direct democracy that we live in\n\nWhen the other side goes against basic tenants of what makes America America not rhetorically speaking not who's got the bigger flag not not who proclaims their American more than you\n\nBut those who actually believe and wish to defend the constitution of the United states versus those that don't\nThat's a political divide that's very tough to solve\nWell it's not like a you know a social issue where you know eventually there might be I don't know I'm a resolution or\nA change of heart we're talking about the very basic fundamentals of the country of the nation we're talking about the building blocks of the nation\n\nBecause\nYou have is where they build the numbers and people supporting all of this is people not knowing its the willfully ignore it but I don't know because they believe that they can have a big government but not an intrusive government\nWell if you believe that then you also believe we can do away with\nParts of the constitution or do away with the constitution in general will just come up with something new who write it up and posted on Facebook if we get enough light then it'll be good\nI have to pick something now but it's not about fixing anything it's about giving me what I Want it's about shutting up the other side given me what I Want well the the political drive behind that the machine behind that on the left is very

of action anymore that's where it becomes a real threat\nBecause then it becomes a deeper consideration then from there what well if it has enough steam if it has legs\nThan what you hope to do is put into office people who are who think like that and ultimately get to the point where you can change the process where you can change the constitution and do away with the fundamentals of this nation that is the threat\nAnd to think and if you scoff at the whole slippery slope we can point out a whole number of things over the years where we were\nRight on that kind of [noise] progress by the

sides and I will tell you that the left his justice guilty\nOkay here's the saints\nHere's a point that I Want to get too because you this is very important because one of the things that that really\nGets to conservatives because conservatives have compassion and I believe and I believe that and I believe that that the the yanks when we are we've got some interference or I I Believe the Trump is compassionate\nI Believe Trump's rhetoric at times goes over the top ... example [laughter] you know the example of going to give [laughter]\nKeeping the conspiracy going the cruise Ted Cruz's father was part of the Kennedy assassination so to me that was the high level anything since then has actually taken down a little bit because that's what the heck of it\nComes to hide purposely he can go over the top but don't you care about the substance isn't only the\nHyperbole then is that what you're claiming Democrats are Democrats only care\nAbout how you say it's not what you say\nAnd you also have to understand when it comes to the theory that exist in America by a lot of people including Trump when you see the Democrats wish to protect illegal immigrant criminals this is not ultra part it's in\nTo get people angry it is the reality of what exists today\nDating reality is not hate talk but when you have the Democrats who prefer\nTheir preference is the safety and security of illegal immigrant criminals over American citizens yeah you're going to get people angry with the president mhm yep what's gonna happen\nUm look and by the way the whole thing with the remember the president said the rapist thing and you know it's it's you know you and I for example we've said you could take quotes that we have said and and you know\nThe context of not knowing other things you could take it out of context as soon as that was said he goes no I mean the the bad people not the good ones and he said we know there are good people tried to come across the border we can't do it\nSo we clarified that a long long time ago in fact he clarified that right after it happened yes but again it was a what they did was they took it and they ran with it that that all are rapists and now\nYou said all he said rape is well and he didn't say they were all rapist won't name across it and and ... change the making the point the very simple point that we have to that every single person that comes in this country that was the point he was making yes\n\nBecause does the most part and criminals are the ones you don't want to hear\n\nVery simple uh some data to a point by point with our last caller to find out just how liberal you are because you have to understand where liberalism\n... or ... you know again and you can tell at least he conceded he was conceding some points a by the way I did see over the weekend we need a third political party everything here proves that that would stand for what\n\n... what are you going to do that are going to let them out for about a third political party stand for what where does this center where's the center yeah who's really moderate right now\nI don't know what a moderate is right now\nYou know we've been you know over the past few years especially over the past twenty four months we've been trying to define what a conservative as\nA I think we all know what a liberalism there are varying degrees of liberalism\nBut it starts pretty much on the far left and then goes to the extreme far left well tell me what a moderate is forget about conservative or liberal tell me what a moderate is what are they stand for what are they promote and how they vote\nAnd I've talked about how I uh talked\nA a relative by marriage who was a college professor and it was a liberal I mean I really never got into the conversation and did this year at our family reunion and even though he's a liberal he rejects what's coming from the Democrats completely and he said about Trump said\n'cause like my dad loved Trump because Trump look his rhetoric has over the top but not a racist these dot ... said come on\nIsn't New York city deals with everybody and this guy's a liberal professor who says I Can't stand being on the liberal campus as he said because they're not liberal anymore now she would be in his fifties mhm so he might still be some of the old ...\nNew school liberals that are really have the

eight six six Ninety red eye he is are currently and I'm Gary McNamara thanks so much for being here this morning [noise] well we're talking about the political divide in this country ... we've had some great color so far we really appreciate it thanks to all of a couple of other stories you want to make sure we covered them back to your calls\nAnd comments on the political divide in America\nI just chuckled over this one on um MSNBC and on Saturday joy read and the panel rented discussion on voter suppression you know they've got the very tight race Stacey Abrams and Brian Kemp for governor of ah\nOf Georgia than they are trying to make a big deal he's from voter suppression voter suppression are talking about the fact that\nUh there's you know there's a law in Georgia\nThat you have to purge the rules and they got it wrong they said after every two elections it's not it after seven years and by the way a lot of people left have got that wrong except for seven years after purchased and they're like and butter suppression voter suppression voter suppression voter suppression\nThe law was passed by Democrats in Nineteen Ninety seven that you had to purge the rose after seven years\nSo Democrats passed the law it's like yeah but he wants to do it\n[laughter]\nWe passed it we didn't really mean it he means that they may [laughter] we're Democrats we passed the law to purge the voter rolls if you don't vote every seven yeah\nBut he's actually doing it and he's a Republican so that's bad he's surprising the vote I mean this is all by the way if you want the most pleasant czar issue out there it's the claim of voter suppression by the Democrats\n[noise]\nThat is when you think about it how but ... that is\n\nYeah um it's huh it's just like the money in politics we hate it if the other side's raising more money than we love it at about though is raising a ton of money so\nThen and then oh Casio Cortez she did it was very little money\nSo they're not ... they're one more example of them just basically reaching out every time they get defeated they'll reach out and we'll well we need to change that well that works against us\nBy the way voter fraud doesn't happen the story's a couple of weeks old but I I Want to bring it because we we got involved there were so many different topics going on we were on vacation never got to this a couple of weeks ago for women were indicted in North north Texas voter fraud ring\nFor women who are accused of targeting elderly voters were indicted on thirty felony counts of voter fraud and arrested following an investigation by the Texas attorney general before women who are accused of targeting elderly voters in twenty sixteen\nWere indicted on thirty felony counts of voter fraud the defendants were members of an organized voter fraud rang and were paid to target elderly voters in certain ... uh northern Fort Worth precincts in a scheme to generate\nSo you've got a ton of people because if he only get six or seven wins by six seven eight points Ted Cruz\nAnd have it wins by twenty huge number of people we voted for Greg Abbott voted for better or voted for Greg Abbott and would not vote for Cruz why would be my question\nWell you know we have to point out and I don't know if this is a part of it or if this would be in in the you know part of the answer that uh that you would get if you were to learn that\nBut we we talk about two years ago Ted Cruz being the Damon oh yeah I agree with you know and and you know I mean back when banner was was speaker of the house and and you know a ... there were people in the Republican Party we know that in the Senate and in the house\nThat hated cruise but I mean if you had any question you look at what happened at the are in see at the convention in the summer of twenty sixteen yeah bowed out stage but now he's beautiful Ted yes right\nWhile because now he's useful\nBut if he decided to challenge the president managing and twenty twenty but isn't that politics though yeah of course the strange bedfellows that it seems to me yeah that's and and it's nothing new but it it is\nThe same thing is is that okay well but in that setting it was about his lack of endorsement and now it's I think you could probably point to a number of people that say that still stuck with me even though the president is with him and Houston I'm not\nI mean I I think he would probably again which some I Can't even measure that but I Know there are people that support the president right now support governor Abbott and are not going to support\nTed Cruz for one reason or the other and it's it's likely because I'm I'm guessing a handful of them at least are saying it's because he did not get on board and twenty sixteen\nI Would love to see those votes how many votes for Abbott but don't vote for Cruz at ... or ... just don't vote for Senate mhm\nYeah no there or you know if you if you look at that there there could be a number of them that aren't voting and the Senate or how many of them\nYou know are looking at the governor's race and and you know going well yeah that's it that's all great and wonderful but Lupe Valdez is not our candidate there were a number of things that came up and her history as a share of that the left is considered the ... in fact been more vocal about\nUh of course in the in the past few months that they're concerned with her actions as an and policy of the basically the Dallas County sheriff department\nUnder her leadership so you look at that and then and those that probably has some to do with it again you know you could put some of those answers in that category but we'll see what where it comes together I guess on election day in and how many people actually did vote for Abbott\nBoat wouldn't vote for Ted Cruz that's an interesting question and point\nEight six six Ninety red eye\nHim a dish into being required by law pre and post trip inspections are vital to the safety of

it was Ninety four point one\nBut to me when he said that\nWhat it was was I I'm I'm Out of the I'm Out of the mindset of groupthink that it ... it I'm involved in group think find being told that I must think this way because of the color of my skin then my mind is still in the plantation\n[noise] that's what I Try to some other for your your your point a finger at a\nPhase or public implantation what I'm saying what what ... are you are on right now that won't allow you to think as you really think\nOr what but when you're talking to folks about the homosexual affair and the marriage thing or whatever\nThe talk of the mission issue is up with more of a conservative mindset but because they're so brainwashed into fishing of racism racism racism racism at clouds their their their their judgment\nYou know I I Wonder 'cause you know we've talked about the identity politics with the with the ... with the Democrats in and the identity politics that have really I think come to the forefront because they're so radical is you know number one the transgender movement where if you're\nA a man you can be a woman and the the country and laws must ah recognize you that way and then what we've got into now is transracial that if you're black you can be white and if you're white you can be black\nLegally and when I start thinking about that and wonder how many we said that we said with the transgender it seemed that there was more acceptance and when they jumped to the trans racial\nI said I think you're going to get a lot of blowback from a lot of black leaders out there standing wait a minute\nYou can be whatever race you want whenever you want to be it and I thought that was really interesting I Wonder if people thought that that was just a ... a lot of minorities might have seen that and said okay maybe this time for you to get on a different mindset as to where the Democrats are going\nTo the extent that challenge is so what does the fight for a week at all in vain yeah right\nNo that's I I think that's the question that that many of us have been asking for a long time I mean when you think of the mindset from the the the the left right now that you can be whatever you wish to be now that includes gender or race\nSo there because there's transgender as ... there's also trans racial Islam and they want you to believe well if that's how you identify\nIf if you look at a you know the the the civil rights at\nThe protected groups created under the civil rights act if there if you can belong if anyone can belong to any protected group then there are just by saying so\nThen there are no protected groups send the civil rights that they aren't just done it's it's over I I mean the the the civil rights act but everything that the civil rights era that happened there all that entire battle\nThis we're not\nOnly that the uh the civil war was for nothing and wouldn't you fight\nAgainst a press of a governmental systems there are no why did we fight this to say about that we should have done that uh we're we're on another different paths now so I'm like no we are America this or that record\nWhen I say there were as individuals better that ended by or any other country were saying I give us a better than everybody else yes or in other countries\nYes and ... and and and the goal would be to everybody to adapt the actual ideas in in in the constitution where they\nThey don't always do so and the other thing is too I mean there's also this thing that the left throws at the conservatives in at the right that you don't you won't acknowledge racism come on and we all know what are how horrendous racism in slavery and Jim Crow was\nAnd I don't know any conservative that which is to go back to that\nAnd my belief is the Democrats and I think about my grandfather my grandfather was the ... the Democratic chairman of the town\nThat we grew up in and he was because he emigrated from Canada and he came to town and they were all Republican and he just said well you got to have two parties you can't have a system with but he was he was much much more conservative but he left the Democrats that ball I I Believe\nMy father never had the official conversation with somebody and he died before I got to ask him\nBut I said ... be a Democrat today and he said no abortion abortion changed him a lot of the liberal politics\nOr changed him but when you think of what they\nWhat the Republican but the Democrats used to claim in the seventies and eighties they cared about and then the identity politics where everything is about race everything is about gender and the whole cabinet thing where you saw that you must believe the woman well that's ridiculous if you must believe the woman will it used to be it must leave the white man over the black\nYou know all over the black person in a criminal justice in the black person you don't believe in the white person you believe you know you go by evidence\nAnd what I find in credit is what I find incredible the bigotry and intolerance and the actual racism and sexism seems not to be coming\nFrom the Democrats\n'cause when I talk to black men about a ... that situation um they fully understand\nThat uh because I remember there was a white lady that was several years ago she ran away and uh she blamed it on to black males as so every\nBlack without that within the city you know capable under scrutiny and they came out that she just wanted to run away right oh so\nSo I'm like well you have to understand that that\nIf you go to that system would be fully aware of that what you're trying to fight against corruption foolish ...\nFrames a thank you so much up saying some reshaping writes thoughts and uh yeah I mean you're not the first person who is called the show and said look I'm black\nMy life well you know it's interesting too is that you go through the day to day experiences and we hear that from callers uh every so often\nAnd and I think of and then you mentioned the signs in the yard I have a a a a neighbor I spend my neighbor for almost Fifteen Years at the end of my street he's so he's at the corner he's got a corner lot right\nAnd one of the three of that corner not not our street but the the the cross street there is a is six lanes so there's a lot of traffic but he has a cruise sign and another conservative that's running on the state level for for a for Congress here\nUm that is our our our congressmen on the state level and I just I just wonder I haven't asked him yet 'cause I haven't had a chance to talk to him he's a black conservative and I haven't had a chance to ask him\nHas anybody ever tried to steal your science I mean not that they would know he's black and and that that would even matter to anybody on the left but you see the things on social media\nAs anyone ever tried to steal your signs you know from your guard because he has them right there on the on the side where the big street is\nAnd so I don't know I I Would love to to know that if if anyone's ever attempted that he's he's always working in my yard I you know I I think the\nAh a\nGroup that the president spoke to the young black leadership some mhm\nAnd the responses that you got in the media coverage of it and James like our our last caller and this is striking fear I'm not saying there was a monumental change in in a blacks going to vote Republican\nBut they're much higher profile now and getting much more coverage\nThe left cannot permit that they must demonize every single person who would tend to do that

saying that they should come in legally they stand in line but now they changed their to\nThis is what I say America First just like President Trump said you know ... when there is no homeless shelters here in America and there's no starving people here you see what's going on in the streets of California sleeping in these tent cities\nWhen we take care of America First then we could worry about other people if not we're not going to have a country without any border\nSo getting Michael John W. P. T. F. in Raleigh North Carolina hey John\nThank you sir I I figure it out the reason why the Democrats do not want to stop the quote migration our invasion from the south and it goes back to after the civil war\nThey suppressed black voting but they still counted all the black people in the south for representation in Congress so non voters kept the Democrats in control of Congress all through the ...\nNow they're attempting to go back to their roots as it were by bringing in an invasion from the south of non voting Hispanics who will be counted in the two thousand twenty cents is ... and therefore be wearing a portion giving the Democrats more seats in Congress from non voting people\nPossibly I don't even know if they're thinking that grand of a plan Richard listening in Montreal Richard Hi Brian\nI just want to talk about the media and the Democrats are blaming President Trump for what happened in Pittsburgh\nHas a Jew I'll tell you there's been no president a more pro Jewish or more more pro Israel than president and that's one of the people of Israel Jews in Israel love them and in the ... congressional district Minnesota who's running for the Democrats Milan Omar who's\nCalled Israel evil I'm wearing Chuck Schumer and Adam Schiff purge who are Jewish and CNN and MSNBC all\nCovering that up that's what the spray from there they have a nerve to accuse the Republicans of being anti Semite when they put a candidate like that up who caused Israel evil or were you were tweet Israel has hit the world they all week and the people and help them see the evil doings with Israel could you imagine if a Republican can we did ...\nHow about this can you imagine is a former Republican president was on stage with Farrakhan Mr anti Semite anti termite he hate you'd be literally he lives in breeds hate Jewish people and there's\nFuneral day so I mean what are we talking about here this is ridiculous and the thing is inside Washington they may think they're pulling the wool over people's eyes but the rest of the country is laughing at the prospect that the president's to blame at all\nJust like you wouldn't blame President Obama for what happened er during his eight years where there are multiple shootings but they were very effective in blaming the Republicans and gun laws\nThey rescue at a local nonprofit\nSaying ah you know if if the Trump Organization through through Eric and John junior continues to do business um that has had ties and may have\nCurrent ties and we're not entirely\nCertain um but all those monuments cases you know the people are bringing against the president and ... those have them all listed you can go to cruise website you know but that's a that's a concern that they never separated from interests with aren't connected to foreign governments and that foreign governments obviously Brian would be interested in trying to buy influence\nFrom the Trump family I mean that's goal number one\nBright ... who was a big worry about anybody that ever does business who wants to run for the White House when you think\nWell you know what they better you know what cut ties before you take that job that's I'm Sorry those are the two separate those are two\nThem do what did cut ties\nPresident Trump has not severed his ... his uh his connection to the Trump Organization they continue to profit from that business\nHe continues to be connected to that he never officially separated from it who's really running that in a blind trust\nAnd you know what I can tell you that it is a serious question\nFirst skeptics of what's going on with this coziness with Saudi Arabia\nThat the Trump family whether it's papa or sons continue to have interests that are connected to Saudi Arabia I'm not the only one asking this question I I think that the next time someone wants to run for president after President Trump if they'd been in business\nThey better go bend over backwards to divest and disconnect and disengage so that we can rebuild the trust of the American people who for decades before President Trump took office have always believed in you know prime they come up to you on the street and tell you this and me\nThat it's all about money that no matter which which person which parties running the government somehow there on the cake and we have to build back this trust and we can't be doing business foreign governments while we're conducting national\nSecurity also see I don't know what they are but the house Democrats who said issue fifty two subpoenas that were blocked by the Republicans is there a theme to the subpoenas or they just all over the place\nThey're all they're all or they have everything to do with a ... it's everything it's like health care and and all these different policy issues along with that sort of the ethical um the you know the group of ethical questions that range as we've just you and I have discussed\nBefore throughout the cabinet it's not just President Trump that's what people are allowed to do at the cabinet level as well so\nUm as I think you and I talked to in our last conversation they're going to jump on Ryan's again Wilbur Ross ah an interior and commerce shore and um but but the the fifty two subpoenas are on oh my God environment you know on a million policy questions\nAlong with ethical conduct right\nUm do you have to uh Ryan Zinke he used to live in different investigations into him Wilbur Ross will have to explain to do that if Democrats are in the majority not only about his potential insider trading and conflicts of interest but testimony to Congress the may not have been truthful about those discussions\nRight there is an ongoing um there's a debate about whether or not when he testified to Congress and was asked about this uh censorship sorry the I'm a citizen question on the census\nWhether or not he was forthcoming and he later said that he then recalled a conversation with Steve Bannon about creating a citizenship test I mean a question on the on the census and not um\nHe basically his spokesman is explaining that he didn't really understand what he was being asked when he was being asked that but that will I just I'm telling you that will be a hearing\nRight immediately because that say you know the census is ... is a huge political issue um along with citizenship and you know uh the the whole fight over immigration sort of writ large\nEnough not to go going after Kavanaugh would not be was more than likely right\nI just think it's I think it's really hard to prove a there were these misconduct complaints that were forwarded from a from a a judge on the on the district a court of appeals to the story broke an hour before the Senate votes maybe two thirty on that Saturday and the vote was at four o'clock sharp\nOn that he had sent these complaints to ah the um chief justice John Roberts the Supreme Court that having nothing to do with Dr\nFord but concerns that a he can to his conduct in his compartment in those hearings were not worthy of a justice of the Supreme Court same complaint that retired Justice John Paul Stevens made about cabinet that he's too partisan\nAnd that he uh you know he he was\nPartial um in in his in his testimony that day but also this other complaint was that he may have perjured himself before the committee on his first set of hearings when will be for Dr Ford ... about his service in the Bush administration\nPerjury is very hard to prove and if they want to poke around and they really think a good standing for for for that\nUm you know maybe there needs to be a new process when we go through confirmation hearings for the next stresses\nThe Supreme Court no matter which party is controlling the Senate but I Do believe that trying to take a ... a a a justice off of the Supreme Court um who obviously as qualified may have done the wrong thing in his confirmation hearings\nAnd will always be stained by that but to remove him and I just think it's incredibly divisive and destructive and I think it's it's it's not the right\nThing to do list and I think it's really handy too is for both sides for Democrats or Republicans to read your column\nBecause given idea of if if the Democrats have it for at least two years what they should be in ... with the more than likely will be investigating they're able to investigate with this type of the ledger will be there any positive worked it could be done\nWe'll see Brian I Do think it's positive if there's some needed oversight on on um on conduct because I think the president is running a swamp we discuss this before I think it's been\nJust unbelievable what's gone on the blurring of the lines the trampling I'm of the rules and I think the oversight of that is very important I I I I make the point in the column that I think that ... going into an impeachment drive 'em before a special counsel tells us\nThat he actually obstruction of justice for you know we did anything um that would merit impeachment I think is just is is it the norm is overstep that will cost them the presidency and twenty twenty and just you know further degrade our discourse and and our political situation I Do think that turning up\nI mean it is the job of the legislative branch no matter which party is running it to hold the executive branch accountable it is a separate and co equal branch because we're not a third world dictatorship\nAnd president but other men run this country and you say without overstepping is really helpful\nBut do you think that if they want to get the Senate and get the president's either gotta show they can not only investigate the legislature and what about infrastructure what about immigration reform would rather have a combined ... program where in Twenty years were were knocking it down into the building it up\nBy the Illinois I are always obviously hopeful about the ways that the parties can work together and they're not always you know sharing our priorities but\nI Do believe the areas that are potentially um you know ripe for compromise are a prescription drug pricing and I and I think infrastructure and I really hope that they you know they don't have huge budget\nFights that lead to government shutdowns I don't see an any kind of agreement on immigration coming because the to the Democrats aren't going to get the Senate they're going to get the house by four seats if they get it [noise] um I think if the Republicans hold on it'll be by you know for seven seats to I think it's going to be incredibly I'm slim a week old\nSon and already we called for either party and not can create opportunities for consensus or it can just be a disaster but I think I Hope immigration and some prescription drug work as possible immigration is just a fight that both part of the Democrats are leaning far too heavily on immigrant rights\nPresident Trump is fleeting far too heavily on the fight he was his his bill in the Senate Brian got fewer votes from Republicans and Democrats combined than any of the proposals he took for positions on the good luck to own the house he made it clear to driven and Graham he didn't want the DACA deal he doesn't want to daily wants to fight for twenty twenty I see no hope on that issue in the next two\nYeah I'm going I'm going to just give you a scenario you ready yeah he\nHave the house have the Senate if I give and I'll look weak with every did whatever calculus he thought he didn't go for it but if you lose the house and see he gets an offer that deal again from democratic leadership of hey I'll give you the wall or you get ten year a ten year a path on DACA\nMaybe takes it and he goes gosh this is what I got you know this is the best I got I don't have the house I'm going to do a deal here because\nI think I knew that I Will give him credit if he does that right no I Know absolutely will do the people\nTo break down and and and solve some of our problems I Know they're not going to do ... ... you know they're not going to tackle everything but I I Would I Would be so happy for even a half a loaf on immigration just something\nI think it would be great I give him\nCredit if he does that absolutely\nYeah I think Lindsey Graham really wants them to do it and right now he has a they say well when we how would you know are alienated the Freedom Caucus well what if he doesn't have the house\nSo maybe he says I Can't you know his instincts we saw his instincts when he brought the cameras into that room and we saw him try to work out guns and we saw I'm trying to work at

necessarily against us but he was aren't marked within a last night on life liberty and lived in cut forty seven\nAnd so from because he was running as a Republican\nAnd because he he he has no hostility to conservatism is just isn't to think about a much any as a norm is hostility to political correctness and liberalism\nBecause it just doesn't fit how he thinks the world wars\nAnd so I think\nWe ended up with somebody who I I compare frankly to Andrew Jackson has one of the most disruptive presidents we've ever had because because he's not afraid to take on the establishment every single morning\nHey I don't disagree with that and the dimension of Andrew Jackson resonates with you obviously a and it resonates I think with a lot of Americans who recognize that Jackson was he was kind of our our first real populist president who understood the relationship between American power\nAnd where America needed to be as a society where it was directions and he gets a lot of bad press because of trail of tears in San and I've written about the fact that Jackson is not the person should take the blame for\nWhat happened with all that but the point is is that if you if you compare Theodore Roosevelt view of America's role in the world at Donald Trump's\nOr they are I Would say if not identical certainly parallel in ways that I think Americans right now I Begin to realize we actually gained a great deal by this new approach to America's role in the world\nAnd the way he was viewed died Teddy Roosevelt to in the beginning they saw this guy was to robots almost comical I and the way he handled himself he was vice president thrown on the last minute to unify ticket I guess get New York it's right or a police chiefs I run riders rough rider guy so and he was self promoting in many ways so\nOnly help it and you know ... and ... that that that that tweet Twitter is Trump's bully part puppet and it's a way in which he's been able to change the political dialogue in this country in extraordinary ways that we haven't really seen the end of the\nPeople don't set them they didn't accept a Roosevelt in and he took on business by the way but they didn't accept him really in Washington they never accepted Donald Trump he took his case to the people Teddy Roosevelt took his case of the people and they seem oblivious to criticism\nTotally and she is also the mistake that Roosevelt made was in Nineteen twelve is split the Republican ticket\nAnd let Woodrow Wilson into the White House by running a against his own hand picked successor William Howard Taft because he didn't like some of task more conservative policies\nAnd that hurt him both as a figure within the Republican Party but it also open the door to someone like Woodrow Wilson and a progressive agenda both internationally and nationally that we are still trying to sort it out and still trying to clear out today\nIs that Roosevelt gets his you know will make you only get killed yet right so he becomes president he finishes McKinley term didn't win re election and then says he's done and then says he's finished in ... become right over to ... in this country which was that\nIn in anything if anything it was in many ways a river seeing some of roses\nBut Roosevelt also keep in mind too he was our first real colorblind president you know he invited Booker T washing to come to the White House\nHe was a firm believer also in the idea of what we call the melting pot right not the end of hyphenated Americans\nHe would look at the situation with illegal immigration and sort of saying well we need immigrants who become Americans we don't need America as a haven where people come in order to preserve and to maintain a political or cultural identity which is anesthetic all too what America represents where America needs to\nGo so you know the presidents are shortcomings you know his successors he's anything but traditional and he's he gets up every day he's a unorthodox as say the least but us somebody's historian and like David a I'm a David Hanson\nVictor Davis Hanson and others are open and you know the general Keane just say okay I Know how things the only one but I'm open to see if this is going to work\nSo I'm just stunned to see the anti Semitism or the anti Semitic gunman walk into a synagogue kill a weapon people in cold blood and people draw back to Donald Trump listening to Jonathan Weissman he's in New York Times jeopardy editor listen to this guy cut nine\nNot over what her and president trolley line we're not calling him a racist were not only one that we don't know what I'm saying and\nThe president has shown a reluctant time and time again to show his supporters and hit record\nAs in Illinois that I'm not calling you a writer I think you're right that's right then we are in semi fully on their side and he got pushed back hard enough that they are with\nThis guy is hates Trump so ... yeah he hated Trump ... Israel Trump this Trump is eighty he's gets criticized because he's too tight with Israel\nIt's a it's a guilt by association but it's so typical of the media's response to drop you know what\nThey're ... they live on Trump Trump has made them possible to maintain ratings to keep themselves in the public eye and the only way which they can deal with this is and they're declining ... relevance and declining influence\nThat Trump presidency represents is to get more and more extreme or and become more and more unqualified and their attacks on him and in some ways you know I watch this with people that I Know who are never Trump voters and I've watched sort of there if I'm going to ... son uses expression\nWashed their character deform as a result of this is a is there anger ... feeds on itself towards Trump and this has happened in our mainstream media look what's happened to the New York times and the Washington Post ah the decline of intellectual credibility which was never very high to begin with right on his\nUh end with the with the mainstream media and it's infuriating Brian to watch and I know I Know that you you see this happening to those who call themselves your peers but it's also tragedy in the middle of January ... has nothing to do with\nWith Donald Trump it has to do with their own growing impotence to shape the national dialogue and that drives me\nCrazy also they were wrong [laughter] I don't think there is also kind of Donald Trump will never ... Donald Trump will never win and he did all those things that I have\nAnd I had people who were trapped for ... hours in the summer who'd come to be at my office in sort of say do you think do you really think Donald Trump is going on and said yes I Do I think that the media is wrong I think the polls are off the mark here and I said\nAlso I said not only is he going to win I think could be a very good president he's actually exceeded my expectations from the point of view of what he's been able to accomplish and what he's been able to do\nHere and he okay he's a bowling a China shop\nBut the American people said you know what its time\nThat and they sent Donald Trump been\nSo you are Michael Gerson speechwriter for George Bush hates them rights everyday Abadi is you have George Will despise them doesn't want to be Republican anymore you a Bill Kristol a someone whose dad really was one of the founders of conservatism and I know very well yeah and now Bill Kristol hates everything he does he can't do anything right or by him\nGuys like Franklin two were wrong so listen I was wrong\nYou know guys like a Erick Erickson so you know I become I was in trouble but now I'm seeing what's going on and seeing how unfairly has been treated\n'em back in yeah so I give people credit you could be wrong but why you keep doubling and tripling down he's not going to get impeach he's gonna finish for years he's already got a plan in place it's going to be easier to get another four there was his first for\nTraffic it will be and and also to there is going to be a deep bench of young conservatives including people like uh like John James\nThe Kennedy Michigan who I think it's a terrific candidate we used a voice in prison ...

and it's independent so I don't speak to him but I'm not happy with what he's doing because it's going too fast because you looked at the last inflation numbers are very low\nBut he put on there I mean I'm not going to yell and I was you know now they're going to be honest I'm not blaming anybody I put him there and maybe a trade maybe it's wrong but I wanted to get their own I put it so couple of other people there that I'm not so happy with it but for the algebra I'm very happy with people\nThat is for the United states but you know treasury and about the fed and he says you know as our economy there's good and forecasters do well they raise\nNodding along is the co author of jumping around like inside the America First plan to revive our economy Stephen Moore Steven you think he was a lot of people are sitting on the president should not comment on this how do you feel\nLike I think he's right on the substance and I don't see anything inappropriate but the president who is basically the c._e._o. or our economy speaking out now that's not to say that that shouldn't be independent you just heard Donald Trump said he believes the fed should be independent but look\nThe economy is booming right now we were in the biggest boom in Thirty years we have seven million more workers than we have I mean jobs and we have workers and that's an amazing statistic\nSo the economy is booming and Trump is basically saying look there's no inflation why is the fed taking the you know the old metaphor was the trumpet and why is the taking the punch bowl away from the party just when it's getting going\nAnd I happen to agree with him on that look I don't want to see a return of inflation I Lived through the seventies I Lived through you know Fifteen sixteen percent inflation rates\nBut this idea that somehow this is a bogeyman inflation right now in food prices are not rising\nAnd there's too many people the fed who believed that growth and the economy and higher wages are inflationary now about laughter we're here Brian I nobody would tell you you say if the economy produces more apples the price of Apple's falls it doesn't rise growth causes lower inflation not higher inflation so\nA white now you're looking at ah the market last week and a lot of people an upset so that's for sure ... points up three points down ... points down what's going on\nA I think there's a lot of profit taking at the beginning I thought there was a lot of nervousness about what the fed was doing what when interest rates rise than bonds are more attractive and socks right I mean that's just simple a finance but ah look I'm not a great stock picker or anything like that but I Will tell people this\nOne great piece of advice ready for this Ryan ready by low shell high finance people tend to do the opposite right they tend to you know when the markets crashing this is a good time to buy stocks they're cheap earnings are good around your good now so Stephen Morse Sherry's talking about his\nBook Trump ... now the president's got his economy roaring [laughter] he's got the revenue coming in the deficits or something else he's got to tackle but a GDP is it three point five last time was four point to feel good about it but guess what somebody else is taking credit\nEconomic\nPrinted on on the job numbers come monthly job numbers suddenly Republicans are saying it's\nActually those numbers are the same as they were going through Fifteen and sixteen\nReaction Stevens well about my luck liberals have a hard time explaining what's going on with US Economy because you should also play\nI Know you probably have the send your catalog when Brock Obama set a few weeks before the election how is Donald Trump's going to get us to four percent growth how is he going to revive manufacturing does he have a magic wand well maybe this president does have a magic wand 'cause we have revived manufacturing we have revised the\nMining industry and we have four percent growth and now they're trying to explain why this is happening now here\nHere's the reason why it's not true that this Obama deserves the credit by the way when I get my speech is when I say you know is this the Obama effect it is the bottom of the fact is the effect of Iraq Obama's no longer president that's why the economy is booming the last year the Iraq Obama was president you can lift the surprise the economy grew at one point\nSix percent that's pathetic this is America we don't grow at one point six percent it's wrong for that's the difference between being your powers like sixty miles an hour and forty miles an hour pickup truck down even more north of ... you got to read it\nIt's going to be the talk of town for a movie I saw Ninety four point one\nThe media's constant unfair coverage [noise] the possibility\nNegative attacks you know the [noise] only served to drive people apart\nAnd to undermine healthy debate\nSo he took the argument at him and I thought it was very fair go you go the media's got to see a role here\nIf you watch CNN MSNBC if something happens good with the economy they don't talk about right if something's happened with ice has been decimated it doesn't doesn't wear reached the radar if something happens with the Mueller probe it leads are they line no\nBut they're putting you in order to an emphasis on things that they think is going to get them ratings that drives him nuts\nNo that's right and and the bias in the media tell people all the time isn't necessarily what the coverage what they don't cover what they ... how many people recognize him realize the president just signed a clean up our oceans\n... to get plastic out of the oceans some of the biggest offenders are in Asia how many people realize that he signed sex trafficking legislation to do is to stop sex trafficking in its tracks that law enforcement\nHas been pressing for for years the veterans accountability act the veteran's Choice Act all of these things people are getting done Brian I'm knocking hundreds of thousands of doors over the course of the last year year and people want results\nThey recognize the results that are happening in their everyday lives there looking past the rhetoric and that's just what we have to keep talking\nAbout the opioid too or just passed on a bipartisan level of money to opioid abuse\nTreatment that is right or not and not only more broadly but with our veterans a community as well many of them running around with ...\nAll over the world are living with chronic pain and they're getting addicted to opioids so not only are we going to a deal with it more broadly but we need to deal with it within the VA thing and that's what they're getting done\nAnd colonel on top of that the one thing is and I've always said that is\nThe health care is did you don't even hear about Republicans and Democrats when it comes to health care it's all personal kind of play or do you have a and when you go to a hospital you go to a doctor what kind of care do you get how much comes out of your pocket you wouldn't matter what class you are it hits you so I think Republicans kinda dropped the ball here\nBrian I'm a business owner and for the for the last six years I've had to look at my employees dealing with double digit premium increases year after year after year under Obamacare\nThese are people making maybe fifty sixty thousand dollars if you've got an eight to ten thousand dollar to ... you have to come out of pocket ten grand before your plan even kick then that's not a plan that's a joke\nSo so I Am proposing talked about we have to get out the cost of care that the floor with Obamacare is when after universal coverage and that's what Andrew\nGillum and so many others free free free will nothing's free\nOr if we're going after the cost tort reform portability of insurance selling across state lines prices which the president drug prices getting serious about Medicaid fraud and Medicare fraud that blowing up\nThe system that not only helps businesses like mine that helps individuals that helps it's the fastest growing part of our defense budget that's not aircraft carriers and planes it's health care costs and it helps our national debt getting after the cost of care and when\nPeople say that the president has made moves to stop covering preexisting conditions what's the truth\nSo what the Democrats are running on nationwide\nIs is a portion and amendment when they went after trying to fix Obamacare that basically said if you have a pre existing condition you were

see when you're out and about shopping and it is a change that you may have offered to you at the register as you're doing your Christmas shopping and beyond\nA lot of small and mid sized businesses use the square out and square service to accept credit cards\nAnd so when you go into a store that except square and you're doing a larger purchase you may be offered enough\nYou were going to use borrowing for that purchase through square\nAnd the purchases that will be eligible will be purchases of two hundred and fifty dollars to ten thousand dollars if in fact emergent online or in a physical store is offering you in store financing is is referred to\nNow the interesting twist to it this is that if you're doing a larger purchase you don't want to put it on one of your regular credit cards you may be offered a zero percent rate or you could be offered a rate all the way up to the mid twenties\nBecause it'll be up to the retailer either online or in person whether they're going to subsidize your borrowing\nAnd paying them over time\nSo this is an option not one I really like for you to really get into but I Know this time of year\nHow many people are tempted by Ninety Days same as cash six months same as cash zero percent interest for a period of time or whatever in this case it will be fix monthly payments for three months to a year\nAnd square will be responsible for the loans just like any other store financing would be there'll be a third party and this is\nNot something I ever want you to green light to buy something that you likely really can't afford I mean when you're buying something for lifestyle\nAnd you're having to pay it off over time\nThat's not a good idea\nAnd just because all the retailers even small ones this year we're going to be offering the option of walking out the door with an item and not having to pay anything at that time you're creating another obligation\nI don't even really like these when they're at zero percent interest\n[laughter]\nWell it's certainly a great direction quote I Do appreciate it I really enjoy your show and I appreciate what you\nWill thank you very much and I hope you have a great day you're

how're you doing excellent yourself\nGood thank you you have something that it's getting really old in your life a home equity line right\nOr right down to zero for quite a while and it's coming from time to either get a new one or just trying to end this life answer the question I have is\nFrom the credit scores standpoint is he going to help me or hurt me to go hand in let's say I get another two hundred thousand dollar home equity loan but never use\n... is it a loan or a line 'cause the distinction where the difference is a line you can draw on basically with like a check so it's a line\nIn line and the interest rate floats so let's step away from the credit aspect for a second let me ask you this do you find that it's been a useful financial tool for you to know that that's available in a financial emergency of some kind\nIt is although I doubt that I ever need to use it except for maybe like use it to make some other investments that pay a whole lot higher interest rate so that would be the only reason I might want to use it\n'cause I liked the idea of home equity lines of credit is stand by in lieu of keeping money and things like simple savings accounts or anything like that if you have assets and you keep them invested\nAnd if you had a sudden the financial emergency\nHaving to sell investments could be at a bad time and that's where a home equity line of credit I think can be very useful is for people who carry very little or no debt in their lives a home equity line of credit can be a wonderful tool\nAs far as how would it affect your credit how long have you staying in the house here in\nUh we've been there twenty eight years all the time I got another victim\nOkay so you're not looking to get a new mortgage or anything like that I think having a home equity line of credit is a good idea as a strategic thing then in terms of your credit history of the home equity line you have will benefit you for years to come the fact that it's been there\nThe issue potentially is available credit\nAnd ratios in terms of use of available credit and that would put the argument towards you taking out the new ... new home equity line of credit but what will it cost you to originate that he lock that would replace it the one that's done\nThey said it's not going to cost think if it won't cost you anything I'd do it okay that's what I was thinking All right we'll best to you at Oh thanks cart thanks\nRebecca joins us on the Clark Howard show Rebecca how are you doing\nNow Clark and thank you Rebecca you're looking for new wheels\nWhere I'm now a warm I bought my alcohol actually model car it's a chick Avon Thirteen guy got it in September of two thousand twelve and we're going to keep it for five years\nMy kind of come and gone pretty quickly and I always get the urge for a new car I didn't even thousands ... falls on attack percentage object Carson and I'll start thinking and we pay for our callers ... ...\nI Need to be cutting down on a car and then once we write that check it's gone except for the car you know we have the car back I'm thinking now leasing might be an option for me\nSo I had when you bought that car back in twenty twelve ... am I hearing you right you just wrote a check for it you didn't take out alone\nNow we've got ...\nSo it's a lifestyle choice if you're in a position that you don't need a loan for a car and you light new wheels routinely\nThat's a circumstance particularly with luxury vehicles that it may make sense for you to lease instead of by because with the luxury makes they don't like to out now discount the vehicles because they're trying to maintain a cache of brand worth\nSo with all often do is they'll factory subsidize the lease and where'd you get the deal on the luxury vehicle is in a lease usually for three years they want to turn you into another vehicle in a three year window\nRight and so a book cause for you is not a dollars and cents question is more of lifestyle question we sing on many luxury makes would be the right decision\nWell from my question if I decided to go and clearly the next time I Want a new car to I found my car out right and they had them on because I'm not your ... your spark back on the price of the car not from not the monthly payment ... [laughter]\nRight so harder when you when you get the deal are involved in the trade in of your existing vehicle it really comes up the works at fogs it up and it's hard for you to know what you're really paying\nAs a cost of that ... and ... says are complicated anyway so if you keep the idea of trading in your car is a separate concern here's how I like you to do it do you happen to live in a part of the country that has ...\nYes if you go to ... when you're in the cycle of thinking you want to lease a vehicle climax we'll give you a guaranteed price they'll buy the vehicle from you for a week\nSo you go start negotiating on your lease for the one you'd like to lease\nAnd make the deal on what the least is going to be what you're going to have to pay up front or what your monthly will be on ...\nHow many miles you'll get under the allowance and all their particular price points with that lease and then and only then you say well I'm going to sell my old car to harm Macs what will you offer me for the car\nSo that you kept that completely separate out for it and yeah I Know that they've already got to offer from car max they've got a beat and you've kept beliefs as a whole

[noise]\nNicky with us on the Clark Howard show Hi Nikki how you doing\nAll right how are you great thanks for your dad's done something for you that you're trying to figure out if it's nicer not\nYeah yeah so when you're in the background I was going to check on my credit score during the ... credit report and I thought it was going to get a lot of credit\nFor it it seems like they're the the credit card though it was under the county was counting on my credit score so I wasn't sure if that meant I should get another credit card like for my cells to boost scores that one counted as my second one\nOkay great question so you're are you an authorized user or co owner of that account with your dad\nBelieve I Am an authorized user\nRight so it depends on the scoring model an hour a credit card company would report whether that authorized users status would be a particular note for you I assume your dad's a great player and that's just good stuff for you on the report or neutral one or the other\nBut yeah yeah but you're working you're out there doing your own thing now\nThan I Would much rather you get your own card another card and then I close the authorize user status with the card you've had with your debt\nProblem for me is a ... billion pay or\nYes if any if you are an authorized user and somebody doesn't pay it reflects negatively on you you don't have obligations of the debt but but the ... credit Ryan fouls up your credit and I don't want you paying it annual credit report any more for your credit score\nOkay instead I'd like you to sign up for an account at credit karma or credit sesame for both of them\nAnd you'll be able whenever you want to see what's going on with your credit to see a reasonable representation of your credit score every seven days for free if you want your able really to monitor what's going on with your credit\nOkay yeah so I think that that's the main credit sesame and credit karma Ari and a lot of people do both completely free for both of them ...\nSo and then once you figure out what your next card is going to be are you the kind of person who pays your balance in full every month\nOh yes I I wouldn't I wouldn't want to keep the\nRight then I Would like you to get a reward corners of some kind either\nAre there any uh any you use you would suggest\nYeah so if you are how much do you think you charge in a month\nAh hours how I'm old enough cells that are now are out there and I know the card the city double cash\nDouble cash will\nPay you two percent cash back on everything you do and the other alternative is if you're a customer fidelity investments get there two percent cash back card\nYeah city double cash flow look into that\nAll right and then once you get approved for that that's when you get yourself removed from the account with your dad make sure you get that card first best to you and\nI'm I'm Glad that your dad's a good player\nYou're listening to the Clark Howard show\n\nBut

validity to the minimum wage\nTo you that may not be a big route revelation but it's been a held opinion of mine for as far back as I can remember\n[noise] Josh joins us on the Clark Howard show hello Josh\nBy Mr Clark Terry you great thank you just plain old Clark is five [laughter] yes see what's going on Josh\nSo back in jail and Thirteen I play for a university football uh\nAnd during that first year or I received a back injury and\nOh I'm Sorry did it end you're playing career\nI was able to play for about two more years and then eventually I had to have surgery and then it ended so yesterday\nYuck what position did you play\nIt I think the guard\nTapas you can be because people are coming for ... every single down\nYes there but it's all worth it [laughter]\nSo I'll let you know and I'm a junior high when I decided I didn't like getting hit\nThat was the same position I played I paid it laid right off and serve guard\nI played on the left side so\nYou obviously were much better than I was that you played through high school and three years of college\nI tried my hardest those worship\nWell or so from that I'm gathering something looking back five years as a hassle now\nYes sir Yes sir I'm hearing recently and she doesn't Eighteen um I went to go and check my credit score on experience\nAnd before I even got to see the credit score I saw to charges that were unfamiliar for me uh again our feet I was on her full scholarship um I have a letter stating that I should've been covered for tuition books the whole spill\nFor the university should have been responsible for these medical charges that are from long ago\nYes okay\nYes it and so now I have called the ah credit corporation to see what steps I can take\n'em Dan so long ago and now the university has a whole new staff so that makes it quite difficult to communicate with them um and it seems to me that they of course kind of drug defeat a little and\nWhat I've gathered from the credit corporation is that um is even if I go ahead and just have this myself I'm it will mark the mark as paid them full for the next month but the damage to your credit score will ask for six years and eleven lots\nCIA and you're getting close to the end of that yes so\nUm as far as you paying a bill that was never your legal responsibility I Would recommend that you not pay\nOkay\nAnd not have any further contact with the collection agency odds are in almost every state in the country you're outside what some of the statute of limitations and you can't be sued against that\nThose unpaid medical bills and but it is an obligation university had and even with the turnover in personnel I Would suggest that you make a call to the head of the alumni association or and or the head of the booster club for the football team\nOkay you know 'cause the ones that are involved with the booster clubs they are intense\nAnd they are very influential on a college campus and where others or a avoiding responsibility for a bill that belong to the university people in the booster clubs may be able to get the university to do what they should have done originally and should have ... to it once notified by you\nKnow roasting okay\nBut otherwise if the university just blows you off it means that when they try to hit you up for alumni contributions or they don't get those for you right but is as far as the bill let the clock run cars so little time is left\nOkay All right so\nUp the the actual money that is owed even after that term is up and it goes away from my credit score does that money stay on my you\nKnow so I remember as far as being on your head if you will once the time period is passed to be able to sue against the debt basically it's just a reputational thing which is what it is now and then that reputational thing ends at the they said six years eleven months\nAnd I've never heard that is the exact time usually out here six years nine or seven but anyway it goes away\nIt doesn't mean that at some point or was it was a scavenger collector may ten Twenty years from now contact you about it but you have no obligation in any way shape or form or fashion and it can not be used in any way to harm your credit once the seven years his run\nInteresting okay\nSo you can rest pretty easy about this because the clock doesn't have much to Ron okay but if you want to try to get the bill paid\nHit the pressure points at the university okay and best to you as one fellow offensive guard to another one who was good at the game and one who was not namely me\nDon's with us on the Clark Howard show Hi dawn hey they're gone you have a question for me about credit let's see if I can be of help\nOkay so um I've got a good credit rating\nBut and and not paid off my credit card so I'm feeling great about that that that one credit card that's got a pretty large balance on it and I'm trying to find a maybe a credit card company that I can transfer that get\nFrom the higher one to maybe one with a zero eight PR start twelve to Eighteen nice\nI'm giving me time to pay it off the interest charges are astronomical\nSo there are fewer of those offers right now than there were a year ago and the reason is is that interest rates have risen\nAnd it's costing credit card companies more money if they extend zero percent to you\nSo what are you may find here or there is zero percent transfer but they act they often will ... interest in it within up front usually four percent of the of the balance you're transferring that they give you the twelve or Eighteen months interest free\nRight yeah I've seen that and I'm willing to do that so that I can transfer the balance I think that that's just not a good idea\nAnd no no that's a fine idea if you think you can kill off the balance in a year and a half if that's the offer then yes go for it because right now you're looking at an interest rate\nMid teens yeah\nYou know so if you take something from somewhere in the mid teens and you take it down to you pay the upfront I so I don't know what the actual and Putin interest rate would be but obviously a lot less than paying Fifteen Seventeen Eighteen percent\nI Would go for it as long as you down or certain you'll be able to wipe it out in the interest free period because the problem is after that period the rates tend to boomerang really high on those zero percent offers\nYeah I'm confident that I can do that but um I don't know where a lot I see ads for things all over the place so I don't know you know watch on it what's not\nWell do you have a credit sesame or credit ... are both dashboard set up\nI don't set up both of those and based on your credit profile\nAnd you'll be able to see what might be there for a zero percent balance transfer perfect and also if you are you a member of any credit union\nI Am not\nReady to say I was gonna say sometimes credit unions will offer such an effectively lower rate on a credit card that it works kind of like doing a balance transfer cause you drop it from a mid double digit ... teams down to single digit rate\nYeah I looked at that I looked at that I just didn't you know just put so many options out there you can get ... sometimes\n... ... ... that's ... that sounds great\nProbably best to you and I wish you the best getting rid of that debt\nAt Walmart quest oh okay kind of has to\nDo it that I'm spending my son to college next year and I've been told that there are millions of dollars and then you scholarship for students entering school again that a lot of research

[noise] um [noise] you know we have three hundred and Fifteen cayenne retirement already and [noise]\nBut I Would have to take out two hundred twenty five K. and non retirement investments in order to be able to afford a house up there in San Diego so [noise] you know I don't want everything in the stock market us I don't want everything in one house especially if I'm only going to leave their short time and I wanted to know your advice\n[noise]\nUm I don't have a problem with the not wanting everything in the stock market I Would not long distance landlord in order to accomplish my goals though so you're talking about keeping the homeless by foreign Pensacola when you moved to San Diego is that what you're telling me\nYou know sort of a we have it on the market I I Am going to cash out of this now suddenly they're going to die out while they sell for a a little ... about three fifty\nOkay in a you're not going to be able to buy anything in San Diego for three fifty\nAlone not unless I catch up on retirement investments uh you know at two twenty five ... and now I can afford something up there\nLike I Want to you have in non retirement is that all you've got\nTo twenty five K. non retirement so you're talking about a half million dollar house then yes or what's your household income or about one eighty okay\nThe reason we tell folks to not buy in the military in most cases is because you're not in the home long enough for it to appreciate enough\nTo sell it and make a profit and also sometimes some military markets have an oversupply of homes on the market they're hard to resell\nSo you get stuck in it and you lose money on it in some markets in Pensacola would not be one of those markets usually and certainly San Diego would not be one of those market you're going to see incredible appreciation and incredible market activity in both of those markets you should so\nSo you should be able to get out of this and make a profit on the one you bought there and that's what it sounds like you're doing\nAnd you should be able to do the same in San Diego and I do agree real estate prices are up substantially um I'm not sure that you have to use all of that I Would probably if I were in your shoes what would I Do if I woke up in your shoes\nOr I Would either a rent or be I Would pay cash for whatever I bought in San Diego\nAnd that would mean one of two things that neither one of which are going to be comfortable one is I'm not going to I'm not going to spend as much as you're talking about spending instead of been spending five hundred maybe four hundred and leave a hundred and non retirement um or I'm I'm just going to get comfortable in order to have a house like that\nWith having no non retirement investing until I re sell this house now\nIf he re sell this house let's say you bought it for five Seventy five or five fifty use up all your cash or non retirement cash and money from this other home and it goes up to seven hundred and when your salad you're probably next move moving to a cheaper market\nThere's not many more expensive markets for you to move to in the military\nThan San Diego that's about the ... I mean Hawaii Hawaii maybe okay by a there's a couple of other main there's one or two but most of the markets would be well most markets in general not just naval markets but markets in general would be cheaper in the San Diego I think we all agree to that\nSo if you make some money and you're there are three years\nYou're going to put money back in on retirement investing in by a less expensive home maybe a larger home but less expensive home the next\nJason how are you how you doing better than I deserve what's up\nI I own my own business and I'm not trying to figure out how not to be a crime and under or ... years old but ... retirement should I go or oh\nOkay well you know how how do I start or retirement like that\nOr do you ... well the first thing we teach folks to do is to get out of debt and have an emergency fund before you start retirement and the reason is because if you don't have any payment you have more money\nFor you up to put into retirement and then we want you to put five Fifteen Percent of your income into retirement Jason what do you make a year\nA band around a lot of average probably right about a thousand only\nOkay so somewhere around fifty grand a year okay the affair and how old are you I'm thirty four and okay good do you have any debt no effect good for you or you're single okay okay does your wife work outside the home\nThe idea that nurse machine make a right about that and get all kinds of All right so you've got about a hundred and twenty thousand dollar household income and no data\nAnd you're thirty four years old well done well we want to have an emergency fund of three to six months of expenses that grandma's rainy day fund\nAnd then we would tell you to put Fifteen Percent\nOf your household income into retirement and that's going to be about Eighteen thousand dollars a year in your case going into retirement and now you're asking how to fund that if if she as a nurse has a thorough three or four one K. available at our hospital or a doctor's office\nYou would put some money there especially if there's a match and then you both need to do a Ross IRA you can do five thousand five hundred each that's eleven thousand dollars of the Eighteen that we need to be putting in right there\nAnd put that in good growth stock mutual funds and Jason to help you set that up and teach you how it works just because you need to

I Would just rather ... at least this was the mindset was that I Would rather have him there and uh we get some tax benefit from the house so I assume\nThat the hundred and thirty six dollars a month that we're losing our actually getting back at the end of the year to at least break even or maybe still make some money on on the home\nAnd stay home or even I'm All right so you got this is that her house or your house like about its person says her brother living there\nCorrect okay if you didn't own that how she wouldn't go buy that house and called tax benefits and subsidizing brother a good plan\nYeah we're actually ups in down in the house she bought it for two ten Kelly worth about one Seventy one eighty\nOkay well we're probably hold it and break even that we can get it come on up in value what's your household income\nOf between the two of the about one between one eighty and two hundred and tell us your question is what to pay off first or what\nOkay a shower you know I'm Sorry ... show you how old I said anything you told me that I'm sure now and you stayed there because of a scholarship the affair to nursing school\nYes sir it's a it's been a steak I graduated here like parents needed to get the job opportunity\nOkay so the scholarship is partial Yes sir how much of a scholarship that you get\nFat twenty thousand every four years that it wasn't a large life\nTwenty over four years and it's a four year program I take it they're dying and what does it cost it costs ... nearly okay of which you have five\nKids are so we need eight yes our plus you need to eat yeah there's that detail right where are you living with friends family what\nI'm living with frankly a split a house out in the country because it's cheaper you\nAnd some friends were roommates okay and so you have rent\nAnd electricity or share and you have food and you need to get out and you need eight thousand dollars a year\nThere okay\nShow when we add all of that up what does your rent and other stuff cost you a month\nIt cost me about nine hundred thousand looking around like that and I work\nMinimum wage and I do things like clean needles holidays and things like that trying to make a little bit of extra money\nMhm okay All right so let's let's kind of had that up then I get about twelve thousand dollars a year for that and I need a thousand dollars a year for ... for tuition and some other are probably some books and stuff too but we're pretty close their show twenty thousand dollars a year as what you need to earn\nIt there and minimum wage doesn't do that they left their sounds like you need a new job\n[noise] and I have an opportunity to start a whole failing family name brand clothing and and now I don't have the money to put up right now\nNo they don't need to get into that you have a job you need a job you need to show you can make more you can make 'em Fifteen twenty dollars an hour babysitting and managing you can make\nGood money cleaning houses Fifteen dollars an hour ten dollars an hour cleaning houses I'm walking dogs or other stuff\nSo I I think we need to get your doing something along those lines and the other benefit of those are not only do you make a lot more than minimum wage and by the way you make enough to work your way through with the numbers that you and I are discussing here I'm\nIn um you are going to be working all the time though and if you but if you can get a situation like that the semi self employed where you're cleaning some houses you're doing some nanny and you're doing some whatever um and you\nUh uh\nCan control your time and you can make more money you can control when you work\nAnd how much you work now you are going to struggle\nBecause you're going to work and study and go clash\nIf you do that the other thing I Would do is I Would apply for a bunch of scholarships to the third thing I Would do is investigate some of the hospital companies that are out there particularly in your immediate area talk to the nursing school\nAnd see if there are any of them that if you agree to work for them for a couple of years after school how much of the nursing they would pick up for you\nKind of an endangered servant type program if you've ever heard of those\nAnd I married a hospital that actually planning on working at ... ... they were fair game on my mind and body\nWell let's see if we can get a job over there now and let them just pay for it now\nOkay rather than have to pay you back for student loans\nBecause I'm trying to keep you out of student loans with the math were you in are doing here so I Want you to apply for a hundred more scholarships you'll get turned down for most of them but if you get another five thousand it really helps the situation a lot I Want you to think about doing different things for work that make you a lot more money and you can control the time\nAnd I want you to investigate with this hospital or what they will do and talk to the nursing school about ... anything they can do to help you as well that you're working your way through but\nYou you sound like you are\nTo me just talking to you you're you're very very mature for Seventeen years old that sounds to me like you're a rock star thinking and so I don't think you need to play beer pong his real\nHot [laughter]\nI I think you don't mind working in and grinding and hustling grind to get your way through this and not come out of this with you know forty fifty ten thousand twenty thousand dollars of student loan that you don't need to it\nBut you're going to have to make some very distinct and very careful choices to do this and the good news is you're living expenses are very reasonable and your tuition is very reasonable and the third piece of good news is you've chosen a fabulous career\nIn terms of employment you will be able to get employed instantaneously\nUm I mean nursing is just there's always a shortage\nSo you're going to do very very well but I Would go talk to that go talk to that hospital administrator at that local hospital just set up an appointment with them and just walk in there like you own the place there's a kind of I think you can do that\nAnd uh just tell them that they need to pay for your school and then you'll promise to work there how's that work\nAnd how can you help me get through school because I don't want a bunch of student loan debt I'm trying to not be a statistic and you know get get him impressed with you and and let him help you be a hero in your story and a him or her that hospital administrator\n... by the white needs nurses so they're going to be very intentioned\nA very very inclined towards helping someone in your position especially someone who walks in and ask for help and walks in and says what can I Do to earn some help and so on and um you know get get some people on your side helping you accomplish this um\nThis task that's in front of you but you're on your way you're doing really good

they're at the highest risk and no matter where you are and your baby steps it's a necessity\nNot a choice this includes working husbands and wives as well as stay at home parents it's pretty

and how old are you guys we are forty six okay and how much is in retirement\nI'm a little over a million ... your head congratulations ... ... what's your household income definitely feel that way but yeah we we are I mean when you have more than a million dollars you're a millionaire yeah okay yeah you're right [laughter] yeah [laughter] yeah so ... what is your household income\nA little over two hundred okay so\nWhy can you say Fifteen Percent of two hundred and still catch up and get plenty of money for college when you've got eight years before college\nWe're paying for private school right now as well\nWhat are you paying for brown to how much cash how much twenty thousand a year per kid or total turtle okay you make two fifty but we're looking at you like it you don't have like two hundred I mean one eighty okay\nAnd if you can cash flow twenty thousand a year for private school that's ... ... that cash flow can return towards cash flow in college too if they choose a college it's reasonably expensive\nYeah OK okay that's a good point I yes nine so I I\nYou know Fifteen Percent of your household income going into retirement\nYou don't need it you're in good shape I agree with you if you want to stop it's not the end of the moral\nBut I don't think your house to stop if you'll just sit down and actually do a written budget on a two hundred thousand dollar your income twenty thousand out for kids to school today we're going to offset some of that was cash flow in some college but some college we want to set aside\nAnd put Fifteen Percent of ... side so we're talking about thirty thousand dollars that's fifty thousand bucks going into these two things\nCollege in return I mean I'm Sorry a private school in retirement and then we got to say something to college you say ten grand a year per kid another twenty grand you can do that\nA front for from now until I go to school they'll have plenty of money\nI mean you just Jack up to five twenty nine and pick out good mutual funds that you control and saw that five twenty nine get or the one that's more of us are pros and they'll help you do that click smart ... de Ramsey dot com for a list of them in your area the people we recommend them sit down when you help people that five twenty nine together\nAnd pop ten grand a piece in those two I don't think you have to cut retirement back but if you're putting more than Fifteen Percent into retirement than you're not working our plan at this stage\nCollege and it was done and houses paid off only when those two things are done and then you're a baby step seven to increase returned wrote me on Fifteen Percent\nAnd Fifteen Percent or two hundred thousand started ground\nSo that that's how I'm doing the math here I think you can do it I think you just gotta sit down and not have this vague worry about it\nAnd instead of having an actual game plan ... lay out and go this was important this is more important than other things that we're doing that we need to stop doing show that we can do this and that's ten grand a year per kid for college\nTo kids that's twenty grand if that's what I mean you've got is where you are so good questions

okay with us I I think in the SEC you got to be you got to be prepared for almost any and everything and and what their schedule and I think uh you know it's it's hard news group a little bit uh now you know\nI mean we're in a bi weaken coming off of our we've got to go to Missouri uh for one more road game and and there'll be a great test for ... so you don't mean I'm excited about you know what it looks like for for this team on the back into the schedule\nAnd ups and downs certainly a very close call against one of the top teams in the country against Notre Dame you you put it back together this weekend you you play well against Kentucky I'm your two games away to enjoy it from a ball game and I know you've been there but uh that's where you want to and and the seasons don't you\nOh absolutely I mean the the that's not lost on this football team that's not lost on us but you know we're we're not their football team right now we're we're a challenge is will ball team you know every day to be better or we talk about\nThe ability to compete every day and then when it's all said and done you're going to perform so with that being said uh you know it's one day at a time when we could have gone mentality for the football team right now\nYou look at you look back and I I imagine you will during during this by week uh and as you begin to reflection or all coaches do uh where where where is this season going right where where can you correct things uh for the stretch\nIt started out the right way um you know and it it has the last two years I think you know meant for us a

happen um\nYou know for us the margin for error ... is is a little smaller so we're just trying to shrink by playing better by being better and again it was good when for us heading into by a week and now when we get a chance to do is ask and prepare for most of\nThe way comes late but it it comes nevertheless how do you plan to use it\nOr you don't win for us right now\nAh today was like a Tuesday

about a you know sixty five Seventy men and practice and so\nUh that's that's how I was going to be done for this staff\nAnd now we're going to get away for a little bit um and then do a little recruiting cause any SEC you have to recruit\n[noise] I Would like to ask you are not to turn you into an analyst but you are pretty good one I've worked with you before um we've got some some monster games coming up during your die wake up the game and batteries but we've been spending a lot of time talking about Georgia heading to Lexington you were there the other day or give us a scouting report on the cats\nYou know I I tell you what coastal has done a terrific job of of of being able to build that team around\nYou know been he's now a man that defense you know Josh Allen is extremely talented on the back and they they've they've got you know uh you know\nSafety and corner in Bay and there were two can make plays those guys those guys play fast and physical or they know how to make some things happen and they can cover so when you look at the Kentucky football team you know many people may not\nYou know believe that there are a good football team into your plan okay the physical or they may not be the sexiest bunch you know to to to look at all the time but let me tell you something a mark students football team is going to be cynical as all get out and they know where they are\nOn the other side George are you familiar with them as well are they they've had some I mean for a team that's in the top six in the country they've had some issues to share but now they're starting to get it together and with Jake from finding his rhythm\nPromised talented I Know man they've got from an fields um and we when we saw from a little bit of feels\nBut you know so some of the weapons\nNever never but it is I'm comfortable with just didn't I hear you you have any of these\nI've done I did not you know you seem like just a normal guy I Know it's not normal ... I don't know something normal but I I certainly don't need anything to fidget with 'cause if I put an end in front of me I'm spending at the whole time I know I I Would I Would play with it I really I mean is that right now is she right in there yeah there now is\nLike you know it's like who's us like American\nIt out when I used to go like this like I was playing the piano no more than what it is you're describing mark as far as you're on the radio like your\nPhone like weighs twenty pounds yeah what's in this thing is a big man from St Louis I got I I\nI mean you shouldn't be I was hearing things like this but compare my phone earphone that's about right spot right pleasure from like so much so I mean is that like phone or what\nIt is it is I got what your life I got the uh the light\nVersion that you you you have to pass okay so there are graduates had again the biggest week of the year or something about phone late spring\nNever led [laughter] let's talk about I Love it Kentucky in Georgia and how you got to this point\nAh we got to this point we were I was talking earlier with a couple\nOf guys in the in the office Kentucky has been consistently plant ugly football games and winning and this is the way that they want\nTo make the game it was a it was a\nObvious situation in Missouri that they Missouri looked like they were going to jump out when the game by Twenty one twenty eight points for touchdowns\nAnd Kentucky went back to the old Kentucky way right that we've seen since the beginning of the season the only really dominant performers Kentucky has had was Florida which is which is shocking but at the same time\nIt is ... I'm sure you've been in games like this where you look at a team you're you're playing them and you're standing yourself\nAt some point is going to break open and we'll be about two thirds down three touchdowns at some point we'll make a play at some point the defense will make a play they alternate football tear Wilson is not a great powers to heal towards the end the steps in and then you're sitting there in the fourth quarter with two minutes left\nYou only have three\n... you know what I'm saying so I I think that's what Kentucky has been the one the team's almost as if they lowly people to sleep all for the entire game just enough to have an opportunity to win the game and the fourth quarter and plus they play a really good defense they which has been thought were ...\nShorten the game because they run the ball so much so there's less naps where they're\nSo right now as far as talent level is concerned and the SEC they're not up there with the Alabama Georgia as the LSU ... they're not\nFrom a talent level uh but that talent has a tendency to distance himself the more snaps of often that you play so when you look at Georgia Tech they want their defense on the field fifty times again why do you think and that's been good on defense this year because they've been on the field fifty to snap the game Kentucky is a very similar\nBy playing as Peter snatch defensively as humanly possible I'll be totally honest with you Paul I did not like they're matchup against Missouri I thought they lose it out they lose not convincingly about they lose soundly\nI don't hate their matchup against Georgia at all I actually liked their match against Georgia more so than I liked it against Missouri because Missouri as a team\nThat can be chewed through the air and can connect on some big plays and can play with temple and can rack up a ton of snaps against that deep into does have quality starting eleven talent but maybe doesn't have the debt that some of the teams in the SEC might have but Georgia is a little different animal Georgia's susceptible to the game\nOr they're not great against the run defensively\nAnd ah they're a team that that is going to try to hang in there had on the ground so I I don't hate the matchup for Kentucky this week even more so than I did last week\nAnd we talked about Paul Saturday which conflicting style would take over the game right and and you look at you can look at this that and you look at the at the final\nAt the end of the day Missouri on the score fourteen points right by we can talk about it being Fifteen fourteen and the controversial passing the fears and the game being one on the last second if you told Kentucky that they were gonna hold Missouri to fourteen points everybody every expert animal is what is the Kentucky is going to win a football game\nAnd that's exactly what they did but like I go back to my first point they play the game on their terms and\nWe've seen him do it seven times this year where they play the game on their terms and even in the last ... feel against a and them it took over time right so at some point\nAnd I and I would think that is Georgia and Caribbean away that those guys prepare at some point somebody's gonna have to say this is a good football team that were playing against and we're gonna have to play lights out to beat him because Kentucky has found a way to win seven games this year and everybody's still talk about well\nYou know eventually it somebody will take advantage of\nSo we're we're ah we're ten minutes into the segment haven't talked about the game of the year and the SEC so how will the west be won\nThe west will be one if LSU can turn over to a table and which is not happen at all and if they can have officer production here's the problem when you play Alabama oh Paul we there's seemingly narrative that Alabama has taken a step back defensively right\nYou you do suffer a little bit when you have a really good officers because most of the time of the psychology of a player is\nWe can take chances because our officers going to school or eighty five percent of the time they had a football so everybody is that's kind of been a narrative that's been built in about LSU having a shot LSU up until this point and show me anything\nOutside of Georgia game that they have an explosive all fence enough to beat Alabama\nNow would that being said this will be the best defense that Alabama's face and I know we've talked about how great dolphins is the receivers and all of that there'll be match ups in this game that will be vitally important one that I have my eyes on how many times will judge Judy be lined up we greedy Williams\nHow involved were bred they'll be in defending the past and coming down into the box and stopping Iran\nAnd and so there are there are some narratives in some scenarios in this game where you could see it being a closed in the full court if things work out for el issue in that way but based on everything we've seen up until this point there is nobody calls to Alabama for four quarters in college football\nI don't see how you being a really don't LSU doesn't have the firepower offensively nothing that I've seen from LSU makes me think they can score forty forty five fifty points again now I Know they scored thirty six against Georgia, Georgia was mine is for that\nA situation where Alabama turns the ball over that many times they're too good at protecting the football now I Love the personnel the LSU has on defense and they're going to play a lot of man coverage demand\nCoverage has been hurt by this wide receiver core because the match ups are just too difficult to try to determine greedy William six three\nTwo hundred pounds really long great against big receivers you put them against the guy like Jay Jay Leno auto who's five eleven one eighty and can run for three four ... low for three that's a tough matchup for greedy Williams so uh I like this defense better than any defense in Alabama seemed to this point but I the only way to beat Alabama\nIs to have an office to can match them blow for blow and there's only a couple of fences and college football that I can envision doing that one is Oklahoma\nWho if they played Alabama it would be attract me it might be sixty six fifty two or sixty six sixty it could be that\nIt really could another as Clemson with the way they're playing on the deep south to the football they can rushed the passer and Trevor Lawrence and then often she continues to grow but those are the only two right now that I'm genuinely think can score with Alabama without making the pivotal mistake that every team has a tendency to\nMay I just I look I Will say this you put this whole record I Will be shocked if Alabama school was forty five points\nIt'll shocked me in this game if LSU defense with the crowded a valley Saturday Night and to a plan in this environment they just ... ... if they do fall just like let's cancel all the rest of the game and go ahead and finish the college football season\nI look at Oklahoma Oklahoma is not sustainable Oklahoma has him play defense they gave a fifty points the Georgia last year on the ground now you face on a team that can run as well and throw the football I don't think it would be close\nThis will be the toughest game Alabama plays probably all season until they played Clinton we don't talk about Alabama is running very much we don't\nKnow much more [laughter] because they've always had the running man they've always had the running game so it's somewhat overlooked\nUh Alabama when you look at their running back some into three headed monster that they've become ... Harris spin quite good Damien Harris is steady as any running back is there is in college football and the guy is just completely overlooked completely under appreciated\nAnd it's just an absolute or course then you have Josh Jacobs who's the toughest match it puts a three the guys as good at wide receivers eased a running back\nSo they put him in a fallback position next thing you know he's running man demand routes against linebackers and you can't cover the guy because he is as good\nAs Julian Edelman out of the ... like in that type of office of attack that makes it an an absolute handful and then you have urban Smith who don't qualify as a running back so to speak but he lines up in that backfield from time to time they move him around he's a matchup nightmare\nIBM announced late yesterday it'll by software from red hat the cloud computing deal worth thirty three billion dollars that's IBM's biggest ever acquisition that's your money now\nOn air on your life news talk Ninety four point one\nWhere you are with information and conversation twenty four seven [noise]\nLong\nHave you back certainly good to have everyone on board on this Monday afternoon Darryl is up next year oh good afternoon [noise] ...\nAre doing great Darryl thank you\nOh you're going to Jacksonville\nA really fun ... that's a lot of it now for four years in a row but that's pretty amazing scene\nI don't know what mark spare just say that I definitely agree with him over um although I Believe it or LSU\nEven habits yet the ball game you got to be you know the next year will be better ... yeah it took him on the ground that's the only chance they're going to have a V. chip I started his own legal ... part ... you better be one thing about Hawaii quarterback Ginny ... All right\nThank you know always happy and all we all we did talk Bob sticks that just like all about all the regime never saw any when they never can adversely punch\nNever then you've got to you know you've got to get an rattled as it went by no Concord Becky what's it rattled\nEven without yet but I'm now which they should be a great game but atmosphere started I meant no matter whether or not a lot I\nAbout that what Congress has that I mean this is like a punch a on at the vigil championship but it is coming up as well you\nKnow it's amazing\nIt is that my I was saying what but anything about it in Alabama though they don't want to play the top in\nGeorgia play I could have talked about the same attitude and blow it up they should have no problem at all but you better off with that but it was about what they are there\nAny like all of it I mean there is no doubt or you've got more talent but you got to go there and you got to like this sort of like there's\nIn this day and it gets to the editor at what you think\nYeah I was really I was really impressed I thought the ... election and the goal I was terrible but uh Georgia was going\nOn at the pet complain about that a play called and they complain city should have been built in ... like I said well then it you know what I disagree because\nSometimes we can and I got to get credit okay and do what is that there is a joke and it wasn't a play called who had to buy a car and I kept getting pushed by\nLike push back with all the\nTime yeah but when it happened I mean it's like the old\nLine about Einstein ah [laughter] I mean come on some point you've got to you you have to adjust\nBail you you don't well I wouldn't call we got to freshmen office was alive and supporters of them up to ... you know we can

E. C. championship then that should be left to cut our ticket to get it to the SEC game okay to the national at least at least to the playoffs\nWell so ... well let me make sure I understand you're saying Georgia wins out ... will they go to the playoffs yes of course they well yeah I think if you're a hundred percent currently has no one's talking about that well I tell\nYou what's your money to talk about why whistle we'll see the rankings tomorrow night George Will probably be about six there is no reason right now to start saying George is going to the playoffs when you have the best team in the country ahead of them\nOkay I'll tell you this right here with my prediction\nLSU is going to be that we're getting just lost my shoe okay to a Jack of\nLA if you were going to the Alabama this week in okay we will play LA issue is that it in the ... the championship game it just like last how we'd be Albert we'll be at least in our ... where are you guys\nAre getting all this uh interesting from Cuba is on what\nBasis do being a true George Bush adults\nAnd I thought that's what it was a while I was confused early that we are going to have an objective conversation a Adam is in Louisville Adam good afternoon\nHey how are you All right well thank you good I just have two little of thoughts for you the first one I tried to call last week but your typical man to get a hold of [laughter] well thank you for getting\nWell um ... Alabama is a great promoting and anybody who thinks that they're getting all these breaks and stuff or you know they're just crazy because they're winning about so much if you want to beat Alabama for crew better\nBut Alabama would have to be paying off the players from other schools to beat him by fifty points a game it's not like they're winning by a bar in the game\nBut my my main point is I'm just so proud of Kentucky I really am [laughter] we keep doing things that are Kentucky football is not down in forty years and we are the the team that has found ways to lose games I remember ah the marching band going down one\nSide of the field by the LSU prior with corn bringing touched down [laughter] so we finally got a break by the basketball\nGuards and there are things that Kentucky could be Georgia this week it doesn't matter Kentucky could be Georgia may be worn out of ten\nTimes this might be that one time now and I'm just so proud of important\nThing is uh Kentucky is it is in this position and it did take a a\nMinor miracles to make that happen but that's that's why this is so exciting is Kentucky had beaten Missouri twenty eight to nothing or which still be excited but a ... I mean they were down and out there there was no time left on the clock and\nAnd they they had another opportunity they took advantage of it and wasn't of the right call doesn't matter uh it was the question will call the space must be Frank it was easily a no call\nThe official made it Kentucky though that it didn't give a Kentucky the window Kentucky still had to do it again\n\nDarryl is up next a in Hilton Head good afternoon Daryl\nAnd Paul thanks for taking my call now and I'm proud to have to change my name to chips\nI think that's just saying I'm the but thank you\nMeans that you want to work it would be no I I did watch work within okay yeah that is absolutely true you are in the next you know cook [laughter] yeah thank you I think\nWhat you write an article uh would you do quite well I'm In the headlines and and I know you don't write the headlines much you start doing that let me let me know but the headline is is the is it twenty Eighteen Alabama team the tides greatest ever and that that's always a debate you go from is a you know if you're if you're Alabama's best team\nYou suddenly become one of the best teams ever so give us a the skinny on\nOn where this team is really without having pointed in the league team although that could change very quickly\nWell yeah absolutely and\nThat's the problem with trying to answer a question like this and I pointed out to my editors and they basically really didn't care you know they weren't worried right story anyway but that kind of made it fun uh okay granted\nHaven't played a very good defense but the numbers are\nA video game worthy and uh they are unlike anything that's ever happened in Alabama there unlike anything that's ever happened more important for an exciting team and that was the to me the delightful part of going in pursuing this story is\nA ... and gauging with about whether this was just you know how much of a philosophical change this has been on his part and and how much it drives him nuts\nI've been on that point ... you have to jump to conclusions because of what you said and what we know but\nBecause this is so different for next same and he's one of the great defense of mines\nThat we've never seen ah I'm really interested in your perspective knowing him as well as you do\nOn how comfortable he is especially with an off and it's like this and and the defense that it's probably really good although we don't we don't talk about going into this cauldron better known is tiger stadium Saturday Night where he's often very conservative and that and that match up\nWell he certainly has been but he has needed to be a this off it is not based on conservatism and the great debate that we're going to hear all week and and\nBegan hearing a certainly I began hearing it this morning is you know it has\nTo up in in a situation where a he's all on the road with a hostile crowd\nAnd be a you know obviously is as every school child in Alabama nosy I haven't played in the fourth quarter yet but I you know how's it going to react mail it to my memory the fact that he brought Alabama back from a Thirteen points deficit and the national championship\nGame you know it seems to answer any questions I were to ever be about enjoying refresher\nYou know\nDeath Valley people still think there is a and rightfully so that there is something different about being there when the game is tied in the fourth quarter so\nProbably the most intriguing part about Saturday Night\nYou know it's hard to decipher or understand better\nOver time on the national championship game but I I I certainly understand when everyone says about tiger say we both in there too many times argue\nIn terms of this team well let's go ahead and put a bunch of W's together for them because that's that helps frame this conversation if they do run the table a and continue in somewhat of a clip we know this just these numbers won't stay the same when they play teams like this or George or Kentucky your\nClemson Oklahoma vows say whoever it is a Michigan Notre Dame\nHow do you ultimately determine when when you're talking about the greatest ever because you've done that plenty of times and uh it's it's it's subjective but still well\nA fake you look at the margin of victory\nI I think you look or as I was just a degree of dominance or or is it the fact that you know a\nLong running back on Alabama has more is averaging ten carries a game\nThat's crazy I mean ... you know that that to me made me think of\nThe you know the height of the wish phone era when bear Bryant had a hundred and five players not eighty five and he was playing\nKnow four to six running backs again\nA but this is a you know they've got\nAt least for running backs better NFL worthy at least\nFor receivers probably five veteran I fell worthy of that is the ability to employ all of them and effectively and score this amount of points\nIf they can maintain that pace than yeah you're going to look at them as a\nWell what they'd be fourteen in oh Nick savings only had one undefeated team in Alabama so that immediately would elevate them and uh you'd have to think long and hard about them as as one of the best teams ever\nHappened in the pantheon of Alabama's greatest and we can talk about this\nWho who is in consideration\n\nOr who's in consideration well you get a pretty good how are you know it was sixty one chain gave up twenty five points all year ah that's\nPretty good uh sixty six team gave up forty four points all year but they didn't win the national championship radio so I guess that disqualifies amount that you know\nTo feed it of course\nUndefeated uh the Seventy nine team was undefeated and\nAnd never really uh well they weren't challenge here and there I take that back but but undefeated undefeated Ninety two team was one of the great defense as well time I'd put the Ninety two teams probably ahead of of Seventy nine ah\nAnd then you know savings teams\nNo man uh\nWhat was the ... the undefeated one so that was correct\nYeah so uh yeah I I Would probably go uh\nOh nine and then and then Ninety two and then probably sixty one\n\nOr the ... what do you think um you know I didn't see the sixty one team obviously the sixties [laughter] I didn't have it sixty six team\nIs the one you hear so much crying about Seventy nine team it was just happened to those who don't know they they want a game on a holding Penn State uh four straight times from the goal line that's it's hard to get out that's hard to look past I was\nSeventy eight that was a Seventy eight team\nWas it like it was in the I think it was in Seventy nine you're right yeah yeah I'm\nA and they lost the USC early in the year okay a but by the end of the year was\nJust um you know that's that's the\nOne hand I mean I ... I remember them but\nAh they they just didn't have that a defining bowl game I guess maybe that's what a\nYeah they beat Arkansas sugar bowl and ho hum\nYou know it was a loophole Arkansas team\nThat was yeah\n[noise] so I mean I Lived the everyday that Ninety two and that that team was just so\nInteresting or from the officer standpoint yes I mean it took a punk return to Louisiana Tech if I remember correctly\nYou know Jay Barker was a young raw quarterback and\nThey always had a a it was it last week was the title\nBack yeah you're you know it was a David Palmer team that they didn't need a whole lot on off its new but that you are now going on defense though so uh yeah\nI mean they had one game I think we're missing you said they were challenged in in the second half and uh yeah and it was just such an epic beat down of a previously undefeated Miami in going for a second birther and I can't remember what it was\nSay it it's the Nineteen uh\nI'm just kind of free associating you're just never seemed to me they were undefeated but that close call against Tennessee a job that I mean that that definitely stings you a little bit\nWell that's a fair point or you know I I I think\nI worry about Corby who is clubs in it and has been watching Alabama football for very long time and he said I Will of the last three Alabama teams you've played which one\nDid you think was the best and he said he thought the Fifteen team which was ... high granted a he thought that was the best\nSixteen team was really good to\nSixteenth have I thought was better than the fifth and I didn't I didn't I got closer to even reversed\nYeah yeah\nI mean what they went undefeated for all but one second season so\nLast year may have been his worst national championship\nThat's what a great maybe that's the next story right it was the worst Alabama national\nAnd not to keep the business going on like we're just two guys at the end of the bar but which we are\n[laughter] ah but but that eleven team defensively was just unbelievable the one that\nYeah they they were and a\n... and the fact and the the buildup of twelve team to repeat that pressure\nA ...\n[noise] and uh be having my butt right in front of the TV and she Arabs and my prediction goes\nAnd I'm just wondering um\nWhat you're a\nProduction is part you know in your heart so uh\nYeah I I Joe thanks for the call I haven't really made one yet I I tend not to early in the ... purpose is just a you want to do with whether it all played out I mean I I think if I had to guess what I'll do I'll\nProbably go with Alabama that's uh that's always a pretty wise pick 'em but\nI I understand where you're coming from I think I think this is a much shorter game but\nIn in listening to the experts and that's what I'll do all week because I'm just a talk show host a bit more say that Alabama is in better shape and I want to share a James's in Shreveport you may differ but he's on the air go right ahead\nA ball how you doing today quite well thank you James\nAnd uh I think the game's going to be a lot closer than everybody they they you know are they thinking if they'll mail bowl out but ah\nI've got a good day and they play good all year uh and and they vote of some things on a they're playing in the same uh Saturday Night and uh\nThey gotta they gotta lot of good things are going wrong then they don't get that a white back after the ...\nAnd you know I I I I've\nBeen to enough games ... there were we seen big upsets and usually what happens is a pretty familiar theme or\nThe other the home team will jump all over the visitors uh I watch the Alabama going to Williams rice stadium in two thousand and ten and got their their their heads taken off by a hot team\nAnd once you get into a position like that you start to have a hard time or you make mistakes you get under pressure you heard those wrong say a minute ago a tiger stadium creates a lot of stress it does\nAnd the and you know we have not really seeing a to a under stress yeah we saw him and the national championship game but that's one of those cases where I I don't think he had time to think about it he just got thrown in there and he was ready but to this is a little different uh and this is more hostile because\nHe won't have any fans there cheering for him\nThey are you going to have to ask for teams going against each other and a human gave for LA she's come and they're all you may have a gay or is that all mammals number one and a\nThousand dollars you can stay in there and uh they own the teams in the in the top for\nThank you very much a really good to hear from James uh interesting a call their Jamba\nIs in Raleigh a Jamba go right ahead a thank you for the call and good afternoon [noise]\n\nJamba out a house in his in Georgia hello how tight Paul how you doing we're doing great thank you very much\nI'm Glad to be talking to the greatest show again you've got the brightest producers well I've got to say about them dogs I've got a tale Lance I'm sitting here drinking some alumnae right now feeling pretty good\nBut ... are on the Georgia game I'll tell you what if George it can come out and they can make some big place if some turn it over I think we'll be okay okay I'm not going to really talk about that game I won't talk about Alabama LSU\nI listen to Greg McIlroy and I will tell you what I disagree with him a little bit\nLSU six back and tries to get in that zone to was going to pick them apart okay I really believe that what do you think about\nThat Paul I tend to agree with that I'm a I I'm just\nSaying what you have to do that too\nI mean you have to blessing look Alabama whether you if you if you're getting a zone with Alabama and you play ... they're going to still put ... the only you have got to take chances to try to put\nTo a on his back I'm not saying I'm not with is Darryl crowd I don't care about nobody gets hurt in any\nAny school okay us Georgia plans were not like that no matter what Daryl says and I support there well you know I like that he's a fan and all that but I Do not support that\nBut I'm going to tell you something if they see it if they just try to go back in that zone especially not having dead and white in there it's going to get ugly early because Alabama can do one thing that Georgia could not do to them\nAlabama can put pressure\nAll day long so I don't see too many points they'll let you get and I just don't buy the quarterback ... what do you think about that again get back quite a few times\nYeah it's a fair point it was a that is what the great part of a game like this is that you you have this conversation all and the strategy here is that there's some games you\nYou you just throwing stuff up in the air I mean there's this

only just while the portability of care health care the portability of health care if you're trying to change jobs people are concerned about their health and if there and whether or not they're going to be able to pay for it and how they're going to be able to pay for it so you really healthcare has been the number one issue of all the people at a picture\nLet's jump off there because it's not just\nAn affordability issue it's an availability issue and we are one of those regions in the state\nHave seen rural hospitals close how important is it for the legislature to address that\nSo I think it's the most important even though you're right I think there was just another announcement here in the last few another a a hospital closing in the state of Tennessee and I know that we're very very fortunate to have ... regional medical center right here I Do hear that there are things that if you look at how much money they're bringing in it might be on the line\nI don't have those numbers in front of me but what I Do know is that I think it's the most important for the legislation to address this issue and I think the first thing they have to look at is ...\nElection coverage brunch in part by ... tree service encouraging you to get out and vote\nTwenty Eighteen is flying by some of the holidays will be coming out\nIs the time to think about the new kitchen cabinets and counter tops to get your own holiday ready and ... has great deals on beautiful wooden cabinets and granite countertops right now\n... volume and passes the savings directly to hear your new catch it

remember the name are are the truck equipment C R D truck equipment ...\nA conversation with the information accurate [noise] news talk Matty for somebody to wanna\nPay M. sixteen hundred his hand on it\nUse of the candidates running in next Tuesday's election\nIn the district forty to race Democrat Terry Scott running against Republican Ryan Williams\nBrian Williams welcome to meet the candidates\nThank you Mr stone pleasure to talk to you again\nDo people view incumbents when it comes to stay\nBut uh the truth of the matter is is because we are representatives from our community a lot of times they don't see a much like they do in Washington and they ... as a part of their community that that average or typical disdain that that\nPeople seem to have for those elected up in Washington a doesn't seem to apply it seems to me like than in state government so uh we're we're neighbors you know we've got a kid ball games together as we said and bleachers together and\nGo to church together and we're we're in our community is more than we're outside of our communities to be on\nWhat is the biggest thing that you have learned in your time in Nashville that may be hard to make one but what would you say\nOh say that are being able to slow down and understand someone else's perspective is probably a a gift or a or a a an opportunity that most people miss I think before I got there I was\nYoung and then and just felt like that I kind of had the bull by the horns if you will and I've come to find out that a lot of times it's best to do more to listing but talking and so I think of the legislature it's really important that in particular when things are seem to be less civil and and more to visit today\nWhen you listen to your constituents in house district forty two what are they saying to you what do they want Nashville government to be\nBut I think it's really interesting most people I talked to say they don't want government in their lives say right I I Hope I never have to hear from you or I Hope I never have to talk to you about something but\nUh in most cases people just wanting to go about their regular lives and government not be a part of it but when they do\nA and unfortunately we all find ourselves in some form\nOr fashion having to deal with state government when they do they want it to be more customer driven much like you would uh your radio business or or any business that someone would walk in off the street where the customer is ah the focus of all the decisions that are ...\nDo you feel like the during your time that you have been able to make some parts of state government more that way\nYeah I think so you know I think one of the things that brings me most perhaps working there is when a constituent\nLike duck Jim Gray or or doctor bats and or or one of our other friends here in our community gets me a call and say hey I see this problem we really need to fix it or and so they to play an active part helping us rights legislation\nThat impact not in ... and ... and not just patients that are encouraged generations I think that's really important so uh as they say in government all a government as best as close to the people on the ideas or to changes all all start with the people I think are the result is always better\nA lot of different issues let's hit a couple more than ever the difference between rural Tennessee and urban Tennessee how do you try to represent the upper Cumberland from that perspective\nThat's a great question is of course you know I ... made more than anybody I served on the speakers task force for rural economic community development that for the governor as well so what we found that\nAll rural share something like a and that is the need for rural broadband you know it's it's one thing to bring jobs to community but it's that community can't access\nThe global marketplace it makes it much more difficult and so what we're trying to do is share with those urban colleague those challenges that are associated with that whether it's\nBroadband or whether it's access to some kind of mad at\nA mental health support you know we just don't have the same resources a large metropolitan area with a so being able if not to provide those to crate\nAvenues or or ways which we can provide those services either through tele medicine or or a technology that's afforded to us without broadband is simply wouldn't have\nIt seems as though the upper Cumberland has ... has been a leader in the state in terms of customizing our education system especially in high schools to give young people a chance to work on jobs that have a future here in this region is the legislature playing a part in that\nYeah I think they are I think uh you know the the experiment with dual dual credit or for institutions of higher learning being able to uh for every child to have a free one or two year institution to test the problem is I think\nOur certificate I think those things that add value in particularly to rules you know and what's happened is as you couple that with a work ethic that you have in rural is it allows us to lead the way when you look at\nThe top of jobs were starting to bring that are different than those if they asked the comes to mind it's a it's a great technology company that's come here found like a a place or a home where there\nAre hoping to be at three hundred and twenty five employees but are they all they do is rave about the quality of the work ethic of the student here and their ability willingness to learn it so I think all that starts at ... at the at the K. twelve system I think it does because we're teaching kids the importance of that and\nAnd giving them the access to that kind of education that they do they\nBrian Williams many concerned that there is a line that has been crossed with too much focus in education on testing where do you see that\nYeah I think there is a lot of focus on testing I think sometimes the state probably get yolk with a\nA a lot of the blame there that might not be ... so I think a lot of times though we we have so much performance testing or or there's this desire to see where we are whether students are progressing sometimes week a local school districts are have a tendency to maybe over test and that we blamed the state for that too\nBut I think the what we found is to go from forty eight forty six and science and math and then ... the in the middle what we're saying is it's working the problem is that we can't lose heart or\nOr fight as it relates to that we we we obviously have not arrived there and all this testing issues out there and the governor of recently address those member of the\nHouse of representatives and leadership to I've been able to address some of those\nAh we're not there yet uh and I think most of it has to do with the companies that are providing the testing not the actual pass themselves because with tea and ready we have every test question was developed and tested by tendency teachers in Tennessee classrooms and so that makes a big difference but we have to do is find a\nA reliable source provide this testing and so what you've seen the state is slow walk testing and allow only in high school electronic testing and didn't pay protests like we used to uh even when I was at school\nWe have taken some first steps to ensure better safety for school students in the state of Tennessee this is going to be an expensive process as\nIt is it really is going to be an expensive process you know when I talk to people in my community and on my colleagues talk to their communities are this is one of the things that are if not party driven one way or the other I think most people agree that we gotta do whatever's necessary to provide for say\nYou know the governor and uh in that a school task force on school safety week we tackled a little bit of it but that thirty five miss thirty five million dollars and recurring and not re occurring money that we set aside was immediately spent\nI think we can do more I've been working with my colleagues in order to find a way to fund an asshole row in every school through a grant reimbursed process which in which would be outside the BP which means both money's would have to be spent on and that's our oh", "year": "2018", "show_name": "no_show", "city": "Algood", "day": "29"}
