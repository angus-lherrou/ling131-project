there's a lady she used to be a she was on a Fox\nShe's a political commentator and a former congressional press secretary anyway she was evidently a after she was on Fox News it says in this article that she uh was contacted by that guy that\nStood out the bombs he used his middle name but what she did was he make threats towards her and she reported it to Twitter he had gone to a couple of her account and posted her a ... threat so she reported it to Twitter and a\nShow where he had gotten her picture and then set all this stuff to her and a Twitter she complained to them that she thought he was violent and\nDo nothing about it yeah they said it didn't rise to the level of uh like he was dangerous of abuse their views and uh evidently there were some outcry over it but ah anyway I Would look over at that if you\nWill jury I think I think the carrier earlier ... dirt and you said that there were some parks political analyze\nIt and yeah we've been hearing person that is yes I Believe she came at the same procedure she\nYeah she tweeted just a yesterday he said\nWell wait a minute she said hey quarter the guy that you are a that our reporter I guess what he's saying here is hey Twitter remember when I reported the guy who was making threats towards me\nAfter my parents on Fox News then you've got sent me the U.S response on how you didn't think it was serious well guess what the guy is than than the bomb he forgot and then the bombs to the high profile\nWell how would you how would you posted that yesterday but he just arrested him today she actually said it before the rest of them\nKnow it was six forty five that she posted that\nTo the ... so we ... this morning or worse than I Know it's not\nOkay I got you yeah I thought you said yesterday okay Well Jerry I hear you and I appreciate Jim Carey was on his earlier so keep your own these use you know\nI think yeah I appreciate that it's on top of that I mean really we keep your own for that\nAnd because she knew admitted to you were right you know what I mean [laughter] come on there's going to be some more reasons than that right the ... ... ... and I'm going to low carb diet to keep you have any joke with voice [laughter] okay everybody on\nThe editing nine four one package editing nine four one Seventy four seven Charles is in uh Massachusetts Charles what's going on I\nWrite I Am just a cry for hot I just wanted to ask her I I just feel I Will not vote straight conservative a ticket as much as you can in the state but as I told your screener earlier there's not a single Republican a representative and the state of Massachusetts\nIt's a ... there are a Democrat and I guess I'm just concerned that ah\nElizabeth Warren might pull it off I mean I don't know I mean I I Know that you interviewed a\nJeff deal I I just I just wanted to get your what your feelings on on on first of all I'm afraid that this uh situation with carry a cabin or you know people might forget it I don't forget it certainly and I think that day was and what ...\nWhat are what are your questions about deal and he seems to be I mean it sounds dumb but it seems to be the real deal I mean why not vote for him and he he sounds like he's the right guy if you want conservative a conservative in that seat I mean anybody to the right of of Elizabeth Warren would be better when\nWe were that that's what I'm gonna do it but I'm just wondering what what you are a assessment as well as so far as a whole as to how the election might come out this is a gas there I mean you you talked to a lot of people I just wanted to get some idea that people are concerned what little house it's going to go to the uh if the house goes\nThe wrong way and then I guess the uh uh people trying to carry on this investigation which has gone on for two years of the president right indefinitely and I just wanted to get your feeling on it as a as a host in a completely different part of the country\nWhat well I'll tell you what I've been saying and I and I really do think this is going to be two to four seats in a ... increase on the uh in the Senate I think the Republicans or conservatives will gain seats in the Senate\nUm I think that on the house it's a toss up I don't know what's gonna happen to my house I Hope that the the energy that the right God out of what happened with Kavanaugh will continue I Hope that the tax cuts that'll continue I Hope that jobs coming back that's going to continue it really look at the bottom line is this going to come out to turn out\nThe left is going to turn out they always do the right needs to turn out to make sure that we keep things going on with the going I think the lives with Warren is in trouble no she gonna lose I don't know but when it comes to the actual numbers house and Senate or the Senate is pretty firmly going to stay Republican I think that the house is still a toss up and could certainly go left if people ... don't go and vote\nHe like that that has to point I mean you've got a someone like a I Believe that someone or all the same general philosophy as or a or caught he'll cut ... in New York that is taking a seat for my uh uh I think it's the seventh district whatever I'll thank you very much\nI appreciate you think you are you got a lot of people who are saying that the Elizabeth Warren is up by a lot\nAnd I'm good I'm looking at the polling here I I Hope that Jeff deal still has a chance\nAnd perhaps we'll have a tutor on soon to talk about this ... is the guy who I turned to when it comes to what's happening in Boston in Massachusetts and even actually is very good great brain on him and he does he was a great show on under your kale Monday through friday noon or so we'll find out I mean he certainly will he thought it was promising that last we spoke\nBut I'm at this point I mean I'm looking at the spread and she's up by twenty five points to thirty six points in some of these polls\nI'm not sure how good these polls are uh the latest one is a plus twenty five and this is from UMass Lowell\nSo I'm not really sure what if anything can change their but still to me it looks like at least two seats will be gained in the Senate by the Republicans if not three or four it's eight eight nine four one packs editing nine four one Seventy two four seven Joe ... dot com coming right back [noise]\nOne

safe like Evans\nYou wonder what are they thinking how could they be doing this I mean you know you do have to say Devin has spent a he's raised ten point five million but it's really like you said it's the opponent who's who's putting in over seven million dollars\nThat's just it's unfathomable at least it was nowadays in California you're just seeing huge amounts of money coming in a Mayor Bloomberg decided today or yesterday that he was gonna dump millions in California and some key races this is the way he California's going these\nDays and two other congressmen who are not threatened even slightly\nThis is Adam Schiff and Brad Sherman it just has taught me you call everybody by their first name in California it's the way it's the hip thing to do okay Adam and Brad are safe but

some days\nAre they're much more so by that than they are worried about a cave ins are seismic activity and really you know people in LA they get kind of laws they about earthquakes and such but uh

their indirectly affected by the trade war and\nThere were large companies like Ford who now approximately twenty thousand employees that are going to be laid off because of increasing costs and

I was watching a historical presentation on native bbs or CSPAN\nAnd uh what was portrayed was that it was no less than Benjamin Franklin\nWho approached John Adams no less to uh make comment an apology was in and they for John could get on to apologizing or how they're he had spoken negatively about certain other members of the convention his wife\nA menu of and said that a famous line apparently that gentlemen don't read another man's letters to his wife\nWell who knows that may have been the the the origin nation to that it is a credited the Simpson thing in in general but of course the the important thing is is the notion that somehow that uh its own sporting a I guess in in times of rent a winning or potential war when in fact\nUh it's it it may not be quote sporting but this uh this is a is a serious business\n[noise] well I just\nWanted right I yeah\nI've got a but again in terms of the origin or perhaps so I I had not heard that particular story Lawrence but thank you for sharing a I Want to take a look at how you came across this story a Jason\n[noise] church so are you talking about surveillance and wiretapping and sort of American attitudes about all of that I'm In twenty twenty Thirteen I was reading about the Snowden leaks ah you know the Snowden story he revealed that the national Security Agency was gathering\nAh you know communications records of millions of sort of ordinary Americans to Mrs very surprising a lot of people surprising to me and I started to read about the NSA\nAnd history of being a sec when you read about the history of the NSA all roads lead to this guy a William F treatment Elizabeth Friedman husbands die he's considered to be the godfather you say\nIf you go to NSA headquarters at Fort Meade there's a large toward\nBeing by the way is it Marilyn directly between Baltimore and Washington but go ahead\nSo if you if you go to any say headquarters there um you know there's a bronze bus William Freedman had outside of the auditorium is named in his honor\nAnd so he's he's considered to be the man but in reading about William a who was a code breaker famous code breaker I started his wife Elizabeth was also could break you know that's interesting right how ... how many husband and wife or could raking teams can possibly be a and so I started looking for more information on was that\nUm and there wasn't really that much out there but I did find a link to a library in Virginia private library that that happened to have twenty two boxes of letters and other materials that she had left there before she died\nIn Nineteen eighty one day I just decided to drive down I Lived in Philadelphia\nSo drove down to the library and I I went inside and I said hello and ... I was curious about the Elizabeth Smith Friedman collection and and they were very friendly and they they brought out box one\nOf the twenty two ah boxes that Elizabeth said last night started reading her letters and I it was just one of these moments in in your career that you'll never forget because as soon as I started reading her her handwritten letters from a hundred years ago I was just\nA immediately taken with her and she's such a such a vivid kind of voice on the page and and the materials that library had where\nA or were the kinds of materials that any journalist and author would would walk to stumble across it was her original college diary was there it was you know love letters that she wrote to William early in their relationship\nSome of the letters were actually written in code\nThe letter of yours who else would do that right [laughter]\nRight yeah no I mean it's actually it's actually kind of a I mean it's lovely because we we tend to think of\nSecret right writing a secret message as as a way to\nUm as a way to hide things but for them it was a way to work [laughter] bring them closer together and uh I was just that the the texture these materials was was just a very cool to me and I and I realized after spending some time with them that there was an untold\nStory here that really needs to be cold and it was a story of you know this amazing hidden woman who was behind the developments of American intelligence and the twentieth century it's just kind of a genius who solved all kinds of problems and fix\nAll kinds of messages and you know the more I read the more I realized that she she's kind of like a jelly figure in American intelligence district she'd\nBeen able to I Want to come back and continue that thought as we will continue right after

her to actually get into the tradecraft\nIn a court of law that that's remarkable in today of course the minute anything like that came up a federal agent would would would walk in with some kind of a of a federal court order and would immediately shut down that testimony at least in part of a public trial\nI mean that the ... you know these are things that were at least they are things that that uh let me put it this way when I left the army\nUh I took an oath not to talk about certain things which I have not that many many decades later I was even forbidden to visit a\nA a an iron curtain

Wife spent some time at Fort Leavenworth Kansas behind bars and that is correct\nExactly exactly and and I and that's that was true then and it's true today but the fact the fact was at the time she had no choice she was she was asked asked to do this testimony by a federal prosecutors because the prosecutors needed to make cases\nAgainst some of these international crime rings um\nThat were killing people and network controlling the ... and so they they they wanted to get these guys in prison they wanted to take down the east coast and gets me only way to do that\nWas to actually try to

Florida power company according to police reports he sent them a warning saying it would be worse than September eleventh\nThey are also been making threats against high profile people in the media on his Twitter account mainly directed at CNN journalists\nEven which they are in custody investigators are stressing it does not mean the threat is over\nToday's arrest doesn't mean we're all out of the woods there may be other packages and transit now\nIn plantation Florida Natasha ... reporting\nAnd so we would like your thoughts about what we know and of course that would have to include some of what we do not know July\nSays are say are the main sources say was arrested the\nHas an arrest record that goes back to include an awful lot of the previous activities and or a man who were clearly is quite troubled\nHe was a we're told initially somewhat cooperative after his arrest telling investigators the pipe bombs wouldn't have hurt anyone and then he didn't want to hurt anyone that's according to law enforcement official he has now retained a lawyer and his questioning for the moment has ended\nFive of these Thirteen packages mailed\nWere sent through a U.S postal service processing center in ... Florida according to the criminal complaint is involved here as recently as ...\nGood evening again you know it is ... for this I thought I was a fake this trial you know the rally faith alive here take a lot of\nDirect care I don't know why they out there with the street here in Florida an angle when we had earlier election there's no civility here and there was no way before we start going on\nThe news broke that this is going on for lack of ... you know a ... if you thought that navy the new t._v. or if it if it if they come down here fought off a little fast\nBe interesting if anybody else out throughout the early ... election I think there are early voting places but I tell you it it's pretty nasty here\nBut when you say when you say pretty nasty there are some that you are you're talking about an actual polling places that right\nAfter seven years you know you've got one side on one side and the other side and then the other side and you know one side trading at the other\nAnd talking about people who are effective lever although at a rather childish way campaigning at a polling sites most states have laws against actively campaigning within so many feet of a polling side\nIt was it's not only screaming at the other people that they were like yeah\nBut it was it with a different party at the different parties were actually at one that's out there and in some cases is the party for at one another so even when they heard this is what's going on\nIt's I think kids decide hey there and it'd be interesting is for the caffeine and other places besides Florida I'd like to know because that's the way it was here\nYeah well again ah I ah [noise]\nAre you in other words you have in in in Florida formal polling place was established in many other states you may vote absentee or you may go to let's say the uh\nThe office of a voter registration let's say and cast a ballot but I I don't think a lot of places that you actually have have a normal polling places like\nFire houses in in schools that are are are are opened up in this regard I Know that really because of course it's it's very hard to to protest outside of a of a mailbox you send in an absentee ballot or or or a protest in the offices of let's say a a county uh\nUh the county office building so these are actual polling places huh well\nYeah well like what they call it is early ... are they going to focus his early election\nBut then after a certain state they have to go for their kids to have this ... thing to do any of course you can see the apple two thousand but you were just I Would say that one this\nStory broke get of course I was there not knowing that that they see a path is that for a full either aired at thirtieth warning that wasn't that I feel like a fall out later that afternoon and said that if it is the Kurds\nOf that I'm a stay at the same on the Philly for some it's not war\nWell it is it is very unfortunate I was wondering do you have anything to to say in regard to the specific topic of the rest of the suspect in the uh the uh the phony bombs tonight\nI think the thing that has always been I don't know if this is true is in other states\nThink Clinton Wyoming today as black people in this state like if they had had this ongoing arrest record I just can't help the people that have been arrested for twenty times he's been out on the street I guess that's the thing that for like ...\n[noise] uh yes it replaces me as well of course obviously you can be arrested to many many many times a\nAnd a convictions or or what would matter in terms of uh of any ah what amounts to prior restraint but I see what you're saying elated yes obviously something that needs to be done in the in this regard I Would thoroughly concur Oleg ... calls in from Philadelphia tonight for the good evening on land [laughter]\nAnyway yeah on your mind to you so I'm fine I'm I'm a\nI saw was I going to follow up on what you're saying where laws and you know a person can only got so many chances but I was also looking at it from a proactive angle where we have a problem with the healthcare system in this country\nEspecially compared to other developed countries and I think the field of mental health is even more under served in the medical field in general and so maybe after somebody goes in so many times they are they bought the one for a vacation but people on parole maybe they could have a thing\nWhere they put people on uh\nHealth professional\nAnd they get help and maybe a\nBackground I think what's more acceptable in the first place that person would never get to the ways in their minds when they justify doing these things\nAnd you know and I guess that it costs money mental health professionals are expensive that's one part of it but then we have things like that and how much money was spent by the FBI on this investigation\nThat the financial part of it and then the other side as a mental health professional is able to help somebody and prevent that kind of thing from happening in the first place that just priceless especially if the you know especially somebody could be better building these bombs and they I Would I say get lucky they get\nThere was also go undetected I something actually happens and people get the answer to prevent something like that with a little bit of an investment is definitely something I see is priceless\nWell somebody that I Would agree that's really to the extent that in fact we are able to be so proactive obviously the uh the area of mental health is under served in this country we do not have mental health and science down to ... to do such that we can offer treatment and give but let's say a\nA Seventy percent chance that we've a fixture you're a defect your brain but a yes or the short answer is though we do need more resources in terms of middle help and maybe some kind of a\nIf you will mental health probation might be at least something worth pursuing Greg in Sioux City

to describe this but he's a he's a deranged man\nWho went off the charts\nOn a politician\nI Can't blame the politician\nCan only blamed this man and his mental [noise]\nHello friends on news talk Ninety four point one special event\nWe got a prompt you get the same Floyd you your your bones sounds like you're in ... where are you\nHere is it a little\nBetter than I Do think you think you think you\nYeah I just had to turn that mouthpiece a little bit except that if they catch you had to be some kind of a lunatic I mean let's face it you know he's obsessed over this like like some ... ... ... some guys who obsess over a woman you know they can't apple much stuff\nThey South Korea to get yeah no he says that's a pretty good he's a stocker he's a crumb stocker a I guess you could put it in that saying that\nThey're going to have a thank God he doesn't know how to fill up you know or doesn't really know how to make one to explode evidently because uh if I worked for the post office here in Sacramento and we deliver to that that post office\nAh well I'm a truck driver yeah um I don't know what that nobody that I Know that hurt\nA lot that's the amazing part is that how many people in the postal service system had been exposed to these bombs that have been going through the mail so it's got to be a huge number a huge number so\nI don't know how many more out there but I Would imagine the everybody at the post office has got to still be on their ... and ... because this guy is not sane whether he sent more out or not and at this point we don't have to check well I suspect the one that arrived in I'm In Manhattan today could have been mailed\nFrom Florida three days ago four days ago sometimes it takes that long to get from Florida to New York on them in the mail\nSo especially since the uh uh an odd shaped piece of mail which seemed to take an extra\nDown they put it in and they put it in an aircraft so it's a good thing that it didn't blow up in an aircraft yup coming from there to to California and uh come down in in a neighborhood\nAre you surprised by you surprised that they caught the guys who quickly are you surprised to the fact that he is on obsessed ...\nA\n... so I'm surprised that he said he was caught so fast yeah but not really because ah the postal service has has its own investigators FBI what you've got you got somebody that you're doing this kind of stuff in a bad in the belly prize and how fat\nPeople get picked up ... obviously 'cause he got picked up pretty fast yeah\nAs far as you can be in a lot of Trump's support or I don't I don't ... it doesn't surprise me that he dies or Trump's order or a Democrat and I'll be honest with you because there's patriots and ... and ... people on both sides you up\nThere on that didn't matter what it doesn't matter what what uh what political affiliation he has a crazy crazy yeah\nAnd that's the that's where it starts in my opinion it starts there and if you're not mentally healthy you check in on something and you become obsessed with it\nPeople that matter no they get they get locked in on something and and you can't shake them loose cannot ... so uh I don't know how that works but I've seen it many many times by\nFloyd thank you very much appreciate the call a JPEG one thousand sends me an email you can find my email address by going to my website Tom

the\nUh allowed through right I'm right it can commerce right and we can we cannot humans\nWe can we can stop them at the checkpoints but the law right now says to the border patrol officer if they say I'm here to apply for asylum that border patrol officer who sworn to uphold the law must allow them in so\nIf they don't say that only\nCommerce not people you're shutting down you're not allowing people to go in and out through the border only covers only try it you know I look at what to do commerce with Mexico\nAll I'll tell you that's going to be the legal fight went there and that was

do you want another uh Kavanaugh hearing to take place this is not the time\nBut uh he's never lived up to the expectations I have for him\nAnd I think many others did to a you know remember he was

about\nYour reaction to everybody in the media seems that way to me or certainly in the left trying to blame President Trump for what this crazy guy did as if this guy did it because of what President Trump says because of course everything that goes wrong is President Trump's falls and everything goes right like our economy\nIs because of President Obama and if you didn't know that just ask ... he he mentions it all the time all credit calling me that's because of what I started okay which by the way explains why they were so against now justice Kevin no it wouldn't have mattered if the president nominated left is like the pope\nWhatever the president is for their against remember they were against whoever the nominee was they didn't even know the name it didn't matter they had their son's ready\nThat is their basic platform this November and it doesn't matter if the president has done a great job none of it matters say hazing and they hate him with a passion you know I thought the we reached the ... the top with George W. Bush in their hatred this one is being surpass\nThis bumbling fools could never had beaten their candidate and they will never acknowledge the great things that he has done\nSo these acts will not long be about this evil did you notice just like it wasn't long about Paisley for that didn't last that wasn't about her it was about the Democrats regaining power so she she's like an asterisk now that's what she's gonna ...\nJust be always about punishing President Trump and all Republicans because we're evil and they are not you get it which is even more reason why you have to vote tell me what you think is a set of eight eight eight one eight eight eight nine seven ones sage\nIt is also been amazing to see the Democrats in the meeting in action you know the Democrats than going to use these acts to their parties in a vantage\nBut for the media to be so blatant in their advocacy is all new in the age of Trump they haven't been on partial to their views for many years now a lot of us know that that's not a secret\nBut they used to pretend here's the difference that they were non biased no more now does out in the open with their advocacy and you can even see it in their questions what's his name Jim Acosta from CNN hardly hiding his disdain for the president I'm telling you you could see that in his questions\nThey're out to get the president and make no mistake about it and the media has an enormous power to influence the debate in our elections and the president is right to call them out on this\nShow the president has rightly call that the press for who they are and the press cannot deal with it in their righteous indignation\nAnd just today I was watching getting ready for the show there was Shepard Smith on Fox saying that Trump's phrase lock her up and the chance to encourage in that vein and CNN sucks are the kinds of things that AIG is that people like the suspect on so Mary was Trump is responsible for it\nBut those of us on the right blame people with ... bad values were bad acts not those who share their political views\nBut of course did we on the right blamed Bernie Sanders for his support or remember who shot and seriously injured Congressman Steve ... and the other cars when he would've wipe them out if he could\nWhat President Trump is responsible no matter what he says even when he tries to unify us he's no good\nCNN is hopeless by the way I I Try to watch what's the other one MSNBC it's it's not easy watching these channels I I live in another planet and there's a real argument to be made for not letting Hillary Clinton be above the law yeah CNN is hopeless that's my point and President Trump is right\nAnd a lot of supporters are people of arguing with me when I've done all the shows\nThey said how could you say you know because it was my position if Hillary and bill will agree never don't bother us again and leave the scene which is I Know is impossible it's not gonna happen then I might agree not to indict here if I had any power to say that oh you could imagine the calls I got mark how could she be above the law and they had a great point\nThat it's not inciting people to riot or to physically harm someone that is a legitimate political asked to see what it's asking us to see on the right and for the Democrats and the left and now the media that is unacceptable\n[noise] so they're almost all on the left and we're fortunate to have someone like President Trump call them out\nWe've had so many we presidents in the past and it's absolutely refreshing to see someone take it back to them\nEven if the media the left the Democrats can't take it President Trump is not responsible for the craziness in our country\nTell me what you think as I said eight eight eight nine seven one ... and let's try to get a caller to in Houston, Texas let's go to Mark Mark you're on with mark Hi Mark\nAnd mark a Mark I'm what you were a bringing up about a media is absolutely true they don't want to report the fact that the cycle and here's a psycho prior to the threatened to blow up Florida like power and I I don't know\nOf responsible for those no he happens to be just you know the the ... the the course of the ... now and another distinction is the fact that you know Trump literally to not say let's go blow them operate the worst you said a few times during his is a a a\nNot his candidacy while he was trying for a couple of times he said oh yeah go ahead on the face or something like that that was that but he hasn't done anything like that where the the lab whether it's the actual political people or the the news\nUh they've all actually said there are going out and confront them and and and and and run them out of the stores all this other stuff so um again that's that's part of the contrast in different\nYeah like Maxine Waters right get in their face wherever you see them you know don't let them leave especially if you know they're in the cabinet ... this is what they do when they do it's OK mark don't you get that oh of\nCourse it's the the the ultimate double standard that uh everyone recognizes that accept them well they'll they recognize it but they're not going to say it and even\nMost of the hard core I Would say\nYou know a intelligent Democrats because that's the other thing to what they're doing and the people that are acting out these acts of violence most of these are actually borderline psychotic that are reacting to something because they're that way if the Trump arrangements that I'm now they could argue that that's the cause of it now too and that makes them psychotic\nYeah it does you know that's what they would say no question about it\nBreaking ATF news just recently the U.S department of education announced that\nActing on a complaint filed by alliance defending freedom against the Decatur, Georgia city schools is opening an investigation into a horrible assault of a kindergarten kindergarten her in her

three eighty nine but it wasn't until a few years ago when we realized\nKind of took the game warden approach them for for many years we got together around the nation that game wardens just shared information ideas and we kind of kept it to ourselves\nA few years ago we met and we decided why are we why is this organization why are we not operating this organization the way we work where we get the public involved and get the word out there and worldwide get people working together to stop poaching\nWe know there's numerous organizations out there that are conservation minded they're they're anti poaching and all that but there's not many organizations that provide the actual enforcement and go after these people not so we're all about\nAnd and as this gentleman was saying down here we absolutely cannot catch poachers without the without the help of the public we can go out and get a few\nThe bulk of our major cases where you read about these cases were multiple deer were ... were were killed multiple anything most of these cases come from the relationship that game wardens have with the sporting public and and\nI guess I've been accused of being blonde more than once in my

you are carving your pumpkin this weekend let's say a you know you ah get kids yeah this weekend you don't want to wait till Wednesday a you know are there to to carve your pumpkin\nRemember once you're pierce the pumpkin which appears that skin it does what it does two things that allows bacteria to start to eat away at the flash and so I that's what that skins all about when they pick pumpkin you know the cure\nIt's the pumpkin Smith fact if you don't peers to scan\nYou bring a pumpkin in the house and you know ... it can actually last through the holidays with no problem whatsoever\nI'm freezing and thawing outside usually does a number of ... to it over time and of course critters can get on them as well but that seals the moisture inside keeps the bacteria out once you get a bruise your soft spot that's when it's all over or when you cut it with a knife\nSo once you cut it you know obviously it looks good that day but the next day you can start to see a triple and by the third day just starting to turn black and all kinds of funky things on the inside so by the time you get the Wednesday I could start to look\nPretty ugly and sometimes that's kinda cool sometimes it's not point being is this is a product out there cold wet and forget here's talking about it all the time some moss algae a remover that she could spray on the side of your house on the patio or whatever and it just eats the mosques away and the algae away\nWell they did some experimenting with it and they actually found that if you cut you carve your pumpkin and then spray it with the wedding forget every couple of days or so it'll actually continue to eat that fungus away and your pumpkin stays cleaner and more a normal looking like when you first carved it\nFor a longer period of time and I've actually it starts to shrivel up as losing moisture um when I Know folks that they've taken them and don't come down and water to try to redo that\nYeah you could try that but the thing about the white and forget if you can keep the the the bacteria from showing up and start to eat that thing away it real early last ... longer so if you have wet and forget on hand that you're using in the patio area or on the side of the house are rough or whatever it may be\nYou can use it on your pumpkin as well to keep it fresh your if your car this weekend and have it ready for Wednesday when it comes for Halloween if you don't have wet and forget\nYou know you find that most a lot of hard wears a some of the ... the the box stores will have it out there you go on our website wet and forget dot com and find out where to get an I think you can order online as well but it's a really cool product that is literally the name says it all wet and forget you spray\nIt on you forget about it it just eats the mosques and mold analogy all the way\nOver time it turns kind of like dirt and then it dries up and and it goes away it's it's really cool product the wedding forget to help make those pumpkins last right on through the ... the Halloween season alright ... outlines room for you ready eight hundred eight two three eight to five five here in the garden threat to us [noise]\nGuy come on now and the one eight hundred and eighty two to three talk you're listening to the guy with a lot and we'll send\nYour home we're taking care of business news talk Ninety

lawn mowers an outdoor equipment and anything else you've got for the warm weather season\nYou're running a little tight on outside storage shed can be a great solution and also a dad why project are pro project but before you began that there are four important things you have to consider now we've got those tips in today's ... project presented my whole advisor dot com\nNo first your average cost to build a should is a pretty wide range we're talking about between eight hundred and four grand it depends on the truth choosing whether you're going to build yourself we're hiring reproach but what do you decide to the white or not there are several basic questions to ask you something before you start shopping\nYeah first of all do you need a permit I think a lot of people forget and think oh it's my house and I can do whatever I Want and I'm going to build a thing or I'm going to put up a fan\nYou can't always just go and do that you have\nTo check your local building codes first to determine if you need a permit to build a shed on your property now you don't want to find out after you finished the project that it's got to come down because it violated some building code orange zoning code I mean that's the last thing you want to do it and that's a bunch of money and then have to take it all down and then do it again\nNow the other big thing you've got to think about is what size does your shed needs to be and what do you want it to be you know do you need something simple and you know primarily for just business needs putting things in there and not making a cute or any other functions or do you want something decorative\nThere are so many different styles and size is out there that you really need to evaluate your home and your property and how you're going to use that so that you can determine the best style for what your ... going to be\nA part of that is deciding where the should is going to go I mean depending on the size of your property you get a lot of different options for the poison the shit now folks very calmly might put it close to the house which makes running power in ... or\nSometimes folks will tuck it sort of to the side or the back of the property so that it's less obvious but put some thought into that because you're gonna be going back and forth a lot new on a regret that decision\nAnd finally what your budget I mean did you go tight budget you can build a very simple should that gets the job done with on a lot of frills but it does some wiggle room you could think about getting some extra features like integrated shelving inside decorative trim on the outside or you could go all out man cave or she should and maybe at electricity sheet\nPlumbing wall to wall stereo I don't know [laughter] you know you can really totally decked out those are fun too but I think it through in mind that budget comes out just the way you expect\nNow if you do go pro we recommend getting estimates from at least two or three contractors before you choose the one pro that's going to help you with the project\nAnd that today's pro project presented by Pfizer dot com with homemade by there you can get matched with top rated homes

got Tammy in Philadelphia on the line who is looking for a better shot or\nWe do today I'm Hi I'm calling in because I wanted to find out um I had an old Victorian house and I have a a three three three\nI have a better or for the ... and when it's going to shower on a second floor and then I Want to take a shower or in the water up there on the third floor the shower go with cold and I've been an egg creme contractors and my plumber and I'm not getting a consistent answer so I like to remedy that says I'm door remodeling\nOkay so are you opening up walls is part of remodeling\nYes I'm completely stripped down to the ...\nSo the pressure an older homes are generally because you have old steel pipes that suffer from internal resting and they cause they closed down ... like a clogged arteries and then you can't push enough water through it and that could be your main water pipe it could be the spy pipes that are inside the house\nOr a combination of them and so since you're taking the walls are part of the general rule of thumb is whenever you expose these old steel pipes you want to replace them with copper pipes um war with ... was different to a newer type of plumbing pipe now the other thing is you may have enough water pressure coming in from the street\nOne of the pressure is not that big of a deal because I think the pressure that like basically we have to bear on going out and you can only use one at a time by the water completely go cold shower somebody on than eager to think\nWell that's because the the pipes may not be supplying that hot water they may not be moving into hot water which I was worried or do you have a twenty gallon or well that's a minimum size but should be okay for for two bathrooms okay and as an older water heater um\nNo I just looked like or to hear\nWhen you replace the changing the plumbing around it this is going through the steel pipes\nThat they changed it around the no I don't think\nYou need to talk with your plumbers about what kind of pipes you have whether or not that's contributing the problem and need to know where the water pressure is at the street because if you're not getting enough pressure that could be the whole cause of it\nOkay now I go there and I saw something online called a um a car sure ballot now what they were many issue at all\nSo pressure valve valve is designed to be used primarily in the shower and what it does it keeps them mixed between hot and cold balanced so that you don't get scorching or freezing cold waters when the pressure drops so if somebody wants to say run hot water downstairs and now ... hot water from the upstairs shower\nIt would not change the balance of water from the mix of water between hot and cold so the flow would be less you'd have less of a stream but it wouldn't be\nThe the temperature wouldn't change okay right okay no that's not a I don't think that's the cause I mean that would that would certainly be a good thing to have something you should consider but I don't think that's the reason you're not going to hot water on the second floor I just don't think you're moving enough water up there\nOkay so basically what I Need to do with them to check the piping around the water heater\nGetting a plumber should know this not only to run the water heater basically if you're going to one of those walls what kind of pipes do you have\nAnd are they corroded and should they be replaced to help groups are up to help alleviate this okay I'm In of all else fails you could always get a second water heater upstairs you could get into a checklist water heater which would be really small unit and it would supply additional water that second for bathroom\nOkay okay okay well I think that kind of remedy the problem\nAll right

settling in a\nBit like set off a lot yeah I bet I bet so I'm ...\nAs the wiring been updated at all or is it originalist ... kind of worried you have\nHad a mix of not into an updated what's down in the walls I think it's still not into I'm Guy some of the stuff that more out it has been replaced\nAnd what are you planning to do what what's precipitating this this question is is just a general concerned about safety or are you doing some other him out\nOf that as we started redoing the kitchen and I kept that you know that in layers of LA amen [laughter] out of Korea set out at all the stuff that\nHow that shouldn't have been inhaling Ken I'm adding to the Senate floor and kept the original old wood floors and handling and the kitchen and not willing to tear down to it but ... to behind it and every time he touched with all your stuff All right I'm I'm not going to replace it painted\nThe handling and I like to put new for Ken around [noise] but all of the wiring it's a big black wires that from one outlet trauma that let\nLet me give you some advice on this because it is time to update that wiring\nDuring drive all tell us about your project\nStrip the wallpaper in our kitchen until it's down to sheet rock and we'd like to uh put texture in it but I'd like to do it as simply as possible so she can texture and paint\nAnd I like more information about that or what you recommend\n... to use an additive in pay but frankly usually get the opposite question most people calls willing to take the picture away so [laughter] so I Would say send your your really sure you want to do this because once it goes on there it's hard to make it a week ago a\nWhite yes I mean our other walls have some texture I mean and that's not a heavy texture it's just a little bit and make it and it's not a flat sheet rock\nAnd it's a texture and the painter it's an actual texture within the drywall itself almost like a ...\nWhile I'd rather not go that route is the the the ... um I'd like to add texture the pain just to give the wall something other than the mood drywall\nWell there was a couple of different techniques that you can use 'em first there's something called the linen technique that's done with almost like a wallpaper brash sort of a very short\nStiff bristle that's you know maybe twelve inches to Eighteen Inches wide and you put the paint on and then you sort of dragged that brush through and that gives you a linear texture to it and that can kind of looked like wallpaper and you can do it with one color or do a base color and then let that dry and then\nPut it in a coat on top and then dragged outlined through um you can do something that's almost called the I guess it is actually called the Venetian plaster but that involves you know sort of marveling the texture on and and furnishing it and rubbing and it really is a heavier coat of paint and plaster but that gives a really interesting sort of\nCloudy textural look that sometimes has a high shine to it um there's this waited texture I think Ralph Lauren is one of the pain that makes that\nAnd that has um it really does look like sway that has that sort of like rub softer not looking texture to it there's a standard finished with there's actual stand in the pain sometimes I can feel a little rough almost like a sand paper\nBut I'm back of the nice texture to they all in different application technique so if I were looking at a paint that has a specific texture and homo center and make sure that I really read the directions and looked at what that manufacture was recommending for the application process and get those correct tools and do the proper prep work for it\nBecause some of those textures or you know kind of labor intensive forward the wire and you want to make sure you get it right\nAbsolutely [laughter] okay well I'll look into a a things you suggested here and make a decision that I Hope\nThat helps you own it does say something much\nWell now that we are entering the heating season and maybe a lot of you are actually already is and the heat in full swing this time of year you really want to try and get the most out of your energy dollar and to do that you've got to keep that draft but those drafts aren't always just found and really obvious places\nYeah now most the replacement sneaky drifts happen or switch please and outlets on your your walls you know air gets into those walls and those drills from the outside world uses you right in the ... they're not proper we deal\nWith the ... is very civil you pick up some pre cuts ... homes and there's and hardware stores are literally tens of peace and then slip them under the cover place to do a great job of keeping those dress out\nI mean truly it's like one of the least expensive improvement they can make that will make a very noticeable difference in your expenses which is just amazing to me the other thing if you find that you have larger gap some of the exterior walls\nYou can try and filled up with an expandable thumb and that's going to stop the Airflow but in a lot of cases it's not going to stop and he wrote in er pets from coming in so if you want to do that as well\nIt's a little ... wrote in ads from chewing there my aunt yeah good point so lots of ways to try to cut back on those traps but I'll tell you what they do add up so given the now before I could see terribly cold it'd be a lot more comfortable all winter long name can you get the name of the day\nI got to issue with they Italy leaking ceiling I'm not sure if it's coming from from my roof for Meyer conditioners uh doesn't do it all the time but sometimes when it rains it comes down and then other times they comes\nTo that [laughter]\nOr or or ... kinda that allows we've got a metal roof structure house right now I'm thinking maybe to drip they get they don't want more goes into the gutter and you know but like I said I've not had any luck because I have it fixed and then it it will come of rain and become then again\nIt comes in again right so what they're doing the fiction that he knew sealing the seems in the in the metal roof\nYeah we we got up and put a some talk of the stuff on ... you know where the ages of stuff was and now that are supposed to be a twenty year roof and we had an older house rather\nWait a minute this is a metal roof is supposed to be a hundred year roof metal roof last a long time here's what I Would do I would try to make it legal so I Would go up there if you get up there that area with a hose yeah so I Would try to make it leaks I Would try\nYou know the normal light duty rainfall when it falls down from the top and see that there's anything and then I Would try some directional pressure against those scenes and see if I can figure out what type of driving rain storms coming in your ... I suspect that is do the rain\nA driving in those in it might be trapped in there and it's way comes out days later after ... I don't know but I think what you're gonna have to do is to try to figure out what part of that is breaking down and then once you do if you already going the Koch route I Would just taken apart that section the roof\nAnd then putting it back together with the proper ceiling to make sure you get it done once and for all\nRight okay All right way to ...\n... we've got to repair the Salem to or not or a proud to say on\nYeah I Know you don't want to you know you you got his league done yeah and by the way when you do repair that ceiling mysteries primer on it because if you don't prime over leaks means that they're going to come right through enough in Spain okay\nYeah I actually I like what we're going to do is put up a a lot of lip sobbing are a lot of the NATO paying lame but at the top client that will go up and get rid of the popcorn that's up there right\nNow oh yeah well let's say you know that for most expensive words and home improvement while you're at it [laughter] yeah

read that's a great brand and they have a wide variety of repair products um you have the\nThe concrete is a product for that and in all cases they the difference between that type of product a repair product in the original sort of concrete Prague is it the repair parts are designed to adhere to the original concrete base\nYou know if it's if he was loose course shift a pop it out and restore it

baggage is scheduled for time as convenient for you Tripoli five five seven Nineteen Ninety three\nSo now that I got the business stuff out of the way buddy let's talk about the fact that last week we mentioned that uh you were selected along with the a lot\nAnd and you had you got to do that this week so let's talk about how well we we did man that was one of the most awesome most incredible experience is that I I think probably ever had and I'm forty nine years old I'm ... and all that that turned fifty and I think that's probably the most awesome incredible honor humble man I\nI mean you could just go on and on and on with the words there that to try to describe it but yeah they invited a hundred pastors across the state of Tennessee to come to the White House always all hundred from Tennessee or hotter it was a country oh wow it was it was a hundred from the state of Tennessee we only had Ninety show up\nI was like who doesn't go [laughter] I Know really I mean we have many or in the ... that didn't come but um they kept it at Ninety and it was I've known about it for a couple of weeks you and I mentioned a couple of weeks ago on the show that we were going to talk about it in the White House asked\nUs to really keep it kind of hush hush and keep it kind of quiet during the election season than it was an off the record meeting they didn't really want it publicize I didn't want too much information out there about it they didn't want the media slammed thing it that he was trying to\nYou know throw the votes into Tennessee but calling in a hundred ministers and trying to get them to promote from the ... you know how the media is nowadays they shut down everything what you wind up you wind up actually just run up seeing Pence anyway right [noise]\nI did I yeah we did I ended up you know getting to be with my pants and and when he came in the room he walked in with that POW the pastor Andrew bus and that just got released from turkey\nOkay and uh it was really cool to obviously see and meet the vice president it was really cool to tell you the O W\nI don't know if he was actually a prisoner of war or not but I Know they held captive and he was a prisoner\nFor over two years I think he went over there is a missionary maybe he added that they called the O W but yeah I was talking about yeah yeah yeah and he he was ... maybe detainee maybe but he was there you know he had been held captive and been a prisoner for for over two years and\nAnd he had and he made it home yet man he was still he was still in DC they had just brought him over from Germany where they checked him out I mean he he was I mean he was just this\nHappened to be there the same day we were there which was incredibly cool\nAnd he wanted to come in with with vice president pants and she has had like a big prayer group than we did we are big prayer group we had well of course not any of us that's pretty good pretty good ... yeah\nAnd uh Jason crab he's a big artist musician in the Christian music world southern gospel world the crab family\nAnd um he was there with us so he kind of broke away from the crab family became a contemporary artist and\nHe was there he led to praise him worship service in our group and then uh there was a group there from the eighties that that was real popular back in the eighties and the in the contemporary Christian music world when Michael W. Smith\nWas there right behind him I don't know them very very well but they were there with us um and man it was just beautiful singing and beautiful\nTime there and in the White House and we got the red carpet to her out of our eyes out of ... oh yeah yeah we were we were right outside the oval office pants and and Andrew Brunson had come right out of the oval office to\nFor their lifetime and they still got a mortgage debt you know that's okay look I I deal with retirees\nEvery day that have mortgage debt and were able to manage that and we're able to to handle that and and we can get them through it and at the end of the day the mortgages a fixed cost\nSo if it's fixed in you know you can count on it to be there than we can plan for that so I don't want anybody listening today that if you've got a mortgage or you're in that don't beat yourself up because\nMark the one thing you know as you mentioned earlier we've been doing this several years now and one thing you know every single person that comes through the door my office it's a it's a different circumstance I mean there's no there's no two people that walk in here that I can go well gee you know that horrible you know or you know you just can't you just can't put that label you insert\nPerson and ... a right yeah and we say that all the time 'cause one of the things that we do here with the program as we do talk about topics and concepts and things but we speaking generalities\nBecause it's the radio program and we are talking to a wide audience but you specifically each person out there listening is an individual and your situation is certainly going to be different\nWe're talking about debt and retirement planning and uh so I Do agree with you I think that there are some good debts I think that uh you certainly don't want to hit retirement with bad debt which is high credit card debt things of that nature\nNo other people on the the airwaves they say you got to be completely debt free before you retire and I think some people get very concerned about that do you think\nThat someone needs to be debt free before they retire\nI can say being debt free before you retire will make life easier than [laughter] but if I don't think it's I don't think it's a prerequisite right ... I don't think it's a ... but it but it would only get you know what I mean let's be honest if you're\nIf you're drawing you know whatever your monthly check is coming in and all of a sudden you don't have to spin on that that's a pretty good day sure absolutely so yeah I agree I I think you hit the nail right on the head it's not necessarily a prerequisite but\nHey you know let's just be honest with one another here that if you could go in\nAnd now that you would be surprised mark on how little that they draw for retirement and I'm telling you they have no issues at All right I just rock right along and quite honestly they have a great lifestyle and it's it's just simply because they have no debt\nAnd that and that's a tough discipline though because I think most of us that's just not going to be the case\nRight I agree I agree and and you know and we see it more so with the senior market because a lot of folks\nGo ahead and pay their debts off and they get things paid off but then when you get behind us you know if you start looking in the future it's pretty scary because I I just don't think a lot of people behind us in the future are going to go into retirement debt free because it'd be very debt oriented and very driven by that day\nIt well it's a it's a ... of the culture for sure I Would agree with you and and that's why I think that it's good to have a conversation about\nYou know managing their debt and really you know and another another four letter word is on the Florida worried about people associated as budget\nBut if you put yourself on a budget you can seriously make a dent in your debt leading up to your retirement and we're not talking twenty years' worth talking\nYou know less than ten I Would say is is completely plausible let's say fifty five sixty five you could certainly get yourself on a budget you could sit down and work with a retirement plan or with a specialist like yourself with an advisor who can help you structure budget look at the whole situation\nAnd then really make a serious dent on your way towards retirement would you agree\nI agree a hundred percent because if you're working and you know that in ten years you're going to retire\nAnd you've got that income coming in one thing that I've seen people do over the past years mark is along the way you'll get a tax return or you'll get a bonus or you'll get you'll get something over and above your extra pay I even had one client I said how did you end up you know paying your mortgage off\nHe said real simple Anthony every year at Christmas Time and I love this mark I've I've never forgotten this he said every year at Christmas Time I Would for Christmas for me and my wife\nAre Christmas present was we took one house payment and we paid that toward the principle of the house now how simple as that\nAnd I said I said John that is incredible and he said oh he's great at Christmas Time I think he told me their their mortgage at that time as they were working was um I think I think is a Seventeen hundred a month I Believe what he said and every year so they would pay their mortgage payment every every month like clockwork\nAnd then they get to the end of the year they go ahead and pay the December payment but they would take an additional Seventeen hundred and Melanie in and say apply this toward the principal wow vice hate and he paid their house off in Fifteen Years so you just said ten okay which is very possible I mean hey tends not bad\nBut you know I thought wow what a genius I mean they pay that off they pay that house off by just sending in for Christmas every year a house payment said here please apply this toward the principal I'm never forgot that I thought man that is outstanding\nAbsolutely and it all comes back to you know working with the visor working with a plan getting a plan together and then working through that process\nAnd Anthony can certainly help you out with that triple a five five seven Nineteen Ninety three you're listening to retire the right way with Anthony Wright from retirement specialty group eight eight eight five five seven one nine nine three Anthony will finish off our debt and retirement planning you kind of already answered this really just kind of told a story about it but\nDo you think that that is kind of more common than people realize that if you get together and work\nA plan that plan will also help you reduce your debt as you move into retirement you know waiting until sixty five okay that's fine that happens people do that you can\nSooner and not even a lot sooner like we talked about you know five ten Fifteen Years anything makes a big difference but you got to have that plan and work the budget together right\nI agree a hundred percent I couldn't agree more you you got to get the plan together and work to plan because\nPeople can't fly by the seat of their pants and then get there and go wow gee you know I don't know what happened and you know just me personally so my wife and I hired an attorney slash CPA and\nAnd we sat down and we did a plan so I'm not just sitting here\nSaying you need a plant I'm telling you me personally my wife and I sat down with a plan we have a plan we know where we're headed were no we're we're going so you know twelve to Fifteen year playing and I know where I'm going I'm going to get there and I think so many times you're spot on so many times\nPeople don't sit down and put together a plan and then they get there and they go oh wow what happened but I I can tell you more there are many many clients that I meet with\nThat they do create substantial wealth just simply because they don't have any debt\nAnd I I mean I can think of client after client after clients that I have worked with over the years that you will be surprised how much wealth they have created and the end they have accumulated just because they didn't have a ton of debt because like took ten or Fifteen Years\nAnd they work that plan and they pay that debt off\nAnd when you pay that debt off and you don't have money going out the bottom of your bucket so\nIf you get water and your bucket and all of a sudden there's more draining out the bottom then you got into a bucket you got a problem right right so so if you if you stop up the holes in the bottom of the bucket you'll be surprised how much water you can carry\nAnd you'll be surprised how far you can get down the road so like you said earlier mark you know it's easy to get in touch with me triple a five five seven Nineteen Ninety three\nAnd I got a special offer for everybody today\nWe want to extend an opportunity to the listeners right now that will help them be sure that they are well prepared\nSo what I'm doing is I'm offering a complementary financial review to those listeners today\nAnd for those that are listening if you call and the next Fifteen minutes and you have at least a hundred thousand dollars saved for retirement I'm not a miracle worker can't do something without nothing\nSo if you've at least got a hundred thousand dollar save for retirement then we will talk about your retirement income needs what that incomes going to come from how you'll outpaced inflation\nPay as little as you possibly have to in taxes\nMake sure that you don't outlive your money now you might say I don't really have to call in the next Fifteen minutes and yes that's true you could probably take care of it next week or maybe next month but here's the deal\nWe been coaching people on retirement planning for a decade now and we've learned that it's really easy to procrastinate and get distracted and put things off I've learned over the past decade dealing with people that's the number one problem I procrastinate they get distracted they put it off\nSo if you don't start the process now today there's a very good chance that you're not going to do it at all\nSo the first coaching\nThat we're going to give to you is to encourage you to take that first step right now I mean mark imagine if Payton Manning never took the first step and picked up a football so you got to take the first step now so far almost everybody listening\nThat's going to be the hardest part is to pick up the phone and take action now from there it's really not a painful process it's really pretty simple believe it or not I'm a fairly nice easy guy to sit down and talked to so it's pretty\nNot trying to be mean trying to be rude I just can't do something with a goose eggs zero so we got to have a little bit save for retirement before I can help so if you've got at least a hundred thousand dollars save for retirement then I can help you\nSo we're really really really passionate about making sure that our clients have all their bases covered in their retirement plan\nFor instance here Social Security well at what age should you start taking that benefit and then how does it fit into your overall income picture so most people run down to office Social Security office turned sixty to like take a huge twenty five percent haircut\nAnyway going to take a look at when do you turn on Social Security how much risk are you taking in your portfolio and is that amount of risk appropriate for your age and for the amount of return that you're actually getting how much are you paying fees and commissions with your current plan\nWhat about the tax implications of your savings is there a way to save money in taxes down the road ... planning proactively right now\nDo you have an income plan in place to be sure that you aren't in danger of running out of money nothing worse than getting to retirement and running out of money if he ended up living thirty or more years in retirement than you stand a chance of running out of money less don't let that happen\nDo you have a plan to address inflation in future decades as the cost of every single thing you buy continues to go up Markey came by ...\nWhat about long term care oh my word that's through the roof already but do you have a plan for how you're going to pay for that assisted living or that nursing home if you need\nIf leaving a legacy is important to you have you determine the best way to pass that money to the future generations folks I don't think you want your children and your grandchildren paying forty fifty percent in taxes so we take a look at that legacy planning obviously there is a lot a lot a lot that we have to discuss\nAnd if we found one thing at all we have found that most people\nJust hadn't planned thoroughly enough to address all these issues and they get themselves in trouble\nSo if you've been managing your retirement and you've been doing that all by yourself and you realize that there's a lot of these issues that I mentioned that you really have an even addressed or if you are now realizing that your current planner or your current advisor hasn't been helping you think through all these issues thoroughly\nBy the way they should be but not everybody does so today is your chance to get a troop comprehensive plan put in place\nSo again keep in mind this review is complimentary if you have at least a hundred thousand dollars save for retirement but folks you gotta keep in mind you guys have been following me on here and listen to mark enough for several years now\nThe calendar fills up very very quickly so go ahead give me a

anything let's finish out today's program talking about defensive mechanisms we all have 'em [laughter]\nYeah we do we avoid them and a lot of facets of our life\nAnd but we're gonna talk about retirement obviously so some people say they don't want to retire and well they actually really made it they just do not want to retire I I almost see you in this category as well I Know you love what you do\nAnd I can see you may be cutting back on your hours when you get older but I can see you still not wanting to retire you know just because you love what you do but other people\nThey say things as a defensive mechanism because they are afraid they can't retire or they are unsure about how to retire and a loving hit this\nA retired okay well that I I just stay at corrected now [laughter] I'm just totally black and I'm totally totally ... oh I I bet you are well\nBut we do have people that use the I Love my career as an excuse right and they probably really do love their career but I Do love my Korea and you are bottom I don't even play the Powerball odds just just mess around with you\nFor a lot of others you know the idea of walking away from something that you do enjoy so much is a bit daunting\nIt is a bit daunting and and I mean look some people really just enjoy their career let's be honest here I mean they don't have no desire to start going to work everyday lives and I know a guy right now that the eighty three years old and he's still working\nI mean there's nothing wrong with that I mean who wants to sit around and get bored right right right and we were going to talk about that one in a minute [laughter] yeah but you know I mean what you know who wants to sit in rooms they're four walls I mean I I have no problem with that and you know they might be in a financial position the you know they could have retired years ago but\nThey just love what they do and and do what they love and and I mean I don't really have a problem with that but with that being said I mean at some point their their health you know changes in the industry or the disappearance of the company might not allow him to\nContinue working as long as they want ... it's important to have a plan and you know kind of know the direction that\nYou're wanting to go and and you can kind of plan around those circumstances and and kind of the best way you know how that's the reason I I jokingly said that to you I mean I I Know because I have a plan and I know where I'm headed and I\nI Know how I'm going to get there and I know that that in in twelve to Fifteen Years that I'm able to writing my destiny and ...\nAnd and I'm going to be there so and at the end you're spot on all of my career I Love what I Do\nWell I'll tell you what now all joking aside this is actually this is actually a statistic and if it's true and sad [noise]\nTwenty seven percent of the American population thinks that the Powerball or some form of lottery is their retirement plan that's just not smart I mean ... I Know that's just one of the seven for almost thirty basically one third of the country\nThinks that that's going to be how they retire and that's just you know that's just not smart you can plan\nMuch easier than you think you can you can get a plan in place and a lot easier and a strategy and it doesn't necessarily matter about you know how much you make you know ... I Know that there has been situations where\nPeople have you know obviously if you make more it's a little easier but when you make more you spend more so you really just have to make sure that you're talking to somebody about your situation and really working through it because you might be surprised where you're at a little bit further along than you think\nBut you didn't mention being bored okay so that's another defensive mechanism that people will sometimes use whale I don't want to retire Anthony because I'd just be bored [laughter] well I mean they\nMight not have that burning passion you know for their career but right they still find a job better than the alternative of just not having any responsibilities\nYou know I mean for many of those people\nJust simply getting a different job can be a nice way to ease into retirement so maybe they retire from their career and in and get a\nSimpler less stressful job that might not pay as much but gives them a better quality of life and while also preventing them from having to go cold turkey so to speak on K writing of the workforce these cases you know it's important to explore the income planning implications of\nMoving into a job with a with a little lower salary in and maybe keeping the same job but just moving to part time\nWell that's a good point because if you are making a change like that you do want to make sure that you would do explore those are the income planning implications because you want to make sure that you have enough to cover you know obviously the cover your bills and things of that nature and continue you know\nAnd if that's the case of well and certainly you're on the right place for that here on retire the right way to reach out to Anthony and the team of Tripoli five five seven Nineteen Ninety three to talk about\nUh you know retiring or talk about being a pre retiree a and getting on the right path or maybe you already are retired and you aren't quite exactly where you want to be maybe you need to make a change make a shift in the retirement strategy AAA five five seven Nineteen Ninety three is the number to call triple a five five seven one nine\nNine three okay now Anthony here's the more serious one that's a good defense mechanism both of those were were good reasons but sometimes people just say I just don't have enough money to retire\nHundreds visitors as they prepare to visit the area you train mixed news in one hour or online news talk Ninety four one dot com\nYou see the news on the hour sponsored by zoom video conferencing\nI'm Wendy Gillette ...
