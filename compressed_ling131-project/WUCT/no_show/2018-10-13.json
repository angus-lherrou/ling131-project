Michael ... there's a reason to make the case now that it's already too late for this that we can stop it that the escalation cycle\nYou there there's pleasure in the escalation cycle for too many parties China Russia to name too but also those allies who are not all that friendly say Germany or Great Britain already going through their own disorder\nAnd that uh with the American superpower weakened by internal drive\nA our allies and our phones believe they gain another word that maybe there a moment to take a chance\nAnd we're not we're not prepared to defend ourselves Michael were not an estate I I Do not know if the Democratic party presuming it takes control the house I don't know if they'll follow the constitution I mean going after the president with\nCharges of impeachment based upon you understand that that cost\nAnd I'm just organized to the point of not being able to defend it so\nPeople living in the moment who wrapped up in the beliefs that they are in charge\nOr we have less than a minute Michael go ahead I represent\nThe leadership those sorts of people or not I'm sensitive to nor are they going to shift in which the entire situation ships and there\nToday I

three countries from the Arctic Ocean to the Arabian Sea and that's Russia or either by John and Iran\nSo if the U.S or European partners went to conduct trade with East Asia over land and they went to avoid Russia in Iran all the trade has to go the wiser by John ... that's what makes us so geopolitically important\nAnd with this new port that they're constructing in Baku the new is just south

both\nHave a father who are are legitimate businessmen a barber and components case and in a case of really quite successful Baker who had bakeries and in the Chicago area\nAnd I think it was the end the ... influence of a brother or a brother in law Alexander Jamie who became a federal agent\nAnd the kind of um I think the melodrama and romance of that\nActual real life detective being in his life really uh really drew a next to it and there's also the element of him being a very very smart young man who ... who for a while it looked like he was going to be a lawyer and uh\nAlso you know you have the lawyers and doctors but he looks at law enforcement and see that things are changing that forensics is coming in and out of a level of sophistication coming into law enforcement to adding

view\nCrime at the business as a as an industry as a veteran so these two professional law enforcement and crime on a on a collision course in history\nYou know and they both died rather young

J. a good luck to you and your uh your series now that my my cardinals have been the dust why [laughter]\nMay the best team win and that kinda thing one eight six six five oh jumbo is our number one eight six six or five oh five four six to six on the ...\nI was noticing\nI ... a website that uh well it it has to do with the Christian persecution quite frankly and it was just looking at some of the ah\nSome of the things that are happening out there we we occasionally hear stories about this but you may not have heard some of this qualified [noise]\nChristmas remain what are the most persecuted religious groups in the world\nChristian persecution takes many forms of you can call them I guess uh [noise] you know hostility harassment all the way to uh to mob attacks in some cases actual a death\nThey haven't got all the way there's really not Iran or Sudan\nBut this latest the circumstance is just the latest example of what can happen when a country that falls into the throes\nOf a religious fanatics and that's the direction that turkey seems to be heading so we're certainly glad to hear that a river and Andrew Brunson\nHas in fact\nBeen freed and I think we can safely say he will never return to turkey which would feel like a pretty smart move on his part [noise] uh\n[noise] the court in Turkey had sentenced him to three years in a month in prison for his conviction\nA but since he had already spent two years in detention he will not serve any more time Brunson had rejected the espionage and terror related charges and strongly uh maintained or to the country that he had to gauge the no such activity\nAnd it it seems again that [laughter] it's highly unlikely that he did or that he would uh what it sounds like\nHe has another attempt at taking a shot if you will at a at Christians in this world and I'm just curious you are your thoughts about all this is this a a case of hyper sensitivity on the part of Christians as if the case\nOf a a exaggerating it would seem not by the statistics I gave a just a moment ago they were granted there are an awful lot of Christians in the world\nAre but there does seem to be a fair amount of persecution and uh what is particularly telling in many cases is the extent to which much of the world will look the other way [noise]\nAh like they're they're only Christians\nAnd that's a a an odd attitude\nUnless of course I suppose you you fall in with the identity politics kind of nonsense that well Christians tend to be a a rich wealthy quite western countries or some such nonsense which of course by the way it is not even particularly true but if it were it still would be a beside the point\nWhere or at least it ought to be a beside the point\nIs it is ironic indeed that some people in the west who\nMost express themselves with the the various freedoms that we have who make the greatest use of those freedoms are the least willing to defend them it it's ironic certainly if the forces of fundamentalist Islam or where to take over this country the people they would go after first\nWould be what they would consider to be the liberate teen residents of say places like Hollywood for example\nAnd yet those people in their mad quest to appear to be extremely tolerant uh we'll try to show tolerance for the most intolerant people on the planet just kind of bizarre just kind of bizarre most of the central tenets of western civilization\nOr actually nourished by the Christian Church\nChristianity has an unlimited record in this world certainly the or the Spanish Inquisition just to be one particular example\nBut in terms of a of a civilized influence and in terms of of the push toward personal freedom\nOr despite any number of of instances you can point out which are\nChristianity was not always on the side of freedom the overall thrust of it throughout history has been in that direction and the countries which have become the most free had been nations in which Christianity has been the dominant religious force and conversely the countries in which\nAre the greatest persecution has taken place with the exception to view a totalitarian communist nightmares like North Korea or the area of the world that is both consistently um free\nUnstable on wealthy would be the swath of territory from roughly Morocco across North Africa eastward through Egypt in the middle east and the further east do you get as far as Pakistan that swath of predominantly Islamic countries is uh\nThe armpit of this planet in terms of most ah\nStandards of uh of human conduct behavior and the living conditions\nAnd since Islam in that swath of territory is so dominant\nOr if in fact it were a pasture or a pastoral paradise you'd have to give him credit and since\nIt's not then so the blame must go in that direction I'm not sure exactly what it is but uh it's just unfortunate\nAnd uh again yes of course there are many fine Muslims in the world but in many cases it would have to be said that they are fine in spite of their faith and not necessarily because of it [noise] so I find it odd that there are so many apologist\nFor some of the excesses\nOf Islam particularly in that portion of the world where it is the predominant faith and so many people are willing to persecute or at the very least look the other way at persecution of Christianity which certainly in recent centuries has become\nA force and one of the principal forces in support of the notion of free expression of individual rights and the host of other things that could be put under the general\nA title of the western civilization\nJust a sad circumstance [noise]\nOne would like to think that the the release of the river and Andrew Brunson\nIs a sign that this is changing in Turkey a my guess would be it's more of a sign of the pressure placed on the Turks by President Trump and not necessarily a sign of any kind of significant change in their policies the Turkish government is moving\nPretty stride and Lee in the direction of an Islamic point of view not good for turkey not good for the region not good for NATO not good for Europe of course the tiny chunk of turkey remains on the European continent with the bulk of it of course in the in Asia Minor\nIt's an unfortunate circumstance\nAnd we're happy for Andrew Brunson happy for his release happy that in fact this story has had a happy ending but there's so many others that has not been the case and I'm just curious\nHow you folks feel about that one eight six six five oh jumbo one eight six six five oh five four six to six\nThere are many things in this world which ah get curious er and curious or as they used to say in the Alice in wonderland\nThat one of the central forces for personal freedom in the world that I think it's safe to say that that is generally true of Christianity or can be so persecuted at times and the ... and for the civilized world to look the other way as a persecuted\nWhereas a of a force which with the exception of the ... versions of a of a communism that still exist in places like North Korea there is no more despotic or I'm Free portion of the planet\nThan that portion of the world which is predominantly Islamic that is not a condemnation of every Muslim\nBut it is I think a fair condemnation\nOf the poorest of the world which is predominantly Islamic where are the home grown democracies of that area where are the home grown supporters of personal rights of the like uh the homegrown supporters in that part of the world for freedom of religion for example\nAh the answer is\nThey aren't anywhere they don't exist\n[noise] uh it's uh it said we'll come back we'll take some calls but it just struck me that while I'm happy for a river Brunson that uh this is a\nA happy episode and what is the remaining a a very unfortunate dismal and depressing world condition and that is the the persecution of Christians who are

for being with us on the jumbo Hannah Jones won eight six six five oh jumbo one eight six six five oh five or six to six with our guest David Thoreau founder president and chief executive officer of the independent Institute and be Eighteen to Twenty one year old's the youngest of the of the young voters\nThat is the group which has consistently or legs in an election ouch\nNotch voted uh they they vote but the the least of any any age group in the country and for reasons that I've never understood I remember casting my first ballot\nAnd I felt a a sense of empowerment or I can do what I got my driver's license which of course is another area which many young people can identify with with me in that regard but uh it's unfortunate because this is the method by which are people that have an option of this country and if you don't use that\nThat uh that franchise ... you'd be able to exercise your franchise we have trouble nobody likes the flabby franchise\nHe I think I think that's true um I Do think that this reflects the cynicism and powerless nature of their outlook\nBut they make themselves powerless I Know you don't you don't get involved you know what are the issues you don't register to vote you don't vote well who told is that you're powerless I Know ... ...\nEducation they don't have access to education American history they don't understand the world they live and\nWhere do I mean I Know and that and of itself\nBecause of the failure of the of the ... the school system um and that's when you know that's another whole issue of you know the case for educational choice and so forth um which I think it is definitely in the ascendant but it it it is a reality and so\nThat's why we were focusing on\nThe hook for them being the questions they were asking and the fact that they were not willing to trust the usual suspects does I guy so to speak and the uh sort of the commanding heights of the culture and that they no longer trusted\nThe political elites which is sort of catching up with the rest of the country but\nUh in their case especially now I'm millennials have left for college and are starting careers and families\nAnd so they have to buckle down and figure out you know how are they going to get through all this so they're look there's you know they're even more interested in in answers and practical way to get through this so uh that that was the motivation for\nUh creating the series and creating catalyst and so on so our our interest is to push this as far as we can uh we were talking before about uh the view that many millennials are supporting socialism\nUm and that people are like Bernie Sanders talked about the Nordic countries and you were you were pointing out correctly that these countries are actually quite robust market based economy is and to give you an idea that percentage of\nOf ownership I'm In this country is about Seventy five percent private of the wealth\nAnd if you compare that to say a country like China China is just slightly lower than the north in order to countries in and of course is a very robust economy despite the problems with the government so um\nThe uh I think the opportunities are enormous and just give me a further idea if you rank the um\nThe levels of private wealth\nI'm a bike country ah it turns out that Denmark has twelfth\nSwitzerland is for Norway is twenty third sweetness fifteenth I'm North Korea is at the bottom of a hundred and eighty us but the U.S is Eighteenth so the so the U.S is lower than Denmark and Sweden\nWhich is a remarkable when

educated or misguided in interpreting certain things for example um ... have been taught\nThat the great recession and in a two thousand eight was caused by greed and the free market and even though the reality of it is that the federal government created the recession because of the Community Reinvestment act that\nWas started decades earlier that created a gigantic housing bubble and that was not sustainable it burst and of course the usual response was taken which was\nTo have government bail out the different firms that had gone off um and took these high risk um investments which were essentially either mandated\nGovernment more incentive by the government so we don't have all realize that these kinds of um like comic examples of allegedly the failure of\nThat their cynicism about

I I wouldn't call it a subversive but it's it's certainly\nA outflank in the traditional media are it is it is true however that for the first season we had something around a hundred and one million views in the media and John just awful for example devoted one of his programs to love go than\nThere are many columnist wrote about it many other places are and of course yourself taking the time um it's something that is in is it it's in the sentence and I think that's the good news is even if it was something that wasn't getting traction them and and I think we'd have to reconsider\nFame into that we have a call from being in New York City who joins us now good evening Ben\nHow're you doing guys I'm actually not a New York city I'm On Long Island\nClose enough okay go ahead and\n... I don't really have a question I just wanted to say that I think you're going a little bit under any age category yeah with uh the home with the millennial thing because I'm thirty five but I guess that puts me at like the higher end of what a millennial is even though I I Would identify more generation X\n'cause I grew up around people that you know we're\nProbably the older generation that are now about forty and I identify more as generation X than than generation y which became a so called millennial by anybody that's an undergrad in college right now is younger than a millennial according to the math that say they'd be like Generation Z\nThat is right that new one that younger than that that are in the lending it was about twenty three by my youngest brother would be at the ... the youngest of the millennials and he's already graduated college and have the job so you're\nYou're absolutely right and you are a millennial you're actually in the the upper half tier of millennials which I think goes to the age of ... of a thirty eight now [noise]\nUm and of course these categories are imprecise you know there are many different kinds of millennials but overall there is a certain pattern to them and that pattern is not unique to millennials it is true with younger\nPeople as well so that when we developed this this program the original season one was targeting primarily college age and through young adults um you're the ... the second season is primarily focusing on early career is as the ... um\nThe demography uh so I think that it's a it's a very much as a way you're describing at one thing I should also point out this goes back to something that Jim was mentioning about the uh cynicism about millennials and it's also true with younger people as well\nThat ah even despite that um it turns out from very surveys that are about it's about forty two percent of young Americans including millennials support capitalism about thirty thirty three

Arabia\nSo\nAt this point he's got a I mean he's looking at a big big big big track I Know he's a billionaire but I mean about a billion dollars is still a big deal to him so are people putting money over their morals and ethics\nI thought that yesterday to some extent but the more I read and the more I listed in the more I uh find out who the parties are in all of this the more I think\n\nThat there are there's a lot of suspicious of finger pointing going on yeah you can follow me on Twitter the address Ed Sullivan radio or Jackie is I think you're right on there she says first turkey had a video of the murder\nThen hoops no we just have audio if he's been killed than turkey most likely killed him and we are framing the Saudis\nGlobal is don't want the United states and the Saudis to be allies\nThey want war and the U.S seems to be cultivating good relations with Saudi Arabia suddenly turkey comes out with this outrageous story and every global assist screaming for the U.S to denounce Saudi Arabia and to quote do something\nSo this this to me is a perfect example of stories where you hear one side of the story and you make up your mind that's it I Know who's at fault here I Know who's guilty\n\nSo I at this point do we do we dare wait for a little bit of evidence\nTo find out what's going on because again you've got two people that do not like each other in Turkey does not want the United states and the and the Saudis to be buddy buddy buddies\nAnd they don't want the Saudis to be a big partner with Richard Branson on his ah outer space companies\nBecause the Saudis are trying to reform and when you're trying to reform your shaken up a lot of people with a lot of money and a lot of power\nAnd there's a the knives are literally out so I think this story it may turn out to be exactly as first thought that they got him into\nBut I think we are a long way from a ... of knowing that\n\nSo now all these business folks CNN said we're out we're up but ... but but but will that Bloomberg oh we're not going to be partners on this deal nope but we're sending our reporters to cover it [laughter]\nSo New York times CNBC they're all running for the hills I don't

you make up you make your conclusions based on very little information and not a shred of evidence\nNo evidence whatsoever but you've made up your mind\nSo we'll see who actually goes and who doesn't go but I did a story that are that still buzzing around today I don't know why the news barrels kind of funny like I said that I get the television boats covering the hurricane because the the damage

we may be going in that direction you know we are Jane job but what I'm saying is these folks have to take care of their situation in their own countries\nAnd when we try we tried in Afghanistan or the Taliban or brutal brutal battle and that they absolutely brutalized especially women but everybody so [noise]\nReally Saudi Arabia I tend to Saudi Arabia and of the two countries between Saudi Arabian turkey Saudi Arabia is much better with women than turkey is\nAnd I just I just feel you cannot make a judgment on what these countries are doing\nIs between themselves\nI don't know what's going on that's the problem we don't know I suspect I suspect that that they killed him um I don't know though I have no proof I don't have any evidence I don't have anything now they have videos of some private jets landing in Turkey from\nSaudi Arabia and the names of guys coming from two teams have guys going from there to the Saudi embassy and do their head and neck and all the ... this wasn't\nA set up how do you know it wasn't propaganda and set in order to get this propaganda sent to the and I will aids and cause a problem\nI don't even know propaganda I mean if if the Saudi a citizen flies in a private jet I wouldn't be surprised if they went to the Saudi embassy\nMinutes what people do so I don't know what what are what how this is going to come out but I don't expect that the that the Saudis are going to say yeah we killed him that's not going to hang out\nAnd the Turks are going to be real happy to be able to come up with some kind of evidence you know to destroy the relationship that we've\nBeen trying to develop what they were ... they would love to you and\nYou know the women in Saudi Arabia have just recently been given the right to drive although that's a real hard cross to bear for their for their culture but the thing is they're moving a little bit forward and the the thing is is until something breaks\nWithin their culture they are not going to change and you cannot trust any of them anytime anywhere\nNo and so he breaking the the the printed break you know all these rules and allowing the religious police have been had been a barely pulled back women are allowed to go to sports stadiums\nAre so there's there's yes they're small steps but they're steps in the right direction and I presume that the Muslim majority Turks probably aren't

more competition weren't price reduction um so I just think we're starting to see some beginning signs at least you know in my business of a shift and I connect with\nA lot of real estate agents across the country and the percentages seem to be pretty consistent and\nA lot of the the bigger markets across the United states\n\nUh as far as ... well that's going on in New York City there's a ton of places for sale in New York City and prices are coming down so\nExactly yeah but I think you're starting to feel it yet\nUm but you know as as that continues going into next year you know first quarter and second quarter\nHave been up consistently for the last year and all of that that supplier or new houses is coming to marketing causing\nUm some challenges I I I think that you know continue its games of a housing values you're over a year or\nAre starting to slow and that directly hits Americans' pocketbooks\nWell what about the uh the interest rates because I've got a a story

don't want to get\nStuck at the top of the market um you know interest rates here locally or are averaging five to five and a quarter\nAnd as a direct impact on fires affordability so each time that rate is raised by a quarter percent or ... percent if polls the percentage of available buyers out of the market whether they just can't afford the neighborhoods they want to move into or simply can't qualify for loans anymore\nAnd the average interest rate hovers over the last thirty to fifty years around eight percent if you just look at that number it's still a pretty good deal yeah but in a market like California with\nHousing prices at or nearing an all time high that\nFive percent becomes you\nKnow a lot of money advertised out over Thirty years\nSure did too I\nThink that's everyone's just selling hold that's what I'm feeling I you know I focus more\nAnd I I just I've seen a just a paradigm shift over the last sixty that Ninety Days\nOf everyone just holding tight\nWhat about in

L. wildcard tournaments the full field competes both days with winners determined by the heaviest today catch the top six voters and top six co anglers will advance to the twenty Nineteen th marine DFL all American as can be held on the Potomac River Marbury Marilyn\nSo there's two ways to shoot way out there uh the ... method where you either need to target you arrange it you dial it up with a bullet drop compensate or put the cross air exactly where you want the bullet and break the shot that day one day to when you come back out we work hold over\nSo if you show up with a optic like a vortex by for where the uh the church is calibrated in in in quarter minute clicks you know for clicks two minute\nThe hash marks on the radical\nThey too are set up into him away hash marks so day one once we do the discovery and minutes of angle dial up three four or five and six\nThey too as a piece of cake it's a cake walk because you come back in and you have your hold over hash marks so I have to you all you have to do is go to your whole points you know and and do you hold over so at the end of two days\nYou got plenty of ain't point of an impact shooting with a dial up in day to you that hold over\nA hash mark points out to a five six hundred\nYards yeah so you're gonna you're gonna do you think of the school they're going to learn everything there is about to open up that gun and and getting out there exactly where you want to be stuck credentials and people that have hunted like me I have a shot up by gun since I was ten years old I've hunted extensively my whole life\nI've never trusted myself with a three hundred yard shot\nAfter visiting with you half a day that's a chip shot for me I have full confidence in that and not a problem at all the credentials even people shot forever\nOr you know maybe have never ventured out there to pass two hundred yards or a hundred and fifty yards a and there are different places they can go to do that but it's a foreign language to them they've never they've never driven a Ferrari before [noise] so why you Robert you got the credentials [noise]\nUm I I obviously we all have a starting point uh in in our shooting slash instruction careers\nAnd and mine was a military slash I trained with several people like Jeff ...\nOut of the past and some of those guys but I Would think that my my greatest a set of credentials as the fact that we watch people shoot for almost forty years uh and and I see a common flaw\nIn and shooters and I would say that that common flaw manifest itself and trigger management Paso over the years ah and it's been probably thirty five at the Texas pistol and rifle academy\nA Texas pistol dot com over those years we've learned that trigger management is the key to to the precision rifle program\nAnd we teach a surprise break method a ... with the crust three pound trigger a weekend or we we can we can send you out to your hunting environment so that you can ride the glory trained to the skinny [laughter]\nI like that and I said what you'd diverted from yourself and went to a year teaching methods but I'll say twenty two years US military special forces you have been on a range or two in your life and you've learned from the very best and you get a train\nOr some of the very best as well let's talk about day one when folks first come to see you or they bring their equipment they're gone they're optic [noise] uh what else should they bring with the [noise] we\nHave a list of equipment a on a DVD that we send out once the person confirms with us and and says okay I Want to shoot with you guys you know here's my credentials here's my credit card money about once they get booked in with us\nAh we send a DVD which reviews the necessary equipment or it will be used what we like to see in the way of optic or what we like to see in a way of a specific bullet that the gun likes\nSo that once they get here they're shooting a very tight shot group and that makes our job and our life a little bit\nTend to have the proper equipment\nBecause the proper equipment is one third of the battle so they show up here good equipment one third of the battle on the end the two days with us and and then we make them a pointed vein pointing impact shooter on day one in a holdover shooter on day two to five hundred plus yards\nAnd when they first come here it's classroom setting you're going to spend a considerable time I'm probably I'm guessing half a day or so in in the classroom or what are you doing there\nIn the in the classroom the first thing we want to do is we want to spend a little time with the individual and find out exactly what his objectives are\nUh you know everybody just a little bit different than what they want to shoot the position they're going to take the foundation shooting the bone support the most or all actually surprised break the trigger is all the same so number one\nWe're going to look at that rifle we're going to address the rifle to fit that individual we're going to make sure that it's pristine clean and push team dry and everything is good and tied on the topic and then we roll into our instruction on how to manage the rifle and how to release the Figaro break the trigger\nAnd we feel like that trigger management once you learn that but it will it will they will tighten that shot group for you a ...\nI knew that from friends that have been here and that's how I first heard about your friends who have been here said man you've got to go see this guy I don't care how well you shoot he's going to make it better and then I watch the video that you were referring to and man there's some more of my friends on there and I'm thinking we're about being all my buddies are going to see Robert all this time and\nAnd I haven't I tell you what we're going to take a quick break but then we're going to come back and talk a little bit about Dr fire and how important that is\nCertainly a if if if he recognized this the following name a that is is probably the most renowned elephant hunter that ever lived his Karen ... bill\nA nobody uh in our history set maybe call is half cocked or one of those guys ah Chris Kyle dry fired as much as Kara mo Jo bell did\nAnd Karen mojo Bell's claim to fame as I understand it is that he could place that shot in that in that in the front or or from the rear of the elephant and get into the brain so that that an elephant would collapse on its knees and the other bulls wouldn't be disturbed\nSo so he uh he he uh not only a drive fired a continuing she his whole life but he was able to position that shot and his subconscious mind would make that correction if the last moment if it wasn't exactly correct dry dry far as the key to it all\nAnd we're going to go

uh how important a piece of practice that is\nUm a lot of people are still under the misconception that if they drop out of their rifle they're going to ruin the firing pin and that brand new pretty ripe old are they just pulled out of the box is shocked and that's not true I\nI think sometimes that mindset gets a little conflicted with a collector type piece of equipment or collective farm a collector farm certainly you don't want to want to drive farm especially from the from the owners standpoint but from an operational standpoint I don't think you can draw far enough\nUh ... let's say

what they're talking about so have you got a lot of burning information they're the people go to and find out so you know the one thing we have a tendency to forget about sometimes especially when we go into the winter season is that bird bath\nYeah you bet you bet yes and we have\nA heated bird bath okay so it's not like you know you're supplying a spy for the birds and just keep the water or warm enough so that it doesn't freeze\nSo because they get paid and and of course they need water throughout throughout the year so um yeah they're great options you plug them and and I use mine all year because I just plug in and keep it out it's easy to use cleans up beautifully\nAnd um the other you know the other option is to basically go out and you know clean out the water every day or you know every morning if it freezes I'm the one thing you don't want to do is if you have a bird bath\nThat is porous so cement um are are typically the biggest ones there [noise] um ... you should put a I'm a bird bath heater in it and we sell those at the store as well\nAnd the reason being that if the water does freeze and then die and freeze it probably going to crack your bird path so if you have plastic you know the the heated bird bath or actually plastic in there I'm In the bowl and he can is um\nLike solid rock we've got some beautiful brand at for bats that you can use it you can put

knew decorative coming to you know as a blue glaze very nice right but I found out that the birds that was kinda slick didn't really land there and and go for the water like they did on the concrete one\nRight yeah that's a that's very true now you don't want to have a lot of water and the bird bath birds did not like water we say\nDeeper than an inch okay so if you do have a ball that has a deeper and deeper ball then then you can put rocks in it and you know that will allow the bird to sit on the rocks and and drink they you know they don't want to drowned and they can drown so yeah\nSo a very very important and again not only for drinking the water during the wintertime but for ... probably even more important for them as far as keeping themselves clean through the wintertime\nRight

basement as the same advice and we talk about the proper drainage improvements\nSo do that first and then in terms of the concrete itself\nYou can use a patch in compound quick ... has a patch in compound product you definitely want to use the patch in compound because it's designed to stick to the old concrete if you try to put new concrete over it it's not going to stick\nSo they're ready to use patching compounds are trial applied there latex formula so it's easy to clean up but that will seal the old concrete than one says dries then you can painted\nAnd what I Would look for is in the ... floor pain\nOr the epoxy paints I liked because there there are chemical fewer when you buy the floor paint you get the paint and a gallon can that's about three quarters spilled and then of course a partner you mix them together stir them up\nAnd then you apply the paint sometimes there is um an additive that goes in after the fact that gives you some texture to the floor helps kind of hide the dirt but patching it first than having an epoxy paint will have that looking like new in no time\nCarl fat\nQuick ... K. R. E. T. it's quick create concrete patching compound good stuff Mary thanks so much for calling us at eight eight eight money pet\nI got that region in Illinois and the line of getting some water I mean the foundation tells what's going to\nOrder or time I've got a ranch house where they walk out basement and on the walk out when you come out there is a retaining wall\nBut it was about eight foot tall were so house it hasn't really separate it from the house but\nThere is water they get in between that were on vacation and then they read it bottom on a heavy rain and then teach back into the basement so trying or a previous owner had this houses\nPut something in there like a call ... or some type of a hard time and\nIt's falling down too much\nSo this is our gravity situation so let's give you a gravity solution let's have the drainage work with you and not against you and by the way\nYou can see all this so the cows come home and it's still going to find that on its way in which you have to do is stop the water from accumulating so on the opposite side of this retaining wall I'm guessing that there is some run off that goes towards the wall and yes there is\nSo what you're going to want to do is is intercept that run off so we don't get as much water that collects in that area where we want to try to do is limit the amount of water that gets in that area just direct rainfall with no runoff that means\nNo gutter discharge no a runoff from higher elevations\nSo the way we do that is is first of all examine the situation and make sure there's no water dropping\nAt the high side of this work and work its way down if there is you've got to run a pipe underground to get it to a place where it's not going to interfere with ah with leads into the base and secondly in terms of intercepting the run off what you can do is installed something called a courting drain Richard\nIt's really it's a rather simple drain you might construct yourself\nYou dig a trench that's about twelve inches deep and twelve inches wide you put some stone in the trenches then you put a ... type on top of the stone surrounded with more stone play a piece of filter cloth across the top and covered with soil so it's all done it's invisible in the end of that dream that you just installed should\nIf they so the configuration of your yard will that will do is they'll intercept the water that's coming down from higher elevations the fall of the trench come up to the pipe and then run around the house as opposed to collecting in that particular corner\nIf we can keep the water from collecting in that area you will probably be just fine because it's rare that just direct rainfall accumulates enough water to actually leaving the house it's almost always the runoff from gutters and from drainage\nRight well let's just say I'll probably do get rid of land in this little green Bush along that well as well so\nYeah and that's a good point 'cause sometimes you can make the problem worse by having landscaping that traps water so just think in terms of water control here not in terms of trying to steal that water out to be in good shape\nAll right thanks so much for

you in any way that they can Tripoli five five seven Nineteen Ninety three and the other one is talking about one of your favorite sport subjects that is football\nI Know you're a big football fan obviously you're oh and went to UT and you just all around football guy and year baby look this time of year it's a great time of the year for us football fans because you can find it on almost every night right you got high school on friday\nYou got college on Saturday yeah you got to the pros on Sunday Monday am Thursday [laughter]\nSo uh for those folks out there who are not football fans maybe it's not so great but for us is so let's talk about little analogies between retirement planning on the football field\nAnd let's kick it off with the red zone I think most of us especially retirees and pre retirees they probably heard this term now it's been going for a few years in the financial side of course as well as the football side but let's talk about the red zone little but\nSure hit me up what did he get educated on the red zone well and and I'm\nSure those that are listening they understand that in football the red zone is the last twenty yards before you get in the end zone right so you spend all this time driving down the field and you know strategizing and my wife asked me all the time she's like why is that you like football so much and why is it guys are so into football\nAnd I said because it's almost like a chess match it's almost like playing checkers it's it's a strategy it's my Lebanon against dear Lebanon who can out think who and who can out plan who who can out strategizing and when you do you know it's like oh gotcha you\nKnow in case it all you know slamming into one another doesn't hurt [noise] well yeah [laughter] although there are trying to get rid of all that well they are they're they're trying to trying to better than other NFL into power ... yeah exactly that's the best of the conversation or another that\nUh but you know when you get down into that you you you spend all that time strategizing planning and you get into that what they call and referred to as the red zone it's within that twenty yard line and you're going to score touchdown and\nMistakes are costly at that point and it's and it's important that you make the right decisions it's not just\nTake a lot we although we do see a lot of times you know people will take risk that just happened\nOne nine nine three you can also check them out on line learn a little bit more about um at retirement specialty group dot com that's retirement specialty group\nDot com you could you comment on Facebook as well also retirements mess with a group on Facebook\nAlready Anthony's let's continue on with our football analogy who I share a football guy I'm a football guy utility let's talk about okay so we we kinda did the first half talking about not making mistakes right be careful and the red zone be careful when you go into the hurry up often don't try to play catch up and\nGet yourself in a sling so to speak or let's just talk about if you're doing well and you've got things because I Know we've been we've been preaching this lately here on the show\nThe market's been good obviously we've had a lotta fluctuation this year but it is you know it's still kind of reason it's in the mid twenties sixes are so it's kind of jumps all around\nSo let's talk about if you're in pretty good shape\nJust like in football if you've kind of got the game in hand what do they do they they take the victory formation right right yeah there you know the game's winding down they don't want to risk those turnovers they don't want to risk those fumbled or interceptions\nThings of that nature so they taking me and they get into the victory formation everybody kind of like a ... in a protective circle there around the quarterback right so that we dropped back he think no one can get to him so exact let's share an analogy how if you've got the game looking pretty good for your retirement some things to think about there and take that me\nWhile in football when you've got to win within the grass as you mentioned I mean they're very very cautious they're not worried about gaining yards you only care about protecting what you have right yep exact so that is what needs to happen in retirement planning because some times it's\nOkay to stop worrying about getting more money\nI mean for some unknown reason here in America we see a serious problem with greed\nPeople are like just a little more just a little more yeah uh and and I and I've got I've got a a a gentleman right now he and his wife and I I'm telling you they're they're well well into the seven figures and it's like just a little more a little more\nAnd listen you know as your financial advisor you need to take some of the cream of the top yeah and protect yourself and so you see that a lot in in in our country and I and I don't know why that is but it\nIt's just a little more and it's okay if you're listening to our show today it is okay to have enough money to retire on well\nAnd I know I think that's a great point because for some people and uh granted you know everybody situation's different maybe you do have to go after a little bit more depending on your lifestyle isn't that where the balance comes in Anthony when you're sitting down with you guys and you're talking you're looking at the lifestyle and you're saying okay you actually have enough to ... what you want to do in life\nRight yeah yeah I Know that that's OK exactly yeah I Know that you don't you don't have to continue to try to knock it over the centerfield plant\nYou know in in in another scenario to mark his people will come in and say well I don't think I have enough to retire and I and I'm really worried about it and then we run that financial GPS\nThat we talked about and we we put a good plan together form and we go you know what actually you can retire and you can retire right now you can do the victory formation now that's it that's it exactly and and that has happened in the past two months that has happened more in the past two months\nThen I have seen in the ten years I've been doing it\nAnd a lot of it is because people have these four one K. center in the market and these IRAs well it's been ... years or Avon fantastic oh yeah yeah and the and there and they've got enough money right now to retire and they just don't know that they they think that I don't because they they they have this concept in their mind\nBut at the end of the day when they come in and sit down and work with us and talk with us and we build them a plan not just gassing\nAnd we build them a play and then when we say hey guess what\nYou've got enough money to retire go ahead and retire now and let's go into victory formation and protect what we have\nAnd I think it's good to remind folks that a lot of times if you are in a good position where you can possibly retire and you could get into the victory formation\nPart of your advisors job is to tell you these things right now it's your money it's your thing at the end of the day and I don't know anything as a ... if you got a client sitting there saying yeah I Know I'm In good shape but I still want to try to squeak out more how do you handle that do you try to\nA show than the balance and at the end of the day you still do what they want or I mean what's the best way to go about handling the one of the\nKey word there is produced cheering courses those that's been following you enough for the past several years on the radio no that retirement special degree we are ... and and what to do sharing means is we have to do what's in your best interest\nSo we take all the emotion out of it so folks understand when it's your money and you save this this nest egg of money for retirement you're very emotionally attached to it and or and and so we take the emotions out because we're trained\nTo do share Li do what's in your best interest we have to ask the tough questions like what is your risk score and people look at us like a ... I don't know [laughter] and then it you know and will say well what are your current expense ratio is that you're paying\nWell that takes all the emotions out of it and nobody in and nobody ever knows Mark I'm telling you nobody ever knows and they they say well I I I don't know\nAnd then I and then we'll say OK well where is it you're wanting to go and then what happens in five years\nIf you're no longer here will say they don't they don't like to think about that now I don't blame them nobody likes to think and not about not being here in five years right\nIt's much more fun to say we are going to go on vacation and take a cruise and we're going to have a great time right exactly so so that's what ... do do Sherry's make sure that we asked the necessary questions to separate you from your emotions\nAnd we make good solid sound decisions based on your best and and it's not always being yes\nThat's that's a great idea that's exactly what we should do when someone says let's put Ninety percent of my portfolio into bitcoin [laughter] I Do whatever you know I think that right okay it's a it's a really what it comes down to as being a coach and that's how we're going to finish off\nOur football analogy here on retire the right way AAA five five seven Nineteen Ninety three huge number to call AAA five five seven Nineteen Ninety three and he's got a little frog and his throat here today I we've got him some water but it just doesn't seem to be helping but that's all right we're going to get three of the show we'll get there because you were a party and all week with your birthday it was [laughter]\nWife Maria heads you out on the town all week long I think she was just taking care of you and she was living in large had made party headed party on land party and now All right so let's finish off with the like I said this this coaching side of it now on ask you said earlier this week um this past Monday Night so this previous Monday Night\nUh the uh Drew Brees of the saints right he winds up setting the record passing Peyton Manning's right all time passing yard a great moment on the field they just destroyed the Redskins I mean he ... he was on fire but here's what I wanted to bring up so after he gets the record and and people were watching or not but people who may have saw this or didn't he\nGoes around you know he ... his teammates things of that nature he points to the fans and all that kind of stuff and he goes over any hugs his uh his his wife and his kids you know and he says to his kids you can do anything in life if you just try if you're just apply yourself but then he goes to his coach\nRight and he says All right so let's do this to win the game so they end his coach said okay here's what I Want you to do next they immediately immediately this guy just set the all time passing record you know how they're going to have all the statistical records when it's done\nAnd he went to his coach and said what do we do know what do we do next yep and that's what you guys do right you're asking people yeah and what I mean that was that was an awesome moment\nOh fence or how do you think of a sportsman\nHeck of a sportsman and I don't know how many people know Drew Brees but he also has special needs child mhm\nAnd and I mean just just a classic gentleman right I mean were they were they elected a New Orleans saints or not he's he is a total one hundred percent class I absolutely and and and like you said here's a guy right now that is that is very successful just set the record and goes to the coach and goes what do we do next [laughter]\nAnd it was really cute if you didn't see his wife actually the first thing she said she goes go in the game yeah he he just said these records and they've got the game kind of in hand already you know and and she's coaching them as well so you know it's really like a team right like you got to have a team around you to help you and support\nYou totally and in retirement planning some people try to be successful without having the coach at all they they think they can figure it out they think they can work the system and they think they've got it all worked out and and you know to some degree the market's been on a ten year on a ten year rower so you know everybody looks like a genius exactly you you know you can you can\nBe pretty uh I don't know what's the word here pretty you can be pretty common folk and and throw darts at the board and hit some balloons how's that [laughter]\nAnd ... and and then you know others keep the same coach that they've had for years and and even though things aren't working out for him but I still want to hang in there uh and then you find that others have the have the right coach to help 'em and they achieved their goals and dreams and so\nThat you know that's what happens in the retirement world and a lot of times I Know you know those that are listening can tell that\nYou know you want to start talking about it I get really passionate about it and\nThat's that's because ten years ago that's really what drove me into doing what it is I Do today I\nI had some some very close friends of mine that that lost a lot of money and back then I you know I was not a financial advisor and that's what launched me into going back to getting my my ... my my credibility your pastor license yeah and then that and that really lost him because I couldn't I couldn't understand\nZero ... no no not really oh okay well it can't it it can be okay it it really just depends on who's offering the bond at the time so a lot of times it's a state municipal bond okay state is going to do\nBut let's let's just say for instance that you thought okay I don't know I'm going to be real conservative here and say that they're going to live at home and go to the local community college\n'cause some of these private schools like Vanderbilt and\nA vow preys on some of these big Harvard and Yale I mean good grief it's sixty Seventy thousand dollars a year right right but let's just say your child wants to stay home and it's conservative go local community college and you think OK fifty thousand dollars\nIn four years in ten years my kids wouldn't want my kid would get through school [noise] All right so one option would be you don't care what the market does you don't care what the bond goes up goes down you just want to know that in ten years you have fifty thousand dollars to pay for their college\nSo you can go in and buy what's called a zero coupon bond so you might go in and let's just say that fifty thousand dollar bond now this isn't going to be exact I'm just using an example here of how it works OK let's say you go in and you buy that fifty thousand dollar bond today for twenty five thousand\n[noise] All right so you you say okay I'll take I'll take that deal All right so so you write a check for twenty five thousand dollars and that bond in ten years is worth fifty\nThat's zero coupon bond doesn't matter what the market does does it market could crash doesn't matter what interest rates do catch you didn't buy the interest rate you didn't you didn't buy the market so you can\nSeven year old child in ten years grandchild or somebody on our grandchild is going to start college now what happens if they don't go to college well you might be sad that didn't go to college but\nYou didn't lose any money because you only pay twenty five thousand for it now the bond matures in ten years and you get fifty thousand and the child might want to start his own business and become the next Warren Buffett instead of going to college gotcha so so that that would be one scenario what you would not want to do\nIs you would not want to be in the bond market\nIf you saw that you were going to need the money over the next ten years or Twenty years you would not want to buy a ten or twenty year bond the reason is because as interest rates go up bonds have a love hate relationship with interest rates as interest rates go up these bonds come down\nYeah Utah damned bonds go up I\nSaid you taught me years ago when the rates are high bonds die and when the rainbow bonds grow it's an easy way to remember\nIt right easy way to remember yep and and that's what happens in so you would not want to go into the bond market right now with these interest rates going up if you thought that you were going to need your money in five years\nBecause all of a sudden you're going to find yourself losing money now that's important because a lot of people think well I can go into bonds and I'll be okay\nWell it depends on what kind of bond you get and it depends on the longevity of the bond\nAnd it depends on what interest rates are doing the rating of the Bonn all those things right all the writing of the bonds and then you've got to and then you gotta ask yourself am I going to need the money or can I ride out the full ten year term die your term Fifteen year term whatever term bond you buy\nIf you can ride it out you're going to get what what's called power value so you're going to get that power value if you can ride it out so one bond that power is a thousand dollars\nSo if you if you put in a thousand dollars today in ten years that's going to be worth a thousand dollars\nBut if you cash in in three years from today and interest rates have gone up to two or three takes you know three quarters of a point you may find yourself only getting eight hundred dollar I\nGotcha okay yeah so there's a lot of it you know there's a lot around bonds and I guess I'll just I'll throw a couple of quick things out there and then I'll just ask you one final question you know that you know whether it's guaranteed bonds or income bonds or zero coupon bonds is Anthony ... mentioned a speculative bonds which we sometimes referred to as junk bonds those are usually those higher yield type of bonds\nThere's so many things out there and the bottom world do you first I guess the final question just would be\nUm do you feel as though it's a useful tool and as part of people's portfolios at something that you guys use as well and just as long as you're doing in moderation or or is it how do you feel about that\nYeah it's definitely part of the portfolio we do use some ah we we tend to lean a little more toward the bond funds because it's a little more protection for the for the client\nBut but we do it proportionately um so you've heard me say on the show before the rule of one hundred and one hundred monitor your age so if you're Seventy that means thirty percent or we're going to risk\nSo we would consider we would consider those bonds in that thirty percent risk of that way within if anything went wrong within five years and you and you had to cash 'em in and you lost money\nAt least it it was in that thirty percent category that that the of losing money so yeah so you got to be real careful and I think you brought up a good point there you know so many people think bonds are safe\nSo many people think bonds are conservative now if you can keep 'em for the full term than you'd be a hundred percent correct\nIf it were zero coupon bond and you bought it for that that grandchild or that child and in ten years you need in fact I had a gentleman in my office just about six months ago\nHe bought these he bought these zero coupon bonds Twenty years ago and the state of New Jersey and now they're coming due and so and so for that purpose it was the right thing for him\nThey're going to have to come in and sat down and talk with the do Sherry advisor in and of course we're we're fiduciary the biggest problem I see what people's procrastinating\nSo don't procrastinate you know pick up the phone come in sit down and talk with us and and get the answers to these questions is a bond right for you the only way we can answer that is come and sit and talk to us let us look at your portfolio and determine is is the ... on\nThe right thing for you I'm not anti bond I'm not anti stock market I'm just anti anybody losing all their money right\nIs it the right vehicle there's so many investment vehicles you want to make sure that you're using a portion of all the different things at your disposal or to get to your retirement destination and that's what the GPS does\nYeah it does and it and it and it's an education to about your money that that allows you to make the best decision for yourself moving forward I mean we found that most people don't don't have a real true understanding of of a really honestly about three basic things\nOnes I don't know how much they're paying fees and commissions because they're hidden and they're dealing with the suit ability broker and they've never told them what they are too they don't know how much unnecessary risk they're taking with that nest egg they've saved up\nBecause I don't even know what the risks Koreas and three they don't understand the tax implications of their retirement savings so you know we'll sit down with your will help you understand all of those issues and many of our listeners go through the process of course eventually some of them to become clients\nUh but others don't and you know it's not a requirement so it it's just a process that is designed that sometimes we turn them into clients and sometimes we don't sometimes we give\nFree advice and that's good that's helping our community and that's that's\nPaying it forward right so so it's it's a good education and then you'll learn but you know on the radio it's hard for you and I had a gift specific advice and
