eighty eight we started telling kids that you can get participation groceries and sports life\nAnd your ... your work doesn't matter for an outcome so they have unrealistic expectations of what their new place to look like\nAnd they just moved up their parents delayed until they get what they think works and if it takes 'til they're twenty eight or thirty eight that's what it takes\nWell clearly in your house that was the time when I don't know what's the timeline everywhere but I think that makes a lot of sense to me there's something has changed\nTo where you know ... it went from practice as hard as you can and you'll be able to with a trophy in whatever sport it is that you chose or you know a few years later it was just going to show up and if you don't get a trophy all yell at the at the coach and they'll shoot elite something there changed as well that that could have a lot to do with it it\nIs it eight nine for one pack said it eight nine four one Seventy two four seven what the hell's going on with the stock market we talked to a raging could associates Doug ... when we come back to the Joe ... show ... he'll be in a job at the gym ... [noise]\nSo when you feel good about the prospects what do you do you open up your wallet and in that regard I have to tell you this is really\nProfound to thanks [noise] first one is\nDebt service so that's just simply what comes in in income\nOr into a household and then what goes out for obligations like student loans car payments mortgages credit card debt okay read at the lowest level the percentage of income go into debt services the lowest level since the mid seventies and household net worth in this country such assets minus liabilities\nIt's a hundred trillion dollars a hundred trillion although I'm Hi yeah\nSo if my debt obligations are low if my wallet or purses is full of cash as it's ever been and I feel good about things what's the odds that I'm going to suddenly just stop spending money because the Dow drops eleven hundred points\nWell it's not affecting my spending that's a great question and it's interesting but you bring it up that way because I think it was two months ago maybe a month ago we were hearing the big box stores are reporting better sales we've ever seen ever restaurants we're seeing more people go out to eat than they've ever seen the big scene in two generations so clearly people do have more expendable cash\n'em but you know what the media does the media has the viability bleeds it leads and the stock market's bleeding right now that's where they are leading with it but when people generally watch when you when you talk to your investors to people that do you work with or do they call you immediately say oh my God what are we do or\nOr did they say well it's kinda crazy going to go out to eat now\nYeah so I you know what I mean nobody causes nobody calls me with their dinner plans [laughter]\nI'm gonna I'm gonna from now on with the British it I call 'em\nSo I Do get some people are concerned of course in that apprehension that's obvious and makes sense logical also get folks on the other side that are looking to do some buying but let me give you a little perspective so the market bottomed in March of overnight and so he was following the meltdown of oh eight and nine\nWe have had this is this'll be the twenty third but we've had twenty three now correction sense over nine five percent or more and they average I sent this out the clients this morning and just to give some perspective [noise]\nTwenty three times since nine that what we're going through right now is happen average decline as nine point three percent were down about ... almost seven now um but even today Joe I'm now seeing on my screen as I'm watching\nA in real time we're starting to see some of the stocks the leaders ah which were technology these are the names we all know Amazon Microsoft Apple Facebook companies\nUm we're down early today bend down hard this month\nBut now starting to sure I mean Facebook as an example and this is not a recommendation on Facebook but the stock was in August bit over two hundred and ten dollars a share\nOn the day but now it's green Microsoft same thing it was lower early today now that's turned up so it looks like we're starting to see a little bit of selective buying the average stock and this ... needle is moving but the average stack sense this sell off happen is down about Fifteen Percent\nWell pretty big correction yeah now here's the thing to you mentioned this it kind of in passing is too expensive is it over done the market is trading at about the price earnings ratio which that's just simply the price divided by earnings about sixteen probably right today's sixteen point to sixteen point three the twenty five year average\nSixteen point one so it's right words just rent them yes\nYeah you're not cheap so it's not like oh nine when everything was on sale but you're certainly not at twenty three twenty four times what you're saying she's were forty percent overvalued no we're smack at the twenty five year average rate now\nIt is a dog I Would imagine director and senior vice president Raymond James and associates a always incredible knowledge let me ask you something off the beaten path and and you know for Twenty one years no do you tell them you're not as smart as you so you're about to prove it here I'm\nLiterally has partly what do I do write a gas prices go down we're happy\nGas prices go down because the price per barrel goes down so we're happy at the gas pump with the price per bell goes down with the stock market generally speaking goes down and we're all supposed to freak out be angry that that the stock market is going down so\nAgain maybe maybe this is completely outlandish but should we get to the point to where we don't have these valuable resources like gasoline like liquefied natural gas like\nFilling the blank you know I'm I'm utility that we all need\nMaybe we don't have those in the stock market and the reason why I say that is we're happy when the prices go down with the prices will go down in the stock market goes down is I Would guess and it could be wrong but it's rare to see the price per barrel of gas go down and the stock market go up\nSo how do you feel as somebody who does this for a living and you've done for as long as I've known you when you do it very well\nHow do you feel about those being connected is it right just to have gasoline per barrel and the stock market or not because again it seems to be the opposite of what I Want I Want lower gas prices but I Want my stocks to be well\nYeah it's a ... that's an interesting question so you you really can't a separate those for a couple of different reasons a number one is you have companies like\nChevron and Exxon as an example yeah I'm right there publicly traded so they're going to be on the exchange just like home depot and apple are going to be on the exchange that\nThe commodity itself um oil in this case or natural gas as you were mentioning\nThose are inputs of course into a lot of different products right and so you have to have a market price I mean if you look at commodities you can buy cattle hogs oil natural gas platinum played in whatever it's all out there with a\nPrice I Want to I wanted to interject this though 'cause I I see where you're going to make sense but like you brought up apple let's talk about apple I've got an iPhone or I Want to go by the new iPhone right\nAnd Apple's stock dumped today Fifteen Percent\nThey're not going to drop the price of the iPhone tomorrow because their stock price went down but at the price per barrel of oil goes down to the stock prices go down to those oil companies I Am going to pay pay less for it at the gas pump that so I guess my question is\nIs it OK that what we actually pay as a consumer seems to be directly tied to the price per barrel which is for some reason in flux because of what's happened to stock market\nMaybe I vote is going to change price because apple gained or lost money today by phone as the iPhone that's what it costs that's what the plant is\nRight [noise] yeah okay so the or let ... the um battery\nLittle smarter than you thought I was a\nIt actually makes no sense whatsoever and I'm trying to [laughter]\nOh do you have you back home come home yeah yeah yeah so\nAt this year's us dissect the iPhone for an example we all know they have lithium batteries yeah so let's see him as a commodity right um so that's going to trade up and down just like crude oil\nThat's part of the cost structure for Apple now they might do things to hedge that input cost if they think lithium prices are going to run away to the upside because they don't want the iPhone going for um a thousand twelve hundred just because the battery went up by two hundred by right\nUm so it's kind of it's a hard question to answer I think the short answer is no ah oil is part and parcel to the equation\nAre both just as the raw commodity and then all of the ... of that which are directly ... energy companies but then more broadly plastic on an iPhone right uh well guess what that comes from where oil by show it's just it's it's just there\nWhy they gamble is in effect that I think the right answer is from the dumb guy perspective here the right answer is apple already mark set up by a hundred percent so if they're only making Ninety five percent Mark I'm I think they're still gonna be okay and that really is true it cost them exactly half\nOf what of what they're charging for an iPhone so I guess where you've got that kind of wiggle room you can you can survive in the next time we speak give me a favor let's talk about why\nThe price per barrel of oil is it lower for a specifically when we're exporting now more than we've ever\nExported and we're actually exporting now more than we're importing had a great question from a call yesterday who set of where we got all this oil why we keep on exporting it let's just keep it refunded ourselves and I know that it's a it's a global market that's why but maybe you can break down exactly how that works next time can we do that\nYeah you bet that's easy it is I'm Doug oh it's not easy easy is not easy for the\nFor the layman over here All right Doug gambler he's the managing director senior vice president of investments Raymond James and associates Doug always great knowledge thanks man\nJoe my pleasure back after this was the Joe ... writer\n[noise]\n...

opinion pieces that have come out recently that was arguing that we were we were doing wrong by making investments in increased capacity meaning growing the size of the Army Navy air force in the navy\nAnd in fact these are these other voices were arguing that the money would be better spent in in investing in increased capabilities more high technology and my argument was that was strong civilian leadership we can do both and in fact we must\nSo the U.S military has a broader strategy of both attempting to preserve the peace that currently exists which requires that we have capacity to have presents and all the areas where we have interest while also increasing capabilities are so that we have a war winning capabilities when we need them\nAnd so the argument I make in here is it's possible to do both it's it's possible literally to walk and chew gum at the same time ah but I think that there's\nOut there that attempt to say we either must do one or the other uh and I think there is some older pilot a cold um you know arguments are in the background that money would be better spent in other areas or that the physical\nEnvironment is getting to constrain with rising debt and deficit but you know we're in a great power competition and we either need to make the right investments to be able to survive within that competition or we don't we lose we decline\nAnd therefore area denial we had the ships to do it you know two eighty three fifty five what would we put a note three fifty five so they can deal with the Chinese aggression\nWell again we need to continue the investment in these high end destroyers which we just purchased a I had more over the next five year but we also know by need to buy those forget so you and I discuss on\nMany of them and what about air frames Jerry what what would the navy need to deal with the Chinese threats\nFor the navy needs to make it a significant investment in modernizing its carrier air wings in order to get additional long range or aircraft back on the carrier deck and I have repeatedly called\nFor significant investments in unmanned long range precision strike platforms in order to have the aircraft carriers be relevant up against some of the new modern standoff anti access systems with the Chinese and the Russians are employing\nAnd right now we have not done that so that is an area where the navy needs to make a substantial investment to bring new capabilities on the carrier deck in order for that the aircraft carrier or to continue to exercise influence in the future\nHowever the Decatur incident or we're not going to build a fleet overnight do we have the capability right now to deal with the increased ten grand aggression in the south China Sea or any of the passages in the first time and change\nRight now we're holding our own but just barely a so the\nChinese are building up rapidly and in fact in\nIn just a few years they will have a larger navy than we do a a larger navy that's not as capable but the problem that we face as China only has to be great or over ... in one area of the world right now which is essentially the western Pacific and into the Indian Ocean whereas\nWe still have to maintain security everywhere in the world that we have interests which is broadly\nEverywhere so uh our forces are spread thin we need to build up as rapidly as we can unfortunately

six five oh five or six to six hotline you'll find is a jumble had a show dot com you can\nFollow me on Twitter at Jim Botox is going to be talking tonight about parenting and a couple of terms that had been used over the years of one or a with some regularity the other one was a relatively new to me\nAnd we're going to be talking about that and the conclusions that have been reached by our guest Dr John Huber a clinical forensic psychologist and the chair of mainstream mental health Dr Huber thank you for being with us tonight\nWell thank you for having me on Jim I appreciate\nAll right the first term is a helicopter bombs or or helicopter parents and I guess most of us understand it is a term a referencing parents who hover over their children and in essence won't let them make the mistakes necessary to grow up and become adults but that'd be a reasonable definition or would you meant that\nMuch but that's a pretty good definition and ah I think one of the things that that they learn is that somehow they are at the very least they deserve things in life\nAt because their parents did those types of things [noise]\nAll right uh that's something else that it it seems to me that that the generation that has provided us\nWith helicopter parents or their parents as as a group probably would not really a about doing this sort of thing where the I mean ... it's hard for me to to think that\nBefore this generation of a helicopter parents that we had a a generation before that have parents that are essentially provided the role model for these people uh it it seems to me that these people sort of sprung up uh uh on their own ended the whatever their influence may have been\nThat it was not entirely their parents because I I don't think that it goes back ... that many generations does it [noise]\nNo it doesn't really I mean there's some there's some small groups of people who've always been like that but if we go back and look at our generation is a whole you know the the baby boomer generation their parents had to have had to scrimp and say and do without during the war and so\nWe found a lot of those individuals\nYou know the great grandparents great grandparents\nWould store you know thirty cans of core and even though the grocery store having three cans for a dollar down the road um and that generation said okay I don't want to I don't want to hoard things like\nThat so they started easing up a little bit that the greatest generation\nWas afraid of you know what happens if we end up in the same kind of situation again they want it to be prepared the next generation came along the baby boomers and they were like okay you know it's possible we lived through it before we know the sacrifices will have to make\nHearing myself I just got to say the helicopter and warm or parents sounded like the kind of parents who were glad they have their children grow up poor you know bubbles Tibet responsible\nNow you know I don't think you're you're ... exaggerating entirely too much there is a dichotomy there are some practicalities of course involved in that but I uh Dr Huber I I think that the Don may be closer to the literal truth and he'd like to think he is your thoughts Dr\nI I think he's exactly correct unfortunately what that pretty oh there is a an adult who is dependent upon the world for things and not just the permit that completely entitled they deserve this\nAnd you know I was taught right on day one I don't deserve anything I have to earn stuff to get anywhere in this world\nYeah uh what one would would certainly hope that that was the case I Would I Would like to think Russia to your your thoughts are done because I I think that it probably comes close\nTo here right now are you know I keep I keep hearing about about people like this I'm not sure that that I Know of any of these people granted I'd I I don't ... the the young people I Know my my that my my definition I'm Talking about a\nA parent's today's parents who are generally of course in their uh their their twenties and thirties and some of their forties or the\nOnes I Know which are not a a wide swath of humanity they're they're very definitely not this category I mean they they do discipline their children their children are expected to do certain things and yes that includes bumps grapes\nA failures of picking yourself up dusting yourself off and and the whole learning experience is there any kind of a of originality about this or a geographic concentration because I don't know that I have ever actually met a helicopter parent and much less a lawnmower parent\n[laughter] well I don't think it's necessarily originality I mean I I taught university from Nineteen Ninety six and killed two thousand was Seventeen and one of the reasons why I was glad to step away from that was probably the last\nYears I we get calls from parents go what do you mean my travel got us thirty on there that that I go well I Can't even\nWow and like what do you mean I go well you know there are actually federal laws against that they're they're adults I Can't disclose anything\nYou know and you used to be when I got thirty on a on a test I was in trouble today the teachers in trouble\nYes at at the university level not even at the high school level\n[noise] wow uh I had one flew flew in from New Jersey to Texas to to talk with me [laughter] about their child's grade [laughter]\nWhat a good heavens it well but that that does almost eight lay literal helicopter or this case an airline I guess a remarkable I'll ride a Greg in Springfield, Missouri joins us on the jumbo headed show with the clinical forensic psychologist Dr John Huber a good evening Greg\n... says Dr mass question are okay I've got I've got a one year old grandson and on kind of worried about situation the bottom of all I mean I don't even know if she'd be considered a lot more parent is something else going on I mean\nShe obsess taking pictures I Love him to death is if he stands up you know like he can only baby has ever done it and nobody even she won't even let them\nSit like my myself grab them laughing I physically go there and grab them because always on top of them they you know and it can't be around neither grand kids you know they're playing and they get in says there are there some germs you know it's like real estate and I'm almost worried about I mean it\nWell maybe you should be more than almost worried I'd uber Dr Huber sounds to me like Greg may have found an example here\nI might have ... I'm I'm assuming this is our first child\nYeah by the graves is a burden to\nOkay and you know first child you know they they ... they are at the store and they are in the living room they spent their pacifier out and you got to go stick it in boiling water for ten minutes before he can put it in a ... by by the time she has her third kid she's become dusted\nOff it doesn't matter if she didn't know where they get up out of the gutter and throw them out you know [laughter] so\nThat's the only time you get more dads that'll change how they will see jobs\nTo pass by she goes by and they won this law\nHow well All right now the ... and why is it yeah going going away with a hunter\nYeah reminder that you know you you raise the child and spoil the grandchild or if you spoil the child you'll be raising the grandchild\nYeah exactly as we go to the next call here as a Dr Huber I guess you do know the reason why ah grandparents and the grand kids get along so well\n[laughter] yeah they have a common enemy [laughter] okay a little cynicism there for the program I Love it to Tom in Port Angeles Washington good evening a\nGentleman that the uh one of the things that generate show adopt or a mob just the amount of legislation that's out there that you're the seat that the CDC that child develop but people\nIn in in the communities can get word of something in your your child got injured or you know did you leave the play in the yard and this happened or if they try to get the the car seat issue who you know do you have the right one for your head at at that age right there there there's a whole lot of stuff that that that\nYou would never even dreamed of as kids would be\nA and I'm like you're in my piece right [noise]\nAnd and my parents never would have dreamed you know that somebody would have a handgun\nAt the state or local level a show that's got to create some paranoia out there for the people that are remembering that they used to write on the front traders are fifty three Chevrolet pickup truck and hang out with the truck\nAnd the bad and the truck now yeah exactly you know are now\nAt and and and and it does no good things I could think of you guys go out ... ...\nWell ... are your thoughts are Tom uh to what extent it has a government if not imposed this on us at least encouraged is\nWell I'm from the government and I'm here to help and right and\nAnd what happens is you get you get a vocal minority of people and they go out\nThere and they raise this think and they stand up in front of school boards and governor meeting on our legislators and all of a sudden we have these things impose now there are some legitimate things that need to be regulated I I don't disagree with\nThat but\nYou know uh I've been involved in so many different types of court cases a forensic psychologist of people\nFollowing a pediatrician word to the letter a on a first child or something and the pediatrician assumed that oh you know they're an adult they'll they'll know they can't ... you don't wait three hours to feed on even though I said you know they'll eat every three hours and all of a sudden you get child protective services involved\nIn it because you know the kids take being taken up the hospital because hey he's crying all the time and the other they think oh they're not feeding the kids\nAnd the mother's like no I'm seeing them just like the doctor told me every three hours\n[laughter] and it's crazy [laughter] it's scary for new parents especially\nYoung ones and uh they they follow those rules and and what happens with kids they hit the public school system and they learn\nHey of your parents do this child abuse of your parents do that a child abuse and they start coming home and dictating the rules of the household and it's scary because there's no handbook that says what really you can do parents you know what you can't\n[noise] well uh suffice it to say it was something about it Dr Huber managed to be here and I managed to get here and other people in the audience managed to get here a\nCourtesy of parents who did not have that handbook either so I guess that the the old methods at least a do not to cause a ... a tremendous a fatality rate among young people that might be some lessons there to be to be learned from that we'll talk some more about this tonight this tendency\nIn the

find that said\nHaven't show dot com you can follow me on Twitter at jumbo talks well Michael is a history and yet\nIn many cases you could consider Michael is an ongoing presence the hurricane itself\nAs a broken up and moved on across the Carolinas but uh the aftermath well that still much here and now and uh we have proof of that in a course by the Clinton leveled who is standing by in Destin, Florida tonight and I gather that\nMhm [noise] gym you're right you know will hit the forty eight hour marks and Michael made landfall in Mexico Beach Florida not far from where I Am now a early tomorrow afternoon and yet there are still plenty of unknowns here\nThe search and rescue efforts are ongoing in fact they just started today because many roads are still\nImpassable there's people from the Panama City beach area who left who are still not able to get back in\n... there are so many roads blocked off there are trees down in roadways from Tallahassee all the way down close to the best in the area or the amount of damage that this storm has done I've heard it described as a critical\nUh as unlike anything that people from around here I've ever seen and people in these parts are familiar with hurricane\nI talked to a couple of people who surveyed some of the damage today they described it shingles 'em through the eyes of of in two sides of cars for ... they've described the different things freeze down on top of cars and things like that\nHundred and fifty mile per hour winds and they get caught a lot of people off guard not gym that the storm was coming\nBut that it kept ramping up as far as the dirty and when it hit it hit hard\nYeah I Know that a a Boston based a from a Kevin Clark and company\nAnd they produce models for catastrophes and they are estimating that hurricane Michael caused about eight billion dollars in insured law says that does not include loss was covered by the national flood insurance program it's a thousand million and that's an awful lot of money in terms of people\nWho are willing to return to their homes are just looking around the Destin, Florida area Clinton are people able to for the most part\nNot yet you know tomorrow we're thinking that it may be a little bit more realistic but still people in Panama City the officials that is our warning people who evacuated not to come back yet they're not ready\nPowers going to be out for a long time in that part of Florida and inland up towards Tallahassee is well we've heard several small towns in Florida have just been completely destroyed as far as downtown building a part of it laying in the streets and things like that\nAnd are they\nLike a law and more just remove every opposite go from their child's path eliminating the entire [noise] method by which kids grow up [noise]\nI mean it it sounds seductive Lee compassionate ... we don't want our kids to suffer [noise]\nWell I don't want them to ah to suffer from dreaded diseases or or a crippling auto accidents or anything like that or a sexual assault or a lot of things I don't want our kids to suffer from but the ordinarily bumps and bruises of life\nThe the day to day method of of learning by doing and by making mistakes\nThat's a necessary part of growing up as in fact that's the goal if you really want your your child to grow up that's how you do it that's how you grew up is how I grew up making mistakes\nI a good look back on on my mistakes in in various categories there are a few I suppose that I made that I look back and I still cringe about many of them I laugh about boy was I'd dumb [noise]\nA at a lot of them I can look back in a positive way and say that the wasn't fun [noise] but I'm a better person because of it\nAnd it sounds to me that there is a whole generation not everybody in the generation but but I ate a major subset of this generation the parents engaged in such behavior\nAs if they\nNever thought about it\nAs I say it is difficult for me to even conceive of any parent who who thought about this for more than twenty seconds to not be able to figure out that this was a terrible thing you're doing you're setting up your children to fail\n[noise] why would a parent what to do that I mean\nI guess if if you're not very bright\nAnd you could convince yourself not me but maybe you could convince yourself that you're being compassionate by child will not ever stop there to hope they will learn nothing I Will see to it that they go through Eighteen years of of formative life and learn nothing\nBecause every chance they had to learn how to get away and make sure that they don't learn to accept maybe they learned that a mommy and daddy will always be there to make it all better [noise]\nNot the way it's supposed to be and again I Am sure that not every parent does this I Know a few parents in that age group not a lot but the ones I Know\nActually raise their kids with discipline and with standards of performance and with punishment\nFor when they they've followed by the side with correct the behavior all the things that are yes hassles into and sometimes even painful for the parents but that's what you signed up for when you when you reproduce I mean yeah you're having a kid\nThis is what you're supposed to do it it interesting that\nApparently can't figure that out [noise]\nEverybody I'm Talking to right now talking with that one eight six six five oh Jim boat [noise]\nWe were all raised by parents who started out in life making mistakes who grew up who had children and they let us make mistakes\nSome more mistakes than others some lessons more painful than others but the general rule of thumb was I Want my child to grow up to be an adult so that they can cope I won't always be here\nPeople who are parents get older they die the kids were supposed to carry on that's the whole point\nI Want to produce kids who can make a go of it after I'm gone [noise]\nIt it just strikes me as I said I'm just wondering uh how you feel about that or am I to old fashioned them I stuck in the past ... lacking compassion for young people who should always be protected from every conceivable moment of pain embarrassment or heaven forbid\nChallenge to their self esteem\nOne eight six six five oh jumbo is our number\nOne eight six six five oh five or six to six I I'm just I'm just curious about it to me it is just astounding that this can happen all that there would be a few people like this year I mean in a nation of three hundred thirty million people you're going to have a few\nBrain dead do fire guy except that I'm not happy about it but I accept it but it sounds like\nMuch more than that it sounds like a trend not a universal trend to be sure but enough of a trend that you have to wonder are these people thinking\nAt all I don't think we're talking about parents who sit down and and and deliberately calculates this that's how I sabotage my child's life they're not they're not saying that to themselves they're not that they may they may be doing it but that's not what they're trying to do\nJust uh just sad and bizarre as I say [noise] life comes with challenges\nAs they say no pain no gain\nSome pain of course we don't want our kids to undergo other other types of pain I mean it's [laughter] it's essential it's essential one eight six six five oh Jim bode too well Wanda in Hopkins ville Kentucky good evening welcoming\nThe African eight and then I think the problem today that parents have become that channel day and then if you don't have to come back\nWe'll certainly the parents have become the children are in many cases I [laughter] I sound like nobody has become the parents [laughter]\nI think that's been passed in ... oh my God it and I'm not I think yeah and I love that they just wouldn't it would be unbelievable\nI cannot believe that no they can't stop no respect to go I'm I'm just about getting a raise and no response that God allows it's it's just horrible\nIt is horrible and ... what's worse Wanda is that it's entirely foreseeable I mean kids must be taught to be rational reasonable people are kids left to their own devices or are they will\nThey will produce some pretty frightening circumstances\nList is inside a yeah I mean they think their children to go out I mean I guess\nSometimes I just wouldn't even tolerate some things are just so unbelievable like where are these people put planet that those people come from some well what do\n... ... it's a great question what planet and they do they come from I I tell you wonder are they all are to read the lord of the flies\nA very interesting book a work of fiction\nBut uh it's an allegory there are the lesson to be learned in the book the lord of the flies it is what can happen when kids essentially grow up on their own and don't learn these valuable lessons All right to a bill in Walla Walla Washington hello bill and the welcome\nYeah hey how're you doing fine thank you will start your call here might have to carry it best to break but go ahead\nWell okay we'll CBS that gives the origins ... take it over\nFor the parents there's nothing you know parents can do\nCan do this so playing on their child because now the child is taught in school and everywhere else that all they have to do is go to a teacher and say that they were abused even though they might not ban\nAnd there he is just a big fan and he\nSaid well I tell you why shouldn't I gotta I gotta agree with you build it as a a situation that has gone way overboard uh we're talking here about

six five oh five or six to six on line by this a jumbo haven't Jones dot com\nAnd you can follow me on Twitter at Jim bode talks\nGoing to be talking to an item on something that I brought up before on this program and has long been my view the Congress has unconstitutionally abdicated its authority and the constitution and essentially\nHas passed along the business of law writing that who's to say tackling hot potatoes and building yourself on the record\nTo these unelected\nThree litter agencies and uh I've I've always felt that I Know the the reason for it because both sides are cowards and they want to keep the job and any time you tackle a serious problem\nIt probably is still a problem because there's some controversy attached to it and politicians hate that well that's what the get elected for was to tackle these issues\nNow I see that that thought has been flushed out in a considerable study by Peter Wallison senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute who has written judicial fortitude is published by encounter books and subtitled the last chance to rein in the administrative state that Peter thank you for joining us tonight\nMy pleasure good to be what you can\nAbsolutely out your thoughts if you would on on the witness trend really began and and how it has managed to avoid being challenged in the courts because to me it as it is a uh imminently challenge a bowl of there'll be such a word\nBut it's it's a very much challenge a bowl and I hope that this book will encourage the court to start looking at this issue but it really began I think in ... what was called the progressive era between the Eighteen eighties and about Nineteen twenty\nWhen there are many social and economic changes going on in the country\nAnd the people who are then progressive is led by Woodrow Wilson and Theodore Roosevelt\nThought that the constitution was just too rigid to deal with all of these problems\nAnd so we had to make some major constitutional changes apply to a lot of smart or a ... ... people who had no interest in a particular issue but we're credential than an intelligent and we make decisions on the basis of what is best for the country\nAnd they thought of those people as it ministry leaders and officials of the government they wanted more such people to be put into place in the federal government and make many more regulatory and administrative decisions that was how it all began\nAnd uh it has developed since then through a whole series of decisions made and made in the government and made by the people in ...\nWe're glad you're with is on the jumbo had showed one eight six six five oh Jim bode well eight six six five oh five four six to six\nWell I got to say it's about time and the thank goodness for Peter Wallison senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute\nWho's the website ... H. E. I. dot org something needs to be done about this tendency of Congress to pass the buck to the other like the bureaucrats and those three letter agencies and elsewhere but the three letters or a good place to start\nOf essentially writing general outlines of laws and let the agency spilling the details right the laws\nAnd uh I'm going to be done about that uh we have a call from dark who calls in from Wilmington, Delaware to speak with our guests are Peter Wallison than the good evening doc welcome\nThank you for taking my call is August ... just a one or two quick questions for his a metro also all hell just genocide list it of course I was always\nMr walls and where do you see this court has got to President Trump on her opportunity under justice Gorsuch can duck you have it all and it started out justice appointed a say a second jumped are treated us why did\nYou see this court filing turning back to the out of the cameras are not are you hopeful for the future it out or what are your thoughts on that sir\nYou did you have two questions that that was just that was ... where do you see the court going on to these justices and are you all over the future that we could turn back the tide or I Would say almost fifty years\nRight very good at what drives you do see it go again in other words I yeah I Will go to Jim Cavanaugh tip the balance and to actually show some judicial ...\nVery very hopeful I'd add in the book I talk about the position of each of the justices but I say that with the appointment of Kavanaugh there are five justices on the court who I think are ready to modify some of the major decisions that\nHave led us to this position I'm the one that is most important here is one called ... the Chevron case or Chevron deference where the court many years ago in Nineteen eighty four\nA declared that the lower court had to defer to the to the interpretations of various agencies of what powers they had been given by Congress that's very strange because it leaves the courts out entirely and so\nThat that decision in particular has been a warrant for the agencies to increase their powers tremendously and interpret the authorities that they had gotten from Congress or to grow their powers now with cabin or they're\nHe's a constitutional list he's a text you list\nJust just like Gorsuch is\nAnd the other three people including especially Justice Thomas who I I dedicated the book too because he has always been concerned\nAbout this question and now he has four other justices I think on the court who are ready to take the steps that Alexander Hamilton expected them to take when he wrote that ... that the federal is Seventy eight paper that I've that I've named the book after\nA ... it's a remarkable you know I understand Congress being leery of hot potatoes it's cowardly it's chicken but that is understandable they have to face the voters the courts don't want her to be so reluctant about\n[laughter] [laughter] I think they really are concerned about not having any a direct support from the public\nThey don't need support from the public you know what I mean we don't even know what I'm saying with the public they they have their own circles for cocktail parties in the like [laughter]\nI agree that that there is of that but Alexander Hamilton was right and when he talked about fortitude because he was saying yes okay the courts are independent and the reason he was writing about it is because he had he had been asked why are you giving the courts\nThe judges lifetime appointments in this democracy\nUm why shouldn't they stand for election and the argument he made in this federal is Seventy eight is\nThey need lifetime appointments so they can stand up to the elected branches in a democracy the elected branches the president that Congress are bound to have more power because they're speaking for the people the courts are only speaking for the constitution\nI'm so they had been since that\nThose decisions in Nineteen thirty five\nAnd the effort by the president after that to a point seven new members and that's changed the entire nature of the court um they had been reluctant to take on the elected branches so that I think is a reason and we have to get the courts to start doing\nThat well we certainly do Alan on the road in South Dakota denied believe me\nThanks for taking my call sure [noise] I just mentioned just turned it on here and I didn't have an [noise] but uh do your guests mentioned was you know he said that uh\nWhere Republican Mark sooner agree with you know kind of timeframe when he says the problem started you know it's also or\nYou start became you know people start calling us democracy and not a Republican I since then I've heard your guest said several times referring to our democracy\nWell I mean look we have a representative democracy that's why although and maybe that's because until recently it has not been technologically feasible for us all to have one great town hall meeting or we will now of course read the point where that is technologically feasible or they would be a terrible idea\nOr we can even talk about that a bit later on but but the point is we have a representative democracy about is the republic we elect people who make these decisions about how it works or anything you want to add to that a leader\nYou know I think that's exactly right I think ... many conservatism afraid and I'm certainly one of them many that many conservatives are afraid of the term democracy but we have to understand that the that the founding fathers actually thought of the people go running through\nThe legislature and the legislature being elected by the people would make the major decisions that is still a democratic structure and so\nConservative should not worry about calling something a democracy\nThat democracy that the founders didn't like was a democracy where ... which is called the direct democracy where the people make the decisions themselves immediately in in in some kind of um ... uh a conference or structure but that's not what we\nHave the old town hall meetings in the ... is a good idea that's right but we'll we'll get we'll come back to that as time allows but right now I'm calling from Sharon in ... Missouri hello Sharon oh\nGo ahead yeah again Mr wants and maybe I Am way off base back I'm\nMarried and movement can have a constitutional convention and one a couple of the things that I Hope comes out of it if we do have one that we had ... term limits for the legislative branch and me reigning power of\nExecutive orders as the president now if that is Dan\nAnd the legislature cannot uh doesn't have to worry about running for office and is there like it\nWould that change that balance so that the courts possibly would in any stat that to the plate a little bit more because it's like you would have to take more responsibility All right\n... ... the way the way I see it in the way I discuss it in the book is that if the court actually step up and say that certain laws that Congress passes have passed too much legislative power to the executive branch if the court to ... ... ... would actually say that\nThen that would force Congress to make these decisions itself the ... for Congress as Jim had said before is that it's too easy for them just to pass on to these agencies all of the major decisions\nAre having to be made for the ... like I'm going to break that does it move here so we will amplify on that but when we come back\nAnd take off your Saturday here coast to coast\nNothing but football all day long for Lincoln bills SEC Saturday\nOn football from the FCC the

regards to the lion murder and\nGain well before we go too far off the deep end of pizza there ah I'm not sure that anything that has been done in this particular case a illustrates the point that we're making tonight to Peter in in that uh if in fact Congress went along with it however a wise or unwise that decision may have been\nUh it wouldn't be a subject that we're talking about tonight I don't believe that\nNo not unless it was an action that was the rise by Congress this is exactly the kind of thing that could happen if Congress hasn't authorized it um and one of the problems is that this very general legislation that Congress\nPasses sometimes allows administrators even conservative administrators to take things into their own hands and do things that Congress had never intended\nExactly it is that in fact that's what we're talking about them that would be unfortunate but if there were specific authorization by a majority of both houses of Congress it\n... it or a ... in other words if the authorization will specific enough than you would have had in effect a law uh presumably that was passed Gary into Butte, Montana good evening Gary\n[noise] getting ... thanks for having me on the shores pick up things and then get on on your your I agree with\nAlmost everything your guest has said I'm a minor point I I Believe we should call it a constitutional Republican and instead of a Democratic Republic but that's my\nMy ... years and I think it really is we're getting into some addicts federally\nYeah yeah yeah it it does mean something to me but I don't have the time they fit to explain it on your show but anyway um and then the\n... the main thing is that I wanted to call about is the constitutional convention and that is something that we definitely do not want to do there's there's conservatives out there that want to do this and think it think\nIt would be a very good thing to do but I I agree with your guest it could be a runaway costs just ... read the history of our convention they weren't supposed to um go often right\nOh yeah but you're not going to get anything that would be authorized but it's such a convention that could take effect without\nActually having thirty eight states ratify in one form or another let's not forget the articles of confederation were falling apart at the time that that happened and I would I Would just add one more thing if in fact we don't go that route\nThen most of the major changes that need to be made right now being term limits of Congress be at the no budget no pay for Congress be at a a an amendment that would say the Congress may not pass a law that affects the general public that doesn't affect them equally all those things you can forget about\nWe are at an impasse and the mechanism as exist has currently been used it's already it's in the constitution but as it has been used today we're all amendments start with Congress than we can forget about any of those things ever happening a\nBeauty let me add one thing they're ... and I think much of what you said is something I agree with but\nLet's focus instead of having an argument about whether we should have a constitutional convention let's focus on something we can do now because I think we are headed for some serious trouble unless we start raining in these these bureaucracies\nBut how do you ... how do you persuade short of of of some method of of of force ah ah how how do you persuade the uh current judiciary and Congress from changing a path that they have gone down for decades and which they're quite happy with I mean so they're not going to just suddenly say\nIt was these people are going to have to drag them and I don't know how you do that just by saying please read this book is a great read but I don't think I'd want to do\nThat may suggest this and I I I agree that it's tough but we have five members of the Supreme Court now who are who are willing I think to take exactly the position that I'm advocating in the book\nAnd in fact judge Kavanaugh now justice cabinet all said and in that decision and twenty Fifteen when an agency went beyond what are the ... the statute authorized\nBut he was over ruled at the at the court where he was then serving but he said look when an agency take steps that are not authorized and its statute they have to go back to Congress and that's exactly what I Am talking about and I think we have five members of the court now who are willing to do that\nAnd that would immediately cut back on the on the growth of this

go over in coverage is that anybody and I know he's a big celebrity and all that\nOr is it the the Jekyll and Hyde the fact that the\nThere you know rock Kanye West is always thought of is some sort of left the guy but not any more all of a sudden he's become a righty at least in favor of Donald Trump\nIs because of the fact that celebrities don't like Donald Trump but this guy does\nWhat was the reason why he why did Kanye West go why did Donald Trump invite him why did the media cover him is I'm a full force phone number is eight five five to nine five\nSixty six hundred Margie Santa Rosa California Hello Marjorie\n[noise] saw a great topic huh try I I think um [noise] but all the world loves a a train wreck\nAnd that he's going to be entertaining no matter what either they're going to be there when he says something profound or you know if they can run west or you're going to be there for the last year and a bizarre situation um to me seems pretty sick in rambling\nAt times though I think he has a very good heart I just think he's extremely and articulate and why Donald Trump with one and um he obviously has some caught with with voters I'm involved with salesmen and Kanye is to\nSee that in his own strange plant yeah\nAnd I'm a ... it's it's\nThat whole thing about experts and stuff that's so disingenuous you know it's like [laughter] you know the other side wants to use him as well if he's not good to them if he's not pushing their agenda each and every second then obviously the man is totally ill that needs to not be this you know listen to his totally discount it\nThey were there in full force the media in a mean overboard in full force in the oval office are so obviously uh he he was\nEnough for them to to send all the people over and make sure uncovered this whole thing is there something you know how we talk so many times about a look over here is there something we're not supposed to be seen over there that this is a distraction\nI don't know what it would be costly [laughter] well\nI I just think that ... is is at this time of race is very very um nobody is calling for\nA piece you know we don't have any more a\nPaper him Martin in John type songs at nothing to bring us together and it's all about the differences in how they should be celebrated and how there should be actually put substituted for other people and I'm really strange situation that's going on I think Kanye is\nDefinitely a person in danger\nOr they're either going to make him out to be a total total insane person or um you know he's going to be some sort of God that's going to save us all but I think he's too independent thinker into erotic they can't control him\nRemember what year that was when Taylor Swift one her one of her first awards but that was a long time ago when he was he was out of control them so he does his own thing but he doesn't care\nThey want to remind him up they know he's a weapon they know people listen to him and they you know it was fine when he was like this or that white chicks and jumping up and doing that and he tried to do that the next year to back as well and he let it you know\nDid he really ... years in a row that was yeah yeah you know and and that's okay because you know you know it was him oh yeah yeah yeah it should be out say getting it all you know [noise] but now that\nWell he did he did the George Bush hates black people thing and\nUh\nI don't know what that was about either well I think that's\nKind of a bit of a choice as far as I'm concerned that stuff you know I think [noise] somewhere in between his extremes is really the truth of America I think you know what I'm taking my production right now is is just how this is going to come out is how\nTruly people will be treated in the future\n...\nBecause uh you know once you start in on an addict and once you start going down that path then they're going to ... him then they're going to do you know it's gonna\nOur life that they sell because there are opportunities that are looking to as yeah whatever\nThey want it banned sure and they'll jump on and nice things to support it\nThey will get on your own yeah they will get Tanya on the train or try and get on who's trained more to go to Margie I got to run but I Do appreciate your call very much phone number here is eight\nFive five to nine five sixty six hundred it was quite the seen\nA lot of people scratching their heads including me going what was that all about and why was the media gets so upset why were they there enforce\nNews talk Ninety four point one\nFor the elected President Trump you know ... and I think boy Jim Brown along when he was seen Harvey you know showed up at Trump Tower you know showing their support right so right in the first time he popped up you know as far the Trump wagging you know but I'm now going as far as well right\nNow he he was all over the place I Believe you touched off some good points but it kind of just came out just you know literally everywhere are now barred the media I kind of feel like\nThey were trying to find anything pretty much to incriminate um as far as I think the media could have been criminally believe Robert calling you complete a\nCall ... okay you know they're already calling them\nYou know the token anywhere last night I Believe so I feel like they you know a lot of all your Louis\nDid one of her dad who called them the token inward\nA CNN you didn't know about that\nNo oh he's an expert at the media man\nA man I I I Need you need your help I Can't keep up with everything is that was that the dog is really\n... down and things yeah so um\nSo it's far from being there it might be stripped cheese or you know I went back and think of like some type of just how you figured maybe look over here here might be something uh as far as long as those lives 'cause honestly\nYou know I I've been a liberal my whole life man I I was tired I don't listen to you in a rush hour in Sacramento completely changed my life and I didn't even know as far as the history of the Democratic party but it's the history for me along with cottages off putting\nAnd you see what I Want to ask Chicago how bad it was because the old Democratic Party was like a ball man [laughter] oh the big wakeup call for me Yes sir and\nYeah so it out even just with that information he will probably eight hours say look out for his all do that because they like it you know they don't know that just called them out you know take on it and also to um [noise] I'm I'm On I'm On a person that you know this one from top rap I don't know why\nBut let's listen to the track on his um um the uh the life of Pablo\nIf you practice cause pain pop was called San Pablo track of the very last on that album so he's kind of putting a little closer near about you know like the media here in the ... or something of course there I don't know if they do and like I'm I'm\nSome but he was pretty much talking about the media and I even go back to like listen why wait a minute light whopping is actually you know speaking on something so I'm now\nThat that's a\nThinking about doing it right but he\nDidn't know about that that's the thing about rabbits not a you know it's not like some old love song I mean there's messages messages\nI mean it oh yeah big time so I um he gets a buddy buddy buddy make black people all upset because slavery was a choice as some of these other things that just drives people crazy about him [noise]\nWorld to me personally they don't go back and look at this stuff\nAnd it was like they do kind of quick to jump to conclusions through the ... of the way they just don't check on their own research just a\nNo vote I don't know but when I hear that light how dare you say well yeah yeah go check it out like you know\nBut you did on a different way but you know it is because I think he clarified I think a little later I don't think they got much coverage but the clarify what he meant\nSo All right well what I\nAte Brendan thank you always good to hear from you appreciate appreciate your call yeah this uh Jim Brown by the way was there\nAnd he sat\nNext to Kanye but I don't know if he spoke or not I'd parts that I saw he did not\nHave anything to say but\nThe the president a compliment to Jim Brown is being probably if if the that he was like just dug back in the day to

they're given a rip\nAnd Kanye West ended up speaking almost ten minutes kind of a stream of consciousness sometimes it'd make a whole lot of sense but most of it had to do with his belief that black people need to rethink their assumptions\nAnd that the police have a job to do\nA and he did not like the idea of this knee jerk\nPulling out the race card and he's being hammered\nBeing called a sellout being called an Uncle Tom\nSo real meat is\nPresident Trump is a bigger piece of racist because that's why people are he invites Jim Brown and Kanye West into the White House he's ... he's racist and he's a big and doesn't like black people\nSo it doesn't matter\nI look at this a reaction to what\nKind of you with that and I'm going to talk to you about what they said on CNN about him with Don limits that calling him a token negro won the commentators called him a token negro another one said this is what happens when negroes don't read now calling a black person a negro in the year twenty Eighteen as a slur\nAnd I guess these black commentators believe they can get away with it because a lot of white people don't realize calling a black person a negro in twenty Eighteen is a result is offensive\nIt's something that you say when you want to put somebody down\n'cause that's what they're doing the getting away with its bigotry\nAnd Kanye West\nSays he grow up without a father and told a President Trump today in the oval office how much that bothered him\nAnd it is far and away the number one problem in this country the number one problem in the black community the large number of kids growing up without fathers\nClose all the other stuff people talk about all this other nonsense\nFar and away\nAnd you have somebody calling us you can call them uneducated you can call him a not terribly literate calling what you want at least he gets the big picture\nHe also understands that there's a connection between the welfare state and the demise of the family my friend Walter Williams and Thomas all have written about the\nBlack family after slavery a black kid was more likely during slavery to be raised under a roof with the biological mother and biological father than today\nAnd after slavery because\nFor years it was illegal for slaves to marry\nIt was a huge uptick in Mary and if you look at census reports Eighteen Ninety Nineteen hundred Nineteen ten a black child was slightly more likely\nTo be brought into the world with their biological mother and a biological dad under the same roof than a white kid more likely and then along comes the welfare state and dependency\nAnd the LA Times asked both poor people in non poor people questions about welfare and about dependency they asked the question to Nineteen eighty five they asked him again or in twenty sixteen\nDo you believe welfare creates dependency or do you believe it is a stepping stone to get you on your own two feet\nAnd they asked poor people in non poor people those questions forty one percent of people living below the level of poverty responded welfare creates dependency and forty one percent felt that he gave you a stepping stone or to get on your own two feet so as many poor people felt that welfare which harmful\nAs felt that it was helpful\nSo don't you think maybe just maybe that's worth looking at best a topic worthy of discussion as many poor people think that welfare is bad or ethnic it's good\nAnd about eight percent or so have no idea I don't have an opinion one way or the other that is a boatload of people on welfare who believe that it's created dependency and that's what Kanye West was talking about\nYou don't think it's worth having the conversation of course you don't know if you're on the left because you look into the mirror and say oh

what's going on with the California DMV as a result of this motor voter law\nWell you know the ... it's kind of picking on the DMV kind of like shooting fish in a barrel I mean the envy\nThey're going to the DMV it's like a cross between a a bus station and the Soviet red line you know the five six hour wait we have now so\nWhat I thought was if we're doing a motor voter what worse agency could you can you have to ah to deal with this stuff in the department of motor vehicles and you know no\nNo government agency or the pretty good job with databases and the DMV is notoriously awful and basically everything it it it does so now we're going to allow the DMV to\nRegister voters and this was in a state where and I'm not against having driver's licenses for for non citizens just for practical reasons\nBut it could just see the problem coming right and I wrote a column for the union Tribune\nBack in two thousand and Fifteen when this was proposed and was of course accused of of being a racist or by now we see all these sorts of problems so we've got a thousands of of\nA voter registration so you know the the DMV reported last month that it be twenty three thousand voter registration errors resulting from\nWhatever they they blame it on other Fifteen hundred ballots\nAre potentially a you know mistakenly registered by the DMV or the DMV insist that no that legal legal immigrants of as a gotten them but it looks like some potentially some non citizen tests\nThat are gotten these these ballots and then the the LA Times look at a software that they may have been Seventy seven thousand voter records that were misreported\nSeventies that was always use me Seventy seven thousand\nSeventy seven thousand that were misreported to the DMV and some cases allowing duplicate valid in other cases um the DMV seems to inexplicably have changed the party registration of some voters so we've just we've just got the total mass\nAnd uh you know it's become it's a big scandal that even the Democratic controlled California's somewhat of a scandal and the uh you know again the DMV insist that uh you know a legal\nResidents have voted or whatever but you know it's really hard to uh it's really hard to trust trust what they're doing and this comes against the backdrop of you know with the ... id law\nWhich is the federal law mandating you know new driver's licenses that to where people provide a you know ah information so that the security going airplanes\nWe've got these enormous backlogs\nAnd the DMV had these huge commercial license backlogs of the drivers would go through school they get they get a job and then it would take months for them to get a commercial license just because the DMV process so how do you allow these folks to be in control of a voter records\nAnd then the law when it was passed in two thousand and Fifteen one of the big problems was um you know it had some amendments to it\nUm where you're not a lot where really limited the ability of the secretary of state to check out the ah the immigration status of the of the person or you know who who is being registered\nAnd in that law said if a person as as quote if a person who is eligible to vote becomes registered to vote by operation of the California New voter motor voter program\nThat person's registration shall be presumed to have been affected with official authorization and not the fault of that person so if you accidentally get\nRegistered and you're not eligible to be registered to vote it's presumed that it's not your fault so it's just we're just looking for trouble right\nSteven Greenhouse gases article surprise DMV may have registered non citizen voters Steven I was not in favor of illegal aliens getting driver's licenses and I was called a racist you are in favor of illegal aliens getting driver's licenses and you're called a racist so I'm not quite sure\nHe's on immigration are really quite you know quite ... courts are being towards bloody as many people and that's that's possible uh provided they follow the rules so I'm not exactly you know some kind of immigration restriction is the ... yeah I I you know I get to we all get it right\nNow uh again if somebody who's an illegal alien inadvertently gets registered to vote and she er she votes what happens to that person\nWell according to the law nothing nothing to do that unless as much I guess you'd have to prove that they could still will forty uh but you know basically when I pass the motor voter laws and I I'm against those in general\nBecause look if you can't go

get to suicide typically how often we get paid our company decides that\nBut the issue as with so many Americans living paycheck to paycheck um you know you might have an unexpected bill you might have something else come up before your paycheck comes in and you don't have the money right away even though you might have already earned it so\nNow we're seeing these smaller companies pop up that are actually helping companies do this um or even that you can sign up for individually that will actually give you an advance on your pay check 'em but not as alone more as just you know they might charge you a small fee to give it to you but it's much much less than it would be to get a payday loan or something like that\nWhat kinds of fees are we talking about so one of the companies um it's called event and they're only client right now is Walmart\nBut they say they're going to be expanding they chart just six dollar monthly subscription fee which I'm compared to you know the interest that you can pay on a on a payday loan is is relatively small\nUm I talked to another company called daily pay and they said their fees are more similar to an ATM fee and they max out at three dollars so every time you get your paycheck in advance you pay a three dollar fee um which you know is an inexpensive if you do it all the time but it is much much less than some of those interest rates end up being\nThree as I mentioned in the intro most of us get paid every two weeks and people once a week and some people monthly but why is that generally been a two week paycheck cycle\n[noise] the thing is that it's actually just a historical precedent um and really there's no technological reasons for that I think going into this story I thought you know there must be some tax reason or some\nPayroll reason but there really is and um it's just that companies don't want to pay their employees too often because you know what they have to usually they outsource their payroll to another company and sometimes that's um their contract with that company depends on how many times they have to go through the payroll so\nUm you know if they're doing it all the time they might get charged more so it's really about you know how your company can facilitate payroll but technically there's no reason why you couldn't get paid every single day\nWe're speaking with market watches Maria lasagna Maria how will the gig economy affects how we are paid\nSo it already is actually um you know ... and left our two companies that compete with each other very um you know strongly for drivers and so one thing that they've both added is the ability to get paid after every ride 'em they worked with a company called green dot to do that and square\nUm and so now that those type of ... workers are used to doing that that has kind of shifted into the you know ... Khan and me are regular payments cycles\nUm you know everyday workers are now saying we I Know someone that gets paid every day or every ride why can't this happened for me\nSo without conversation is already pre meeting you know a lot of different companies and he's kind of increasing the pressure to pay workers more frequently\nDo you think the rise of the on demand payment company will somehow forced traditional companies to change the way they paid in their cycle\nI think we're already seeing some of that you know obviously the demand will have to come from the workers\nThey need to pay you more frequently I think that would unfortunately be hard to do but I think now that this is part of the national conversation a bit more um companies may start to do that as a benefit for their workers some of these companies are are you know that that allow you to outsource that\nAre presenting it as a benefit there saying you know if you want to keep your workers happy if you want to retain them longer pay them more often so we may see it through the position that way and it could actually make an impact relatively soon\nThanks Maria Maria ... of marketwatch it's thirty minutes after the hour on this morning Americas first news\nNews talk Matty four point one focused on the engine that's growing the upper Cumberland small business\nYou know it's all outlet still take kind of a mini vacation if they want to get away for an extended weekend with the family and a lot of um parents\nStarted out not liking it but the end up liking it\nTurned out I guess the biggest question the twenty thousand dollar question what kind of been impacted this have on learning do we know yet\nYou know and I've looked at study after study from what I can see academics just based on these studies academics are not suffering under the four day and there was actually school districts to say\nThat they vote is higher test scores because the kids just come back well rested and ready to learn and they're missing fewer days so they're in school more that's how that's how they feel\nUm but academics we haven't really seen studies that show that kids too horrible it just seems to be like you know academic Shirley\nThese studies toenail homes of the wall street\nJournal it's Nineteen Minutes before the hour on this morning Americas first knew that\nYou don't often find the words business and friendly and the same sentence let alone the same state unless of course you're talking about Michigan Michigan's business friendly practices help them become a leader in industries that range from\nAgriculture in cyber security to aerospace and advanced manufacturing in fact Michigan is ranked among the top ten states for a major new and expanded facilities which makes Michigan more than business friendly it makes Michigan business smart to learn more visit Michigan business dot org\nCommence Exxon Mobil field test scientist observes subject station subject to be earns Exxon Mobil rewards close plants points you can use to save on gas coffee car washes and more subject ... should share the wealth and buy me a coffee subject the looks like she's leaving subject haven't purchased me anything yet [noise] subject be as what [noise]\nConclusion ExxonMobil rewards plus makes revealing rewarding and subject the owes me a coffee perhaps I don't I\nSigned up today and Exxon Mobil rewards plus dotcom terms and conditions pliable or participating ExxonMobil branded locations\nThis flu season one ... can make a world of difference so you can protect yourself and so you're close talking co workers helpfully neighbors two month old and he's definitely\nLoving especially trained pharmacists but it provided over sixty million flu shots in two thousand ten for your flu shot today with zero dollar company with most insurance because protecting the world starts with protecting you are ...\nJust it's it's nice you know one of the subject to avail ability said Asian health related restrictions may play\nOut in LA F.

[noise]\n[noise] [noise]\n[noise] it's going to be the target of a town from me it was Ninety four point was\nYour ... your opponent wants Bernie care\nYeah well but let let's let's put the blame in both places grind you're well done I'd say this Bernie says things that he doesn't mainly knows it can't happen he knows that are bankrupt the country and they said that the American people fall for it and Republicans for seven years said\nWe'll ... we'll go in and repeal Obamacare they didn't get it done right so and maybe everybody needs a reset but I won't points I agree with you on this Bryan\nThat health care is too important to too many people to not realize that it's an issue that we have to face right eye you and I I think would prefer technology competition more opportunities we don't want a single payer even sliding towards expanded Medicaid or anything\nBut we got to have something right and we got to use we got to leverage technology I think Trump will be game for trying this you know try to leverage technology competition\nAnd and what we can do but you're right we got to face it and and the Republicans haven't done it and by the way it's a one thing the Democrats no they're running on that a little bit they're running and saying hey those guys are supposed to do something they didn't do it so it is a problem that's got to be faced I Hope that the president knows that\nSo Bernie Sanders tries to roll this out and twenty fourteen in his state of Vermont\nHe tries rule out at a weapon point five percent payroll tax plus a nine point five percent income tax and with more increases coming even progressive couldn't get single payer up and running for only six hundred and twenty five thousand people they had to abandon it by twenty six in Haiti\nVoters rejected the referendum to set up ... player in Colorado so what are you doing on the Republicans might not have the answer would they have to find a way to underline what Democrats think the answer is it doesn't help anybody\nRight well and the problem though is Brian is voters\nVote on what they see right they see Trump and Kanye they see the economy and they see healthcare is a mess so I you know I well I agree you got to try to explain how crazy burn is and how men more importantly how bankrupting\nHis vision is you know as you point out one of the things people don't realize\nYes it would cost trillions of dollars but it would also take out of your hands decisions about healthcare you want to see people write tell them they can't go to their doctor they have to go to the doctor over there I mean people so this is and that's the thing that's really damning about this socialism\nThat they're doing is they take away from the individual control you have to give up control of things you care about\nBut I I got to tell you I I look I I think it's just pure politics the Democrats know that got an issue that's kind of a wedge the Republicans don't have a good answer that you can explain in one sense or one uh one\nImage and so we got to get through this election and they better step up and do something about it\nSo the president so when you look at the numbers and talk to people you know what percentage would you I Know what you want you want to Republican control everything but what percentage do you give the Republicans were holding on to the house first\nWell I look I've been somebody uh Brian you you maybe you won't be too surprised I've been saying it's going to be a Trump red wave since January and the reason why is because I I'm from Missouri right in Missouri they told me the polls told me on the day before election Trump\nIt was going to win Missouri by four percent he won by Nineteen percent I see nothing that has taken away from the coalition of Republicans and I see a lot that's taken away from the Democrats so I\nLook I think they hold the house I Will be honest I think the whole the house a hundred percent I actually think they're going to hold the house with exactly what they have or maybe more I noticed people think I'm Crazy\nBut I don't think anybody understands how the bottom look\nThe other thing Phyllis Schlafly my old boss who's to say late Phyllis Schlafly one of the best thing she ever did was run for Congress twice\nAnd lose and I ran twice and lost myself you learn how campaigns go at this point in the campaign you can't really change the trajectory of the race you just got to kind of tweak it and the bottom is going out on the Democrats because not because of Kavanaugh\nBecause of the economy plus cabinet plus just know attraction and they get to do it I tell people give me one reason I Do the old ah Tracy Chapman's I'll give me one reason to be a Democrat tell me one reason maybe healthcare that's what they say but not really so I think it's about a hundred percent they hold the house to be honest\nI Want you to really Walter said in the from the cook Political Report says listen the way we are right now no one's listening to each other who were on a separate corners ... to\nThis becomes about which team are you on are going to be on the red maggots team or you're going to be on the other team and the entire a Trump presidency has been basically about picking your side taking your team and for ... to put the red hat on then he literally as saying I'm going against my team\nAnd there is a backlash to that and the same way that Republicans who said or people who were normally read going to the blue team they get the criticism for doing that there is nothing left there is no middle there is not going to be a middle and this election is just going to I think\nFurther get into these deep deep deep polar pull around the world\nAnd let you know it'll is the party in power holds power but if it's split is going to be accusations and uh and interrogations\nYeah well but Brian I Amy's missing the good a political revolution it's happening because the Republican Party is as dramatically changed I mean we chased off some of the never Trump hers who were sort of global is she wanted a different don't you know not\nNot social conservative not conservative and much\nWe've added a bunch of people that are working class looked for Missouri for Thirty years we had Democrats say they ran for president on it they're going to get part ran for president to get rid of NAFTA it was ...\nI mean the party that the Republican Party and the Democratic party or trance transforming\nThe problem for Amy Walter she doesn't see it but the problem for Democrats as they're transforming to a party of women and anti men they're not even attracting African Americans what's the message that Nancy Pelosi has\nTo an African American about his future her future right now they don't have a message that doesn't last long politically so I think he's wrong I think she was wrong in twenty sixteen I think we're in a political revolution were to mass\nMovement moments that people lot of people don't recognize that what's happening but that's why it's going to be so interesting after November\nAnd how do we get coloring book\nHe ... is love dot com cult fad phase loved dot com inspired by a ... or go to ...

what they consider to be a background check varies from site to site\nLike some of them all they do basically as a simple credit check where others will do a more thorough background check to see if somebody has been in trouble with the law and that kind of stuff\n[noise] so what level would you recommend as far as going how deep would you do a background check on a potential to\nThat is impossible to answer and I think it depends on your experiences away on the horn\nWhat areas have been traumatic for you with tenets that there have been any I mean if we're really\nOh for a lot of

sometimes for\nWho I Am very good about putting now homes and not having packages delivered when I'm Out of town and we traveled frequently\nUm leans advertise a little circular higher up when I'm Out of town and to me or the you know for the fact nobody called I called the circulation department of the paper and the number lifted\nAnd they won't get anything will they not while they face daily\nOr their lie and they're not getting your phone sit in the battle that always newspapers so many people no longer get a daily newspaper that a lot of newspapers are doing this weekly or twice weekly delivery of sales fires\nAnd they may have an outer package that has like a news article or two in it and that's it moves really just an excuse to have all the flyers delivered to you\nAnd you're a non customer they're throwing these typically only to the driveways are people who don't subscribe to the paper and I don't even know if they have an address system\nTo prevent dropping it at your address in by the way you are I think over the years you're the third or fourth person who's called me complaining about this\nHigh class study I feel like it's got to get some kind of a litter or an

somebody gets a Sunday paper and there are way you know you can tell their what they didn't get their paper and it's like noon or I see one of those advertising supplements thrown\nWhatever it is I hide\nThose things I go put it behind a Bush or whatever that as well and so when I Would say is that you need to have some kind of buddy system with a neighbor that you look out for them they look out for you because even if you get that circular stop by some miracle for awhile\nTurnover is going to happen somebody else is going to be throwing them and you're going to get one\nSo it's gonna have to be something where neighbors work together to prevent because it's such an easy mark for a burglar last weekend the neighbor had for newspapers there subscriber they afford newspapers sitting

question about my daughter is traveling to Italy on a school trip and\nHow lucky is she she gets to have to find you got to pay for it you stay home that doesn't sound like a deal to me\nIt doesn't sound fair ... so her question is how ... what is the best way to bring spending money to Italy is because she is kind of shy away from using a debit card because of um identity theft issues\nHow old is your daughter she's twenty\nOkay does she have any major credit card yet\nNo not yet she's tried to get a store credit card but she doesn't make enough money according to them to qualify for a credit card\nSo when I Would recommend in this case she very responsible as a person she is All right is what I Would recommend that you with your cards see which of your credit cards does not charge of foreign currency transaction junk the\nYeah and do you know if any of yours\nAre the free for foreign travel\nI'm not sure no I'd have to look into\nThat how many cars do you have I have to any chance one of them are capital one\nOne is the capital\nOne of my eyes that you would say yes capital one was the pioneer an issue in cars that don't charge foreign currency junk fees\nYep just make sure that the capital one card you have doesn't charge those junk phase okay and then get her and authorized user card you can get that like just a few days\nAnd she travels with that and with the beauty of that is that she can use it all across Italy\nAnd she will be able to purchase things at what's known as bankers buying rate which is the actual real rate of transaction that we'd go on between the U.S dollar and the euro\nOkay now as far as ATMs\nDo she have a a a credit union account or bank account or whatever\nYes a bank account regular savings account a checking account at a federal savings bank\nOh and then the federal savings bank you don't hear about those much anymore now so the ah federal savings bank those are those are kind of like almost like claws I credit unions\nSo they may not charge of big fee for her using an ATM card to withdraw euros she needs them in Italy\nOkay yeah she was going to check into her back to see if what the fees were\nSo normally that's the best combination that you have a major credit card that charges no foreign currency junk fees\nAnd you have an ATM card that doesn't hit you up with a bunch of junk fees at an ATM give you a comparison most of the big banks charge a ten dollar per transaction fee when you withdraw money at an ATM outside the United states wow that's a lot\nIs huge and so a lot of credit unions a usa as an example of a bank that doesn't\nOh in Charles Schwab stock brokerage she have any investments or do you have any investments for her\nNo no we don't\nOkay for them for other people I mentioned Charles Schwab has a ATM card that allows I'm limited withdrawals free free and the United states and overseas\nAnd it's a great product for people traveling overseas\nOr credit as long as she is those two things are a ... fee or no the ATM card to withdraw euros and has a capital one card as long as you're capital one cart is one that doesn't charge the foreign currency drunk fees she sat\nOkay or when you have to when the credit card issue or know in advance and the ... the ATM card but she'll be outside the United states and when she'll be outside the United states\nYes she was going to do that as well so there's no surprises well\nI Hope she has a great time is this like the typical American college student trip to Italy that she's going to be in Florence most of the

because when you don't have any payment you know what you have money\nThe bar or a slave to the lender so no we don't recommend home equity lines of credit and bar Paul is on Facebook is there a mileage limit your use as a rule of thumb when buying a used car\nUm\nKnow what I'm trying to determine is is the core worn out to the point it's going to give me trouble\nSo the more inexpensive and cheaply made the car is the more the miles would affect it in other words a hundred thousand miles dodge neon would be different than a hundred thousand miles Mercedes\nLike one is used up and the other one is just getting started\nAt that point you know what I'm saying the ... is really tired under the hood of that neon at that point\nI mean do they still make a dodge neon but you get my point the cheap little dinky but car I mean you got a hundred thousand miles smart car that's called dom okay it's not called smart anymore so I'll just give you that example so no chance I Want that thing\nBut if you got a car that's built let's say a higher in nicer vehicle uh they're typically well built I mean ... again a Honda Lexus a Mercedes a beamer a Cadillac um\nThe larger body Ford products for building a great product a truck\nA Chevy Truck for truck with a hundred thousand miles on that one thing about that uh it's got easily another hundred and it may be another three hundred and depending on how you took care of it and what you were dropping and that kind of thing [noise]\nUm but I I wouldn't think anything about that at all uh again that we can depends on your budget and how nice car you want obviously the least miles or the last used car I bought was a raptor at Nineteen thousand miles on when I bought a drop\nSo I'm On it and um so it was a very low my car when I got rid of it the other day and um so you know you just you're looking at your situation to what is the um what is your situation and what can you do but generally speaking the\nThe I'm more of an economy car it is quote unquote the ah the more the miles would have a negative effect on it\nUm because I'm just I'm just really don't know how can I just looking for is dependability and how much life is left in it that's a cool question very interesting Dustin is with us in St Louis Hi Dustin how are you\nTaking my call Sherman what's up I'm Seventeen years ago and I cook a senior I've got about three thousand dollars and the cat out donating should I in bed and I knew what China then you're going to college here I mean to college with a program in St Louis and the olive tree\nOkay so you're only going to do two years\nAnd then ending on how the program ... maybe ... served five of the charity and I keep them at the community colleges is either a new ad out in the workforce yeah you know\nI Will be true if you get some search some certifications and stuff and not the four year degree might not even be a wise investment I agree with that of crime so that's what you want to do you won't be programmer you weren't being on or whatever\nLike that okay uh and the community college is paid for as long as you keep an eye plus um you can invest it or\nHere's the thing I always tell folks at your age I'm I'm much more concerned that you complete all of your educational goals with no debt than I Am whether you have an investment mutual\nFund like on a scale\nOf one to ten and a nine point nine\nFinish college and all your education was the road that so if there was a bump in the road in your little plan you might need some money to finish your schooling and that's much much you dust and has a better investment than a mutual fund is assuming you're studying something like you're talking about studying which is a very usable\nField of study that you can you know really make some good money and and the you know getting that level of education is really gonna cause your income to go be a lot higher than if you didn't have that education so um you know you're the best investment we can make much better than a mutual fund I like mutual funds and I you know may\nI talk about um all the time so if you want to invest some of it into a mutual fund that's fine I Would not put it in a retirement account to stage a what this amount of money in your situation because again my main goal\nFor you is your friend is for you to get your degree and your field of study whether it's a two year or the certifications in the ... tech field or or whether it's a four year degree my main goal for you is to give you the tools in your belt the educational tools in your belt for you to be able to go live your dream\nWithout any that and that three thousand dollar spin on that is more important than ... than the mutual fund and so if you put it in a mutual fund and you run into a bump don't be afraid to take it out and use it for college if you're going to go that route [noise]\nIf you need to thanks for calling open phones at triple eight eight to five five two to five Mike is in Chicago Hi Mike how are you\nI'm great Dave it's an honor to speak with you\nYou too sir what's up in your world\nOn my wife and I are currently on baby step forward they can prepare for retirement and we're using the access our budget to pay off our mortgage early cool and we're both teachers and the state run pension pay nine percent of our gross take home pay our dilemma is when we say an extra Fifteen Percent on top of that nine percent that we are already contribute we don't\nWhen we said the thicker than we're able to save a lot for a mortgage toleration though is it okay to do that or am recommend saving their twenty four\nPercent now the the mandatory amount that you're putting in a ... or you vested in that is that uh uh you choosing an investment for that or is a pinch and\nGet the answer no options yeah it's it's mandatory its pension and you don't have control of it right and when you leave you can't take it with you correct that the weight on sixty seven or okay uh and it's nine percent nine percent\nYeah okay so the the equation is do we put Fifteen on top of that or do we only put six on top of that and that's our dilemma correct correct ... I probably would split the difference\nBecause I don't like the pension we're stuck with it but I don't like it you'd age don't control the options for investing be you don't get to take it with you when you go and the state of Illinois is notoriously poorly run\nThrough its horribly run state and now we're battling on those guys [laughter] huh yea no thank you so uh but what I count some of it yeah some of it I'm not going to count it as a whole new line what if we counted it as a four or five\nIf we can do is er for then that means we need to put it in ten percent\nRight you got a million that you don't have a choice but I'm saying if we because we don't have a lot of faith in it I don't like it but it's there and we'll probably get some of it I mean likelihood is I'm not predicting the failure of the teachers pension and Illinois it's just horribly run and if it was ever going to fail anywhere it'd be there\nYou know so um that that that's the truth and you know that show a given that let's just let's give it a fifty percent hit our show and just round numbers let's put it in ten percent instead of putting in Fifteen Percent on top\nOr something like that not only celebrate your mortgage a little bit I'm not going to be perfect but you know it's a little bit more to get that way and you can go that direction show um\nYou know go do it\nThat that was that's what I Would I backing off a little bit\nAppreciate your joining us today Ramsey show [noise]\nCrunching when the rams\nThe Cumberland advisors\nAll big John extraordinary things start from ordinary

very a nasty last last week there's been a lot of noise coming out of here uh I I've been here a couple of hours that have already heard about players\nMeetings um strange comments or you're about as close to this program as anyone what's going on down here well\nPaul anytime you lose games in and you're supposed to win games and you have one side of the ball playing better than the other side of the ball\nYou're going to have some dissention in the locker room guys Eighteen Nineteen twenty year old players they they don't understand every level of maturity they don't understand how to handle themselves in certain situations and I look at the waiters team has played I don't understand some of the frustration I was on an album football team in Nineteen Ninety nine that ran for a hundred yards in one game where the popped in deep and\nWe didn't know how to act the deepest was mad at us and I didn't blame them for being mad at us\nBut ball just say this but some of the things that are coming out of all ...\nI don't know who it is and I don't know who it was or what position they hold within that football team but if you are the guy\nBut thinks it's okay to go to the media and slender your teammates to the media\nAnd have character depth of making to your character assassination to some of the team makes on your team that you share a locker room with\nYour problem on the football team because there's plenty of blame to go around from an execution standpoint on a ... point and an assignment standpoint not if not one person on that football team is playing good enough ball to be able to go talk to bring them are still talk about how bad a teammates he has on his football team not one\nAnd there's not a football player in the country this point that good enough football to be able to go do that behind somebody hacked\nAnd hide your name behind those comments not a single player in college football\nAnd to do it on a team that is struggling to me shows what you're about whoever that person is so poor they're bigger problems that are going to need to be solved I don't know who the source of all that information is but whoever it is needs to be smoke out and they need to find out today before things get worse inside that Auburn locker\nYeah in Britain and certainly that has been a big topic grant where your bread winner a frequent guest here a co and talk about what was said because I mean you are rarely heard you\nPacific comment on our ... anonymously of course it Brandon coated [noise] do you find the most objectionable\nI'm not even overly concerned with it was just a specific comment but when you when you make comments about oh a guy is happy go lucky we all like differing losses OK\nAll of us some guys get over it quickly some guys need to go talk to their parents would talk to their girlfriend and that's how they get over it some guys some guys some guys throw things in the locker we'll deal with problems in different ways all of us\nAnd it's not about one individual comment it's about the fact that you couldn't walk to the other side of the locker room\nAnd get face to face with a guy on your team and say hey man I don't like your attitude\nOr I don't like your actions change figure it out but to figure out how to become a better football team showed me a lot about that individual\nSo the fact that someone would do it and the fact that someone felt okay doing it it's a bigger problem for me Paul not just at somebody says well judge that I'm happy go lucky or all the options have wanted to go to the NFL I don't care about the comments I don't care what they were\nIt's the fact that someone's doing it and felt confident enough in the cells in the way they play to be able to go talk to somebody else in the media and do that to their teammates that their teammates in the back\nAnd put their team on blast away that they did\nIt happen and ah and yeah I mean the the word around here and in that article is the Jerry ... is a is a happy go lucky guy is a positive guys are likeable guy and and maybe he shouldn't smile after a loss or some people just feel good about themselves and about their environment but but what\nDoes this say I mean I get I get your I get your emotion but what does it tell you forget the fact that he did it we know he did or someone did what does it tell you about that locker room\n... tells me that the other leaders in the locker room\nHas to step up and maybe take on an added level of leadership for this football team guys like to Shawn Davis in Marlin Davis and I know that they lead guys like Chandler Cox I Know that he and maybe they're just going to have to step up and do more and at the end of the day it comes down to execution doing your job that's why I went back to the fact that\nNo one's doing a good enough job to be able to go behind someone's back and say these things\nNews talk Ninety four point once the SEC Saturday thirtieth Washington and Oregon driven by ... Lincoln up Cookeville Saturday beginning at eleven [noise]\n[noise]\nOh thank you very much we're back here in Auburn and I want to go back ... chocolate joining us and I want to go back to the a ... a conversation that we're ... we're talking about this article\n... there was a players only meeting a DJ which I Know you're aware of and according to Brandon's story this was on one of these VIP website so it's not like everyone can just go read the new world we live in\nUh the article says several players are discussing departures after this season or this is according to Brandon Marshall ... cording to his article is being criticized privately by a handful of players inside the locker room\nWhich isn't uncommon for any program but the whispers according to the article or audible grumble this season and had been for most of the year receivers according to the article\nAre frustrated withstand them several offensive lineman wants to leave that they believe they can be drafted in the middle rounds but in but it it goes on to say a ... it it does it deals with ... attitude which co a and I were talking about a minute ago\nSo this is a it it also talks about the issues with chip Lindsey uh this is a marshmallows opinion here I'm going to quote\nI'll be surprised if chip Lindsey doesn't look for a way out after this season so again I just giving you a a a thumbnail of of what was in an article that I had not read it and then tried frankly uh we were trying to get a little better\nUnderstanding firm called ... was a high rate that a player would say this but it looks like there's a lot more to it I realize you just parachuted in here to the game tomorrow but we are trying to figure out what's\nOn down here you know what it is very interesting because before I came here I ironically just came from talking to\nA Jewish state and talked to Ron Davis and we we ask them point blank you know ... how are things going on between often civilly 'cause you haven't been playing the way you want it to and\nA ... for sure right David ... but he also said we have to do a better job of helping steer them and from all accounts they seemed like they were in good accords and you know it didn't feel like they had any pitch and 'cause they literally were crossing each other as we were talking to him\nAnd state I'm saying hey I have to play better he talks about being positive with all his teammates especially during series and uh obviously when things aren't going away as opposed to a guy's going to be rumbling and the Shawn Davis we talked to him as well he talked about that players only meeting and how\nAnd how they felt so hopefully that's something that are working\nOn it like they did more than [laughter] than lay it out of the meeting a and this was a cold biggest frustration that someone laid it out to a reporter and now everyone\nIs yeah that that's something that you always never want to do if you're a player especially because if it gets outside then you have a real big issue if you can keep it inside and keep it contain and guys can actually talk about it and sometimes it does get a little while to get a little verbal because guys are passionate air emotional about this game and they want to be better and if it doesn't happen then obviously now\nNow that it's outside we're sitting here talking about it um what what what what if anything does that mean\nIt's it's going to be I think the only tell you could tell you what happens on the field tomorrow I mean you're planning a tendency team that everybody expects that you should win but if I I think on a bigger note if you don't dominate Tennessee\nThere's going to be some more rumblings because if you know you just skate by this is going to be something that's gonna be talking about because you feel as though you should be a lot better than we know tendency who's been rebuilding and they've got lots of going on their own but if you don't come on dominating this ball game I think there's going to be more ... come on\nLook what let's talk about last week and yeah I ... I praise the defense I mean they say they they held Mississippi State and check most of the game to a point where they could have won the game you know it wasn't like they were giving up fifty points I mean it was a relatively close game what what is that big picture half\nHappens in a locker room DJ when one side of the ball clearly is not holding up its side of the bargain\nYou know what I've been on a team like that where one sided hasn't done it and you kinda you know stay but you look over there like\nWe're doing everything we can to win ballgames and you're just not carrying your hand and hopefully the leadership on one side of the ball\nCan bring both sides together and that's the biggest part about it is if one side is pointing fingers and you don't have the leadership on the side that's really not doing well and you can't bring it together it's going to be more attention\nAnd they have to kind of a way to to to kind of bring both sides together and say okay we haven't done our part but sterile defensively we can continue to do our part and go out to play ball but often simply\nThe leaders on that side to step up and not that different some guys are really going to be questioning what do we don't\nSay you're ... so uh I mean should that some are you got to LSU Georgia I'm In Georgia in spite of his ranking in spite of everything they Jay someone's like the country's just not quite believing yet yeah and I needed them are\nFor the biggest thing is because of where they play in the national championship game everybody thought the margin\nOf where Alabama and Georgia where it was a lot tighter and you look at the way out of bounds implant all year they just blowing out everybody and expect Georgia do the same thing and when you don't do that then people say what's wrong with Georgia and offensively I think they're still trying to find who they are identity why they wanted me to run a football we know that but\nThey haven't been really that explosive throwing a football they've had some big plays but often simply they haven't been that team and going into the ... going to get to a ball game I mean they're going to have corners on the outside and greedy Williams and uh we know grand deal but they're going to get in Georgia's face and they're going to force them and say can you beat us\nAnd if George can't get off the jam and then that front seven avail as she gets after you stop the run\nWhat is Georgia go from there are still not sold on other shoes off and all the way a ... and they got after him a little bit last week uh but if\n... if they can do a better job of throwing a football down a few of Georgia and they have a chance to just following [noise]\nAnd the other side of the ball though I mean you have the other shoe and we don't we never talk about the Georgia defense but they're still there\nYeah they are and I think the biggest thing that everybody talked about as Georgia has six tax on here you know near the bottom and getting down to the quarter back in ... here Kirby tall he talks about\nTime and they've done a good job of that but you need to sacked accord that you need to find ways to make him on comfortable and right now those front four or five guys have gotten that pressure the Audrey walkers pretty much the only guy who's got tons of fact the season and they got to find a way to pressure him whether it's bringing more guys\nWe'll see but er Georgia have found a way to pressure the quarterback even more\nDJ Shockley or on the call here Tamara thank you Jay Jay sounds like you are you got her just in time over the world\nRight on time and I get the timing but it's hopeless okay right after\nI got plenty of the other room or break a much succumb including smells on a he will join us

I guess our responsibilities to think bigger picture at the end of the day every one of us who works in the athletic department and all of our peers are competitive we all went away and we all went down bottom line to have more more wisdom that column losses\nBut we're also responsible for for making sure that we're developing or younger people and at the end of the day that's what we're about Mehserle ever got into this industry it just so happens that we need football to be successful in order to support the endeavor for all of our other student athletes [noise] it\nIt's interesting because you know every every Friday I Am on campuses and most of the time we we we're we're uh we have the pleasure of talking to athletic director is in some schools are a little different that you know we're we're proud of this and we're proud of that I've come to Auburn for a long time and and ...

like to hear\nPeople cracking down on this war criminal George Soros is responsible for all of the nation in America he finds all the left and on and many of their rights for this division\nAnd um look like the deal with Kanye West they man has\nBut it it wouldn't even be changes are right now because again it was going to be a blue wave in the house and the Senate ban it started with only ... percent it wasn't going to go blue in fact we probably will gain\nTwo or three or four Republican seats if things go away it looks right now the house bill is a toss up ... what are your feelings on this I feel confident you're going to win but I Wonder when who's who's in this area to go and vote either early voting on election day don't don't take anything for granted but I feel confident that you're going to win\nWhat's it going to take to ensure that you've got a house of representatives that doesn't go the wrong way and the wrong way it's just what you said no more tax cuts in fact was repeal them hum of Obamacare is going to stay put let's impeach the present let's impeach Kavanaugh\nIt I don't know what the hell they're running on vets getting them any traction but I'm ... ... what is it that you could say right none of those watching eliciting across the country\nThat would ensure that the conservative base to you and I want to get out there gets out there\nWell hey I've been out going across the district talking to people nonstop for the last ten months in particular the last several and I can tell you the enthusiasm over the last two to three weeks in light of that sort of the show I represent a minute ago and the ... ... your committee is extraordinary\nThe American people particularly here in Texas are really fed up with what they're seeing out of the Democrat left a progressive agenda that's completely out of lockstep with everything they believe are Texas values run deep that's why a thousand people a day are moving to Texas and while governor Abbott is right to joke about building a fence on our western in northern border city at all\nThe reality is it's like the woman I talked to in burning just down the road from where you live\nOr when to make sure that we control the house of the Texas protected you know I got nowhere else to move and I just moved here from California two weeks ago yeah\nWe'll get it they understand that the opportunity you have in Texas to thrive in the eye and to have prospering to pass something beyond your kids are so great so I feel optimistic I Can't predict what's going to happen in the house but this much right now in Texas we had a million Democrats show up to the first time in the primaries in March\nBut as you know and I think you've talked on your show about a million and a half\nRepublicans showed up to do our job than Texas will send a message not just the taxes and the rest of the country but to the world that we're going to continue to be the vanguard for liberty and make sure that we are not just expand the Senate hold the house and then get busy a truly taking advantage of this opportunity with a president willing to challenge the status quo\nIt's a trip Royce C HIV last name or a why go and vote for him district Twenty one he's running for ah Lamar Smith St Lawrence had Betsy for over Thirty years\nOh what's interesting is you brought up to Capitol hearing is a couple of times and that's important because uh when the economy is so good and we've got more money in the bank and we're going out to eat more often were spending more money at at a big box stores and we're seeing these numbers are off the charts people get fat and happy and they're not why would I go and vote things are going great but I don't think they realize\nThat would be the ramifications the consequences if they don't get off their hands and go and vote do you think the Democrats chip overplay their hand in the Senate Judiciary committee I Am Spartacus and interrupting and yelling and screaming and bringing up allegations that are uncorroborated did they just light a fire under Democrats are under Republicans\nI really believe that they let a fire and the Republicans frankly was badly needed for the reasons you start taking like Republicans were getting a little bit set and saying well we're doing well this is great\nYou know and they're kind of in that mid term diligent and the Democrats did a better job of anybody of lighting a fire and the Republicans by overreaching and not just reaching in the Senate Judiciary committee where they definitively did an unfairly and undermined the process and unfair to cabinet and probably really an\nOffer for Jeff they overreach but it's also the overreach by candidates Kennedy's like Beto O'Rourke candidates like my opponent in the Texas Twenty one who are running as a valid ... progressive socialist on agendas that are about impeaching Trump higher taxes more spending less border security\nFor government run health care for more gun restrictions for more funding for Planned Parenthood my opponent has all of that on his website\nYou don't have to take my word for it and I would encourage anybody listening go looking back on its website is it isn't a valid progressive liberal Democrats and they overreach because they thought they could drive for a this midterm election what progressive policy and Texans like they always do are going to stand up and say not in our back yard we love freedom\nYeah but how does anybody shifting to that's a winning combination I Am I'm open to abolishing ice\nLet's open the border I'm Robert Francis workout I'm calling about the whatever nickname he's calling himself he's not Hispanic he's a fourth generation Irish American nothing wrong with that but he's on the bumper stickers only say PTO which doesn't make sense to me um this guy actually said and there's a piece of video that I saw just yesterday\nSome time ago he said we're basically stole half of Mexico from them\nI mean this is this is what you're dealing with how is it a winning combination of to proud Texans how is it a winning combination of proud Americans who really believe that we're a sovereign nation and it's OK love our nation\nKnow it's definitively not a winning combination I think that's why we're seeing the recent polls for Senator Cruz and and and now getting back up to leave and the eight nine ten point lead right ... the New York times poll in this online poll and others and I think we're going to see that hopefully across the state and across the country\nI think they were betting on the fact that they had some sort of\nAnti Trump mid term ability to galvanize their forces into drive out two thousand sixteen turn out to be with you know people like levels that came out for a Hillary Clinton on the other side of the aisle I Will say this is a caution to all your listeners if we do our job as conservative Americans conservative Texans and show up to vote\nAnd certainly of joy we'll do fine but there are banking on Republican staying home and Democrats turning up in way so they ran a hardcore progressive drive out their base agenda that out a lockstep with the bath majority of Americans and I hope that overreach will shine clear\nIt's ... I Believe he's the only choice industry or Twenty one for a United States house of representatives but you don't ship it will last last question\nAre you like me do you think some of the center left people some people blue dog Democrats are just as happy as the rest of us are about the economy and just as happy about the direction of our country and and that it's okay to wave on American flag and say usa usa usa again\nI mean we're really talking about a far left fringe Alyssa Milano Beto O'Rourke bought a bronco bomber sort of of left that thinks that everything that's going on his bad right I mean you know Democrats you know blue dogs I mean these people actually quietly are going I'm going to vote the way the way it is to keep it the way it is because things are going pretty well\nThere is no question I've ... I've seen that around the district in throughout the state is I've been talking to taxes\nThat they are they're really turned off by this sort of anti American feel they know what the the politics are behind that we saw it as I mentioned in the Capitol hearing and they're and they're kind of retrenchment and saying look you know I I'm not comfortable with that importantly Joe you agree with this I think I Believe that we got an impressive moment and opportunity right now\nTo re you not unify our country around our shared belief system that the federal government should\nBe small and state government than people in power if you want to unite our country and then stop one size fits all solution is watching\nLess taxes be taxes like California Beach California so it won't be any others throats and the escalating politics so you're not watching the the press with bated breath about what Washington is going to do for us to do what we knew best in Texas live our lives and we're not hunting buddy what to do then we will be in each other's throats\nYou're actually suggested moves attempt amendment that says we can do our own thing to a chip I appreciate you I appreciate your candidate see I'm Glad that you're the guy and I think that when you get to do to the house of representatives and again everybody listening watching him this distribute to go and vote out when you get the right to be able to carry the torch very well for this district\nWill do thank you for that they need more to do and your listeners please do get a French shocked about let's make sure we send a strong message was not just went by little it went by a lot and not get busy in Washington don't waste that we would do and make this country great again\n... ... we appreciate it went back after this and the Joe ... thanks\n[noise]\n\n\nConversation continues with Joe bags from news talk Ninety four point one news talk Ninety four one dot com\nPeople who use relief factor love telling people how great it works in fact there was Seventy relief factor testimonials to choose from much or to start and it's an awfully good feeling to know that many of you and yes even thousands if you listen to me right now\nAre going to be feeling better and the very near future it's exciting to me because you're going to be trying relief factor you go to a relief factor dot com you order the three week quick start only Nineteen Ninety five right now less than a dollar a day almost everyone over fifty years occasional aches and pains due to aging exercise and everyday activities\nLet's get back to doing the things that you love your own law goes for long walks golfing or tennis or biking life can be so much better\nIf you're not in pain again the majority of people who ordered the really quick started really factor go on to order more it's a good feeling let's see if they can get you out of paying to go to release factor dot com\nRelief factor dot com get up really quick start right now what do you have to lose its Nineteen Ninety four\nRelief factor dot com if you're like my family you've got a ton of videotapes I mean VHS you might have film\nEven photos laying around you haven't looked at them in years and they're just be generating they're not going to get any better or nicer or better quality sitting around in a dusty boxer on a shelf somewhere want to get I'm taking care of put together on modern media\nFrom a great company called legacy box I Love legacy box I've dealt with them they're incredible when it comes to saving the history of your family for years to come you can get those photos that film that VHS all that stuff put right on a thumb drive you could have it on the cloud you can have it all put on a DVD and then you'll have", "year": "2018", "show_name": "no_show", "city": "Algood", "day": "12"}
