the year generally speaking and she doesn't want to be on it because she supports Colin Kaepernick did I get that right\nThat's yeah that's what I read I mean whatever\nAnd by the way your microphones fine as your president like this during the break is very low so don't worry about your um\nFor me a couple of things I think ... is uh\nAnd clearly\nI'm not as educated on this topic is maybe like her to be but why would you throw away and opportunity like that because of a guy who of his own volition is out of the league polo and I\nSay in your room or into the NFL now that I Am I used to be a great expertly ... now not for three years and I won't go back and watch unless they all stay in for the national anthem in the NFL starts finding that says you're fine if you don't stand is going to do that I'm not going to support them\nBut let me make sure that I have the ... story right he was the starting quarter the quarterback for San Francisco\nTook him to the super bowl the last of the ravens several years ago double threat running in passing the quintessential athlete and it looked like more NFL quarterbacks would be like him because of how successful he was\nThen the defense of starting figure them out and it wasn't as effective anymore and instead of getting better he was getting worse and then he ended up being the second string quarterback was behind Alex Smith\n[noise] ah\nNo I think by that time they'd already turning them away okay and then they had but anyway you have backup ... than when I was yeah right\nAll right so he's he's ride the bench and out of the blue you start sitting down for the national anthem once the cameras realized that he started kneeling for the national anthem then some other guy would deal with them than other players are league which started kneeling and when he was asked about it he was wearing like Fidel Castro shirt\nAnd a sure was Malcolm X. on it or something and he's talking about oppression and he's talking about I mean honestly\nTo me the whole thing is weird man\nBecause he was a guy who had a contract where he was making eleven or twelve million dollars a year now there was and this is not widely reported there was a another year and his contract it was a player option you that would have given a nine to all of a million dollars even though he was just a backup\nHe walked away from that San Francisco one would assume because he thought that there would be a long term contract and even more money waiting for him elsewhere well guess what crickets happened and he didn't get another offer and then you start hearing that the ravens wanted to talk to them then you started hearing that the Denver Broncos wanted to talk to him and he was complaining the entire time that he's not been blacklisted from the NFL because he's dealing\nWhich didn't happen\nIn fact John Elway said we offered him the opportunity to be here and he said no he didn't want to be here so he could be in the NFL Marianna is not doing the super bowl halftime show 'cause she's showing support for him and I guess she thinks that he's been black Boulder blacklisted from the NFL because of his kneeling ... is that why she's\nDoing it it's got to be why right\nProbably but I also think that it has lots of new and than her connections to the\nVoters have to do with it in a couple of years ago beyond say to the halftime show she's married to him\nRight but that was before the whole ... thing happened and then now since then are you sure yeah other capital already was kneeling now and then another Neal environment\nThe bar we might have been nearly but he was so what you're saying he was still in the league right now the league yet right\nI I don't get it honestly don't get it\nThe guy gets the story is told his true right he turned down an opportunity to be on the Denver Broncos he walked away from his last year was contract I'm not making that up and I know well\nThen what do you see complaining about it was his own dumb decision that that led into this\nAnd he still claiming that he's still working out and and I guess ready if the team wanted him but I don't\nThat he should try I mean again Denver offer that nobody has has given me any good information to say the gentle way was lying so I mean maybe you take the offer that's um that's on the table but here's something you'd really al take calls at ... if you can't get through just go to Joe talk show on Twitter as I said I live tweet here's this guy Dustin\nKids are city who wrote to be on my Facebook page and there was a ... little child when I Do to respond to him fast enough I guess you didn't realize that it was actually working at the time and I couldn't respond to his crazy negative review of me oh so he's on the line now and look I I'll give them credit for us you have it a step big enough to call the program Dr let's go man let's mix it up what are you got\nIt is or you invited me and so here I Am\nI did I invited you because you were ... stupid on my Facebook page alleging that I was taking too long to answer your your bad review I'm working ... why would I used to while they stopped working to answer your dumb review why would I Do that\nBut you stop to work in a long enough to call me clueless\nAnd tell your clueless write it took me a letter you know so I took me two seconds to write clueless but now that you're on the air so me and what what is it that I have wrong let's go\nWhat you have you told me that I'm an idiot not clueless and I should call the show and you tell me why\nNo no no I didn't tell you show me where I show me where I called you an idiot and and told you that I Would tell you why you wrote about you got it okay here here's a bit\nSo that style job stop\nYou like it stop it stop\nThis isn't going to work you can't talk when I talk because nobody can hear you here's the thing I gave an overview to my listeners of what you wrote\nWhich was basically I lean Republican my whole life but it's horrible with the Republicans will be gone have become everybody that I Know is going to stop voting Republican and in fact I'm going to do all I can devote Democrat and there's a I'm going to vote Democrat in this coming election now tell me how someone\nThat's exactly what you said tell me you know it really isn't\nGoing to put you on hold here here's the way it's going to work dust and this was a nationally syndicated radio show your heard by about five or six million people right now and so far you sound a little bit on educated\nEven what you you wrote yourself because of how far the Republican Party went away from what you believe in you decided you could never vote Republican again in factory to do what you can devote Democrat that's what you said I said you're clueless if you'd like to correct that I'm listening to your go ahead\nI guess dried as I said I said it's because of the girls the Carter from traditional Republican values there\nSo what is it the Democrat out All right what does it mean immigrants are offering to you pardon ... what is it the Democrats are offering to you that you would vote for them\nIs ... ... you don't tell me what they're offering that you would give them your vote no man I explain a it if they might vote that can I Do that let's go\nOkay [laughter] wow [laughter] like I said there and it it it's\nJust departure from from from the traditional one of the Democrats going that they'll get your vote [laughter] ... that I was not sort of [noise]\nThat's how we do break your back with ... that show called ... [noise]\nEven though their party has drifted more and more in Israel and Florida they usually nominate somebody who's pro Israel but they didn't they find they nominated Andrew Gillum who's really aligned with the radical left a which is really a very hostile to Israel now\nWell he's he's like he's really he's also into our freedom and liberty he's also pro taxation and big government he's also pro abortion me the guy's a socialist he wants Medicare for all we can get into all the problems with him but I think that it's it's even more beneficial to talk about the positives that you bring to the table\nYou know it's interesting to me run in in I live in southern Texas now so I grew up around Hispanics I now live in a place where it's a predominantly Hispanic or I've never met a Hispanic person who generally speaking is Catholic or Christian who is some far left is loon why is it that the Democrats have always been able to count on that Hispanic vote\nAnd would have guys like you and me how to do to let them know that we are on their side\nI don't know that they that they have always been able to I think that the Hispanic vote is not monolithic in Florida you know we have a lot of conservative Hispanics in South Florida\nUm and it's just different than I think what you would see in Texas or California\nUm and then of course in central Florida you know we've had a burgeoning population of people who are Puerto Rican I've been very involved in a lot of those issues I'm actually endorsed by the setting congresswoman from Puerto Rico or he's a Republican and a friend of mine and so I think the reason why Florida we're doin' good\nIt because we're producing economic opportunity as Republicans I mean we have the lower ... unemployment\nIn the history of our country and I think we can do even better in Florida you can do that though if you do what Gillum wants to do which is raise taxes forty percent a single payer health care you know on and on and does\nThat would really be the end of Florida's economic momentum so I think a lot of these are\nReally across the border looking at it and say you know I Want to be able to have a good job I'm going to be able if I work hard to be able to get ahead well clearly if that's what you're looking to do that I'm your guy because I'm going to build apartments success Florida has has had economically I Am not going to tear down with can fiscal tore pots policy\nA run run as soon as he used a Republican running for governor the great state of Florida former congressman from down there but let me talk specifically about school school safety you know there's a good friend of a republic course tragically lost his daughter meadow in Parkland, Florida and then there's the high school in February fourteenth that area of the state was put on the international map\nAs ground zero of gun control versus you know armed guards at the schools\nUm you've got people on school boards like this guy Runcie who is a promise program Obama guy who will ignore the the violent criminal history of students just said that they don't have a a record when they get out of school for some reason\nThe governor think you're going to but what can you do from that offers from that position to stop allowing sheriff like Israel to turn a blind eye to a bad guy who could walk on campus and kill a bunch of people to get people off school boards like Runcie who is going to ignore criminal records of people like this Eighteen Nineteen fifty three fifty eight I don't see his name I see his\nHis prison number what can you do from that position and from that offers\nTo shore up our schools and guarantee our kids are gonna come home at the end of the day\nIf you have to weigh Florida works is if you have and if they're so like the Sierra who's elected county ride or the governor can remove them from office um and I said after Parkland\nIt off to saying a share of Israel do on on um blame other people in power cow for the cameras not be honest with the people a Broward County\nI said if I were the governor than I Would have removed Israel I think that was appropriate thing to do what I'm In the ... I I'm a former navy die right when the when the set funds and ground\nThe captain of the ship it's held accountable that's just the way it is\nAh Israel was saying hey I gave the guy a badge what am I supposed to do not my problem that's not leadership that passing the buck right and I thought it was disgraceful the way he handled himself so that is one tool you have but obviously I'm working with Andy power as well to\nMake sure that we do what we need to do legislatively I said at the school districts are able to protect their students in some school districts will do much better job and I think Andy had a lot of problem uh getting the Broward school district right it's heavily bureaucratic a lot of very left wing ideas\nTo listen to read and he was trying to let the school board members so that they couldn't remove runs the exam and they they narrowly lost so the you know I was disappointed to see that because I agree with you run sees policies helped facilitate what happened in park\nLike Iran would you leave them in a guy like really judge in Polk County to to sort of be a guide to other counties he's doing great work there as far as school safety goes\nBack to where we ... we were in ... county couple of days ago grade he endorsed me with a bunch of the other share on right that that's a huge huge job plus for me in this rate that almost a unified support of law enforcement throughout the state of Florida partially because I've been very strong in support of them and have a\nGreat record the part about do I mean it's usually hospital for the men and women in law enforcement and they realize that he's dead and are there going to have a target on their back because he will damage dog the police and he will use law enforcement of the political football\nBut I agree with you it's a round as soon as this Republican running for governor of the great state of Florida go to Andrew Gillum let me just give you some good kids in about a minute that we have remaining that I really appreciate your time run a taxation it looks like a tax cuts to point over on deck here\nIf the house should go to the Democrats that's not going to happen as the governor of a state would you support the president and continuing to lower our taxes\nAs for ... or people in the United states\nBam right [laughter]\nThat was that was pretty quick I'm All right a pro life obviously argue for defunding Planned Parenthood even on the state level\nYeah so absolutely\nWhen it comes to this caravan of illegal immigrants coming toward border what should we do we can't just keep on giving you know because I Know the government wants to give a path to citizenship for anybody who can sneak across the board or what do you do\nThat will go on he wants to abolish ice and they want and open borders so all of them would say\nThe Caribbean should just be able to go in that foreigners get to determine who comes to our country not lead the American people but I think the president\nActually use whatever tools rather disposal you the Caribbean needs to be turned back we've got to insist on the rule of law you can't have people just bargaining into the country I'm In the middle of the border and it just doesn't work and\nSo I Know the president is monitoring the I think he will take some sort of ...\nAround I think the debate and we've got to stop the mad at our southern border\nIf you were the governor he asked you to send National Guard from Florida there to protect our borders ...\nIt would depend on what that means we're like obviously we have a lot of them being not\nHelping with the hurricane right now that's a lot of this may not be the best time for it but if I had a free or resources that that that some free time I think it is important because that when the drugs come over the border\nYou know that affects Floridians I mean the fence and all the synthetic opioid a big problem in our state and I think that if we're able to turn that back that would be a good thing\nI Know that Andrew Gillum as for equalizing schools and education by by forcing more taxation and more public schools he's against the school vouchers are you for or against vouchers\nSo we have we have a hundred and thirty thousand kids many of them low income on various scholarship program brains you want to end all of it right or those I think that they're successful\nAnd they're in a variety of different ways whether it's boiling hot weather special me when we have a scholarship program for kids that are going in school so their parents and find a safe environment and you would cut the scholarship and force them back into the school where they're being bullied though he has very ideological about that even though these programs that work\nYou would literally pull the rug out from underneath his family\nGet vouchers and scholarships like this obviously expert actually help lower income people why the left would be against it as not to be run I I really appreciate your time and then how busy you are the Republican running for governor the great state of uh of Florida it's wrong to see it as a student going OK\nOkay thank you\nI appreciate you that's around to see it as if you're listening in Florida I Hope you'll seriously consider voting for that man he's going to be the right guy for the job in my opinion and hopefully in years as well

this is John best so good evening the midterms approach but beyond the mid term the day after and there will be when Congress has settled for the next two years we have a\nPresidential election and there are candidates many many candidates for the Democrats there's one particular candidate for the Republicans\nHe is a very careful ... prepare of the grounds for the next candidate for the next contest Donald Trump so I welcome Dan ... the deputy editor to the editorial page of the wall Street Journal writing\nAnd his wonderland about a candidate that Mr Trump at this point is indicating he thinks he must deal with now because in two years' time it would be too late is Elizabeth Warren is the nominee\nFor the Democratic party again a very good evening to you Elizabeth Warren was in the news this week oddly\nMaking remarks about how much DNA she could link to Native Americans who may or may not have been a tribe the Cherokee the CI linked herself to anecdotally by your column suggests\nThat I was wrong to presume that she'd made herself a laughing stock good evening to you Dan\nHi there John well I don't know whether I Would go so far as to say that um you are wrong that she'd made herself laughing stock the issue\nThat I was trying to raise is a ... what does it which audience matters most um the people you would expect to be mocking ridiculing you or a as I put it\nYour political base\nAnd um I think what Elizabeth Warren has figured out is that Donald Trump kind of broke the conventional wisdom about how you go about that um people forget him back in twenty sixteen when a Trump was running through the primaries and beginning to launch his presidential campaign\nThat uh that his number of what is the time or thought to be verbal gaps was were almost count bus I mean he just said things you would assume that we are going to get him run out of politics such as the fact that John McCain was no hero because it got captured\nA people thought is on its over\nWell ah he he wasn't done he's in the White House right now and I think what a Trump understood that was that I'm a\nCelebrity and politics has become the coin other realm and even if it's tarnished at times and you got to get your name up there in light and uh what Elizabeth Warren has done a risk getting a mockery by a lot of people\nAh that ah she put herself up there as a\nOpponent of Donald Trump how do we know that because Trump keeps talking about our keeps calling her Pocahontas and uh it's Trump's way of kind of to run her down and ridicule her\nBut um she in her way you know return fire a with this DNA report and it is\nAt some level absolutely ridiculous but John I don't think that out there among the progressive base where I Will say a day really adore Elizabeth Warren\nShe she kills it when she gives speeches in front of the groups out there like that um she has developed a national I'm kind of a lecture in a machinery a she\nDo sanctions work we'll depriving the people of the GDP even a currency any any hope of an infrastructure because of the drying up of resources with the sanctions will that bring the regime down\nMichael a very good evening to you I remember the lesson from Eastern Europe that I connected immediately with your observations at at PJ Media\nThe observations were when the regimes fell apart in Eastern Europe that is\nOf the early Nineteen nineties the late Nineteen eighties about time of the Soviet collapse it was not from the bottom it was from the top you needed to know that the leadership no longer a bait orders and that there was new leadership\nHow do you measure this effort to bring down Iran by so so uh so beggar ring the population that there'll be something like the ... good evening too\nHard drunk thank you uh well two things [noise] ah first of all those kind of a a vulgar more to some at work were told that if things get bad enough\nThere will be revolution sued the soup for evolution was something that just trapping naturally they're part of the normal course of events when I'm real the ... revolution or here [noise]\nAnd most of the time they fail and most of the time they happen not what things are getting worse but when things are getting better\nAnd when things were getting better even though we all ... with the meat cake for Marie Antoinette\nAnd a Hitler came to power as things are getting better in Germany in moose we came to power with things we're getting better and Italy or too sick or more [noise] and all that so it's it's actually the opposite of the conventional wisdom\nThe ages so off which is so often true ah I\nI just had a detail here Michael because what you're saying is correct all historical evidence points to that puzzling to me that this administration and the last administration both believed and from different sides of the same coin\nThat encouraging the population with or generate a allowances allowing trade to come in again or discouraging the population as the Trump Administration chooses both both the Obama and the Trump people believed\nIn that what you call crude Marxism they believe that the economics what's going to drive the story\nRight right they all believe that and and most of our ... and apparently most of our policymakers belief that\nBecause they keep on saying we don't want to change the regime we want to change its behavior and how are we going to change its behavior sanctions\nWere going to make them more miserable and it says if there was some kind of magical tipping point\nWhere when things got better know for the Iranian people they were going to rise up and change the regime [noise] and I don't think that's what happens I think that we're gonna have to support revolution as we did in the Soviet Union [noise]\nWe are talking about the revolution of the ... days are supporting dissident than putting pressure on human rights violations that that that is what undermine the leadership and the Soviet Union\nYeah that's correct and ah and and we reached out to the dissidents and the Soviet Empire\nAnd what you said okay we're with you what do you need and it turned out the things they need to work all that difficult to I mean they needed above all means to communicate with one another\nAnd ah they need that in order to tell each other how things were going all over the place so people in Leningrad had snow what was going on in Moscow and what was going on and ... and so forth [noise]\nAnd ah [noise] ah and the best way to do that was the radio sets while your radios were such a revolutionary instrument and so they had\nA red you for your radio liberty voice of America all of these broadcasts going in so that we could tell them what was happening there\nWe're not doing that in the in the case of Iran we are we're not talking to the Iranian people are broadcasting our first language broadcasting into Iran is is not very aggressive\nAnd for the most part the people who run then up ration or carry over from the old days\nAnd they tend to support the regime as Obama did Trump doesn't support the regime but\nTrump doesn't seem to get that if you don't want that regime to go on you've got to go after it you have to find it and he's not doing that\nMichael I wouldn't want to remind everyone that you wrote about the green revolution back in two thousand\nOh the election that the military coup that put automated ... Dina shot in power before okay any\nThey were under house arrest the last time I checked on them and you have you had a plane that in door seeing the green revolution and encouraging that leadership and it's a technical in all cities was a positive thing to do is that still positive I mean is that still possible\nOh yes absolutely possible eve ... better than ... [noise]\nIt's it's ... it's easy all you have to do is make a few personnel changes as I keep saying the thing that the Trump Administration does worst is person that they make terrible personal assistance they have not changed\nA Farsi radio management\nOr they do not have we have all kinds of leading to the treatment that guy\nUh bought to be who was on the cover of the economy was holding up his bloody T shirt yes yeah well when he's here in Washington and you'd think they will have him on the air all the time but they use you know as if he didn't exist and there are many others like\nThat yes I speak to no sense has a ... a few weeks he he was a member of the government at one point he's now in Washington a prominent journalist and Farsi is quite capable of telling the facts to the people in Iran I'm surprised that he's not a used\nYeah I'm I'm Amazed just honest and dismayed ... thanks\nVery discouraging but going on forever and for some reason the United states of America which is arguably the most revolutionary country in the world [noise]\nMaybe in the history of the world does not use revolution as an instrument or foreign policy\nWhen it's our most lethal instruments against these tyranny and all the tyrants no and they ... they're scared to death or the ... if you see what Rouhani says what combination says\nThey all talk about the United states try to foster a white revolution which is say a non violent a peaceful transformation those through regime and they know that that could bring them down them but we don't we don't get it\nMichael the dean of the foundation for the defense of democracies riding most recently in PJ Media about the imminent severe sanctions on Iran and will they were\nI'm John bachelor you know the John ...

goes pursuing openness is that a good thing to do in a qualities is a conversation around the world\nThis report suggests that what we need is more equal access to capital translate that Chris what does that mean more equal access does that mean you can go to market or that you have an opportunity at the bank how do you how do you interpret that\n[noise] so what in being a a technologist from

don't break out of their shell don't break out of innovation\nAccess to capital for ideas across a wide variety of markets and opportunities it's obviously best and most interesting to have as broad access to capital in the private equity or venture capital world is as possible but you see companies that quite frankly with out\nCapital may be better off in many cases because they learn the tough

the dynamic of internal civil conflict society or in the sense that\nIn stable periods elites tend to be a relatively homogeneous and although there are different factions within elites different groups within elites they tend to\nShare a world view and this was the best example would be say in the period of a Victorian period we understand from Sherlock Holmes where you had two parties you had the liberals the Tories\nAnd yet they're world view was was absolutely\nA unified and as a result um\nShip were issues of policy differentiation\nOh this kind of more unitary elite was also the

that you it's been used in forensic labs all over the world for for decades now\nI'm a marine biologist or kind of late to the party so we're just now starting to adapt some of these techniques for use in kind of figuring out who might have been involved in a shark bite\nThe I read from the reporting that the U.S has more unprovoked shark attacks than any other nation that was true in twenty Seventeen\nUm that nationwide we have a lot more than fifty and Florida has a lot of attacks is there a pattern here that's emerging Chris or is this is this just better data and or something like the shark lab accumulating the data\nWill there's a number of factors involved in this so one factor is now I get so much media attention that when these incidents occur they always get reported\nFifty sixty eight years ago you know it was sometimes never reported or sometimes that people never made it back to the beach to know that\nAn incident occurred and the other thing is we actually don't refer to these two shark attacks anymore because we don't know the motivation of the shark so we simply refer to them a shark bite so until we figure out you know whether the sharks intent\nWas to deliberately attacked some thing um it could be just simply mistaken identity the shark didn't know what it was a thought it was a\nA food item it bit into it and it decided we just don't taste good so that really isn't an attack that's I'm a sampling if you will but nonetheless a little bite from a big shark can do a lot of damage and what's remarkable and what we've seen in more recent years\nIs the severity of some of these little bites so to speak and how many people survive those and match really attributed to first responder um responses and in in saving these people\nSo we are getting more data because we have more survivors and we move quicker and our communication system allows us to know when something's going on in Cape Cod and two weeks later going on in San Diego county that's why\nWell that's one of the reasons the other reason is there are more people using the ocean recreation than\nEver before in history and in the U.S we have locations in our country where people can use the water year round and they do show when you think about\nHow people use the ocean now for recreation and how much time different user groups spending the ocean like surfers swimmers but the borders waiter stand up paddle borders when you look at the amount of time they actually spending the ocean now is\nExponentially greater than it was twenty thirty fifty years ago so

but while Russia has the largest country in the world it only has\nAn economy around the size of Texas and they don't really have much ability to project power it economically because of that reason I

numbers which are Fifteen twenty three fifty three sixty five Seventy in the mega ball is a seven\nAnd that story one billion dollar jak ... one thousand millions okay if you if you were to win that uh which are the odds against our three hundred two point five million blood\nWell actually ah since most winters opt for cash you wouldn't get a billion you get five hundred sixty five million the billion dollar prize refers to the new the option [noise]\nYou know for example I suppose you could [laughter]\nYou could opt to receive a dollar a year for a billion years I [laughter] probably not a good option but does most of us would a would grab the the big money I mean what's the difference really you know for the in the lives of most of us between five hundred and sixty five million and a a thousand million or billion\nI mean it would not change I think the impact on my lifestyle measurably you know what do you do with that money well that's what I thought I Would ask you what would you do with the money\nOr would you do with the money it's so much money [noise]\nUh there was a a movie a few years back and started to Richard Pryor and and in order to to uh\nGet an inheritance he had to spend a certain amount of money and the whole thing was about his efforts to extravagantly spend a certain amount of money which as as was pointed out\nIn that movie that was the whole premise for the picture a admirably done of course by by Richard Pryor or that it's not as easy to spend money as you might think it is [noise]\nAnd ah I'm just curious what would you do with that kind of money that this thing about it that a thousand million that is to say you could take a thousand people and give each of them a million dollars\nOr put another way you could take a million people give each of them a thousand dollars assuming that you got the full billion that's uh\nThat's just an astounding amount of money I mean sure if your Bill Gates were talking in the pocket change we're talking chump change we're talking or when I leave a tip Scott thing but for the for the most of us that's a lot of money even Rush Limbaugh would find that to be a lot of money okay [noise]\nSo I'm just curious what you would do with that I mean obviously you need to think big\nYou got to think big like Richard Pryor character in that movie thought big can't just say well I think we'll get a new job with a shabby I Know you gotta think bigger than that actually you might want to replace that particular vehicle or maybe with a fleet of vehicles [noise]\n... and ... ... ... ... can mind by Sunni and they get their mass killing two people that are in a lot of charity and how to keep that in that [noise]\nWow well that's certainly a very uh al ... thought to read it and we uh we obviously a wish you the very best there there was a person who who probably deserved to win one eight six six five oh jumbo what eight six six five oh five or six to six or Andrew in South lake Texas on the head of Joe Hi\nYou're taking the call I'm actually getting a lot of thought in the past and I've got a pretty foolproof plan for it would be to get that all the ...\nSo all of it tries to do that I Want to make sure we all heard what the Andrew said you said all of it\nAll that every penny okay rubble plus okay this is the tax load then\nThen I Would use that money you can borrow from your own trust and purchased four point five billion in a middle income property then with the money from those who paid back because given all the charities they give a billion service in real money plus interest\nAnd you've got ... five billion and properties yourself\nWow how'd you get up from from a billion up to four four point five billion that that's that's quite a rate of return they're\nTwenty percent down on ... billion or the properties\nOkay well you've given this a lot of uh do you play a mega millions were Powerball\nOnly occasionally\nOnly occasionally well obviously here's a man is ready for it gee whiz Andrew okay that that guy's got to the guy that planned out already Lewis in Mitchell South Dakota welcome to the ... Joe\nHi Janet I'm doing fine thank you I'm not as\nPlanned ... but uh uh I can tell you that ah from a divorce or five years old uh I was supposed to be removed\nFrom ah my\nMortgage that I had planned way and I haven't been on so the first thing I Would do is call that mortgage company and a pay that off first\nAnd then uh always had a dream car I owned it for about seven years and then I had to sell it uh which was the addicts has generally so it's going to cost me about eight thousand to get another\n... I'm curious how how big is your mortgage\nUh I Am only guessing gym because sharp and now for five years you're I'm guessing that that's probably about a hundred and ten thousand\nOkay so figure you're you're just a committed there between the mortgage and a and get your version of the general leave the old dodge city aren't here you're talking about two hundred grand there so that would leave you about a five hundred sixty four point eight million dollars [laughter] what do you go to the rest of\nI I I I um I got three kids\nBut uh they don't talk to me anymore but I Would uh uh secretly set something up for each of them about two million apiece and uh\nI'm a big animal lover so\nUh here in South Dakota I Would probably try to set up a no kill shelter and instead of helping volunteers run it to have it be something to where they are paid employees a and that's about all I can think\nWe're very good okay neither the of course two million each of the three kids at six million are down to five fifty eight point eight million let's assume that you you get an extravagant on the center of the you're talking about a duel knock it down to even five hundred and fifty million dollars but but you can see what I was talking about earlier it's not easy to spend this kind of money [laughter]\nOh no no no uh I I Know the movie you're talking about I really enjoyed it and uh it's true you you just don't know how to go about spending that kind of money and if you actually had a plan I think you would probably be a kind of person I wouldn't want to know anyway\nWell you know I as I say I would be very boring but I Would be buying all kinds of a of a a very a a safe and sound or bonds and the like I I Would I Would be setting up my family forever and all I Would allow others to really really blow a ton of bugs\nHonestly there aren't a lot that many things that I really want to do\nI mean you know the travel the world [noise]\nOh I suppose if you could afford it I mean you know sure that gives them some big vacations and then see a few places but I mean that's not a passion of mine a mansion ah [noise]\n... not a passion of my cars I mean you know most of the cars I wouldn't want to buy\nWould get me a a a a speeding ticket that would cost me a driver's license and rapid order I mean it would be tough for me to think of things to blow this money I'm not a gambler I'm not a big drinker anymore and uh\nIt would be tough for me to think of what to do with it All right thanks very much so Lewis Carroll in Rochester, Minnesota next on the jumbo had a

and Asian eligible voters also at record low turnout rate so although there was a record number of Latinos voting six point eight million\nIn the twenty four teams will be because their numbers were growing but still as a percentage that is a decidedly disappointing a given some serious in contentious issues at stake what do you suppose that is\nWell you know it's funny Jim I quite the Latino vote\nKind of like a three headed monster there so many moving parts here so many different had her ... immigrants you have the first and second generation\nAnd the well established generations here in the United states where the immigrants might think Warren way you know can we get behind that you know and I can only speculate can we get behind a candidate that\nListens to us that may speak our language too although not a necessary component and\nIs it worth our time to go to the polls now I hate saying that gym but it's absolutely true I can remember back in the days when I worked in the warehouse and they would pay us to go\nDemocrats ...\nRepublicans for jobs\nI knew rhyming line of attack from President Trump as he tries to pump up Republican voters by laying out a closing argument around two weeks from the mid term election [noise]\nI Know a lot [noise] of Kavanaugh law and order and common sense that's what it's going to be\nAnd remember it's gonna be an election of the caravan you know what I'm Talking about\nFrom feeding on a new might bring caravan thousands of Central Americans nearing Mexico southern border presumably headed to the U.S\nI Will say I have caused the problem I'm taking those lines because it's such an incredible autonomy I have so many [noise]\nEverybody wants [noise]\nWith the war is laws in the world we're doing a hell of a job\nUsing those laws to blame Democrats without evidence supporting the immigration influx\nAs you know I'm willing to send a military to defend our southern border [noise]\nIllegal immigration onslaught\nBrought by the Democrats because they refuse to acknowledge or to change the laws they like it\nAlso taking it Twitter with his Democratic conspiracy theory I Am watching the Democrat Party lettuce south on our country by Guatemala Honduras and El Salvador the leaders are doing little\nAnd he criminals from entering Mexico to the U.S again again without evidence this group of migrants are criminals grants for their part accusing the president fear mongering\nThey almost want there to be an immigration a challenge there most cheering it on a because they're looking for some way to create\nOr something to frighten the American people during an election\nWith control of the house and Senate and the balance trumpeting bull campaign though as the election season entered its final week\nPamela Brown and with all due respect to Pamela of course he did not say they were all criminals you said that they include criminals just a little parsing of the language that might help to further understand the discussion so we are talking to live with a key lay low ratio of the ... wealth management\nAnd looking at the end something I I Will simply state this as as I see it and I believe that this is accurate whether you dig businesses right or wrong and that is we live in a world of nation states nation states have the absolute right to determine\nOf their own prerogative who gets into their country how many for how long and for whatever reason now there are those of course who who are getting warm and fuzzy feeling about the whole world holding hands and sing in ... I Am not one of those people [noise]\nUh I'm all in favor of immigrants who come to this country by the laws of the land but no one anywhere in this world has the right to enter another country without the country's permission\nOr do you uh take exception do any of that\n[laughter] you know [laughter] I I think that the immigration issue is a very complex and complicated issue I think that\nWe should have a better policy on immigration I'm not that it's not strong enough that it shouldn't be definitely more career and um\nThat we should be trying also\nThis is our back yard we should be trying to help these countries out a lot of the problems I hate to say this but a lot of the problems these countries have\nWere created by us I mean unless Thirteen there from LA they're not from those countries so you know it's kind of a double edged\nThing although everyone lightly US government policy that created in most Thirteen\n[laughter] of course not of course not\nAll right from LA uh they they they certainly are and of course ah many of them have gone back and forth and there are those who wind up in other countries who who wind up a\nA entering this country but I guess the point is simply and I saw this sign by demonstrator out in California some months back and it it it's stuck in my mind\nThe size of the red immigration is right\nAnd and at the time I remember saying no it is not a right you may argue that you would think it ought to be which would at least be a debatable point I Would argue that it is not\nAnd should not be quote a writer but a privilege to be conferred by a nation state or depending on what is the best interest of the nation state but to call it a right or simply indicates that you really don't know what's going on it isn't a ride a and in my view that it should not be a ride per se\nBut this whole discussion of course is not about immigration and never has been it is about the laws of the land that is to say who enters the country legally and who does not your thoughts\n[noise] you know uh [noise] I think things are changing you know just a bike hoarding fifty Hispanics or or you know actually I don't like the term Hispanics I like to turn back to you know it's more selective upon his partner\nWarning for one in four ... persons here in the United states are going to be Hispanic where do we like to acknowledge that are not the fleet or terror policies that address this coming wave because\nWe're seeing families grow here average average Latino families have a lot more\nUh sons and daughters are ... an average angle a family um but more importantly we to tailor policies that makes sense that are not cruel and that makes sense going forward for the future that's just an opinion\nOr ended and obviously we are are dealing in pigeons will get a few from our audience as well here and they just a few minutes\nAh for example let's take of the case of the uh the children separated from their parents at the border or is my understanding that if we were to come across a parents who were let's say a robbing a bank\nOr that we would probably wind up separating those parents from their children\nAnd my response or frankly to those people is perhaps some would say harsh but this is my view if you don't want to be separated from your children stop breaking into our country there are procedures for entering this country and yes sometimes they are a very lengthy and sometimes they are\nLaden with red tape but a Soviet uh that does not give you the right to turn this into the international flop house your thoughts\n[noise] you know uh for many years uh back in the early Nineteen hundreds there was no illegal immigration John and I agree with you I think that I I I agree with you to a point but\nYou know looking at from the other side of the of the glass you have to also say to yourself Seventeen to Twenty years for someone to become a citizen of this country because I've seen that\nYes and I had it I did a show on that and and uh ... ... is not exaggerating that that that is the length of time it takes some people and it's way too long we proceed\nYou know so you know in that sense if we could you know if we can get both sides of the aisles start having the dialogue started having this conversation no one's ever going to be a hundred percent happy\nBut we sure are going to work and show progress to putting together an immigration that makes sense for every\nNow and again the prospect of this country being a one quarter or one third or more a Latino or bothers me not one wet and I suspect most Americans as well provided they came here legally which of course in the case of many would not be the case\nBut this was not about ethnicity or anything other than the laws of the land and ah so anyway the ah the point of course obviously then we'll discuss this in the the next half hour of the program with our guest is because we're talking about the Latino vote and the midterm elections to what extent\nIs this an issue of for the Latino population but obviously it is an issue than issue for all of us but there are other issues as well a job's a crime but all the other issues that affect everyone how does this fit into the ... of opinion here will be\nIn the game coming back again for operation Christmas how this is an international relief from Randy's mission is that I guess I ... I asked him into science for children in poverty natural disaster famine and\nShe actually got in and bring it to ... income or any any other locations in the family get passed on board for more information than ... ... square the upper ... care\nAnd it and how great college yeah yeah\nThis is the season it warm days call any reasons and went leaves on the ground and about a million things to make me sneeze\nFrankly you know ... something over by the garage that sounds like what animal that about the ball is tailor made to aggravate\nMy allergies sometimes the over the counter says helps but never in my eyes itchy and read science has long running and I'll wind up with a sore throat and that turned into a car before you know I'd be sidelined if it weren't for highlands health care I\nIn each one of these countries MS Thirteen being one of them but that's just\nOne of many that are there and right or wrong it was one of the factors that are that still\nCreating this feeling of hopelessness of helplessness in their eyes you know ... you know I Can't speak for their opinion or what have you but it's just something that has come up\nOne eight six six five oh Jim bowl as the we'd take a call from bin he is on the Long Island New York and joined the boy had an show good evening bed\nYeah good evening I I I wanted to know what you would consider the difference between four thousand Italian immigrants showing up what's island in Nineteen eighty two hundred years ago\nOr four thousand migrants coming to the southern border now is twenty eight to ... will be the er at different ... especially legally\nWell I can certainly give you my answer to that uh my answer would be that are the ones who showed up at ...\nOr just a landing by boat somewhere along the east coast and and running a show or they were going through the process which is all the difference in the world as far as I'm concerned or a ...\nA year and I both know that that process was short a months at best also\nIt was not illegal to enter the country at that time by or they did not have\nThe laws that we have now set up your right or wrong and it was a different process entire ...\n[noise] that's true but nonetheless it is the right of the country to do so I Would even go further and say once your population reaches a certain critical mass it as the obligation of a nation state to determine who gets in when you reached the point where there are a\nA certain number of beyond a certain number of people that are easily absorbed\nThat uh it has the obligation of a country to decide who should enter the country and how many based on what's in the best interests of that country now grad and you go back a century and a quarter\nMaybe say a century and a half and a and we had a burgeoning industrial machine that needed a it was very labor intensive needed a lot of bodies and we were trying to settle the lands of of the Old West we needed a lot of warm bodies we don't need as many today\nWould you agree\n[noise] you know [noise] um I I think that we still need a lot of bodies in other industries and to generalize or stereotype population coming in as not being educated not what you said but you know not only that education I I did not having\nThe wherewithal you know when many of these people are very educated and here's their advantage they will out work us\nThey work very hard my father came to this country work seven days a week I he worked his tail off my mother the same thing some kinds of her two jobs but the idea is that there has to be some\nSort of going back to what I said before there has to be some sort of policy that makes sense that works for both sides of the aisle and nobody's talking to each other gym well then I just walk into each other and

right\nNow I have no reason to believe you did anything other than candidates a complicated issue and I I assume that what you here's what he thinks so go ahead\nOf the other thing is this is the the

put into America because they try really hard to fit the America\nAnd I just don't believe that that we're helping ourselves by trying to uh to meet the needs of the Latino community in order to get them into this country I think that's why the influx who's coming in and the other thing that really gets to me there's no one is putting pressure on these government the way we should\nWe should cut

because All right bye says they'll be lower but you're going to pay a little higher as\nWell okay one other little goody though is um what is the availability of money because you're just you're middle person you you you know who has money available and who doesn't who wants to do mortgages and who doesn't who funds how everyone is\nGreat you know what I've noticed lately Tom is\nOn the people that have the special programs for a down payment assistance they have loosened up their guidelines a little bit as far as the income qualifications to be under you know you had to be under eighty thousand dollars even qualify for a down payment and says it now they've bumped it up to\nLess than a hundred and twenty four thousand dollars and that one's going up too so it's people that don't take they have any money for a down payment because they make too much money\nThat's all about to change\nAll that worried about what worries me about that ... is are we going back into the area which got us in trouble which is a no no they they are very little\nMoney or at ... I worked for ... at that time it was that we were doing that for the loans for\nTwenty percent yeah that was terrible\nAre we what are we are if they're relaxing the standards are we going back to\nYou know you know they they they\nDo a lot of research on who I'm to foreclosures on homes\nAnd honestly they're not alone\nThere are going to be a little tighter so yes they've done the research if you have to credit scores they look at your own history they're going to look at your employment\nAnd they know what they're doing as far as not having the foreclosures and the hundred percent financing like we did this for now they're calling the skin in the game anymore that these people really want to be homeowners and I think people care a little bit more now\nAt Twenty years ago about their credit score and you know building equity\nAnd stuff so I think they really researched it they're just handing out stuff like that and what was it that\nI knew I knew we were in trouble when I uh would uh I used to take financial calls on Fridays ... put it in front of people on I'll never forget I was getting calls from people saying\nHey Tom I got a no money down a you know in ... I'm a zero in what was it a a interest only loans no money down what do you think and I don't do it don't do it\nBut they will be but we're doing it\nIn the film or\nThank you very much for the call\nOr two for one measurement\nWell they've done pretty good job I've got to give the fed credit for I mean it was an experiment and they did a pretty good job of\nOf trying to patch through the recession of two thousand eight I'm bringing the question is how do they unwind that and that's always been the question of how do they get out of what they created\nAnd we'll see how skilled they are doing it but they've got to do it in a slow ... should yeah we'll see how they do All right\nRichard I appreciate the call\nPaid five five to nine five sixty six hundred John ah Reno nevada Hello John\nEyes on high or they had this conversation before but I think the main focus now should be to get the corporate taxes back up again they went from thirty five percent effective right the ... but all\nThe way that corporations were basically not putting in anything into the federal budget now they get all the taxes and they say that a trillion dollar profit\nIn twenty Seventeen right so I mean I was standing about three trillion a year what the government\nSo the idea that corporations can make a trillion and not pay back anything into the system you know the roads the labor air quality everything you know they've got to pay that\nSo I always thought it was fifty fifty but when I looked at the taxpayers are still putting in over eighty percent of the budget recall or finance at about one that I was going out of that but I don't\nKnow no no no no no no ... look at corporations have always been the small portion of revenue for the for the federal government individual income taxes have always been the biggest they always have been so by dropping the corporate tax rate you're not going to change that much revenue\nDo ah the federal government but what what do corporations do they provide jobs are they hiring obviously unemployment rates down to the lowest levels since\nThe Nineteen fifties I think it is\nI mean this this is the you have to look at the other side of the coin there is a benefit for corporations to be sitting there and especially banks having losing money because if you want to go in and borrow money even though interest rates going up they will have the money to do that\nBut if you wanted to have them send all their money off to the IRS they're going to be much tighter on making loans [laughter] I I look at it I I think it's a good thing that I

morning\nIt's MORNING or on the other thing for me on I I enjoy your show mentally and you're very knowledgeable and uh I have a problem do come up I live on a farm probably probably\nFifty or sixty acres and all of our as trees are either dead or dying or however I have this one as treated solitary by itself there's probably maybe ten percent growth foliage and the top\nBut at the very bottom of this tree and it's not a big ass treats a smaller one but at the very bottom there's about ten or Fifteen shoot coming up out of the out of the truck you know from the from the ground and I was thinking about maybe trans playing them you know a shaving I'm off\nA maybe putting them around to different areas and and I don't know as a possible can I Do that\nThe tree yes they are and that got into the ground there\nThey had yeah they have four ... four lanes on their um their not dead\nRight [noise] well the ... the here's the problem if you if you cut those off you'd have to root those before you plant 'em in the ground yeah I Know\nSo you'd have to take ... and and really what you would be one thing if you're going to take ask cutting or any kind of things\nWould be pieces that we're only about six to eight inches long so you'd be tall the tips of those All right and using those as you're cutting Z and he would take tips and you can actually work your way down to branch as long as you have the top out of the soil in the bottom part in the soil but you could actually take six eight ... cutting off of those\nUsually the tip cutting or your best\nAnd then stick those in a ... mix get those to root once they route then put them in the ground can you do that absolutely um and you know what's gonna happen with ash trees is this\nYour ... when they start to sucker out on the on the trunk like that it's usually a um secondary reaction to other issues that's going on with the tree so they're trying to regenerate so that I Know is down to go down lower and they'll try to send up soccer is as a matter of fact\nSome of your ash trees that have died from the emerald ash borer sometimes when you cut those off at the ground they'll actually sucker up at the trunk\nAnd start to re grow again they're very good at doing that\nI've I've seen that a lot of firewood\nYeah that's a test of that but I but down the road\nObviously there are all the ash borer will still be here and eventually it will take them out oh unfortunately\nThat's the that's the bad thing to all of this is that can you do what you were talking about you as you can take cutting\nRoute them plant them start more ash trees absolutely\nBut the the kicker is down the road the emerald ash borer still out there and you know populations aren't going away they're going to they may go down but they're not going away and they will continue to feed on the ash trees as they get large enough for them to to feed on them yes\nIt is there any hope of coming up with a a a some kind of act fair or some kind of a maybe a chemical that you can put on it will catch that will kill though if\nYou can well you know the the ash trees that are still alive out there today that the larger ash trees that are still alive are typically the ones that have been protected\nAnd there's a systemic insecticide which can be applied to the base of the tree or injected into the tree\nThat's taken up and it's a it's it goes inside the plan and protected from the emerald ash borer\nSo those are available ... I'm a and and you know a Arbor uh started doing that for folks that want to have that key large ash tree that's just a key member of their landscape don't want to lose it are willing to invest in the budget because you're going to have to do it you know it's it's a never ending process\nBut I don't know but they're willing to do that they're protected against the ... the emerald ash borer\nTo keep that actually around a lot of parks are doing that picking out several ash trees of different species and in treating them and keeping them they're so they've got a couple of specimens of ash trees still growing in the area unfortunately they haven't come up with anything as far as taking out the emerald ash borer itself\nI'm you know that they can actually get it under control they've looked at some a parasitic wasps that do a decent job on them but there's so many out there today\nIt is so widespread that's really not an answer for them right now I think the bottom you know the bottom line is they're just going to continue to spread and they're probably in about twenty three different states now and continue to take out the ash trees in North America\n... dead ash trees everywhere you know and and they're ... I think they're beautiful tree I like from a lot or you don't pick up the pile if I if I Do this\nOh it's just to read just do the ... down the road\nDown the road once they get a large enough yeah\nBut absolutely I you know if you want to take the time and it's fun to take cutting and try to get them to root uh you know go on for a couple of years in a in a pot and then put them in the ground it can be a fun thing to do and it's in a you know you should be fairly successful with it\nOh I see I'm looking at a couple of years of keeping keeping\n... here's the deal when you when you take those cutting Z and you put them in whatever you put them in and get them to root that takes you got one season just getting to develop a root system and growing in a container and then they move out of that small container into like a one or two gallon pot\nAnd there'll be grown in that for another year or two to get a nice root system developed and some size to them three or four feet\nAnd that's when they're taken out of either put in the fields and grown in the nursery or you take 'em out and put them in the ground let them grow from there so you've got at least a couple of years invested in them just to get them rooted well enough for you to go out and replant\nThem into your into your wooded area so you know is it worth it\nIf you like you know again to save a few ashtrays or to continue to propagate them on I'd say absolutely give it a shot it should ... you know you can get them to root for them to plant [noise]\nWho knows what's gonna happen Twenty years from now but

coming to you from Jamestown Rhode Island [noise] this is the site of the latest project\nFor the forty a season of this old house and today is the final day of production but right here actually in the garage out of it is a lot nicer than that sounds surrounded by the cameras and the sauce to bring in a story of a very ... just completed\nBy the spectacular team at this old house now if you're not familiar with this area it's a very unique place with a lot of history Jamestown Rhode Island is a coastal town it's it's just across the Narragansett Bay\nFrom Newport which is home to many many famous mansions\nBut if you didn't happen to be named Vanderbilt or asked her do you may have decided to build a more modest cottage right here in Jamestown and many of these houses deep from the late Eighteen hundreds and early Nineteen hundreds when summer visitors built them to enjoy the ocean breeze isn't the Sandy beaches\nBut today many of those dwellings remain on insulated\nAnd since they were originally bill just for the summer season there was really no need for insulation back then and that's what brings us to this old house which was rebuilt\nTo increase energy efficiency but keep the old charm now to kick things off I'm joined by this old house any contractor Richard truth do we welcome Richard thanks so much sir Richard when we say that the goal was to make this home energy efficient we're talking like insanely energy efficient here because\nThe plan was to make this a net zero house so those are not familiar with ... zeroes kind of explain that\nThere's a bunch of components to one is to make it insulated really well to make it incredibly tight and so we did that with our thirty walls in our forty feelings and and we made it tight tight tight and then on top of it we\nWe did another thing called aero barrier to make sure that we we controlled infiltration unbelievably I'll get back to the minute right so you got to make the place where the type then you've got to be able to make some electricity so we put\nEighteen solar panels on this brilliantly designed garage which just is behind the building away so nobody sees it it's the perfect dangle so it becomes this terrific collector for us and so we could make about five kilowatts of electricity so\nWe can make electricity were super tight we can make electricity in the last piece to have a really efficient heating and cooling in ventilation system which we we did and then something I'll tell you that ... in just a second so the combination of those three pieces [noise] is that when the sun is out right\nWe make electricity and we spend the meter backwards back to the utility and then when it's not out at night or and cloudy days we use electricity as we need to feeding cooling and running the building\nYour banking that electricity as you make it and then you're taken it\nIt's actually made all the energy that it needed now to do that you need to rely on a lot of systems or one of which was the insulation still talk to me about the insulation that made it possible here\nYou know as you said this was a summer cottage are designed a you know in the Nineteen twenties or so where you had some structural framing members that were only geared to support the roof load itself right a now today's standards with the insulation in the energy codes\nWe've got to make room for insulation or they might say that he's not even a so we had to do a combination of insulated from the inside with super high a fish and stuff like clothes so a spray foam right then we also had to insulate on the exterior of the building\nSo we added to the outside just as much as we added to the inside because we didn't have all room on the inside right they are they advantage to to adding to the outside is that you create that thermal barrier\nAround the the framing members which are much more conduct the transfer heat also\nSo that was a critical part of this project now to the inside the finished I had a chance to walk through the house earlier just amazing carpentry in this job you guys that are really terrific uh works here with all the detail in the ... and ... and stuff to talk about that\nWell uh I give credit to the architect on powers who are really just thought about every space in the house and took advantage of his expertise in the design world and and really created a masterful a depiction of of water\nThe atmosphere would be in a you know all we did was follow his lead in a and execute a but I I give credit to him he he took advantage of every single corner in the house\nAll the sounds are those are good partnership and unusual for you to have the architect is the home or you're killing his wife has the designer\nYeah well it was it was really a little bit intimidating to start with that because um I you know held to a little bit of a higher standard has left us do it it really turned out to be a really mutual relationship you know we collaborated on a lot of things done wasn't a so you know\nA meal to already you know right we were able to exchange ideas and um\nThey were right down the road so it eliminated a third party and the middle so it really ... really did work out\nWell but as you say communication really is key now the exterior of this home had a lot of work done landscape you had a landscape architect helping with that but ah you had to organize that part of the construction as well what was the challenge\nWhile the challenge was a it was a short period of time where we had to make a lot of things happen and we had three different porches which uh\nYou know cascaded down into the hearts gate and then we had a really extensive landscape plan\nYou know it caught me by a little bit by surprise but when they started bringing the trees and the plants and I was amazed at how many plant things we ended up having and then they the landscape architect Tom Ryan did just a wonderful job that segment in different areas around the yard which are all\nMeaningful and well planned in a you know it it it came together\nWe can't wait to see it rollout chefs winter the builder on this project thanks so much for stopping by the money pit that was my pleasure you can follow along with all the progress here in Jamestown online at this old house dot com or on Twitter and Facebook hashtags tear wage

and one of the guys who's a part of the fabric of this old house for over twenty five years is general contractor Tommy soul to just keep getting younger\nDon't you don't yeah [laughter] well almost thirty five years there wow five thirty six years and maybe a van it's amazing I hear and I'm Down in the first few years [laughter]\nWhat you played hard to get I ... well maybe that's it and turn it down because I work for my dad we would just do my dad would he didn't want any part of the details anyway but now we're too busy to do that\nRight exact on TV and stuff so I Want to talk with you first about the fact that a lot of the construction here was pre fabricated and I think when people think prefabs factory built they think well maybe it's not as good as what you could do my hand but that's not really the case here and ... you weren't specifically to things that you did hear that we're it's fascinating to me\nThe foundation first she said oh you can make everything in the house but you can't make the foundation\nNow you know you guys actually got a foundation three hundred miles away and brought here they bring\nA narrow trucking wow free casts foundation it's insulated it ... it has a concrete reinforced steel reinforced studying it insulated so there's no thermal break in that in that position and the studs a pre drilled for the electrician to run his wires through and it's a fast\nEfficient way to put a foundation and\nThat's basically waterproof at the same time\nWhile in the building that we're in right now this is actually the garage that it probably the nicest girl jak you've ever seen right but this was back to rebuild as well and so anyway\nThis is a pre cut building well you put it together everything's caught on a on a CNC so yeah so you know what's going to fit exactly right you know put the puzzle together and you've got a beautiful barn that looks like it was built onsite\nNow the challenge on this property was building at the net zero which means that basically has to be so tight so well insulated and uh so perfectly heated um that it it essentially makes all the energy it needs to operate that involved a lot of different types of insulation or want to ask you about that because I think it's unusual to see\nSpray foam used to different types of Springfield open and close close so and then you had stolen ...\nIn which a actually I Love that isolation I mean I think of it is it's basically rock right funding to fight it molten rock and ... and ... it's a great installation if astounded need for insulation and its water resistant well you know if it gets wet it's going to dry out\nNow you guys use a technique called warmer blanket on the exterior walls what does that mean well\nThat's the way you take the insulation the the stone will instantly right now you can also use rigid film and you apply it to the exterior surface of the building so you framed the building in this case we had the whole building we had to deal with the conventional walls right those will spray foam on the outside of the sheeting you have\nTo put a thermal barrier because you have to worry about the thermal bridging of the structure when it when it meets that different installations so in other words it could be some transfer of different temperature\nFrom the actual study and so you got to worry about condensation forming on the inside of the outside insulation\nHere that makes sense that way does enter the sandwich right so in other words you're putting something like a um it's it's ... like a house wrap that you put on before you put your insulation it's like a range screens you know of any any condensation should occur in between that insulation it will run down and not damage that she\nWas actually has to be completely storm only separated\n... yeah it's almost like when you're building sounded the buildings you put separate walls and never touch the same idea here right up which are firmly separating everything's going to see that insulation exactly right yeah that's the trick now you also had to install the solar right which is on this building and you also have a beautiful wouldn't shingles\nRight and I've seen an awful lot and I know you have to they write like crazy\nSay rye fast if they're not you you have to ... you have to think of that ... a ... today is not like what you can go it was say fifty two hundred years ago right the wood that you get from lumber\nIs really farmed\nTrees younger trees because all the bagel tight green trees are gone now\nThe wood will absorb moisture and so on down the line so what you would do years ago you would have what is called skip sheeting right basically it's like strapping their roof with space in between it so the air could get underneath the roof shingles and dry and from underneath and from the sun up top\nA wood roof is like a wooden boat it has to get saturated with water as well tied to the joint and then it becomes waterproof the shingle itself is actually ...\nAnd if it's laying on cheating without any air writ it rots from the underside out yeah so you have to put some type of a breather\nUnderneath that ran

point one [noise]\nThe money but it's presented by neutrons and home advisor now here's Tom Chrysler\nCoast to coast and more and more single this is the money that home improvement show I'm Tom quite lurking Jamestown Rhode Island today\nAnd I'm here hanging with our friends from this old house they've invited me to be a part of the final day of production\nHere and James now as a complete and a really unusual house they've taken a one hundred year old seaside house that when it was originally built was probably never intended for anything other than summer residency they bolted on a brand new addition and they've made this entire structure so energy and fishing\nIs now known as a net zero house which means just designed to create the total amount of energy it needs to operate so coming up this hour to get all the details on that project straight from the chia which team\nIncluding Kevin O'Connor Roger Cook plus norm ... will be by to talk about a very special mouse to reach by very few programs because this is these forty in season of this old house so let's get to it to get things off I'm very pleased to welcome a great friend of the money pit Tim and OConnor welcome Kevin\nAnd I mean that figuratively and literally because not only are you are now but you've been a friend too many homeowners now for many many years in your role as host and congratulations\nYeah well he's forty season forty years it's something we're very proud of his you know I Can't take any credit for that I've only been doing it for the last Fifteen or the other boys are twenty five years ahead of me on that but it's a testament to\nWhat norm Roger Richard in time he started back in Nineteen Seventy nine um that it's still going that it's still popular that we're still doing beautiful building like this and we're taking it for a little bit of a victory lap are proud of it absolutely so tell us about\nThis area of Jamestown now we're kind of right across the river from Newport which is famous for mansions and cliff walks is this where you move if your name wasn't Vanderbilt\n[laughter] I'm not sure it's an\nIsland or I Am right in their games it sounds so to the west of us at the mainland of Rhode Island\nAnd into the east of us as you say is the peninsula of Newport where all the mansions are all the sailing\nOr it's a smaller island community back in the day people had to take the ferry to go to school for a year to the mainland that\nWe are now connected by bridges but it's always been sort of you know one step removed from the hubbub of Newport for us it's the home of our architect is also a homeowner right who's fall in love with the area they had been vacationing here for\nMany years and he decided no this is where you want to raise our kids and we went to live and so that is what has sort of started this project to begin with\nNow this is a net zero project and that probably had a lot of challenges behind that you took a very old building and on an addition that significantly increase the space of it I had to bring those together and are not as a trick when he came to being any energy efficient\nHit net zero has two components to you've got to make your own energy and we do that with solar panels and it's kind of new beautiful technology but you also have to try to reduce the load that you use in the house right and as you know these old houses the original one he was built in the Nineteen twenties um leak like a sieve\nAnd now we place to grill near the back door a there is the barn or that they're in and out of the new projects it's a it's a family of\nOf of ah constructors right there ... definitely bills yeah\nSo we created a working yard off that garage in off the kitchen with a a with an old flat open space a little area of of paving a little vegetable garden and there's a sliding door between the garage in this open space so it's kind of the overflow workspace\nSo and so it's kind of like I'm bringing the indoors out in the outdoors in addition to carry space where she's very comfortable moving from one zones and the next ... exactly that's where the design comes in and then his side from the design\nHow you've got to actually planning the physical elements actually perform what that intent is yes oh yes so we gave\nThem both are in an area of heart surfers in an area of grass a it designed fenced or this kind of the back wall to this space put up a hedge between the house\nAnd the working yard which takes out some of the view of the mess that might be there in the back yard right out of the out of the kitchen windows uh and then that's also the circulation space in the back into the back\nBack yard a which is a larger grassy area for their two young boys to get out and do it young boys do\nNo if folks are listening to this thinking you know what process show I go through if I Want to improve my backyard space what kind of tips would you give them to kind of get them started will\nEither which you mentioned before about relating the inside of the outside is vitally important okay so you can have a great space outside but if you can't get to it it doesn't do a lot of good right [laughter] and and you want to go inside and look out all the windows you know because you're going to live in a in this New England\nWe live inside quite a lot of the time but I owe a lot of views out the windows are just as important as the views of the house or the news in the open space\nAnd then to zone those different areas as they relate to the house and then as they relate to the outside property lines we don't really think of the outside as being rooms but sensitive exactly the ruins\nAnd in the smaller the house the more useful those rooms are more important than they are right\nHave you got five acre lot you have a house in ... billion lawn and you know everything kinda bleeds out when you have a small house like this those outside edge has become more defined and they become more integrated into the living in the house\nSo all really important things to keep in mind if you're\nYou know if you just completed the summer and you're thinking about now\nSo I'm gonna start planning for next year you got about six or eight months now to start staring at those windows and thinking about those bases that I and you know really living through it and your head and maybe make in\nThe paper model of it I always just because people sometimes can't imagine space and make sure that fits sack but now's the time to do that and that's great information so congratulations on Wheldon project\nHere Tom Ryan landscape architect on this project thank you so much for stopping by the money pay ... thank you\nAnd you'll find this old house and asked us on the house on your local PBS stations plus for more details and behind the scenes photos visit this little house dot com or follow at this little house on Twitter and Facebook and hash tag ... wage Jamestown\nWell as you heard there are many many things about this on that or special and that includes the lawn there's actually a very unique type of earth called micro clover here\nWith us to talk about that is this old house landscaping contractor Roger Cook and pat Hogan was sod co welcome guys welcome ... so this is a house where the ...\nYou've chosen a type of Turks here that is extremely sustainable and pretty much defines a environmental sensibility for for a landscape let's talk about you call it micro clover what is\nThe micro clover is just what it is it's a clover but it's not not like the Dutch clover right a minimally flowering non colonizing clover okay that we've mixed in with a call to ask you mix in is very trout tolerant\nThe clover takes the atmosphere nitrogen converted into nitrogen at the grass can use so you don't need to fertilize it\nHer Roger when it comes to fertilizing and getting the the lawn chemicals just write that something trips a lot of people up right\nWhere we spend a lot of time on our lawns trying to get them just right and usually it's in the past it's always been a bluegrass lawn bright blue grass lawns a lot of water and a lot to feed and then you got to spray for weeds and bugs and everything else but this is the type\nOf tournament you see a lot commercially is it unusual to put it in a residents\nWell we just started growing this in the past few years in right so it's something that's going on we see is the future is going to keep going rancid exactly\nHow does it stand up in terms of like wear and tear I mean this house has has two kids are growing up in it you know the top of that it's tough for that at the idea house a couple of weeks ago here for this old house so they had quite a bit\nOf traffic and cross that lawn and uh I was back there last week with the professor from Penn State that have done research on this stuff up gorgeous he was a very happy to see so when you put down\nA side Roger as opposed to you know growing one from scratch what's the prep involved\nOr that I think it's the same as we've always been doing right we take what soil is here and we rotor Tiller scare by and losing it all All right so the the roots that are coming in can get down into a tank of themselves and get whatever moisture Zia then we find greed will ... will put in some lime if it needs it and then the seed aside [noise]\nNow we're in the midst of a wrench all rainstorm right now [laughter] I had to eat off as a health issue with irrigation today but does it take\nThe same amount of water or less or more than you wear traditional long we'd get\nAnother one of the beautiful things about it is does not use a lot a lot of water in the middle yeah we have to get in fact we have to educate people who are not watering so much\nThat's right yeah at the idea house I've already had to contact the irrigation contractor and say shut the water off the I had enough\nHow can you add this to an existing longer do you always have to start from scratch with San huh I think\nWith the micro ... you can over seated into it\nBut I Would say wouldn't want to do it into a bluegrass lawn because that's not really a drought tolerant orange alert more than a century right correct and that's not good they're not going to get along right those two types right yeah we've\nPut it in with the tall fast that's more drought tolerant about this is a harsh environment because it's right here on the coast I guess it's an appropriate products for a seaside community are yes it is is your last salt in it all that it's actually more of\nSalt resist the bluegrass is qualified\nI Love about this old house I mean you know you were things that you just wouldn't imagine really exist I mean the fact that there's this very specialized type of side that has all these benefits to me\nIs is so cool and and you guys\nAlways sort of pushing the envelope and coming up with this stuff for projects like that it just you

old wiring and that was certainly the case with this old houses well lots of wiring that had outlived its usefulness including what would have been probably the original wiring for one hundred your home it's a type called knob into\nSo with us to talk about the safety of all that old wiring and what needs to be done with it as electrician been Giles welcome Ben how're you we're good thanks for stopping by the money to this is an interesting area lots of lots of history right here\nLots of old homes and would you agree that nominee too was probably the first ... wearing the mayor than as these buildings\nYeah for sure that was the first modern type of wiring that could be afforded by your average person it wasn't as steel pipe installation or something that was highly labor intensive to install so it was pretty widely used in the early Nineteen hundreds as one of the first real residential methods of wiring\nNow it's interesting for those that are unfamiliar with not been tube or actually talking about real knobs and real to cheer when it was run through beams so you drill hole and they look like a ceramic tube through it\nTo sort of inflate the wire from the wood and then when it went perils of the themes that we'd be strung on these ceramic knobs and it was essentially an air cooled system so air had to circulate around it\nBut then we decided we were going to have these homes an installation and what happens\nWell it heats up the other thing I think that happens to a lot in these older homes as you know in the homes are originally built designed they weren't designed for things like vacuum cleaners dishwashers air conditioners all of these modern appliances that already have today\nAnd all of those things these days are grounded a lot of the time so what you get is people kind of tagging new wiring on to the old system in unsafe way race and using it incorrectly a an ...\nIt's coupled with poor installation techniques of newer wiring and the and the increased loads of the homes that just create some dangerous situations but the original installation the way that it was intended to be used was actually not a bad one writer who's fairly safe\nIt was it was the environment changed around it now for this house here in Jamestown did you find any existing nominate two that was still active\nOh yeah there was definitely most of the house had some now than to than it there were a lot of things topped off of that and um and to just like I just said people trying to get something that they didn't have and make it work with the existing system [noise]\nUm so it was definitely a a relatively dangerous situation in this house you know the things that definitely needed to be taken back to zero and start over\nTheir real education and I

learning skilled trades do you think they were ... for that mission\nOh for sure yeah you know they both love what they do they both loved to learn about what they do so that's a great start you know you can teach a lot of things but you can't teach work ethic are passions so those guys are both great for that\nI'm Talking to bend drowsy the electrician on this project in Jamestown Rhode Island and then before I let you go I understand you had some uh help with this project kind of a star assistant joining you with the rough wearing you had congressman Don Norcross from my home state of New

really more of a college in uh yeah I Know you are but that's you know but it's All right hey yeah I I think the NFL's getting a little too that little big whether they're a little bit for the richest

yeah\nBasically the player admitted to letting go brown he was going to get flagged but anyway well that's kind of a football news topic well let's talk about what we do here on the program Anthony to go ahead and get her show going with the financial stuff\nYou don't want to talk about news topic it's obviously been going around ever since last week when it happened so you know we had a out of the point drop kind of back in February right yeah oh yeah earlier in February we had a pretty big point drop in in just a little less than just about a week ago a little more than we can go I guess we had a pretty big point drop\nAnd they start doing these numbers that can say oh it's one of the biggest declines in history and blah blah blah blah blah blah blah\nAnd so got me to thinking you know we anytime you have something happen you have someone saying the doomsday are saying this is it the crashes coming and other saying you know it's no big deal it was a slight correction or really maybe even just a price adjustment what's your stance\nWell you know look I think they're both right okay I mean\nAre we do a correction absolutely the numbers prove it you know is a wise man told me once growing up he said young man\nPeople on numbers don't [laughter] yeah I mean and I got that no it is it is inflated and when you look at the numbers the numbers show\nThat for ten years in a row we have been on a ten year high and we cross that we broke through that ceiling now about what's it been now maybe four years ago we been on borrowed time\nAnd for four or five years but you know but who knows right would be but who knows I mean look at the end of the day if any of us knew what was going to happen in the stock market we'd have more money than Warren Buffett right right\nWell so nobody knows that's why I think they're both right I think I think a a correction is do\nI think a correction is coming now that might be that might be two or three years down the road it might be five years down the road I who knows right on the road and maybe five weeks down the road it might happen next week or as you saw earlier this past week we had a in two days we saw fourteen hundred point drop\nThat show you know it seems it seems like that I mean it seems like nowadays somebody sneezes Ryan and the market just kind of takes a tumble for you know fourteen hundred points in two days so\nBut it but I go okay but let's let's talk about this from an early but it did come back fairly quickly OK CEO ... hundred point drop and then within I dunno another three to five days now it was in the ... if memory serves and don't hold me to those folks but it was actually pushing the upper twenty six is which was heading towards a new high\nAnd then it dropped down and I think within you know five days afterwards it was back to mid twenty fives again so you know it's working it's not like it's I don't know again I think it's percentage versus points numbers it was like ... percent two percent\nYeah I mean it is and and at the end of the day you're right I I think it bounced back pretty quickly now in the industry we call that a sell off so when it gets high or out of people holding a lot of shares decided to sell it and take some money out of the market so it creates a big day up like\nThat well and he's so you have a lot of people were just been a little time on this I Hope you don't mind so we have a lot of people you know who say okay well it's probably a ... a price correction right kind of like that like talking about some of these corporations or the end of the years coming there just making some adjustments you have others say it's because the feds talking about taking the rates back up\nAnd just say uh you know athletics and activity and retirement can be linked together so planning and preparation right those two words are key in just about anything in life man they sure are and you know really key when it comes to getting prepared for an athletic event or for retirement\nWell yeah I mean of course they are made a lot of people assume that training for a marathon\nInvolved just going for a long run I Would say right I just start rather until I pass that take about a quarter of 'em out and then [laughter] for but I mean you know I mean actually on the serious side it involves a lot of ... and most marathon runners spin at least six months in training\nI've got a friend of mine actually he's my cousin he's my first cousin up in Indiana and he doesn't run marathons but he rides a bicycle like those long bike ride yeah let alone the U.S look I kind of thing same thing Oh yes oh last just back in September and they come down they have a place here in Tennessee on the lake and\nHe come down and it's nothing for me it's like\nSo I'm like you know well what are you going to do tomorrow route thirty five miles oh thirty five oh I mean and he had a good ride for it's not a hundred oh out and he's like well I'm ... I'm going to go down to Nashville back on my bicycle nothing while he so he ...\nWhile I'm like oh is that take you so he leaves at eight in the morning gets home at six that nine or something like ... smoke but but one thing I'll tell you about him and of course I can relate to him because being my cousin and growing up with him and stuff\nHe spends a lot of time training and\nAnd a lot of time mixing in days with smaller ride so before he goes out on a big ride that's when you come in and he'll ride that thirty ... thirty mile ride that makes sense a little short fast little law already yeah yeah yeah and then some days on long runs\nA that that is kind of help stimulate and getting ready for that by marathons so in a lot of days it's just it's just some shorter quick fast runs up\nThe same thing happens in retirement planning you should have different dollars invested in different ways to accomplish different task and your portfolio should have some planning behind it and not just haphazard and investment choices not just I think uh\nI'm sure that that retirement plan and you and I talk about that a lot and that's one thing that retirement specially really stands out among all of our competitors we really focus a lot on education education education\nWe educate educate educate what happens when you educate that creates a plan because they want you have knowledge then you're able to take that knowledge and you're able to formulate it and put it into a plan so we can get you built for the marathon because retirement is not a sprint it is definitely a marathon\nYeah very true very true and lack of knowledge doing that's just dangerous right on anything it is if you had a lack of knowledge and you start you know poking around a with trying to take your lawn mower apart you know he gets used right when the trouble or messing with a buzz saw or whatever the case is it like ending life education\nIs key to understanding and having a better thought out plan and perhaps strategy for whatever you're doing in return literally no different\nAnd that's what we're talking about here are kind of just doing some correlation between now and ... I guess we're going to just using Anthony's cousin and bike marathon and that's long distance bike riding it's pretty cool so we'll continue on with that theme and say or something that you and I are probably not great at and that's proper diet [laughter]\nWe'll speak for yourself\nI well I was going to I mean I'm not going to ... that says to me but now you\nYou know or are those that are on the listen to me on the radio don't don't get to see me but I'm the I'm twenty eight\nPounds you know I'm so proud of you I'm Down if team well we're all good for you know I'll just look an awesome in here aren't we [laughter]\nMuffin that's right but let's talk about a proper financial diet now that might sound a little weird people right or thinking about that but just like you're going to burn different kinds you know like carbs are going to help you burn you know a more efficiently than fats if you were trying to run or race or something there's gotta be some ways you can trim the fat so to speak and your financial plans well of\nCourse I mean before marathon most people do what they call it carbo load right and that prepares them in the days before the race the body's gonna burn carbs more efficiently than it than it burns fat right right what you mean ... ... yeah the energy\nSo having the right amount of carbs and your system's going to help help the performance while they're running or bike riding whatever that marathon is\nSame thing here with your retirement planning you need to be paying very close attention to your portfolio in the years leading up to the retirement you cannot afford any big losses\nSo it's important that you have a proper diet to be sure that your properly managing that risk and mark a lot of times when folks come into our offices in Knoxville or Chattanooga Cookeville\nWe but one of the things we do is a risk analysis and when we share people I'll say what's your risk score and they kind of look at me like I like like I have to have kids they don't even know what a risk Korea's right so one talking about on yeah for sure yeah yeah and once I Do a risk analysis and I said well your wrist scores in eighty five or\nNinety or whatever it may be and then I'm like well what are your expense ratio as well they don't even know what the expense ratios are so so in this particular analogy that we're talking about they don't even know what diet they're protecting us\nAnd a lot of times you know you think about trim and the fat or kind of cleaning things up that could be in a lot of the fees that some of the things that you're carrying an owning half for you that can be a lot of those hidden fees you talk a lot about those as well\nWell yeah I mean there's always hidden fees and a lot of times you know people say oh I don't pay any fees and I'm well of course you have to write nothing ... you have to pay fees right yeah there's nothing free and\nPeople honestly get deceived and they'll say oh I don't pay any fees and I'm like yes you do so and when you when I asked you can see is chipping away Taylor tyrant playing yeah you're totally and if and if I'm able to save somebody's Seventy percent on their fees that's a huge amount of money over her son's lifetime\nAbout one thing about reducing your if your Seventy percent\nSo yeah so exactly the same kind of thing fits into place here look a lot of what we do here on the show was trying to get you thinking about things because\nSometimes we you know let's be honest we we kind of put financial stuff on the back burner a lot of times in life maybe you or maybe you operate off of a budget but a lot of people don't a lot of people kind of have a general idea of what they do or\nThings of that nature when it comes to their finances but retirement is so critically important\nThat you want to make sure you're not making those missteps and that's why I think you know it's just a great idea to make sure that you're talking with somebody who does this every day you know I don't run a marathon so I Would not even begin to know how to plan for one well I don't plan for retirement every day so I wouldn't know how to do that but Anthony does\nAnd his team a retired special degree but that's why it's important to reach out eight eight eight five five seven Nineteen Ninety three\nEighty five five seven Nineteen Ninety three and the final piece I Want to just ask you on this Anthony is you know I did some reading real fast while we were here sitting here talking to get me a another point to talk about\nAnd starting to fast it seems as though a lot of people get tempted to just shoot out of the gate when it comes to\nAh any kind of athletic at a attendance and boy that's marathon in your bike racing or whatever and it makes sense right 'cause you're at the starting line there's probably music playing a crowds you know you know getting fired up they're going to cheer you on when the gun goes off and you take off to go\nAnd you got to be careful and retirement because you can shoot out of the gate to fast they're too can't you\nWell you absolutely can and and especially you see this in marathons you know sometimes it's tempting that\nAnd I my son my my twenty three year old he grew up racing motor cross and it was nothing to watch those guys\n... you know get flagged for too fast of a start oh I'll go or something yeah so yeah so if you know you've got to time it just right because if it's too fast I mean you're feeling good your adrenalin flowing and then you're you know you're on a pretty pretty good pace clicking along and\nYou're feeling pretty good but if you don't pace yourself appropriate well he had to run on a bike ride and write your ass out\nOh you're going to gas out and you're gonna you're gonna fall by the wayside right yeah and and you're going to you're going to have some serious issues when it comes to the end of the race and you might not even be able to finish to be quite honest truth ... so so retirement is the same way I mean it's it's sometimes tempting for people to spend too much in the early years\nBut if you don't have an income plan that tells you how much that you can reasonably spin than you might end up spending too much and cause trouble for yourself\nLater and right when they called that the the go go phase right when you first yeah but you're going to go go\nAnd that's great we want you to do that you want to enjoy what you've done but you've got to plan accordingly so that when you get to the no go you're not broke [laughter] well that's right because somewhere around eighty you're going to his logo [laughter] five is no go [laughter] yeah exactly and then and then you know because you you don't have that income\nPlan that shows you that stuff you're you're really not able to spend with confidence so\nThat's all about this plan that we put together called the financial GPS that's our trademark plan that's something that we built we personally design and I mean mark I tell you this thing it's hard for people to really grasp it that hear\nMy voice on the radio but it's it's sixty five to a hundred pages the plan is so it's a very detailed plan and to be quite honest with you\nI found that most people that come into our offices don't really have a true understanding of three basic things one they don't know how much that they're paying in fees and commissions to they really don't know how much unnecessary risk taking with that nest egg\nAnd then three they really don't understand the tax implications of that retirement savings so those that are listening today and and kind of fit that three categories look I've seen people come in ... they were getting ready to take a five hundred dollar withdraw it was going to throw him in a whole different tax bracket and that five hundred dollar withdrawal was going to\nWell it can be challenged in so easily\nBecause you're thinking this inheritance is going to go to I you know I Want this to go here and I want this to go there and I want I Want Johnny to get the golf clubs in on Julie to get the car or whatever the case may be\nAnd then all of a sudden because it's written in the will then it goes before the judge and the judge says does anybody here contest and all it takes is one person\nOr we saw at one time in a court system where the guy said it was the guy's brother he stood up in court and said yes your honor I can test this because you know the guy that was with him a just a couple of days before you had a massive heart attack they were playing golf\nAnd he said your honor I play golf with him two days ago and he just told me then that if anything happened and he wanted me to get this this car and it was crazy it was just it was just foolish so\nUm and then you know and it it just it just unnecessary so in the in the case of an inheritance you want to make sure that you're set up but with the trust is that trust eerie vocal it does it need to be revoked global does it need to be a charitable reminder trust does it need to be living trust there's all kinds of different trust out there\nAnd my attorneys are extremely skilled that's all they work in his estate planning and as I said now be be watching here in a week or two I'm going to bring my attorney on air with me and we're gonna we're gonna have an entire segment that we are going to talk about estate planning and we're going to talk about trust\nAnd but as far as an inheritance goes you want to make absolutely sure that that's in a trust and then it gets outside that court system you don't want it to have to go through probate you don't want to have to pay all the experts\nWe just saw it was it a who was it the\n... years we were all there is a bunch of them Aretha Franklin had a problem of the problem I mean yeah it's actually surprising the number of\nUh celebrities with a lot of money to do not wind up in these things done they just don't and I I actually had an article I should've I which I found that maybe I'll find that and we'll talk about that or maybe in another week or two here on the air\nUh but uh was actually from her hurdling legal team and stuff that talked about how they urged her for years Aretha\nTo take action and she just wouldn't do it and lo and behold it's just been a big mess ever since so surprising when you constantly see that we're you're listening to retire the right way with Anthony Wright AAA five five seven Nineteen Ninety three if you have some major life events that have just happen are coming up or\nYou have some questions or concerns about what to do if they do strike will get yourself on the counter no cost around ... five five seven Nineteen Ninety three\nAh we've got two more of what kind of get to these these are the ones that happy one maybe [laughter] and one is definitely not a but a year okay so I Am an empty nester that's another major life event becoming an empty nester\nNow you could have been but you got yourself a little fellow there so you're not going to be an empty nester now for a while you get a little eight nine ... Thirteen Years eight okay All right so you've got a little what ten years okay ten years maybe a way they were or thinking about\nMcCauley which is a in Chattanooga and it's a it's an all boys preparatory school wow okay okay so if that happens his freshman year in high school or what are we now only six six years\nWow okay well ... it's changed now I I that's for sure my wife and I enjoy it you know we miss our daughter but we enjoy being empty nesters but that's a a lot of things there's there's some good things to think about an Iraq because now you got the kids off the payroll um my dad used to call us biscuits Snatchers we're no longer on ...\nUh so what are some things to think about when it comes to being an empty nester or just to kind of look forward to that might change your your financial aspects\nWhere the big the big thing is is is my wife has telling me that I'm going to be an empty nester 'cause if I Move her baby to a colleague\nThat I got out I used to work on her you know as\nFar as as far as concerning finances when when the empty nesters go unfortunately\nI Do have three older children I have a twenty eight year old I have a twenty four year old and I have a twenty two year old so the older kids go and they leave but unfortunately they don't always leave mom and dad's pocketbook behind right right so he goes and I mean we all want to help our kids along the way I mean we don't want to do it for\n'em but every time they need a little help you want to be able to help All right so just because it's an empty nest situation doesn't mean that you can kind of kick back on your\nLows if you would and just kind of take a deep breath and relax\nBecause they're still going to hit little bumps along the way that you're going to need to help him out of\nYeah and you want to be who you want to be sure that you don't want to derail your financial during your own plans right you don't want to sacrifice retiring say that yeah\nSo you don't want to get in a bad situation where you're having a sacrifice yourself\nFor that particular case you know we had a I had a client that are asked me a couple of weeks ago about he his son and daughter in law were really struggling and the he was thinking about taking money out of his retirement and and paying off their house\nOh well yeah yeah so but I I see different types of people I mean I see a lot of people come through there they're more like him and then I see a lot of people come through say I'm not gonna worry about the kids I had to struggle and fight it out like in struggle but it yeah so you know so there's there's different ... different different strokes for different folks ...\nWell I guess in some things to consider is once you do become that empty nester do you want to downsize the house maybe you raised a large family and you have a four or five bedroom house and you just don't need all that now that you're going to be heading into retirement or maybe the house is not retirement proof as they\nYou know you're not going to want to struggle with those stairs as you age so different things to consider when it comes to different meals are all great if those are all great point yeah a lot of different things to consider when it comes to major live events and we'll hit this last one because we're getting real tight on time and it's unfortunately a dark subject but it is going to happen or one hundred percent of us are going to experience the death of a spouse\nOr and we're going to lose our loved one and just a couple of things a quick points to consider when unfortunately this happens well once\nAgain you want to consider when that happens you got to be sure you gather all the eggs in the basket so to speak and then you've got to count your eggs right so\nYou're going to lose half basically of what you know you got to an optional side was this talk financial here you're losing half of your income\nYeah exactly I mean you're you're losing half your income so you kinda gotta kinda got together all your eggs you kind of got to count them you got to see where you're at and what's leftover and then you've got to find that did that level and have an IRA somewhere or a four O. one K. or how have we been living since I passed all you know how much of that was their income\nUh you know use their name on the in the house is their name on the car I mean you've got all these things to deal with and what about Social Security survivor benefits\nSo you have survivor benefits that you get a look at it and see if you can get so all those play into the factor when the when the death of a spouse happen so yes it's very tragic and yes it it hurts extremely bad it's a tragic moment in there you go with the beneficiaries once again so once that spouse passes\nNow you have to go make make absolutely sure you don't have their name on anything because what if you pass away and they're still not there you know yeah it can be it can be bad so do you need to check that\nWell and when it comes to making sure that your retirement plan is set up correctly\nFor the loss of one of one or the other of you and certainly a lot of little fine pieces of the you need to check off and make sure those things are there and it's not a fun topic but it is one that we all have to address because we do not want to leave our partner you know in bad shape so to speak more than they have to be you know they're already having the emotional side\nWas trying to make it as easy as possible and the financial side\nAnd you can do so really by making sure you got that financial plan in place that's helping you get all these items kind of checked off on the checklist and Anthony and the team can certainly help you out with that by calling ... five five seven Nineteen Ninety three\nThat's AAA five five seven Nineteen Ninety three he usually saved this for the end of the show but I'm going to go ahead and just tossed it back out there that\nIf you're one of
