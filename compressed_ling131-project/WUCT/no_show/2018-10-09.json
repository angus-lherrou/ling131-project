it pays off Saturday\nYeah it's a back to back to the grind back to the SCC and uh hopefully they use these last ten days or so to uh ironed out a few things in a get a little more continuity and get a little smarter and be ready to play better football\nWell I think it's also important off week to get the kids away from football to give them but I mean obviously it's been a grad they've been going pretty hard you know since what August going hard\nAnd to get away June ... yet but I think it's important for those guys to get away get away from their teammates and the coaches relax a little bit uh but at the same time you know obviously cooked ... staff had some a chance to look at it some things in into value weight their talent in some of those practices\nYou know a lot of guys went home see the old high school team ... see their friends and uh a such a good thing to just kind of catch your breath is none of the season but this team needs to take a step in to get a little bit it does and so you you\nKinda got to juggle\nYou know take a breath get away from football with\nBetter what we're doing any of that says that's a delicate balance and you know the coach Bruce as\nMuch as a figured it out I think they did a lot of hitting and I think that in quite a bit of scrimmage during last week to\nOne just to kind of help on the fundamentals but I think also see are there any young kids on the way to go up and help us right now\nWell I think it's important that that's important I think to develop a competitive a toughness physicality a ... in your program but I think that's I mean I don't think\nLike most coaches would have done that in that spot\nWhere and I think you know ... it's kind of like a down the road it's like setting a precedent so next year doping date it's not it's not it's not play time it's not a vacation hey hoping day you know we're gonna we're gonna get after a little bit to just get ready for\nIt you know as much as you guys hated open dates when you were when they got two of them next year is the way the schedule is going right\nSo I don't know like guys they really don't care to get through this year there's like spring break all over yeah [laughter]\nSo Bob Jared here and taught them what do you hope that he learned and what the what does he need to do to get better over this open you know he's ... well it is I have a really hard time in critiquing Gehring Donald because\nI haven't seen him behind solid protection yet\nAnd until I seem behind a line that can protect them to know whether he knows who he's really going to end where you can get the ball up on time and things like that it's really hard to to gauge his progress I think one thing that I that I if I was him I Would work on constantly was\nHe is what I call a long throat and he's along thrower and that means it takes he's got a big old wind up paying\nIf he's going to go anywhere in football he's going to get rid of that or he's going to have to shorten it he's one of those guys are\nKind of turns the ball back and some guys teach that I I I'm One of those it's got to be helping out camping out you could\nTurn it you can turn it but it's got you got to be able to wake up and out quickly and he says he\nDoes not do that he's along through our\nOur number set out on the big orange hotline here a dead end barbecue is one eight hundred six eight eight eight six five seven one eight hundred six and eight V. O. L. S.\nOr tweet us your question to us at the ball network underscore I. N. G. hash tag ask role network I don't much how much football are you guys got a chance to watch over the weekend I did watch the Mississippi State Auburn game\nWas shocked that sovereign cannot tackle that's Nick Fitzgerald their quarterback\nBut a lot of guys I mean he just passed him ... is the SEC is all time we've lost a lot of people have not been able to tackle him but I Do you know you you look at the schedule and\nYou know Tennessee has got to figure out in this stretch\nHow to win some games okay and you know at the start of the year I wouldn't have said Auburn was one of them I kinda feel like we can beat them I really do they're struggling on off and they haven't found a group um you know their their court wrecked such um had not played great\nUm had not played like he did last year at the end of the year so you know this is a chance to to steal getting we I said the whole time is this the staff they want to build his program they're gonna have to win some games where they don't have\nThe better talent because the game I think they can still\nLook in the Albert played against Mississippi State and we don't have a quarterback like Fitzgerald we don't have a guy that's going to make the first guy medicine and essentially be the full back half back\nH. back for your off and that is how he plays we don't have that uh we don't have their off into blind now I was really surprised with orange juice\nUnder two hundred yards just absolutely amazed because he's a good runner but he's not being able to be All right so ah you know I don't know where there aren't going to be mad or\nWell disappointed I think with all fences when you struggle\nI think struggling off and it's kind of begets struggling cars on I think I'd start depressed they start trying to do too much um I think the war in a good spot to get kind of a struggling maybe a little frustrated team hopefully defensively costs and turnovers and um you know I'd like I said I think this is a game you look at the schedule\nI think it's a game we can steal I I'm not I'm not saying well relief elite maybe I I feel that this is kinda strange but after watching college football I feel better about playing Auburn than I Do Kentucky\nThat's crazy I Know but I I Do\nI don't feel good about the war [laughter]\nBut Auburn has struggled scoring and that's something that I was I was going over these numbers with pat before we got on the air Fitzgerald their quarterback and Mississippi State\nTwenty eight carries for a hundred and Ninety five yards and most of those were designed quarterback runs ... and they went right up the middle and against the vaunted front seminal Auburn give them the time of ... Mississippi State of the ball forty one minutes and fifty three seconds Auburn ... Eighteen minutes\nThat's what I mean you got it off at the main part of that is Auburn off and it's\nGetting first out and they struggle they just have not played very well I think\nThird square say they didn't have a touchdown taken off with low trying to stretch the ball the goal line so they took that touchdown whoever which could have swung the momentum of the game but\nI think Auburn Auburn is having a lot of St problems we are up ... they can't run the football uh they don't really have a bell ... running back when I think they're having off its von ... and they're not protecting instead of them at all he's he's ... he's having to move around and and he's just not the same guy that\nHe was supposed to be coming out junior God's being the pretty ... last year he was awfully good this year though I don't care who you are if you if you get protection you're not going to play a very good federal\nHim I said this guy it was like during the top recruits I said he's a he's a\nHe's not look that\nThat way they look at it looked a little overweight from the outside of ... he looked like a defensive lineman without a he's lost a lot of your he looked like in my neighbor out there with the water in the yard I mean\nHe did he has gotten in a plus ... he's a freshman yeah ... he's got a chance to you know to define himself yeah ... and and have a great career because he's got some ability but let's be honest seat he did not come cooked for he did not come into\nShape no and but I think your first chance to see him would be an special teams to see it if you can finally get him has for shrimp um\nYou know I just depends on how the season goes there and I think coach Pruitt's about winning games and you might sticky men there but ah I I don't know I\nI Would write and how they I don't think for him just perk for him would be the red shirt and I mean obviously you probably won't play for games but um\nYeah so we'll see on both of those huh let's go to Kevin in Columbia Kevin how are you tonight welcome to the big orange\nSo I'm doing great I'm doing right Bob thanks a at least we saw a lot to say it was bistro running the ball obviously you're into was not Fitzgerald but do you think we can maybe see some wild cat action we saw that earlier in the year\nAnd also a how are we going to get caught Chandler and space we got to get the ball and in space and I think I agree with Jeff I think we went out to this weight gain and yoga do ball\nGames I I Do think the tide Chandler has to church more than nine times like he did and the Georgia game I don't know I'm a I'm a twenty time a game changer type guy personally\nI'm personally that we have we been playing for running back before tail back whatever I got to get to to I think those guys got ... I don't know who they are I don't know I'm just saying I think you've got to give those guys a chance to get in the rhythm of the game I don't think any of them have ever felt like there in the rhythm of the game and start to get the feel for it\nYou know it's interesting to you got to tell banks Jordan and Chandler ... pretty much the same in London and banks you have to be pretty close so it's not like you have four distinctive different time\nBack I I I I disagree I think Chandler is\nWay more talented I Would suggest that would be one of the most talented yeah I I really had I think he's the guy that can go and and and\nCan make people missing and go the distance if if I was now I'm not there every day and so I don't see how they practice and all that good stuff and I think they all have a good point but if I if I'm a put a gap there down after Dan I'm and I need plays tight family is a guy I'm\nGoing with a group that uh the ... about the wildcat situation the problem you have with wild cat when you go to that\nThat kind of the the antennas on the defense kind of pop up all of a sudden they have they're going to run the football the thing may Fitzgerald was so affected the on I I mean he was reading the opera so aggressive defensively and he was just reading it they crashed down on the tail but he just kept\n... that's one of those I mean you could say well okay who are going to run the wildcat with and then all of a sudden you got to figure out I mean the current time was the guy you're going to you know what the ball run the ball twenty times where okay yes so you do that\nNow all of a sudden you got to figure out a way to wrap that and all of a sudden it's like you said if you're going to read that it's not\nAs easy as I'll just you know we'll try to a couple of times\nUm it's it's nice for fans to talk about that and I could drop on the blackboard and say hey we should\nDo this but it's another thing to actually implement it put it in play and also guarantee ... is physically he's not ... is is just a he's a bit and he takes he takes a beating gaming and game at an age to ... to it I don't believe ... could take some of the said he\nSaid well I think today also that Germany proven this press conference kind of a\nA put an end of the gear and tunnel running a bunch of against Auburn 'cause he mentioned the fact that Fitzgerald a is probably so store he probably couldn't get out of bed this morning and be a if you're going to run your quarterback that much you better have somebody else behind this you should and I'm so we'll see how that plays out speaking a coach broady at his\nWeekly press conference today to talk about the open debt and get ready for the ...\nTime now by their\nChoice Scott stronger you buy Kroger\nPrices pleas for your game day party nice\nWell I Know we work really hard going back\nWe were really hard and fundamental just blocking block block protection I'm just kinda went back to the ABCs of\nYou know what you do during spring about what you do in fall camp\nWhich we need I mean we had a lot of guys didn't get to do that here in during the um so\nThen we got guys that are\nAre inexperienced we got guys who have experience and maybe you're not doing it\nAt the highest level so it's good for everybody's good competition uh all the way I Know how to get better something has to go do it and that's what we did this past week\nI was thinking about over the weekend I think there's probably ten guys that have started for us at some point\nIn time this season uh there wasn't here during spring and\nUm there's probably\nAnother eight to ten guys that play a lot that that wasn't here so it was good the kind of go back and and get some fundamental work and go back to the\nKind of some foundations or you know both sides of the ball and then the kicking game unfortunately we did lose a player or for a few weeks a tray month flowers on\n'em do the intercept a ball of the day in a\nBroke his collar bone but he had surgery and he'll be back in a few weeks so I'm\nSo unfortunate for him because he really had improved in the last two or three weeks and had a great off week this past week so um but we'll be without him moving forward\nUm you know got a tremendous challenges we go into ... um\nYou know all burns a very difficult place to play 'em\nAnd they've got a very good football team I'm\nVery good on defense I think they're on the top defensive teams in the country they're\nThey're really big up front um got a really good friends seven play man demand in the back in a whole lot I can do that but now the ball lots of pressure on the quarterback\nAnd they can do it with just their front for you know a fence Lily Garcia is always done a really good job running the football I'm making you play from ... online creating explosive plays in the run impasse game give me a bunch of different looks\nThey play really fast a got an experienced quarterback got good wide receivers you know Chandler Koch seems like he's been playing forever um and then got a couple of running backs that are big and physical or so it will be a tremendous challenge for us and they're kicking game got good specialist\nReturned upon and kick off or to stay on the block three kicks this year so they got a lot of runners and strikers owner special teams and they got good guys are returning in the back in so uh we'll definitely be a huge challenge for us that our guys I think are ...\nThe chance to prepare for somebody kind of talked to guys they they don't have any history of playing over you know nothing especially on the defensive side\nYou know there's a lot of wearing is that you need 'em so we've got to do a good job getting these guys prepared for this week\nI think if you looked at her\nFrom both sides of the ball in the kicking game um there's been some bright spots through the first five weeks\nYou know and then there's been lots of inconsistencies so [noise]\nI really couldn't say one spot is\nIs further along than what I thought it would be er one spots further behind I think if you look at the whole part I'm\nAn entire teens to improve on it to ... and being consistent and everything that we do\nI'll I'll I live in a um kickoffs a\nYou know especially on the road will will be home by seven thirty at night so I'm\nYou know sit around all day as opposed to seven o'clock\n...\nJeremy Pruitt his press conference today talking about a trade on flowers that was the big news today out for several weeks with that broken collarbone and in\nFact he likes eleven AM kickoff she played a lot of those when the U.S\nDown through the years being on central time of the places east coast are we got a Twitter question now for you guys uh it says that is from Michael foul star remember coach majors using the third down quick kick when his team was backed up and check on her and that's surprising the other team in reversing field position is the quick kick dead\nDo you see a musician so funny you say that 'cause like OK as a quarterback and\nIts third and twenty and all of a sudden you're like oh here comes the partners are trying to sneak a man this has never really thanks for your confidence coach [laughter]\nIt is a great I I think it's a it's probably not use enough in in football today it is not\nI don't think it's dead I think if I think the only way they detainee good really is if you have quarterback\nThey can get you get a little bit hard to stick around or somebody like yourself in a shotgun and all you do as he heads back a couple of yards\nCatch it kicking it you know\nYeah I did I say I couldn't part so I didn't have to worry about I did see something though yesterday in one of the NFL games I Can't remember which one\nThere was a guy dropped kicking the kickoff snow yes didn't put her on a twang really yeah I did just because you can you know if you drop and you kick it off the ground that's legal and they did 'cause you could kick it straight up in the air\nSo they drop kick I might have been Seattle I don't think about it though I mean I'm I'm Sorry but if you're\nUh the ... the two guards neither one of those guys are very healthy one of those kind of shoulder injury other one's got a hamstring problem that I was\nA little surprised that both of them ended up starting last week and then the uh the center situation they've lost their centers in the NFL now their backup center almost made it an F L team and the two guys are playing that missed almost all spring practice one of them ... de la ... one had an injury and\nNeither one I've had a lot of practice\nSo they're on the second team right now and uh you know he's going to be good these retro freshmen he's just not very season so this is certainly\nA more vulnerable off and it's you know we're not used to seeing all over one of the leaders in the country of rushing your age and they're not even close right now\nYou know I think ... has had a thousand yard Russia or for nine or ten years in a row and it doesn't appear that that's going to happen again this year uh\nCan't run the football can't protect your quarterback it it sounds kind of this story\nA little farther south\nNow defense you know the struggles against Mississippi State but before that game I mean your front seven is probably consider to be one of ...\nYeah the front seven is a good bunch and um [noise] I probably would say this game last night was an anomaly because they had been praying really well defensively and uh you know part of\nThe problem was he a special teams dropped apart right before it has a ... and ... with us at the state of short field and that certainly didn't help to cause but I'm the ... state was\nGetting too much shortage on first day I was playing pretty conservatively on these ants not take a lot of chances and just to certainly Mississippi State would make mistakes like they had the year before and uh and and two seasons before when they played 'em so uh you know going into that game\nI really didn't do far was going to win because no one of the situation with the offensive line and ah\nAh you know the year before I wouldn't have been totally shocked involved in the last Mississippi State because this is a really different teeming little and they had the one the FCC was slashed\nWith mark Murphy he's up from a Auburn tiger magazine and getting set for Tennessee in Auburn coming up on a Saturday down on the planes are mark how much did the last the LSU loss how much storage for how much did it exposed\nYou know I think it took a lot of 'em\nI mean it was really disappointed because this team has the expectation that they weren't going to go back to the SEC championship game and\nAnd and the big thing was unfinished business and and whoever was from the east they wanted to win that game and uh [noise] uh you know I'm really curious to see how they come out respond on Saturday for real good question that they cause the term and how all the rest of the seasons are going to go because this was gold opportunity for Tennessee\nBecause they've got an extra weight to prepare for this game and the\nAuthor and it's just not confident on office right now uh you know they've been one to games with really good defense they've only had one really good authentic game against for the call the opponent that was the opener against Washington and they came out with a a a real aggressive passing game plan and\nAnd there's a good job and that game even though they wore\nSuper uh but they had over four hundred yards and it gets a good team but I just haven't been scary on off and it's like they have been from in recent years once once they got cranked up\nWell she'll be interesting on a Saturday interesting also that the Tennessee Ann Arbor and they have not played very often and so now there get back and I'm Mark we all remember the days when Auburn in Tennessee used to be the first SEC game out of the chute\nSay we got Tracy Rocker on our side now too [laughter] than I Do I prefer to have on your side of lawyer yeah getting off the bus why agreement ...\nUsed to be up for Robert hurricane yeah for all been in Tennessee because er and fans around here really look forward to it because not only was the first SEC gang normally there was often the first\nGame against a really strong opponent and a sort of gave everybody a clue a on how the seasons are going to go and I was certainly a you know exciting games a lot of very exciting games particularly in the in the sixties in the Nineteen eighties from all over his perspective\nYeah well that is good that they're playing again and I think both of these teams have some questions are going to answer on Saturday will sail plays out hey mark thanks for your time that I Know we'll see on Saturday\nSo glad to be I enjoy listening to your call games Bob a British yet or satellite radio is a wonderful thing when you're on

course ... sneak which is just south of those promises you had the provincial capital that was partially over run by the Taliban over the summer so yeah this is something that we are seeing\nContinuing or is there to the Taliban of kept the consistent pressure on the Afghan forces\nIn it you know in the area south and east of ... and it it should be very concerning to the Afghan government is happening on the government's doors staff\nAnd the Afghan military has been a holy incapable of stopping it\nAnd they rate into the center and then they melt away did they did they ponder it the way they've done before bill\nAbsolutely did the Taliban claimed that cat for what we're witnessing military equipment obviously home the uh\nI have no reason to doubt the mood often released video showing group is supposed to capture the guilt that district police chief this thing about is the one where and she's always lose August ... where the Taliban shot down a U.S a helicopter carrying a\nYour and killed Seventeen maybe skills and through and then the ... I Believe it was a another Fifteen fourteen or Fifteen Afghan and US military personnel so this has been a contested district where the Taliban in ... valley in this district where they openly\nUm or governing ah there you know patrolling the area and and this is all happening under the nose to the Afghan government\nDoes the Afghan national army have a response so we learn anything about how they you you may mentioned in past weeks that a down helicopter with a ... of with the corps has a ... a full fully visible in the video that there was no response even in daylight so is that the same thing here no response to the attack\nBut didn't know what what typically happens when the district centers over on the counter and often retreats from it and then they control the areas around it the government often send in their best for commandos and some army and it's often with us as\nThey come they chased the Taliban out out in typically you know trying to help before they rather than taking taking a fight to it\nSegment brought to you by scholar scholar a leading marketing technology company powers millions of digital times around the world leading the wave of retail transformation visit scholar dot com today to modernize your digital experience\nDon Johnson and build roads are here to report on the vast landscape and we go now to Africa to Somalia\nYou will recall a week passed bill reported\nThat the ... al Shabaab which is linked to the cup throats and al ... al Shabaab truck cat and Italian unit in Mogadishu and I look for the follow up to that I was a suicide bombing attack al Shabaab is say an indigenous\nUprising but it has transnational reach so therefore I was\nI was puzzled by the U.S strike ... an airstrike on the southern Somali coast in these last days and bill reports on a bill you keep a\nVery careful map of the U.S airstrikes in Somalia for this year this is the southern Somalia co south of Mogadishu what do we know about what was the point of it these look like Penn pranks on a map and I don't see the overall strategy for the U.S to participate\nYet for us strategy ... Somalis who support ... or ... or ... or ... ... army in their operations against the problem is that in Mali national aren't really any\nMore like a a clan militias clan\nUm they hit an area that was very close to where the smiley national army was trying to clear about what their defense ministry called the safe havens um is is an area out the twenty thirty miles north of the city because mile um which was run by Shabaab several years ago\nSo this was a you know a lot of\nThe interesting thing we're tracking strikes in Somalia and Yemen and Libya because like that they try to use military in these government tries to call them out of hers strikes\nWill either their military operations off in in uh sometimes they are are they are as individuals cells and their their networks but they're also ... military operations to fight these\nIn Turkey and you have to keep in mind that\nThese terrorist groups in the third group they're wanting to move back out tighter and their branches are affiliates or whatever you want to call them\nThe primary goal is to\nEstablish Emirates in in the furthering the goal of this global\nShow the insurgency a key part of the terrorism or not you know bombs suicide bombs gets western part is and it's I think that's just that ...\nGoing to see if I understand this bill so the U.S military and I'm presuming these are drone strikes not I'm not warplanes the U.S military is in the air wing of the African Union forces fighting in Somalia and\nUh the African Union forces are fighting indigenous uprisings nothing to do with transnational terrorism\n[noise] no no this is the first parties often but Shabaab he's both a\nYou know indigenous insurgency but he's also he's had his branch in Somalia so you know it's it's not one way or the other it's both Shabaab is you know local insurgent group that is an Islamic church group that pledge allegiance to al ... who has out titled eaters\nUm and it's you know in command and its\nLeaders and fighters brought the game experience\nSo al Shabaab is part of al ... network it is part of al tighter and but yes you're correct US military is often operating and supported the African Union holiday but army that's where she writes like\nThis but this particular strike was they like to call them ... that's not the case right right now it's sort of running up to your mom and dad a station trying to say we are not\nYes we appeal to Congress because you pay for this at least be articulate when we use drones knees are not counterterrorism strikes these are\nThese are police operations I think that was the polite way to talk about in the twentieth century Tom the Taliban is looking to an Afghan election or to say that the Taliban is going to disrupt it is an understatement a you also mentioned that the Islamic state is involved how so\nWell you know both the Taliban Islamic state of course uh you know denied the legitimacy of Afghanistan's elections and what the the key thing here is that the U.S government has been quite delusional about what they think the Taliban is willing to do with the Taliban leaders are willing to do [noise]\nYou know early this year the state department actually called on a tall bond to turn to turn over their bullets for ballot and to get out and vote and become part of the political process Afghanistan\nThis is completely inconsistent with every piece of public rhetoric you'll see come out of the tall blond there's no evidence that the Taliban is willing to lay down its bullets for balance I mean this is just mindless rhetoric really in any event this new I'm Calvin theme of the came out just today emphasize the fact that they ...\nSomething up on October twenty eighth I Believe the parliamentary elections they rejected by numerous grounds they they claim that the elections are basically just a sort of a ... at least on for the foreign forces meaning of the U.S\nThey will reject the legitimacy of the Afghan government and they claim that basically it's their religious duty to disrupt or prevent the elections from going off\nNow that Columbine I like the Islamic state is very careful in the statement anyway rhetorically to say that they're going to try and be careful not to kill Afghan civilians indiscriminately and they're going to try and target security forces that are in charge of preserving the elections are safeguarding the elections\nWhat's different about that now of course they will if they do strike out they will end up killing civilians but what's different about that at least in terms of their rhetoric is the Islamic state doesn't care Islamic state says we're going to go after if you're participating in the elections as your your civilian or otherwise\nThen you have the right to kill you and so the Islamic state has absolutely no compunction about going out and killing whoever is taking a party elections where's the top on because they're a little more sensitive toward\nSort of how they're they're perceived publicly and in terms of popular appeal the least want to put a little bit of a shrine on their sort of the violence\nBut the Taliban is against the elections just not correct um they're not they're not in no way in ... this ... at first\nThey couldn't be any clear that they are against the elections and here's the point John ... the whole us strategy in Afghanistan is about right now we we call it a strategy is about trying to get the Taliban laid out its arms and ... and recognize the legitimacy the Afghan government and participate in the political process it they couldn't tell us\nAnymore or any more often than they already are that they reject the Afghan government in the political process and it's against the sugary laws against the religious obligations\nAnd that they basically need to undermine the Afghan political process because all it is for them is basically just a sort of a a puppet of of the foreign invaders\nA bill I checked with you on your sources right now this Afghan national election it's a lining up to be a failure or at least considerably diminished considering how much\nIn the old days you remember when we used to make a big deal about an election Afghanistan now it looks like they're going to hold it in ... in a small club in capital and call it an election\nYeah that's absolutely right up in officials are saying that there are lot of places are not going to be open right\nThat these elections are largely going to be held in the in the major cities and the more constantly off those districts that most of the Afghans are not going to be a represented in this election and now that is a major failures in years at the U.S invasion that you know it's\nThe students in a situation is worse than a than at any point\nAnd that polling centers won't be open in Afghanistan to represent the will of the Afghan people that the Taliban are very clear that government is illegitimate that aid do you watch it legitimate and the election looks illegitimate when they can't open polling centers throughout the\nBill Roadshow and Tom Johnson senior fellow at the foundation for the defense of democracy they keep

property value and bitter curb appeal with a genuine the original overhead door we've been the leader for over Ninety years just look for the red ribbon logo here listen to what the experts have to say I'm\nI the reason I get to that is that China really wanted to have the head of Interpol to be a Chinese national Communist Party official and they were successful in that and for them to do this to take a among\nAnd disappear and indicates that they don't care about China's international standing anymore that what's really important for them is solving internal political disputes\nWe've seen this in the Maoist era you know siege and paying this one mile Arab powers he's also ended up with Mao era instability you can't have um what a siege and paying wants\nThis really I think is an indication that we are going to go back to the intense political struggles in the Nineteen fifties and Nineteen sixties this is really bad news because China right now looks to be unstable\nMike ... said in this meeting that he regret that there will not be an annual meeting between Chinese and us diplomats and military officials to do in mid October so not only in the middle of the mill stop Gordon and Secretary Mattis\nIt's in between diplomat sci fi follow this reporting\n[noise] yes well you know the Chinese are blaming us for the cancellation of the security dialogue but we canceled only because the Chinese said that their top the admiral would not be available um and so you know this is and also they pulled the admiral from meetings he had in the U.S [noise]\nSo really what the US was reacting to was China a centrally cutting off the milk Tamil discussions\nAs we pointed out before these milk Tamil dialogues benefit China much more than the u._s. so for Beijing to cut them off shows temper tantrum shows counterproductive diplomacy shows that people in Beijing are are not really thinking anymore they're just getting angry so this is not good\nAll right we'll check jobs the tension between ... and my palm pale we checked off the threats to Taiwan we checked off the threats to the freedom of navigation we checked off\nThe threats that you're not allowed to mention that a million we guards are being brutalized by the Chinese because they're the wrong religion or have a religion\nWe checked out the fact that will be no ... it's going to North Korea\nIf I understand correctly there's an upcoming visit\nA weekend visit to young young uh uh Mike Pompeo is in young young but there's an upcoming conversation between Pyongyang and Moscow and Beijing I think Ken is going to participate in that\nThe puzzle here gardening is with the deterioration between the U.S and China where does that lead moons utopian ism is is is Korea now collateral damage to Wang east temper tantrum\nWell you know it could be John you know a lot of people have said we've had centrally this ideology for for decades that you got to be nice to the Chinese and they will reciprocate\nWell you know President Trump explicitly tried that last year he said look I'm going to go easy on the Chinese on trade if they help on North Korea well they didn't help on North Korea they took that as a big green light to violate sanctions we've got to do something different and you know I'm not saying that pressure is going to absolutely work\nBut it can't do any worse than the cooperation path I think what President Trump needs to do is to start sanctioning Chinese banks\nReally imposing costs on Beijing for transferring ballistic missile and nuclear weapons technology to the north Koreans for violating sanctions for doing all the rest of it you know we have all these disagreements with China we've got to have it out with the Chinese because as disagreeable if that is\nYou know we've tried the other approach and its miserably failed this made the Chinese even worse than they were before and so you know we are the author of almost of Chinese aggression it's not like we're the aggressors but nonetheless we made it easy for the Chinese to be a embolden and to try to take down the international system\nMoon Jae in is the president of South Korea he has made it very clear he wants to reunite the peninsula a quote today and this story from Beijing a new order is being created on the Korean Peninsula\nGood is it is moving on yesterday's news or is he part of the problem does he work for Beijing or does he work for soul\nYou know he works for appearing young um if you read the rest of what Moon Jae in said when he spoke to a hundred and fifty thousand North Korea is in the stadium\nYou know essentially it was written by North Korean propaganda is um and so essentially we've got a South Korean president who I I don't know what's in his head John but what he's doing is sort of hurting his own freedom his own democracy his own society here in the nation he's supporting his own nation\nAnd so regardless of what he thinks a you know some people say he's a communist some people say worse I don't know but I Do know that he's dangerous um to what we're trying to do to disarm the north Koreans into stylish and continue peace and stability in the region mood is an obstacle to that we should treat them like that\nAdversary final question garden Fifteen seconds why did Kevin drive a Rolls Royce when he met by Mike Pompeo\nBecause he wanted to

fond of the national Review Online and Fox News and Thaddeus McCotter my colleague can cost up W J are the great voice of the great lakes veteran a recovering politician a veteran of the U.S Congress living through the highs and lows midterms\nAnd the twentieth century gentleman I turned to the cabinet matter not to re litigate but us lessons learned applied to the mid term the White House denied held a ceremony swearing in for justice Kavanaugh social justice Kevin ...\nThe president a remarks I Want to apologize to bread and the entire Kavanaugh family for the pain and suffering you been forced to endure use are under historic scrutiny where proven innocent said Mr Trump so lessons learned for the Democrats and the Republicans David is just back from Tennessee and I want to draw upon his\nInformation he did very ... for reporting of the voters in Tennessee where there's a tight Senate race David lessons learned from the Kavanaugh matter as you saw it from the distance of the middle of America lessons learned let's start for the Republicans when did they learn about these last three weeks from these last three weeks getting down\nTo John in looking in Senate races which are largely playing out in Republican states where the president in this ... what part of the lessons learned was that this was a good exercise for them it galvanized Republican vote and the Republican vote that isn't necessarily the biggest cheerleader of presents\nSort of awake in the interest in the mid term elections a lot of Republican that you know as as normal when you control everything there's less of a motivation to get out there and vote again with us just the way it is a angers more galvanized usually but this really angered a lot of Republicans\nAnd and so I think Democrats come out your worse for the where I mean this is what I saw in Tennessee\nIn talking to people and and observe a um you just had a lot of anger and and a lot of people were telling me or you know at least a few that they weren't still rather than they thought he was a good governor and who knows maybe they would have voted for uh maybe they wouldn't have voted at all\nBut that this for them or created a straight ticket for the Republican sort of election\nOn house races ... it could be a totally different story at the different Plainfield ... largely in an upscale suburb in all sorts of state including many swing state and blue states like California\nWhere you have districts that have been Republican for Congress for years but a more democratic for president in twenty sixteen and we see a number of Republicans under threat and I don't\nI don't think this help them all that much it may help\nSome Republican seats Republican leaning states that voted for Trump pretty strongly on the margins because you'll have the same sort of a fact within these these red state Senate races\nBut overall I think that this was a split decision for the parties but I Do think that Democrats overall would have been better off\nIf they never had this because they'd be still in good shape in the house and they'd be in better shape and the Senate so we'll just have to see what

CNN and the Washington Examiner who look at the midterms in four weeks time [noise]\nAsk the economy very good economy very very good economy in fact so good that even the Federal Reserve thinks it's a good economy and will continue for some quarter is heads in addition Russia gay big story two weeks ago\nLots of anxiety and now the president takes Rod Rosenstein on a ride for air force one so David back from Tennessee did you hear comments about the economy or comments about Russia gate as the voters considered the Senate race in Tennessee\nYes I Know a lot of Republicans that I talked to 'em want us to talk about the economy but Kavanaugh what the dominant issue Russia did not really come up and in fact it really hasn't been an issue over the past several weeks\nThis is another good reason why this cabin up there ended up to be a very good or for Republicans because all of the\nAll the things that rubs people the wrong way about Trump and and might get crushed with the Republican vote or off the table now I I still contend\nThat we've reached the point in the cycle where the economy is a much bigger story for Trump's twenty twenty re election I think it could win them a lot of votes a bat were reluctant Trump votes last time and might even when I'm a few more votes and it's sort of depends on who the Democrats put up\nA if you're caught him he was going to be\nYou know we might have assumed from from his ... perspective on it on the economy helping the incumbent party\nI think that would have already been the dominant story the fact that we're still talking about another extraneous story Cavanaugh a as the one that's motivating Republicans and and my level the playing field here tells you what you need to know about its place in this race but in the next race it could be a very big deal\nMitch us on the economy pocketbooks take home pay if it wasn't there we'd be talking about it it's there so we're not this is not merely a good economy this looks to be a break one\nAnd a great one that is the envy of the world the trade negotiations that are said to be a source of disruption or failure are not damaging the stock market\nIn addition to the fact that the Chinese are having trouble a lot of trouble and it's obvious are having trouble nothing to do with us So Jon is that a factor in the mid term or is it all going to be about Trump\nWell until now it was all about Trump\nBecause he was always in the news and the economy was viewed as okay that's fine what have you done for us lately and what are you going to do for us in the future I think if the Republicans run a more aggressive campaign and they can keep Trump quiet\nOr at least disciplined for the next four weeks what will happen is a Republican attack on what the Democratic House or a Democratic Senate would do to mess up the economy\nSo not so much taking credit for what is done but what threats exist raising taxes more regulation I'm basically a more spending\nImpeachment impeachment which is a distraction that people don't want because they want the Congress to go about the people's business not a partisan obsession\nWith Mr Mr McCotter you have a question quickly gentleman more we make the Democrats with impeachment are they going to use them as a hallmark has Mr ... seems to be saying or are they going to be more like the Democrats in the Senate butter saying let's not must not be so hasty about this David\nWell look I think what you're gonna hear from those Democrats as if they're going to use the the oversight power of the Congress and\nYou know what we know they will do is hall of everybody they can have testified before a house committee and somehow get them out there and the subpoenas oil and by the truckload at the White House from the Democratic

course Republicans don't need to create the fantasy anymore because they got Kavanaugh to to do that job and and the only question is does that last or ten days from now do we revert to what had been the meaning of this election cycle\nMr Bond [noise] well I agree with David the Democratic officials and consultants don't want to talk about impeachment but their base can't help itself and the message that is going getting through a lot of the grassroots is we have to impeach Trump and not just trumpet Kavanaugh and\nThat's what this election is about so the the the overall thirty thousand foot message is responsible and prudent as David says but the message a lot of activists who sending an individual districts are ah we're going to get them and we're going to impeach them and that's one of our signal issue\nDavid I saw a news item and saying that some group and the Democratic party was not going to spend money or ... pulling money back from the the the Democratic race in in Tennessee did you see that was that substantive or just a quick reaction well\nLook I mean it it's a major democratic group a part of me I got the one Democrat who speculated they might have done that it let's throw bread is a solid or because you know you can give them something to crow about I mean he he doesn't need any money so if they're going to make bread\nAs for Democrats are concerned but

ways with the music with bands and a\nLot of spectators are in many schools have a pretty phenomenal followings in terms of the game of football some would say that there is a\nSerious question about the future of the game it has prompted our guest a Bob cast viola too right\nFirst in forever making the case for the future of football the fact that you have felt the need to write the book alone must have given you some misgivings that you know you have you on the subject and come up twenty five years ago by making the case for the future of football they wouldn't even have been an issue\nThat's a very good question I what got me go and was that\nEverybody was taking shots at it and I felt that from my own experience my own experience as a as a player and as a coach administrator and from many I coached and recruited\nI felt that story I have to be told to say hey there should be a future again should go on\nI I just want to get back to something very quickly generate you mentioned earlier he talked about change dropping the sport or ... ... it's very interesting in ... in Pennsylvania just this year\nThere at three schools three towns because of the population changes that have decided they want to maintain the football program and they'd gone to eight man football instead of eleven\nWell you know people would say is that an indication that game is going out I said not at all as long as they're playing and they go on with the game\nWith preserving the game so you do whatever you can do that and the other thing is I noted\nThat this year but the kickoff us too has an Eighteen college football season has a record seven hundred and Seventy eight teams playing each weekend since two thousand and twelve\nThirty five teams have join that list and is school out here it's very interesting and again just to say there's other things happening that are positive that here and surprise Arizona is a new school\n... disease the name of it playing at the university plane as a building block to give extra curricular activity to the student based they've started the football program so there are some signs that people are finding a way to keep it alive\nIn the chapter six of your book first forever or a quoting or what you call that the coach of coaches a grant chief building some of the the positive aspects of the game here I'll just read the for that or that he mentioned a positive attitude and approach to life\nA total effort to anything I commit myself to self control of self discipline and caring for others\nUm those were pretty pretty solid point and then a very good points are carrying ...\nFor a ... it sometimes seems I think\nThat the people who watch the game who may not have any close association with other than just watching a a little screen in their living room but the caring for others would be the last thing may with a scribe to football but it is a\nHard nosed ah ah almost killed or be killed a winning is everything or maybe more along the the Vince Lombardi line of of of thinking and I'm Wondering your thoughts about this notion of caring in football isn't it very much a\nA hard nose game of of when it's not at all costs at at most cost\n[noise] yeah but I think it's come to the point where coaches have come around to becoming more than just guys on the on the field giving you an assignment to block this guy a tackle this guy a covered this band I think they've taken it beyond that to what they do with their lives with Hugh beyond your\nFootball experience because no greater example of caring then when you look at the chapter in here on Jack ...\nWho came in and took over a program at Marshall after they had disastrous crash that\nKilled the entire team coaches in parts of the administration of

to be good news for conservatives that the Brett Kavanaugh is on the court\nAlthough of course he is replacing a swing justice and I'm not sure which way Anthony Kennedy tended to swing on gun case\n[noise]\nWash the new season of the man\nVideo from a massive cactus falling on a home here dancing on a ... we covered it talked to farmers we know one thing or two because we've seen a thing or two we\nAre\nUnder it and I finally struck by insurance exchange Jennifer pranks on an airplane every state [noise]\n\nWalk back to the gym haven't showed one eight six six five oh Jim ... six six\nFive oh five or six to six our guest is Dave workman senior editor at the gun bag ... dot com and we're taking a look\nAt the things that are by possibly come before new Supreme Court justice Brett Kavanaugh including mainly gun issues in this particular instance in that scenario of course where there have been many many resounding battle that has occurred at the Supreme Court Charles calls in from Springfield, Missouri this evening hello Charles\nHow are you doing Mr Bannon I'm fine thank you [noise]\nI was listening and I you know you hit on a topic that's always been a kind of a hot button for me\nThat you know completely side with them but the\nYou know people get bored you know anytime than a conservative tries to get someone that really is on their side not some halfway you know a ...\nA you know the Democrats are an absolute sense but we the conservatives do nothing they they have constantly there the the party of appeasement and they need some on this got some fighting in just says no or we're going to fight for this\nCan we just haven't seen it I mean I look at the Democrats and how they treated cabinet that'd be despicable and either party however why don't we ever fight fight they put up\nYeah the ... not a good point I Would argue has to do address and I certainly agree with the Charles uh absolutely uh Dave in regard to the motion of the next time there's a a Democratic president if we put up by a liberal justice will start coming up with the stories about how they uh\nThey uh they litter or have overdue parking tickets or what have you I think that that is ... disgusting practice\nBut uh I was wondering I have Republicans thought hard enough regarding some of the more liberal a recent pigs say for example a bronco Obama's pick some of which I sailed a ride through I mean it seems to me Republicans tend to follow the the the victim\nIt's the president's choice of the nominee is qualified I can go with it whereas Democrats followed the victim I disagree with that person therefore anything and everything is fair game\nWell I I think if you look at it from the perspective of Republicans tried to follow the constitution a little bit more than the Democrats do at least in this issue and and the the or a collegial bunch of\nPeople which I'm not too sure that pays off anymore collegiate being collegial doesn't work too well when you were in a bar fight\nAnd that's what we just witness frankly you know I I remember back when I was in high school and we talked about all this stuff in American government and\nAnd you know I had some good teachers back then people who weren't really afraid to ah to speak out call a spade a spade and say look you know people do this but it's wrong it's not the government is supposed to work\nNowadays uh it it's almost like a a a\nPitched battle you know a food fight and what they tried to do to Britain cabin or the Democrats\nAre with this eleventh hour Hail Mary thing bringing up a um [noise] the the Ford accusations and and and frankly I have a lot of sympathy for I think she got thrown under the bus fare to the dogs the ... just in order to uh to try to derail Kavanaugh's nomination\nUh they were both ... and it would probably be who the the Republicans now especially if they retain control on Capitol Hill after November\nTo launch some investigations into just how did that become public or what we witnessed with a judge cab now justice Cabot all the was it just deplorable if not despicable\nAnd uh you know I wrote about this I've covered this thing for liberty park press and the gun bag and I'm going to continue to cover it\nBecause I think what happened there was wrong and certainly the polls seem to be indicating that to the public is just riled up this really has fired up the Republican base I think\nIt's bringing people out to vote who probably wouldn't have voted at the midterms but Jim they're angry and and they have some people that they're ...\nReally mad at me and I\nKinda think the Democrats are they might have bloom this\nWar well we'll see certainly both basis seemed to be quite fired up we'll see who does the turn a trick the best Sharon in grain Missouri yellow\n... fan um you know I Hope that justice Kavanaugh\nJust vote the constitution that but I Want to get to do I want to make a I don't want them to ah the actor best on the court I Want the pilot that kind of fish\nAnd some time that going to be happy with that although it may go against something that I think that parents dictation man I Will I Will abide by that and support it\nI hired this\nCork a making law than they are not supposed to do that that is Congress' job that I Want everybody to do their job Congress to do their job president their their guys and they did bishop branch to do their\nCamp for those in the judicial branch who do not do their job or I Would keep in mind one thing a share and I'll just notice to today as well you look at the constitution that information constitution\nOr the house is spelled out in the constitution the Senate\nThe presidency that the chief executive officers the cabinet heads and the like and then you come of course to the article three the or the judicial branch of that is is particularly interesting because it says the judicial power of the United states shall be vested in one Supreme Court\nAnd in such inferior records as the Congress may from time to time ordain and establish that is to say all of the appellate courts the district courts are creations of Congress Congress can simply repeal any of those courts anytime it so chooses Dave\n[laughter] yeah and I think we also know if you if you're still all really will judges are on the lower federal courts and and there's even been some mentioned I think ... in New York that\nThat is the liberal democratic congressman go\nAhead yeah and it it he's apparently already talking about a trained to I'm a recall or get rid of just his cabinet or you\nCan only do that by impeaching him convict\nI Know and and and just you know impeachment is just ... that came right out of left field but I think that shows just how extremist some of these people really are on the east side of the aisle and the country is looking at this and they don't like it\nThough I'm I'm sure they do that after this appeals to the base which increasingly has a as Democrats rather nervous\nOr after what happened to Joe Crowley the New York other New York congressman but again keep in mind as in the case of the presidency\nIf the Democrats get so much as a bare majority in the house yes I'm sure the articles of impeachment against the Donald Trump and possibly Kevin ... they'll never get sixty seven votes in the Senate to convict so it's not something that I'm going to lose any sleep over it will be it's going to\nBe the talk of the town from news ah Ninety four point was\nHow much time for a great dinner new not Ninety One point why and went to send

the Supreme Court\nNow than it has it's night the justice Brett Kavanaugh who officially shows up for work tomorrow today being a Columbus Day a federal holiday now this is what you know going back to the D.C versus Heller\nA decision and this is what a judge Kavanaugh had to say in the twenty eleven\nIn and I'm quoting here from a cabinet position and disapproving D.C.'s ban on handguns in approving a ban on machine guns and in approving longstanding regulations such as concealed carry a felon in possession laws\nHeller established that the scope of the second Amendment rights and busts the constitutionality of gun bans on regulation is determined by reference to text history and tradition\nUnquote Brett Kavanaugh as an appellate court judge seven years ago or your your thoughts about that as a as a a philosophy going forward Dave\n[noise] well I think that is one of the keys to white Dianne Feinstein and some colleagues were just going berserk or the idea of a cabinet or a sending to the Supreme Court ah I think he looks at the historic\nA way that firearms have really been a part of the American fabric uh you know we talked earlier about a\nA new law enforcement and and how uh the country didn't really have a law enforcement until the early Eighteen hundreds\nAnd I checked the Texas Rangers\nOr were formed Eighteen twenty three boys\nAnd often now All right um\nThe the idea that ah when the constitution was written\nA it was commonplace for people walk around in the village they they'd go to trade they do think they had a fire or with a and it might have been a a Flynn lock or or abrasive pistols or something but they had guns with them\nEverybody behaved themselves or at least most people behave themselves\nAnd uh I think he looks at the historic context of how firearms were were really part of the ... the American a fabric and and how we advance as a country he also said something in in that ruling into this little Evan\nThat because semi automatic pistols or protectors so also should be semi automatic rifles\nAnd you know that's in some of the Democrats into orbit\nThey'll try it out the term that they could define that their lives depend on what about assault rifles and now I can defining assault rifle for you right now and that is it's a it's black and sinister looking it may have a pistol grip that that's an assault rifle go ahead\nWell I yeah I think you just paint that because quite frankly the term is an invention by the the the gun prohibition lobby and you know they this dates back in twenty five thirty years\nWe've got to demonize these things and and really make people think that their machine guns and this was the strategy back then and when when Dianne Feinstein opened request shooting\nOf a judge Kavanaugh\nOr the first thing she turned to was good news and and the ... his ah a dissenting opinion which really was in two thousand eleven and what he said about semi automatic rifles and and then she said something that just is bizarre I called her on that\nSchool shootings that we've had over the years involving assault rifles that was just hogwash ... and I don't know where she gets the stuff but ah too many in the media especially the meaty inside the beltway or do they still want to call people out on this kind of thing they needed this rhetoric\nGets way overboard and\nIn many cases they don't have the knowledge to call her out on it\nWell yeah you're right they don't and\nHow many of them ever fired a gun I mean is there any\nWay too many of them agree with you and I I you

Dave Ramsey Andy in\nThis afternoon at one\n\nThat's what President Trump does he ... the reality shows\nAnd that's what he knows how to produce the problem though for Joe and people like yourself is it's successful\nSomehow articulated what a lot of people feel which is boy I guess everybody gang up too much on this guy it was unfair and I think it was a style of showing that Donald Trump\nAlmost with the help of the Democrats have been made or something that should have fled very strongly to the Democrats hands and it's something that is going to on ballots help Republicans especially running for the Senate because by painting it as a notion of mob people try to destroy this nice man\nUh somehow or another he changed the narrative\nSo uh so smart well ... in a very an extraordinary story and to do at the Benjamin Franklin you might know did was ask personally by Steve Jobs to do his biography will while he was still alive and to be as brutal as you want to be\nBut a ... day he's analyzing this is as a way in which he's not taking sides used to run CNN by the way so he's not taking sides you know where he stands he's probably outraged by dropping candy I recoiled but the notion of him being president I imagine but for him to say that it's just that's cold accurate analysis\nAccurate analysis and why the guy we spoke about\nRight under Donald Trump's hands whether what is often the way Michael Gerson writes about it that way understandably are passionate Democrats self had to show the same fashion that some Republicans have but they play then to the hands of those who thought this was a mom rural\nAnd that people want lifting the size and it was a shame that the Democrats in my opinion so overplay their hand because up until then whichever way the vote when it was going to help the Democrats now if the Democrats running in the mid term election\nI think the Democratic politicians in ... that really ought to\nGo into another line of work and not you know you can't win a mentor to get a different type of job\nBut let me just tell you the big story and the Democratic side is who's paying all these protesters one thing is to be outraged the other one is doing it as a job so you go there and you have a strategy of how to head off a senator you have a strategy about how to interrupt a dinner you have a strategy about how to get on camera and they're all getting paid\nThey're all getting paid and yeah it does take away the authenticity if you're protesting something I think you should be there I don't think it should be a profit oriented adventure deal\nI mean maybe for the travel agent if they want to build in some travelling incentives for hotel and buses but once you get the air you should be sacrificing something not earning something they'll get a regular job in protest during your free time you being paid for a point of view by other people who have a lot of money and they want you to go ahead and do the legwork\nUnbelievable but that's what we're seeing any of these a hundred percent right the guy that I Am so glad is lost the prestige in glow as Michael ...\nAnd his sweat Nick person who came forward and said\nYou know that a judge Kavanaugh then Brett Kavanaugh was out there might have been spiking the punch by never saw him might have been involved with groups expos never there might have been part of my sexual assault but I don't remember really those are the allegations Michael ... brought forward and almost everybody to a person said that\nHis allegations were so out of left field and an substantiated it ruined the entire cause\nIt made Ford seem less credible and Ramirez as you know the freshman at Yale could not remember originally what happened took care of herself a week Democrats crawling over campus trying to find somebody that saw something about something that Kavanaugh did\nAnd the New York times that I can write this the New Yorker Senate love to write this [noise]\nSo that's what he's talking about they have thoroughly overplay their hand them for the most part the prison at two events that you like to take back all of us in my mind should take back over the last twenty days besides that\nHe's been perfect he's been perfect and we'll see if it translates because we know that George Bush could not bring along anybody in his mid term elections and we know that you are Brock Obama had the worst mid term elections of any modern president gradually he lost his party almost everything\nAnd now this president says oh yeah I'm going out now they told I think it was July court\nAh will say no excuse me George Stephanopoulos so that you know when Bill Clinton won the presidency wanted to make sure to widen is Margie prevent a big losses in the mid term so we went out and they check the POWs after he started helping out congressmen and women and they went down and almost everywhere I appear to have stayed home\nThis is another thing different about President Trump the approval rating might be forty one percent but when he goes out the crates momentum excitement he gets big crowds and they're always ah they're always going crazy and then he creates new soundbites and other people run maybe Britain disdain because of things he said\nWell maybe it was a news were newsworthy because of who showed up\nSo this guy is different in every way and by the way he is taking on the number one enemy of America China in every way he's stopping them in South America\nYou had in preventing them from dominating the south China Sea by making land masses out of the ocean and China does not know what to make about because some of the protest it happened but behind closed doors are now happening in front of the camera and you saw last weekend [noise] hate to tell you but Democrats\nAre happy about this one eight six six for all eight seven six six nine Senate colonel Allen West\n\nWhere the upper Cumberland talks news talk Ninety four point one where the upper Cumberland streams taught high school playbook sixty minutes of exercising does sixty minutes of football high school\nToday so what's at stake I mean right now there's a seven point difference in the generic ballot or in between the Republicans and Democrats were not voting for people how do you feel about the party seven points is doable for the party in power doesn't mean it's an obtainable board asked what do you expect to happen in the next four weeks\nI think in the next four weeks there has to be a clear delineation about the\nPath that the United states of America is on right now when you look at all of our economic success and the path that an opposition party wants to take it towards and again just look at the images of people climbing on statues there at the Supreme Court banging on the walls\nIs this what we're really what do we really want to move away from the rule of law towards a rule of\nThe mob and that's that's really the the question we have to ask ourselves all you have people like Tom Perriello leadership for the Democratic party that are not denounce in this day are truly encouraging or of it that's not what we want to be an American\nI didn't think so so we're\nEconomist talked about what this whole cabinet or confirmation battle has done cut thirty to\nFall into this morning I think that the Republicans have filed its jar sorrows and Maxine Waters and Michael ... is not going there and the entire Democratic Party but they do have a child\nI think that in ran death threats or purple districts where the Republican days we're kind of indifferent fair motivated now so it makes a difference but today it's a lot of October knife who knows what's gonna happen between now and election day there can be more wild cards\nThere could be and you see that now all of a sudden CNN is reaching for some type of twenty sixteen issue Israelis might help Rick Gates with some type of negative or do it a negative ads against Ted Cruz in the primary\nSo you know they're going to reach the mother when Kavanaugh failed it's almost as if the darkest rated as it they have a a hundred stories in their quiver and they decide when to release the time or the time bomb\nWithout a doubt they have a strategic war room and you're right they'll look at it this in each and every way that they possibly can if this uh avenue of approach fails and we'd go to courses ... number see or plan B or plant F\nA and this is what we're up against we're up against people that are seeking to attain power and control at dominance in the United states of America is an ideological dominance instead of sitting back and say you know look\nThe more Americans of working at ever before our our stock markets are doing well for all the cage door our foreign policy look at what we just did was ready to go ... this trade trade deals are military is being a you know re strength and we're on a good path\nDo for them as about obtaining power and getting back control and and why do they want that control because\nThey want because this country on a different path\nSo a couple of things when you see Mike Pompeo in the foreign minister of China allow public ... what is colonel Allen West thing somebody was station nearby in Korea\nI think is very important that we let the Chinese know that we're not going to accept the status quo and and before we let them know that the fast of our intellectual property and the you know forcing a technology transfers\nOr it's not going to happen anymore and we're going to close the uh the the the circle around them we're gonna have better trade negotiations and deals with others\nAnd if they don't want to be a part of the civilized society if they want to continue down their path that they have chosen as a communist country or they're not going to be welcome and we're not going to couch without that this was no longer the Obama foreign policy of strategic patience\nRemember how President Obama left off\nHis last visit to China the American media was stuck into one small room away from the event and he has a part of the United states was forced to leave leave off the cargo entrance and enter a and enter the event ah I mean you know and into the event and then of course me the leader of China\nThat is humiliating I mean they would not open the door they would not line up the stairs so he had to go out to the emergency exit so this president said okay I'll get to know you will try it you're not moving you not budging you're still a problem so we'll battle it out everywhere I think it's so genius that we're going to India\nAnd it was saying how can we help you how can we work together\nWell absolutely so because one of the things is now the Chinese Pakistan economic corridor that they're trying to establish China is building a poor facility in Pakistan so I think that it is important that we go to other allies like you say if you just say that you know we're going to check you and we'll go to check make you\nMake a colonel congratulations your book drops tomorrow go pre order now hold Texas hold the nation victory or death talked about the history of taxes what it means to the ...\nIt

administration this came as a shock to them so I ... and and one thing that's been made very clear to me is that the tide lied about the hot chick still sounds pretty sketchy so\nI don't know that they've caught someone lined up um a reply so yet\nI just I got some great speculation which will do now you will not participate I Know uh I say center a lot she's been ... been marching around different people she's played a role in the party a big friend of McCain's ... you know she was in my\nMind push back to that would be um I don't think Trump is a huge fan can better um I think he has

she said he was state side so it's all just one thing is clear I don't know anybody in the ministry she more respected she'll be missed I don't know how she gets replaced\nWe'll see what it took to explore all eight seven six six now my son will cast which Giuliani venue now\nIt's going to be the target of a town for a movie I saw Ninety four point one\nRural crying yeah without having to get some headlines from the poll maintain their uh the president says the to Nikki Haley has done an incredible job a job\nThe president says that Haley told him six months ago that at the end of the year or two year period which would come up next month that she wanted to take some time off those are some initial headlines of coming out of the White House now so she said six months ago she was right it's like\nSo so Brian what's that in mind or you know everyone's gonna again be it'd be speculating to your point or what does he do for five years I mean students seem to become a political supernova things a superstar or she sings pushback against the president when she's had to ... more more\nCome out and does the president said he hopes that Nikki Haley will come back in a different role and says quote you can have your pick out her I thought\nMy thoughts to things Gary Cohn similar press conference but Gary Coleman was always felt this oh he was smarter than the president and then we know he was a source of Woodward's book if you read the book\nNikki Haley has never done that she's been or own person working for a president who who deal personified being single minded in this in my way of the highway she thrived in a way that I haven't seen anybody else thrive next him so I Do look for her to come back in a way this has been sprint\nEven though ... makes it look easy for going from South Carolina to New York is not a threat to the young family and a husband in the military\nSo I sense that she comes back takes a pause and then see who sticks around in this high octane highly demanding field you know a bolting Tom pail something international like that there's a lot of prominent positions that they could be coming loose in the next few weeks I'm sure she'll\nShe'll do a you know whatever works best for family will work for the president\nAnd Brian of course I'm a ... it\nIt seems we're restoring press finish this position which has really lost a lot of his first days for a long time\nSo you know we've all been speculating or outside of perhaps a Lieberman who would fill this role do you think ought to have to be someone was really good name recognition along resume someone that can hit the ground running but also have that sort of presents because seems relevant to this position\nYou'd like to think too uh I don't get into the gender roles on this but it to she was the most prominent woman I think outside of ... or the president\nHave another woman and there will be great and I think Kelly Ayotte has been in it around the circles or Republicans she lost a heartbreak her for her Senate seat so she's been around is courting around these judicial nominees\nAnd I'm just thinking that she might be someone brought in I don't think it's that big a deal and she made some comments about the president and the tone in ten or twenty sixteen the president's gotten over a lot of that including with Marco Rubio and Rand Paul\nSo she's she's very talented I Know internationally ... Lindsey Graham and Joe Lieberman thinks the world of her ... John McCain she did a lot of that work and go into battlefields in two years after Lieberman left so that might make sense\nI don't know if she'd be willing to do it but clearly she wants to run for the Senate again didn't work why wouldn't she accepted position like this again\nTo enter your point even making Haley had some early issues where President Trump and even in this role as the ambassador to the EU and she was never afraid to speak your mind or the push back\nAgainst the White House machine thought maybe there was a difference a ... so so all of this in mind a and considering how how tense or we are in a certain relationships particularly with the with ...\nEven our allies on certain things there's a this is really going to be critical isn't an Bryant\nI think so either the secretary of state overwhelms the position or works with the position now she was their first upon pale and they did they respect each other but that's why you got to pick the right person to go in there the seat that he or she has to have the respect of Bolton\nAnd the secretary defense as well as the secretary of state therefore if they do have that the seat doesn't shrink\nThe sheet didn't shrink within bastard her Haley a crew but there are a lot of ... nations I have to think twice and we do this every day who are they\nI mean Susan Rice was there she was invisible Samantha Power was on masking people more than she was actually stick me up for America internationally if you ask me and then you have Nikki Haley came in there and every space statement she made every policy she trumpeted seemed to make headlines because this president is a disruptor he's a ... balance or\nAnd it's not going to be easy having this position unless you believe what he believes what about governor Mike Huckabee in that spot if you talk about uh the synthesis of thought that would make sense\nYou know what I mean you get a lot of great things out there\nAre some really helping your show Charles and they were throwing books [laughter] even though the president's press conference ... right now we're we're finished the when you\n... ... but unfortunately they brought out of time and you were fantastic Brian thank you very much great stuff you see Mali nice to Charles [laughter] and I said I if I ever meter [laughter] more lively dollars coming out of the thinking Haley saying\nAll right one eight six six eight seven six six and I've got some calls to make who just able to go on at the end and do some wild speculation I I Know chosen reading something I didn't want to look down on camera Alison could you read to me with this early read out or are you getting the pool reports\nNot getting the poorer parts of what I see here is Trump apparently said something along the lines that she told me six months to do that maybe at the end of the year she wanted to take a break he was governor this is perhaps even more intense the style or problems together and North Korea is moving along ... thinks the roads Nikki Haley as soon as they get the tape andme overload pack\nUm but yeah that's what I'm saying so far\nWell All right when we come back I I Want to be able to bring it to you so maybe if I take a break now we'll have a long enough to do it also get aboard one eight six six for all eight seven six six nine it ends the best way possible but with Nikki Haley steps aside that's a big loss for the Trump Administration your thoughts next Brian kill me ...\nPolitics [noise] current events and news set up a ... hue Brian's got a lot more to say with Brian kill made [noise]\n\nHave you ever looked at your credit card statement have been shocked by the interest rate did you know you can actually roll all of your credit card debt into one monthly payment at a lower fixed interest rate like three mile bridge credit card consolidation loan from five point eight nine percent a PR with auto pay lower than average credit card interest rate of over Eighteen percent a PR\nGet a loan from five thousand to a hundred thousand dollars and you can even get your fund as soon as the day you apply well ice cream plant a tree by the way with every loan they fund I feel great recommending to my friends and my family because it's life's dream my listeners can also get a special discount on top of ice creams already low rates\nThe only way to get the discount is go to light stream dot com slash kill made\nThat L.

the embassy or we haven't seen the peace plan that the Trump or people have been working on I think it's clear that\nThey're trying to line up a lot of Arab support before they present it to the

constant media coverage\nPresident Trump is accomplishing many many things that you can it it's almost like pieces of a puzzle fitting together you can see these things taking shape it takes longer it doesn't always go smoothly and sometimes the noise obscures the picture that is developing\nBut you see with these trade deals or you know I was talking to somebody the other day or something like

sitting back through most of it\nI really gain an advantage you remember the number one story in America was about Paul Manafort cutting a deal and about Rick Gates testifying against him and now we you know Papadopoulos or get to sentence influence coming up in December and everything looks so grim\nAnd now that's a lifetime ago because now everybody's talking about cabinet\nAnd Brian you notice the ... the news cycle move so quickly so fast\nThis president's accomplishing so many things people can't keep up the fight with Brett Kavanaugh lasted two to three weeks and what we're going to know and two to three weeks from now is that people say boy that seemed like forever ago but what this fight has done I mean this is unified the Republican Party from the establishment wing\nTo the to the outskirts and everywhere in between that they're unified because now they see the playbook of the Democrats what the Democrats are talking about\nIs not only if they take over the house will they impeach the president of the United states or attempt to they will trying to teach justice Kavanaugh now this is what's on their agenda and the Republicans are waking up to ... election for weeks from today realizing exactly what is at stake I think\nThere were a bit complacent there were so happy with a three point seven percent unemployment rate and the economy doing so well in our national security homeland security all doing better than it's ever done and so they were complacent and now they see it as a reminder of what these what the Democrats want to do which is not just impeach\nDonald Trump and remove him from office but now they're talking about potentially impeaching justice Kavanaugh for nothing and this is now motivated the Republicans and we've got four weeks ago early voting starts a very very soon and there are some key bats\nFinding people the success tonight he'll be in Iowa\nOkay I Want you to hear how this whole thing played out ... and he used to run CNN a big town biographer of Steve Jobs Benjamin Franklin major projects this is how he sees this thing how the president played a cut sixteen\n[noise] that's when President Trump does or he turns to cap rallies in terms of the reality shows and that's what he knows how to do [noise] ah the problem though for Joe and people like\nYourself is is successful fears somehow articulated what a lot of people feel which is boy I guess everybody gang up too much on this guy it was unfair and I think it was a time and sharing that Donald Trump\n... with the help the Democrats have made a made something that should have played very strongly and Democrats hands and it's something that is going to on balance help Republicans especially running for the Senate because by painting it as a notion of mobs of people who try to destroy this nice man\nUh somehow or another he changed the narrative\n[noise] and I think that some students houses and I probably ... to say that\n... you write what this president did is he allowed the Democrats to overplay their hand you've seen the footage many times though on Fox News banging on the doors of the Supreme Court to sit in the hundreds of people\nAt a time being arrested at the Capitol the screaming during the confirmation process look Republicans don't do that whether you want it you know can't get on the court or you want and whoever it was you didn't see that with the conservative they let the process play out the Democrats\nAttacked demand ... his reputation went after his family this is a man who in his spare time unbeknownst to anybody else for the last dozen years\nGoes down and feed the homeless services the poor he doesn't do that so he thought someday could get them onto the bank she did it because at the character that he is and no one wants to talk about that and everything that they threw at him he returned fire and I mean that in a positive sense when he made a very impassioned\nStatement his opening remark on a second confirmation process at at that second hearing but what was most stunning to me of everything that judge Kavanaugh said\nWas that his ten year old daughter\nSaid dad we need to pray for this woman who said these things and we need to make sure that we're praying for her that that type of value that he has distilled on his children and that talks about the character of the man and I think the turning point in his confirmation process\nIs when Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina said you know what I mean this is not right and he made such\nA moving argument between him and senator Collins and ultimately Mitch McConnell lose three individuals helped to change the public opinion of what Brett Kavanaugh did and the fight that Donald Trump put behind him because I Believe Brian\nNot any other president if it wasn't Donald Trump would have stood behind that nominee in the way that he did and far from the way he did and Donald Trump has proven to be successful because of it\nUsually the president said to judge Kavanaugh his daughters cuts six\nMargaret analyze your father is a great man he's a man of decency character kindness encourage\nWho is devoted his life to serving his fellow citizens and now from the bench of our nation's highest court your father will defend the eternal rights and freedoms of all Americans\nThat you right back at the kids you must have heard some of the negativity the horrible allegation from Michael I've been out of you know there's and I thought that was a great part of the speech\nHe'll run I I've seen this in my own life where I was\nChildren are old enough to watch the news and go on the Internet and see what happens I remember then candidate Trump and ultimately President Trump calling my kids and you're saying your dad as doing great work and that goes so far you know and and saying nice things about me and it wasn't just me he's done it so many times to other people because he\nKnows that the media attacks individuals who are associated with Trump in a different manner than if they weren't and we've seen the double standard time and time again and we've seen it with\nMedia reporters who say one thing if they're liberals and get away with it and if they're conservative they are chastised till the end of the earth we saw just this week with a CNN reporter\nWho use some discussing language on Twitter and all of

you introduce yourself Hi what's your name well this is Rob\nHi Rob it's great to have you here on the car coward show and Robbie you want to talk about how I always trash for oh three B plans\nThat strike Clark and at first I just want to say I'm I'm completely guinea talking to you I've been listening to you for decades and uh\nHave followed your advice and also myself been interested in personal finance and investments for you know since I was a teenager a lot like you so [noise] well right\nYes so forestry bees or as you've talked about there for non profits and they do have a bad rap or in some of them are still pretty lousy but my wife and I worked in a number of organizations with for three days that have been excellent\nAnd I work in health care and she works for a think tank and we've never had anything but fantastic for three days with\nSome of your favorite companies and very low expense ratio does um so I just wanted to make sure that you were aware that not all for freebies are bad\nAsking about their plans making sure they they look under the hood at what they really got\nWell that is a great thing you said 'cause you know when I talk in such stark terms about four or thirty ...\nI'm trying to really shake people up and get them to do something they don't even know they can do and that is find out what they're paying for the for the ... the problem in the fourth ruby industry is so often even if somebody has\nA fines offered to them from a low cost or find house they may still be paying very high charges for administration to an insurance company that manages the four three be there at and so\nThat's ... go ahead a threat I I think especially um teachers have\nTraditionally been exposed to a pretty lousy plans through their school districts and and whatever\nThey've worked out um but\nYeah and isn't it the ... teachers get beaten up every possible way not physically but I mean\nYou know the teachers have trouble getting enough respect they have trouble getting enough pay for the hard work they do and then on top of it that generally school districts lack the capability in house\nTo pick good for three B plans and so they just can't say oh why don't you handle that whoever you are you go handle that or it's handled by a teacher's union that also lacks\nThe expertise to pick these plans and the teachers ended up getting socked with the expenses that are so high that often a teacher will end up with less money at the end of the year and they started with at the beginning because the fees are so dry norm us\nThat's in the last ... financial term by the way John enormous not really\nSeeing teacher plans with three percent ... expense ratio is and as an example my plan and my wife's plan has expense ratio is a total expenses down around point ... point ... percent so\nAnd that's fantastic so where you and your wife are is in the range of what a good for three four one K. would be also\nWell thanks clerked for everything you do appreciate it\nAnd I and keep saving that money ... save the better off you're going to be and we're speaking now with tied tied welcome to the Clark Howard show\nType clerk it's a nice to talk to you thank you for taking my call\nCertainly Todd how can I be of service\nYeah all my life I have an emergency fund I'm just at a local bank and but it's not it's just a regular checking account and it's not getting any kind of like return on it\nUm and so really I was just kind of wondering if you had any advice to may be moving at a local credit union maybe in our area that I've seen maybe two or three percent for a checking account um just won the kind of get your thoughts on that\nSo that the two percent checking accounts usually two or three or ten years ago there were five percent checking accounts the way those work is you and your wife would have to do so many debit card transactions than a month\nAnd clear them as credit card transactions you know how the debit card you'll use it somewhere or any car and they'll say debit or credit\nAnd with a debit card you can cheat\nCard and then the merchant has to pay much higher fees than they would if it clears as a debit card\nSo when a credit union or a bank is offering higher interest rates on checking accounts were those accounts usually they're limited to paying the interest on our balance up to like twenty or twenty five thousand dollars\nAnd you're required to do usually I think it's like a twelve to twenty depending on the bank or credit union debit card transactions a month cleared as credit and that's where the money comes from to pay you the interest is from what they earn on those merchant fees\nOkay so you would most likely will kind of keep it where it's at now and just click land or I'm\nNo time for an answer all the um you can link your existing account to one of the online banks that are paying now lots of them are paying around two percent even some a little more than two percent on simple savings\nAnd the money can be moved on two days' notice you know emergency usually two days will be quick enough you can move back to your regular bank\n\nAnd then you earn and two percent that's going to go higher over the next six months\nAnd that is just simply linking the out to an online bank or is it moving it\nThat's exactly right what you do is you open an account with an online bank and you will link it to your existing bank or credit union account\nAnd then the money can be moved back and forth pretty easily and I'm looking right now there's a website that has a pretty good list of the online banks I'm looking at a bank re dot com and the highest rates available today or to point two five percent\nOn simple savings\nAnd so that's that's where things are headed by the end of the year we may have the highest rates people are offering around two point five or so per se\nReally simple to just link your account and no you're going to get a better deal so give it a try you're listening to the Clark Howard show\n[noise] word from Clark Howard now four point one [laughter]\nI'm Jay foreigners CEO of Quicken Loans America's premier home purchase lender

are you today on Susan you want to talk about your family members what's going on with them\nWell I have a couple of family members that have high chairs and one of them got till the time share trauma and could no longer use and why time share that fake ... fall\nOr name and it's got the limit and I know there's a lot of emails people get I'm trying to sell and there's the Web site and I think some of those are not on the up enough so I'm just getting their idea of what to do with the timeshare\nRight so let me just lay it straight out to you Susan I'm your relative is pretty much stuck with those weeks\n\nTime shares are are virtually completely unsustainable\nAnd even at a time share that was sold by a well known and recognize brand like some of the hotel chains were in that business for a while he even in those cases the value of a time share that you purchase declines by a almost a hundred percent the second is purchased\nSo any of the any of the offers that they receive saying oh we're going to help you sell your time share we've got a buyer then if I were in the salad for X number of dollars all we need from you is to pay us this listing fee or this money or whatever\nThey're all bogus they're all scams\nAnd what I recommend it in the past and it still is holes as true right now is your relatives need to use their weeks and get some value out of them\nWell these are our points I guess all that weight\nDo they have trouble redeeming their points or they don't try\nNow they they are using the one that the case that that that they why they don't really have any need for it they had it transferred from there and\nWhich means they are they are the nicest people to do that because they took a burden from there but they're stuck with something they can't now and burden themselves from\nFor generally if you want somebody to take over a timeshare week not only be paid for that week but then you have to turn around and pay them usually in the thousands of dollars to take it over time share weeks or points have a negative value\nBecause you're entering into an obligation that goes on and on and on and on and you have no control what the fees are going to be for that obligation\n\nFlying during our show that was the commercial for a a Web site\nOh well let me tell you it's funny I'm so glad you mentioned that because we just talked about this on the show recently is that I don't even know who's advertising on the show or our website\nAh also an ad that appears in it the way ads are placed I don't even know who's doing that or you know where the ads are coming for who I Know where they come from but I don't know who's running ads and it could even be a local ... not one of my show ads\nSo I don't know that that there's no method that I Know of where you can actually make money\nSelling a timeshare weaker selling timeshare points because it is a a it's a defective market you know it's something for every thousand sellers there's not even a buyer so what I Would say is they need to find a use for that second we\nAnd start using it or even give it to other relatives to use the weeks as long as they'll pay the annual fees for it and one other idea that has worked for some people say I'll repeat it\nIs that if you go stay at your time share week while you're there there are other people who love time shares I made a lot of that place and they may be\nSign it over to them you're not going to make any money but you'll end the obligation for the week and that's usually the best you can hope for with a time share I've also mentioned fake Keisha\nV.

IRA which is kind of like a bulletin board for people trying to buy and ah well they don't really buy 'em they get time shares and people trying to unload time shares and you could check that out Michael is with us on the Clark Howard show hello Michael\n...

S.\nAnd I've heard that the batteries on the earlier ones like mine are very unreliable and have deteriorated quite rapidly but other people with newer leaves have not reported that problem at all\nBut if you do follow my suggestion turning the leaf you have when you go to buy another one you know there's that dial to the right hand side of where you charge relief that will show you how much the leaf battery has deteriorated and if it's still at a hundred percent strain\nYou will be fined buying that as a use leaf but it's had a significant loss in the capacity of the battery if it's really deteriorated don't buy that one Robert's with us on the Clark Howard show Hi how are you\nUm find Clark how are you\nGreat thank you you have a question for me about arbitration\n[noise] yeah you know I I listen to your show a lot and I know that you talked about arbitration in a doctor's office or when you signed paperwork and stuff but\nI'm looking to get a new roof on my house and I'm getting a couple of bit from one of the bits I got the contract that the contractor sent me has binding arbitration in it and ah I think you always\nKind of talk down about that\nAnd I do talk down arbitration because when they impose it on you they probably picked the forum for arbitration\nIt's such a rotten system is that if you agree to their arbitration and they picked the arbitrator the arbitrator only makes money if they keep getting the business\nWell so arbitrators have an unholy alliance with the businesses that select the arbitration panels because if they don't fine for the business they don't get work anymore\nOkay that's why we're the arbitration generally the company picking the arbitrator where when just a hair under a hundred percent of the time no matter what the facts are the situation\nOkay and then ... I only got one bit so far it I'm waiting for some more to come in but can I expect almost every contract to have our binding arbitration and number\nI don't know if they use a standard contracted is from their trade association right they may have is standard language and then you always have the right to scratch through that and put your initials by it\nAnd then they would have to decide either to say well then we're not going to do business with the EU or agree that you're not subject to binding arbitration\nCBS News on the hour sponsored by ... works relief I'm Jim ...

by a reporter and courting occur and of course any advice for how do we wind on the trust when the government comes on the show you aren't given millions of dollars on the team but nor do I want to hold it over him until he was like thirty five year\nGood good balance or like that I agree with both ... much and so your wind down by releasing some of it at different times\nUm we had our set up a before our kids you know became adults are trying to serve the same situation so\nWe put it together we both get hit by a bus with millions of dollars in a trust to be good used only for their good uh we did not leave the money to their guardian we left it into a trust which is the proper thing to do the trust is formed only at your death\nWe put in that trust exactly how the money was to be invested the four types of mutual funds for instance that I\nRecommend we put in that trust that the income off of the investments can be used for their care and feeding of the kids and the use of the guardian that there will beyond that if they needed money out of that trust to be for a major medical thing possibly a little bit on a first car and\nWhen you graduate from college we would release a percentage and then we'd releasing another percentage at twenty five and another ... percent at twenty seven I think we did a maybe a third or dirt I don't remember but we let them kind of roll it out a little bit like you say I don't want to hold it too long but also don't want an Eighteen year old to hit the lottery\nAnd I think that what we're thinking about doing too so\nYeah so you lay all of that that way and um you know we put hours and nobody gets it until after college age uh and so you might as well go to college\n[laughter]\n... yeah they are just trying to kind of trying to direct a

four thousand forty two hundred\nOkay and you said the house payment is how much again\nOr and heritage ... that are asking you how should handle that and he told me how to go slow and I take my time and be patient with it and that was very helpful but now I'm having a another problem whereas\nI'm so basically since then I bought a house remodel the air being be making a lot of money about fifty thousand dollars a month on gross I'm about yeah about Fifteen thousand dollars a month and I'm just blowing through that crazy sex addiction\nUm I'm standing just insane amounts of money that ten thousand dollars a month on prostitutes and strip clubs and um karaoke all the above and I don't know what to do have tried everything I go to sex addicts anonymous\nUm and I I I I Want to know what you would do in that situation I have done well I spent about how that money on buying a house and I'm ... now and I'm dealing with that I'm a kind of not since then\nIt's been a long project I finished but I don't know what to do about this how it should handle it ... ... anything else I even tried I [laughter]\nHow old are you having twenty ... ... and um\nThe inheritance came from who passed away\nMy dad passed away about two years ago and um\nHe was missing plane and I might be coming into a lot more money 'cause I found that child a wrongful death situation is um ... it it's a long story about your mom my mom she's out of the picture that divorce that go talk to her um she yeah she to enter the picture\nI ... as you know job and I'm not a therapist I'm not a a trained councilor um I have worked with addicts for Thirty years ago one hundred percent of the addicts ended up broke\nIf the if they don't feel their addiction and so you are going to destroy\nYour legacy your dad's legacy with the money that was left to you and you're going to destroy all your future dreams that this money represents if we don't if you don't get the help and he'd the help and\nSite to win against the addiction um sex addictions and pornography addictions are the fastest growing addictions in America that\nWe see that in our offices with financial trouble um people in your situation more than any other addiction we see we still see cocaine we still see\nAnd we don't treat for that but we ended up helping them with their finances we still see alcohol\nUh but gambling and sex are both just ... the the pornography is a is a is gone crazy because of the Internet access and um\nAh it's affecting every part of our lives in a good ways and bad ways with the access in this case is causing\nExcess and gets people in real trouble with gambling and porn sex addictions um\nSo you're you you know you named off a couple of the right things and that's getting an essay getting in a um a an anonymous group I'm getting in a with a therapist is the second thing I Would do um the third thing I Would do\nIs um [noise] it it sounds to me like just a guy talking to a young guy an old guy talking to a young guy that all of your family structure has gone it's just you didn't have it with your mom and then your dad died and so ... years\nThere is a twenty year old young guy there's nobody in your life kind of standing over your shoulder is going to dump you when you grew up your life\nThat I Do have some family on my dad's side I'm actually a good way but\nThey know what's going on now so I Know\nThey were I had a problem that's going on like over a year ago like aside from that just a and I I never and whenever I tried it goes then they kind of they were like a cheesy oh you're just being picked on this and I never had a track again okay with them so I just kind of put off the leash and\nYou know K. everyone's okay but it's fun so that there are no help is what you're saying yeah OK\nOr no help but they they they're they're good but I just I don't know how\nWell I Know that all behaviors obviously have a psychology involved um as a person of faith as a Christian I also believe behaviors or spiritual and show to treat or something like this only as a psychological thing is usually a half treatment\nTo treated only like it's a spiritual thing might very well be a half treatment but um there there is something that you're obviously searching for and there's something that you're missing 'em that's causing you too I'm literally go crazy in this part of your life right\n[noise] yeah I I I think like I'm just beyond lonely I don't know if it's that um but um [noise] I I don't know honestly\nI think that's probably right that doesn't sound wrong [laughter] I can I can resonate with that I can imagine you being there in that situation and it's amazing you can be in one of the largest cities in the world and be lonely\nYou know but you can be it's very very real um the ... the last component I Would add to it um\nAnd you're asking me so you always get my opinion when you're asking me and that I'm an expert on my opinion [laughter] so ah what I Would tell you do is find a great church and will help you do that and and sit down and get\nPast store all counseling to go with your other counseling get with some young guys in that church and become friends with some people who have some character have some integrity and that are walking a straight line not perfect there isn't any perfect people over there\nAre at that church ... got churches got people and um so you can find that out pretty quick but you will find a better\nSynagogue how no you're Jewish okay cool that's more effective than let's get one of the rabbi dude let's get the spiritual element of this going because there's a there's an aspect of that\nGoes with this and if that's your heritage and that's your your your faith and wonderful on by caused the town that has a lot to say about the issues that you're dealing with um a lot\nAnd um\nSo yeah I that's the only thing I Know how to tell you though because I Can't just yell at you stop it or you would have already stopped it I mean you're smart guy you've already realize this is ruining your life\nAnd um you know that I Know that um but the nature of an addiction is and you're finding this from a twelve steps is that one of the thing is you realize you're powerless\nAnd you know God has to step in and I've got to put some structures in my life and I've got a you know figure out uh do do some careful psych self analysis and say well loneliness is the issue so how do I fix loneliness well obviously I'm fixing it inappropriately\nAnd so how do I fix it was more wisdom and that will be hanging out with good people um that are lifting you up\nI'm obviously not hanging out with paid friends which doesn't work for anybody whatever version of pay to friends you have and yours is one of the more gross so um\nMake sure I really lean into getting a group of people around me that I can trust and if there's\nA group of people that um are are working on a social project that is worthy and you got to get with a bunch of young men doing that and you had some good guys around you um then that's very important I've got a group of guys I get with once a month those were the last night as a matter of fact I'm fifty eight\nUm that group of guys got all our son's together that are in their twenties or the other day and we all encouraged them and they all agreed\nThat they need a group of guys do any of my friends the the man's bill calls a band of brothers and your life\nA talk with you and the situations so I'm a man I'm just a guy I don't know how to help you um I'll pray\nFor you to tell you that and hold on I'll have to pick up we're going to send you a copy of Mansfield but he's got a lot to say about this kind of stuff and then look man Mansfield manly men or whatever it's called and said

but ah how how how good to use to see this team doing\nA most dominant team in college football to me at them and everybody else I Would say at least at this point are entering week seven of the football season is the best team next saving his had I don't think any of his other national championship teams would beat this team\nI think the biggest differences the playing quarterback to a ton of a violent or they just look so much more explosive in lethal throwing the football than they ever have and certainly they've got weapons scattered all across the field\nOr I don't know if there's ever been a quarterback as efficient as to what has been this year it gets thrown twenty five and completion Eighteen touchdowns no interceptions I mean you you can't make that kind of stuff up and certainly Alabama hasn't really been tested yet this year old ... and everyone's got\nLSU circled on November third but we know we knew this coming into the year the schedule is going to set up this way for Alabama law to key games being played at home but right now to me isn't the best team next saving his hat I think that's a big reason why he's getting angry at the students section a and not

you're still complaining that he won the contest\nNot a chance not a chance I just ... I mean he used a cinnamon rolls like seeing which is just way too many flavors going I get outta here with that is from Canada's yeah and I was\nTalking about some of the the bigger bigger there were the biggest game or the weekend the Georgia going to LSU what do you see a being the keys to victory for\nYeah I think it's interesting I had Georgia this week I'm really impressed with from development throwing the ball down field I was one that said he hadn't seen a ton of it yet um\nI think it's a ... and I'm going to end today when I say this 'cause I Do believe George is going to win this football game but I don't think it's a great match up for Georgia which surprised watching Georgia envy Andy 'cause I don't think babies up to ... very good I don't think that teach very good in general but\nThey were getting movement up front and I think the biggest piece albeit you lose you know ... guys like that from the linebacker a court I think the biggest myth is Jay Jay Atkins inside they don't have a dominant nose or they don't have it\nAnd the controlling double team to keep guys off their linebacker so time and time again is ... you get to the second level now door to a lot better than being such they scored that's what you see but I Do think else who's going to have some success run the football but if I'm Georgia I make them one dimensional because Paul\nIt took a while but are LSU fans finally coming around to my side that Joel borough is just a game manager and that's it because I said it alone are not happy about it when when everybody was coming at me\nYou know what I Love job or on what he does at the line of scrimmage I think he's as good as they've had a deposition pre snap\nControlling the ... and a long time but there are limitations when they need to win the football game throwing\nI don't think he's the guy for it and nine times out of ten to Shawn Davis picks out ball off at the end of the Auburn LSU game and it's a whole different story as well so that's going to be the story to me I think Georgia tries to make LSU one dimensional because they've struggled with their front for being stiff against the run I think they lowered the box\nUm guard on the outside and they got some good corners on the outside as well I think they make a tough one job or [noise] well\nThat's a big game or another game as tendencies or after a by week heading to Auburn a team that the couldn't be any more down their foreign to that looks good but ah they've got a lot left like the number two that like the number one and two teams in the country remaining\nWhat is going on with Auburn I mean I it's it's frustrating to watch from a guy that I Know jerks did um are really like him I think he's really talented\nThere's a lot of problems with Auburn I mean I saw some graphic today I was ... as I was on the plane that he's got the lowest percentage of throws pass the stakes in the SEC they throw the ball short because they don't have any semblance\nOf it's not even they don't have the talent or the personnel to push the ball down field they have no semblance of how to design plays in my opinion to get their guy\nProblem there because you know triple engine came in and now you hear their squabbling and guess what happens\nIs the only here but the problem is Gus miles on handing over and often are changing the identity of an object what is this three games in a row they haven't rush for over a hundred yards\nThis is not the Auburn of old and at some point you gotta realize hey what we've been doing what we've had success in the past doesn't work we need to change and who is the most talented guy on this football ... on the football team on the opposite side of the football a chair extend them\nAnd he's performing really poorly\nIn a store that his own hand yes but some of that is when I watch film the play design there's two options on the outside they don't push the middle of the field they don't push the ball down field and more importantly when they go for why they try to throw the ball when they tried to run the ball there's a tight in in the game\nSo every time I flip on the film defenses when there's a tight in in the game or gender Cox full back cut in whatever you want to call it puts them guys in the box it's hard to run the football against seven guys in the box with three linebackers and like okay well we need to pass the ball\nLet's let's bring on our for wide receivers and and it's just their plane into the coverage or into the hands of the defense and it doesn't work if I'm gonna smells on I'd say you know what the hell was my pride\nChip Lindsey do what you need to do get together with the urge to them and say what our five to ten past concept that you feel really good with cars to them is not comfortable he's not confident right now he's seen ghost out there as we use a quarterback binoculars if he's just not seeing what he's supposed to uh get together with him and said let's let's\nThrow a bomb on what we've done so far we got to do something different 'cause obviously it's not working that's what I Do and that's what I see when I watch film it's just a mess\nDuring Rogers rivers a couple of about ... about twenty minutes ago the Danny shared into the SEC Network\nSet right where you are sitting in predicted Vanderbilt over for random Zimmerman are ah are all all encompassing a notes X ray and the right that's advantage coming off of big when you've seen this movie before Florida usually limps in there after the Georgia game this year the schedule is different any possibility\nSee that well obviously\nHey Paul how you doing today oh no that right now or\nThe take my medicine or not talked last week I got ahead of myself and I was concerned about Florida and sure enough it it came to a ... and\nI felt a couple of key players or early that when they start off with that opening Dr mental really really pumped and then a\nForward or three it out they got the ball back he had the bowling twenty eight year old alone and in the big ... came up a protection broke down and just thinking that if they don't want to fourteen attend nothing there\nThat might have made a little bit of difference and then right before the first half\nEven one of the announcers Gary Daniel from I Believe he mentioned that uh when they run for chick that field go to ... go turn seven he looked like for the niche as they possibly could a review that didn't go to a review I'm thinking of fate of school there\nAnd one of fourteen of seven and a little more time off the clock but I was really disappointed the defense also I'm I'm Still a big ... fan but I got a question for your call\nAnd I and I wouldn't want to get your answer on those are the ones in the past years especially the last few years of less miles it didn't happen to last year with with soldier on but if she'd like to me the psyche of LA issue is when they get into a big game and they lose it\nIt's hard for them to bounce back I remember in years past and give Alabama it's like after that did that last Alabama\nDidn't have any sparking them left you know they just went through the motions in a couple of years there that that happened my question to you is is that from what you've seen do you think that that uh I guess the time will tell this weekend but\nOther teams can get up Alabama to get up after law when you do when they lost LSU ... six and twenty a loving it came right back won every game got into the championship game and beat LSU but she doesn't seem to have a real issue like that do you see that number one and uh if there's something about ...\n... I think that's always difficult I Will say coming home this weekend I Believe is an advantage for LSU and bouncing back because it is it's easier to play at home I think when when you've lost on the road ah so\nI don't think you can look at history I Know odds makers do but I don't uh it should try to gauge where there's team is I mean the LSU competed in that game it was we came down to the last\nSeries are too so it wasn't um it was a devastating loss but but I but I don't think it's the end of the world I think this team has overcome a lot now the season is going to start to be determined by what happens now though\nIt doesn't matter what the narrative was in in in August so you lose this game you start to wonder whether you can beat Alabama I Know a lot of people don't think that's possible but you know win over Georgia and home would give a lot of energy to that thought with and then there's texture saying them later in the seasons so you go from\nThoughts of being a top ten team and next thing you know you're eight and four and that's what that's really what's at stake right now for this team and the question I have is\nYou know Ken as always Ron able to settle everyone down and bring them back\nHere you know it'll last week Paul we we we were joking and I told you about the the pep talk I Want it to the give tell her she would have kind of a selfish on my part I guess what what I Would have lost that game against Florida said man I said I was just hoping that they could just get to the Alabama game on their feet and it would make a little more drama\nThey might make it an an a nighttime here and that's my thing\nToo that one way or the you know or that game is going to be at nighttime it hasn't been announced but it will be that the Alabama game yeah I mean that's right yeah and I just wanted to date or the prime time\nYou know what I noticed that they had that none of the Georgia game will be in the afternoon but ah I can just you know so many fond memories of up all night games in Baton Rouge especially the last few other things\nYou know I I I ... I\nBelieve this game if it's a I Believe that this game was at seven thirty uh I like LSU more ah this six thirty in the afternoon is not a good time for you to play and tiger stadium\nYou you know you know I looked at the the records I talk to you know what I'm I'm sixty three I go back to up to my first LSU game as much until you're several times\nAnd in Nineteen sixty two however I looked up and I've seen where the only three I Believe\nThree SEC teams that LSU has losing rockets to over the years that Florida Tennessee in Alabama all the other SEC school they're winning percentages over and I can remember fondly a lot of those are both trying to figure all remember and I'm sure if you're going to ... feet or the game in their mid sixties where else on\nI think LSU a ton of feet tied fruit at three\nIn tiger stadium or unless you had a a\nA a defensive tackle by the name of Tommy fuel cell and he put a hit on the on a I think it was a body Douglas I Believe the head of Florida had a call I mean I tend to feel a quarter\nOf ... he was the quarterback yeah\nYeah so I mean I tell you what I got up I Will not St Paul before you go I Want to to just a dimension to the audience to his ...\nAnd my dad had a little small Italian grocery in wars and you might remember the disc jockey this was back in the sixties I can remember as a kid every Friday afternoon for the last hour of his talk show this is like in the instance we'll talk show there was a a disc jockey by the name of Keith rush\nHe was on the radio in New Orleans and there'll be a and B and a big issue fan and the last hour official\nEvery Friday during football season he played all the college fight song of every major ... I ... I remember I don't uh college fight for Lisa good in my bed at night and I'd say my point a finger on a college fights on my my parents would have to\nTo to to to ... to shut up but like I got a lot of fond memories of that and as I mentioned or if he if LSU could pull it all on Saturday against Georgia\nAnd I think it was ... you know the the the atmosphere the Alabama game more intense if they can be you know be be missile restate the next week also\nHad to ride around the ... don't forget about Mississippi State are going to be a tough game this'll be saying is playing a little better after that big when thank you for the uh the the call Jeff is in South bend hello Jeff good afternoon\nHey Paul good really good show thank you very much really enjoyed ... they don't seem to be fantastic I agree\nHey look I Wonder why\nThey're almost no oh miss fans call it about this road trip to lower our cars are are you a control on your ... going to knock them off and turn their season\nAround I mean you know I Know they've got like a turn a completely around but they're going to get on a winning where they winning rule [noise]\nYou know I'm I'm Glad you brought that up because that's not a game that um we've even discussed yet it and it's a big opportunity for for both thriller for almost a get a road when in for Arkansas to get it when\nKids to get a win where they've they've got a really good recruiting going and so I think they've got the right guy in place to stay to get a couple of victories\nWell said uh we'll see what I Will say about that game that that's a a you know you you have to you have to start somewhere and I think Arkansas if you look at Arkansas a couple of weeks ago it looked\nLike it was desperate but they played well against a and M. and uh they had some good moments against Alabama even in a big law so uh there's a reason there's there are there are reasons to be a mildly optimistic Scott and laughing yet good afternoon\n[noise] pay Mr Paul think however much for taking my call thank you very much\nYeah I had a question of moving a little bit of a way I did appreciate those comments and I respect the FCC\nThe end of the earth because I'm In Michigan fan so I Am calling to ask you about ah what's your feelings on we're coming up on a big stretch with Wisconsin Penn State Michigan State and Ohio State so the truth will be told about this particular team but have always had for years now\nAnd do you think he's on the hot seat during this war game stretch between October and uh the big one against Ohio State\nBut I Believe the administration is firmly behind him the the reason he could get in trouble though if suddenly\nLost his start to pile up and fans\nBecome disgruntled more than they are ah after the Notre Dame game you heard it but now it's settled down a little bit the northwestern when helped a little yeah calm calm the waters because he was a ... game but\nAnd it wasn't a bad when against Maryland a\nEh you drop this game a Penn State Ohio State those are the games are going to be judged by\nAnd Michigan State too so I mean to until the end and\nCertainly a momentum get shifted and you know I don't think he would be fired but if if if fans start to make a lot of noise or it's going to create issues and uh I've always felt losing four straight to Ohio State no matter how good Ohio State is is not acceptable at Michigan\nYou know [laughter] no but I tell you this is going to be one of those games that tiger stadiums mythology if\nYou will is it's kind of built on it you know it has a great reputation but most of the time it's like any other stadium but this game I think it LSU fans are going to really be there because Georgia's number two and because they hadn't played Georgia's so long and usually the only big home games or Florida\nAlabama and you know they don't they haven't eaten Alabama's so long as I think they liked the fact that this is a highly ranked team and it's not Alabama\nI realized it didn't happen but had it happened had I Do as you've gotten by Florida or what would this it's ... it's going to be big but uh how much bigger would that have been with two top four or five top five teams [noise]\nWell you know it it it will have been one of the biggest and he was ever a the the biggest one was one a bell issue verse three old men is back in uh in fifty eight years never match that so that this would have probably been\nThe game day would be here uh I think they were planning on coming if\nIf I Believe that I Believe they were uh they were registered that local hotels\n[laughter] and then they have those tickets the Georgia fans will [laughter] and the end of hotel\nRooms but no I you know it it definitely took a little of the uh the shine off the game but it's it's still a huge game um for LSU because they can they can definitely mostly a race to last last week that they can beat the number two two of the nation\nYeah I think you would have probably taken a split going into that that stretch but let me get your read and I realize this question maybe better after the game then right now but it sounds like people are are holding on pretty well you you have number two coming in but if this thing game doesn't go well and I know that's a speculative question\nSchedule doesn't really get much easier with Mississippi State and then bam a in a and M. O. or what would your guess be on the\nOn the mindset of LA shoe nation\n[noise] well I I think if they you know they play well and and lose a close game I I don't take care of by that we would be upset I mean Alex ... fans are quick to point out how difficult or a schedule is\nLSU fans didn't go into this season thinking they work on the line one or two games I think everybody kinda got caught up in the moment with this five and START I was kind of guilty of that too and and some things were exposed and thus far to gain that we should just seen already like all of a sense of wine is not\nAs not so great but you know if they lose to Georgia or you know\nThey're looking at a three or four last season\nThat's what that's really what was expected going in so I don't think the fan base won't be on the bridge again\nA lot of conversation about ... ah we had a Jordan Rogers in here a minute ago saying that he he really does believe he's a he's a gay manager others or take a different view or in perspective uh what's your view\n[noise] well I think he's a good game attitude but he he's born again ... ...\nCame manager that's that's kind of a nice way of saying the guy's not really that good but he does in many states Joe ... had a a heck of a game or against all this I mean that's a bad defense but nobody know LSU quarterbacks ever on in past as well at the same game\nAs boroughs data that game he almost had a hundred yards Russia is three hundred yards passing he's he's a playmate or just you know he's about seven to ... and\nIn passing yards as efficiency numbers on break but he's a leader he avoids sacks and he's played behind a line that gives up a lot of facts five sacks last week a hurry but he's still he's still a horny sacks it gets thrown around I mean he's probably not an NFL quarterback\nBut he's one of the better quarterbacks el issues handle all the time and he he can win a game I mean he won the ... brigade and uh you know he did not win this game through a key interceptions he had some drops he's a he's capable of doing some very good things\nThey're all just predictions Glen and we take them with a grain of salt but we we do care where do you think because you know most of that program where do you think Saturday\nDon't think she's going to win I predicted issue to win this game\nIn August you know when I picked him to go eight and four and because Georgia's not used to come in here George has the week next week but they have Florida after that it might it's scheduled game\nFor a for LSU and I think it's going to be one of those rare times when the stadium really is a weapon for sure it will be a close game I think they're going to play better they loo proved throughout the season ... step back last week but I think you get a sale issue when on a tall trace you feel\nYou go about protecting victory you will be able to get that\nOh you're right I'm I'm bus in Dallas and Georgia fan so I wasn't planning on going to the game

we're just chatting here by the way about ten minutes from now it'll be a doctor gene allowed and she's got a book out which really does have some Greek some key question is a lot of us have after the month we just went through it's called ... politics keeping your sanity in a world gone crazy\nAll right so I Will have her bottom of the er make sure you stick around\nAnother question I'll throw out there it's sort of a hodgepodge of stuff that we're putting together today because it's sort of all revolves around the same thing could carry I got to tell you I Am in a hurry to get away from the cabinet stuff I'm In a hurry to get away from the constant left versus right yeah unfortunately because of the day and age in which we live\nI don't believe we're going to be able to um nothing left in the mid term yeah\nYou think dying down a little bit afterwards I Hope so I I wanted to\nBut the reason why we're here is because the left has been so disgusting and how it is attacked anybody who disagrees with them it's very strange\nBecause that's not I I thought who we were but they are constantly doing it then it constantly makes people who are on the other side like me want to react but let me ask another question though just throw up there\nI Would especially like to hear from Democrats are liberals and we can\nHas Michael ... hurt or help because\n\nMike Lebanon and the reason why I say that because people are now retweeted meet somebody that he said I'm and I guess he's attacking Donald Trump junior now or something but with every tweet he makes every appearance I see him on his show on likable\nThe likeability factor for this guy is so low\nBut he keeps being asked to back because I guess he's interesting TV to the left at least but it keeps them showing back up on television and I think with every appearance his nurses system shores and it really does he does start to believe his own BS security of an opinion as he helped to hurt\nWell I think if you talk with a lot of the Democrats are saying he's definitely heard their cars and that Democrats saying that\nI agree and by the way he was the savior for a while but lately um right now right because of the the allegations he brought from sweat Nick\nThat were so ridiculous in so extremely hard to believe um I think that that he went from ... died on the left side of the aisle let me go to the phone lines are people that are about ... do they want to talk about a lot of again we're just from a lot of stuff out there today\nBecause I Do want to move on past us I Want to have some fun\nOn the radio and TV against somebody we haven't really been able to do for a while we might not be able to until after the November sixth ... as soon as they are on I think it's a sex look at a till we get past that we probably won't be able to let me go to a line to Carlo is in Minnesota Carlo what's up\nHey Joe going limited dream and what's happened is it\nWell you know I'm kind of concerned about guys down there that are getting the echo chamber there in Minnesota and what's wrong with you and go to you got a great guy running around but just in case um I got I got a recipe or a baseball\nAnd that's growing corn yeah and we can convert that into and the good clean energy how they in energy and at this\nLevel with the delta between a a rising all price had just provides a balance where we're no longer held hostage to uh all shepherds internationally where we used to send just billions hundreds of billions of dollars a out of this country into the hands of Middle Eastern people who didn't much like the United states\nWhy someone would like to help subsidize farmers up before I Want to build any more golden palaces in Saudi Arabia and without a doubt but but I'm confused because at my gas station or Sunday there was a sign that says ... five I even have I was ... ... five\nBut in this article that I'm reading and you and I talked about this a bit beforehand were talking about ... Fifteen ... which which that\nIs similar the two sides of this thing going there you know what we're talking about is mixing Fifteen Percent ethanol which is made from corn right in the process and then the blending that with petroleum fuel you either got eighty five percent gasoline or Fifteen Percent ethanol so it's really the uh both sides of the same coin\nOkay and and we find that ethanol is a double fuel like like you're the gas where he put it you've bought it burns cleaner that's why we liked it and again it helps farmers\nLess greenhouse gas emissions more energy independence for us to a U.S of the nation of America and a less or more consumer choice so it's all it's all good news for America and this will be beneficial for corn\nGrowers are egg market use the secretary\nIf they are pressing the flesh of these farmers every day\nYou're meeting on ... up with these men and women these raids families for generations have been doing this what is their outlook because I Know that when the terrorists in the trade issue started being talked about and it's and again you and I think already knew that the president was using it as leverage to get a better deal\nBut there was an interim time where it looked like farmers were going to suffer and their outlook immediately was hold on a second what are you guys doing here what is their outlook now what are you hearing from them\nWell amazingly though Joe farmers have been very supportive of the president understanding he's trying to get them a better long term deal\nThey know that China is not played fair and they've not been reciprocal in their trade policy\nAnd they know the president's willing to stand up for them that's why they meant amazingly resilient and supportive of the president there surely it's brought up around some economic thing for them and maybe some prices that terrorists have hurt but are they understand\nThat the president I think the president's validated in this trade with this latest Mexico Canada deal you know\nAnd then the chorus deal with South Korea talking with Japan they you they I think they got confidence in whole and that's what farmers always trade onus hope and optimism for the next crop and the next better price so I think there with the president they understand and I think he's validated his trading philosophy with this new deal\nI think a lot of Americans like be found it very interesting how fast the ... you said yes let's make a deal we found it interesting how fast the Mexico said yeah let's renegotiate NAFTA Canada held out a little bit but they're also coming around\nAre you surprised by how quickly the leverage of the possibility of terrorists is working and how quickly these other countries are going All right you're right we've taken advantage of you for a long time which make it more balanced\nI don't know that can say I fully understood that until the present demonstrated you know there was also that you and I think again when he threatens\nAuto tariffs on ... in Germany and France and others as well as Canada and they understand that they've been taking advantage of our huge a fluid and sewer market here and certainly by U.S companies taking a jobs and plants and Mexico and then shipping them back over here they're free\nYou know the president said no more so this is the kind of thing and he is recognized I probably was not an early recognize or that I wanted to sell as much egg products as we could rise but also like most farmers\nUnderstand that he's in it for the long term gain and they're going to be better off in the long term he's\nThe secretary of our department of agriculture here in the United states of America Sonny Perdue or as you know I've got stations across the land and we're on television too but Fifteen of my stations are in Texas and I'm based in Texas\nIn Texas there were these heated races for house and Senate wearing of both sides you're talking about our trade specially agriculture between Mexico and Texas and Mexico and the United states of America\nHow how involved are you in the trade negotiations with Mexico when it comes to agriculture between Texas New Mexico in Arizona and California and our friend to the south\nWould you do you know that are us trade ambassador Rob Bob light has or has the legal authority to negotiate\nThe specific legal deal right USDA supports him and the things the agriculturally that on the table so we had the portfolio of agriculture\nAnd we have people from us did it right at the table with a U.S they are\nHelping them to identify a where our lines of ah of agreement disagreement are so we work very closely together\nAnd bashful light hazard in touch with us on a routine and regular basis when we do in these negotiations so he fought hard for the dairy access as you mentioned in Canada right and it's a big supporter of agriculture\nBut what's interesting is the people that are running on the left Democrats that are running for either the house with the Senate\nThis is hurting our ability to trade with Mexico he's hurting our our farmers use hurting our agriculture how would you respond about\nWell I I Want to ask them to read the paper from the last two weeks about the new you know how to stay\nIn Mexican and Canadian ...\nIt's the U. S. M. C. A. and tell me what is not better than the original NAFTA agreement it's better all around and for those people you know when you're running for office in particularly in the minority party\nYou know you can just say anything it doesn't have to be true and you can\n... and just see it any people is is will be to see but the truth is this deal validates the presents a strategy of knew better deals and certainly the U. S. M. C. A. as a better deal and we had a NAFTA\nIt is a Sonny Perdue the secretary of agriculture from United States of America are great secretary of agriculture one last question in\nThe ... when the farm bill is talked about we save the farm bill ... what does what does that mean to the regular American but is it on a on a tractor on a farm I mean is that something that we can look for prices will go up will go down our agricultural go to more people around the world which will benefit our deficit what is the farm bill means to me\nWill the farm bill is a bill that has the policies of the safety net that has farm programs and they're much more than that has conservation\nMeasures and it has the Supplemental Nutrition program known as they stand right for many\nPeople that's where most of the farm bill money goes is that the people that don't have enough food and that's why the disagreement or putting people back to work and helping them to get out of a a life cycle of poverty is very critical this president into a and the Congress\nAnd the farm bill can actually be less expensive well Americans actually do better\nThat's right that's the goal is to help people that are in a time of unemployment three point seven percent or more jobs out there than people looking for jobs that we really don't have a lot of excuses about what we should allow people to stay on food stamps and definitely if their jobs going lacking out there\nHe's the secretary of the USDA Sonny Perdue sunny thanks a million always appreciate it\nKilled thank you always going to talk with you back\nAfter this and the Joe ... show stand writer\n[noise]\nThe gym Todd [noise]\n\n\nConversation continues with Joe ... bags from news talk Ninety four point one news talk Ninety four one dot com\nThere is nobody on the planet like use so why would you buy a generic mattress built for everyone else he'll sleep built this lead quiz that takes two minutes to complete and they use the answers to match your body type and sleep references to the perfect mattress\nWhether you're aside sleeper hot sleeper like a plush or from bed which he looks there is no more gassing or confusion just go to sleep dot com slash packs\nTakes her two minutes sleep quiz they're going to match into a mattress that will give you the best sleep over your life you'll excuse even split the mattress down the middle providing individuals support needs and feel preferences for each side they have a ten year warranty\nAnd you get to try it out for a hundred nights risk free right now he looks is offering up to a hundred and twenty five dollars off all mattress orders get up to a hundred and twenty five dollars off at ... dot com slash bags that ceiling sleep dot com slash P.
