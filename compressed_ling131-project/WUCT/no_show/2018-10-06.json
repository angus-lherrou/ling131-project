legitimacy now comes a as as judge Kavanaugh or whoever fill the seat a\nTakes the bench and the court continues its work\nThe court has always wielded immense power in our country and it's often been

around the court\nOr a hundred and fifty memorial at almost two hundred years ago Alexis de Tocqueville and his famous study of democracy in America he reflected on the political power the judges

George Mason university law school the school just unveiled a nine foot tall bronze statue of the late Justice Scalia and an event attended by five Supreme Court justices including not\nJust

that we've seen even in recent history like Justice Scalia\nAnd reflect on how they went about their work and reflect about how they tried to keep the court at a distance from politics and hope\nThe

future of the Texas Public policy foundation what lessons do you think we should have learned will get down to whether or not we have a minute but but out of this debacle but we've gone through what lessons do you think we should have learned\nI think the lesson that we are learning now is the importance of standing or ground I mean with with this president ah you know you have in back in a way that may be and pass administrations would have been polled\nAnd I think the new gold the strategy of the left had never thought that the Republicans would hold their ground and actually stay in sperm behind the nominee\nOr the pressure would be so great that ah he would have been withdraw the or she would have with Charles himself and so in the face of these vicious\nOn them and as\nA stellar reputation as head of the Mason career as a a jurors to judge the lesson here is that uh we conservative stood there grilled\nPendant right outcome was achieved and that needs to be a lesson moving forward to have courage and the convictions that uh our leadership and DC are dared represented\nIn reality can you foresee a time in let's say the next five or ten years when a a a major nominee like the Supreme Court nominee will be able to receive more than four or five votes from the other party\n\nHope we'll get there I I Do I think we'll get there quicker than that\nThen my my prediction is that actually the next Supreme Court justice will will get that kind of back to bipartisan consideration that used to be traditional with the Supreme Court and I'll tell you why\nIs I think with judge Kavanaugh's confirmation to justice this takes in the last forty years of the Supreme Court being a toss up when it came to super judicial activism\nAnd that with this justice being ... not that\nYou know the other side is always going to win but what's going to prevail this law the law and the constitution and I think with that recognition you will see\nA less and hopefully end or the last attempt to hit the homerun cases to create brand new rights to brand do\nAh protections that that were never intended by by our constitution and so\nWith the next justice than with is already established as the new status quo the return to the respect for the rule of law or that there won't be so much at stake that you won't have hundreds of people getting arrested the capital over the nominee\nA high stakes game anymore\nFor the judiciary for the highest court in the land and so maybe we can get back to considering the merits of candidates based on there and here it to the law of respect for the constitution the qualifications of their record and we won't have these cases that make\nYou know every single nominee a life or death five\nHardest and fight for the the ... right\nI Would hope that you're correct I I don't know if I'm terribly optimistic but one thing the whole notion of the judiciary as essentially governments umpire calling balls and strikes that's constitutional that's not a constitutional\nThere are an awful lot of people out there and unfortunately who don't really care how you get where you're going to the end justifies the means I don't care where it's in the constitution it was only written by a bunch of dead old white guys and they all own slaves and the vet center and so on\nA they don't care about that sort of thing they care only about getting their way and that means as I said earlier a lifetime tenured unelected legislators that's fine with them were not in many cases talking about very principled individuals' here\nWell that's right and that say a symptom or a sickness that it's come from the federal government that's way out of control and this guy or way beyond a government of limited enumerated powers that was one dish and by the founding fathers and\nYou know one thing and the overall theme that this administration has that in the ministry ration that it's been looking at cutting regulation and decrease in size empower the government being thought\nInch by inch every step along the way a but here I think in the way the judiciary is being transformed its ... men and women in place that have that commitment and are rejecting this idea that you\nKnow every court case needs to be a policy victory how about we just have a court case that is correct all the law and that's what we expected they borrowed\nWell I'm certainly with you ah of course if that were to happen we would probably need to do a certain extent to be teaching young people\nTo feel that way and and that's another area that I wanted to get into with the Rob had Mickey and that is the extent to which we have taught\nYoung people to not only be have been in the the vicious and the self centered Neal mattered way that we have seen but there's also to to recognize that free speech is important the ... the your feelings if they get hurt by when somebody else says well grow up to develop a thicker skin\nA though there

I think the challenge for those on the last two than opposing judge Kavanaugh is that track record over Twenty years in public service target and towards any serious getting out of stuff to share that as I said he has been widely acclaimed even by people who are his ideological opponents had\nSomething that takes a law and the constitution very seriously and so that they put more questions that we look for and this is anything but a rush to judgment but I think what you're trying to find ways to attack yes Kavanaugh on his jurisprudence on his approach to the law and the constitution I think the Democrats are simply come up and say\nYeah about those questions over Thirteen hundred and eighty seven written questions he responded to that is more than all Supreme Court nominees in the

God\nAnd um what's been brought up is that when the you know when the Democrats take the house they're going to investigate it they're going to ask for all it has paperwork 'cause they only got ten percent of it they're going to look into this and start pooling thing because\nI think there is now maybe maybe it won't maybe these people are just ... or whatever but um you can teach\nU.S Supreme

didn't have a lot of chance to really do proper research but I saw the light at ... I did I looked at the Washington Post article about it\nAnd and is it is one of those where he has been asked about these documents that came into the Bush White House that were apparently documents for senator lady who was a Democrat from Vermont and\nWas it was both shepherd through a judicial nominees and they were looking at somebody\nAnd some guy brought him all these documents and everybody says he should have known\nThat these were stolen documents and he has said consistently under all of his background investigations I did not know they were stolen I did not know that they were anything other than documents that were a lane out or something of regarding this nominee\nSo he's claiming cuts or I didn't know\nHow do you yeah and they how do you prove anti tax pledge that he knew\nThey had the tax they have attacked this is what they're saying that they would tell us the attacks that says\nGot something to ... and ... he's a good and if that's true that's a big deal now I don't know that we don't know that because we didn't get to pay for failing on the side of the state\nBut you bring up a shares all you got three hundred and one opinions my God the only way I mean there was no there there's over a million ... million pages of documents let me ask you something how long does it take you to read a two hundred page book\nHow are they going to go through a million documents I understand that will be their complaint from now until the attorney but you bring up a are more interesting question to me which is are they going to be once the Democrats if they take control of the house will they go back\nAnd examine everything that happened in the past ... ministry and when when you change the White House at\nThat you get this all the time about we're going to go back and we're going to investigate Bill Clinton we're going to go back we're going to investigate George W.

senators they're not happy with it because they weren't given all the paperwork and I don't know what the Republican\nUs of about ... that's got out but Janet you know that they only you know that's a

I'll go at least a mile between my stance\nIn one I'm fishing for ticket always small mouth bass when I when I catch one and I'm bringing him to the boat and clear water a lot of times there's two or three more trailing along behind him coming in where they ... that he's got in his mouth\nYou shoot a coyote or a bobcat or Fox or whatever [noise]\nDo you get out of there and go find another spot or is it worth hanging around a little while\nActually has an excellent question um [noise] I I actually stay there um\nHave a a photograph of a we have ten predators that we shot it was for coyotes and six Fox and\nWe only went to a five stands so if we only been five stands on one shot ten predator show you we were able to call in multiple predators per stand when I won't either my partner I shoot I usually go to a distress sound or a top distress of a coyote and then we sit down and we get to sign up for five minutes and then we continue to call\nAnd just because you shoot one you know the hunt is not over here to stay there you keep calling you will be surprise you can call to even three in on one sand and\nYou know I see that a lot of the people who do the high fives after they shoot they go you know after five minutes a calling and that's fine\nBut you've probably given up or educated some of the other ... that were coming in to the to the calls to sit tight sit quiet for a little bit and then continue to call and you'll be surprised how many other writers you will be um he will actually call in and out of success on\nWe're going to get into some of your calling in because she's a little bit later on because you really smart about that and have a lot share with an audience over calling can be a problem and I don't want to talk about over calling us on a set up or how long have you called I Want to talk about a piece of property\nOr if you heard that place a one night how long will you wait before you go back\nI usually wait at least you know um it would depend on the weather obviously but about at least three weeks to four weeks before I'll hit that same spot again and if I did hit the same spot I Try to do it at a different time of the night so if I was at seven PM or ATM\nYou know this month I might wait next month and headed to three in the morning also try to set up on a little different areas of property now the wind is going to dictate where we set up but you know if possible we'll try up on a different area and we've been very successful with that I mean I can tell you all one location\nTheir season so we were there three different times over a period of about three and a half months and we scored every time and multiple top predators each time\nI have always set up with my nose pointing directly into the when I talk to you about that and I've been doing this wrong not necessarily wrong but not the best way maybe you'd like to heart across when\nWell yeah I mean you know you're never\nGoing to have the wind perfect for you on every single set so you have to improvise I mean I like the wind in my face a possible because then I'm when I'm parking my vehicle I'm walking into the wind so I'm not nothing is smelling me going in but you know you're not always going to have that I like cross when I'm just as much as I I like to hunt a window is directly in my face\nBecause you know a predator generally speaking it's not all the time sometimes they'll just break all the rules and just come rushing right in but most of the time as you're approaching to your call they're going to try to angle downwind or try to get down window view\nSo you have to be able to see down when and if I'm Out in the open and shut up and the winds cross when I Want to be able to make sure whether it's blowing left or right that I can see that down when side because eventually that predator is going to try to angle that in that location and you have to stop them before you get your when sent and make the shot\nYou ever set up decoys or ... or nay and water the pros and cons there\nYeah I mean I don't think there's anything wrong with the cause I\nDon't use them um I have used them during the daylight hunts you know when if I was hung out west or in Texas are there some other states where you know you're you're going to um have good success during the day because I understand this\nDaylight hunting and night hunting is like night and day literally because when you're daylight hunting you want the predator to concentrate away from you so you want to be camouflaged you want to be up and getting your outline up against some brush or something to break up your outline\nAnd you want your call your ... out in front of you because you want that predator to concentrate on that equal and call and keep his eyes off and you say you have a little bit more movement and then you can make a shot at nighttime\nUsing your light is your camouflage concealment but he want them to look at you at night because you're able to see their eye reflection from your scan light and you're able to use that light as your concealment\nSo he wants to call close to you and to declare really wouldn't be um really benefit in my opinion because they really can't see anything behind that light anyway I'm not saying that they they wouldn't be beneficial if used and you know the right circumstances\nJoe order take a little break they were going to

stress you know when you come home to a neighborhood with a lot of trees it's beautiful Japanese force bathing exactly it's the same same idea that ... that\nYou have in your ones and talk in Mount mount Washington neighborhood were to adjoining streets the same houses you know it looks like two completely different neighborhoods but the architecture's almost exactly the same the difference is that one street is lined with mature oak trees and the other street has basically no trees\nAnd and it literally looks like a very high end neighborhood versus a a lower end neighborhoods although the architecture's exactly the same\nAnd you know I looked at uh what is it jello and some of the house values in that neighborhood and the difference of those houses which range I think around a hundred

talked about deep mulching you know and ... and things but mulching wide areas is very very beneficial not deep you know two three inches ... only much a wide area there is a research done a few years ago\nWhere they did side by side where they just put mulch and compost over a tree root system in one area and then they went in with an air knife until it up the soil with air and and in most over there they got about eighty percent of the benefit from the standpoint of of of soil improvement\nAnd ... and ... and just by putting the compost and ... over the road system that they got from doing all the knife excavation and things like that because the biological activity and so does a lot of the work for years so rather than just putting it up a foot high and\nAnd two feet wide put two or

to it Leslie whose first\nAlison him in Illinois is on the line has a question about some guy what's going on at your money pet\nSo we just bought our first home um [noise] and it's in the city so it's very close to that has to make sure there's not a lot and um for probably ... feet for my neighbor down the south by its um and I'm hoping to finish our basement the way I look in the water ... than that but\nWe also have to have this enormous puddle that happens every time it rains and between at your house is okay um which is nice but anyway so giant pedal I don't actually know constrained okay in Chicago um [noise] but yeah I mean what we can do about that it's pretty on the grounds\nTo first of all you mentioned that you're planning to waterproof your basement if you do this right you probably won't have to do any further water ... basement because when you're basements could dampen went as a result of rainfall\nAnd polls forming around foundation that is the source of the week so we enjoy and who knows ... mostly dry now when you have to those that are close together and there's no place for the war to run you need to try to do everything you can kind of manage it now do the the rules on these houses both sort of dumped into the space\nMaybe dumping they're a part of fuel or whatever they do [laughter] land you know\nYou think they're flushing the bathrooms on your roof there about what they're doing this in a let me ask you a question for you but this roof on did you take the old ... Oh yes of course okay now I'm the old rule did have any stringer same problems not really know is your home shady\nUh yeah some shade or in front of the house yeah\nYou get more strict on the front of that\nI just noticed that in the front of a little bit right right like above the entrance of the door you know ... but I got like a a bind shape a typo so\nOne in thinking here is that typically the area where the roof rafter touches the roof sheeting right where the would be squeezing solid contact\nThat's a cooler spot than the average the right and left of it so sometimes when we get these stripes on the roof it's a condition called ... and it's because you get more conversation\nOr in the areas that are cold near his dinner warms the left and right and now also on the shady side of the house or wherever you have shade you're also much more likely to pick up a little algae or like in March\nAnd that can also cause standing on route\nSo before we jump to conclusions what I Would suggest you do you take a very simple approach does a roof clear out there that's called spray and forget it's available and ready to use bottled you basically just snap a hose and garden hose onto and then you could spray the roof down\nAnd just kind of walk away and see what happens I actually haven't had an extremely dirty shed roof that has so much moss on and it was crazy 'cause it just hadn't done anything wrong times\nDoing the repairs outside of decided I Would take care of that and I got the springs forget and put it on once and then I walked away for about a month knows that almost all who was going to put it on one more time and it's like perfectly clean then put it down doesn't happen instantly because basically what it does it stops the gross from forming think of it in a sort of a weed killers the moss\nAnd brightens the roof and then there's a residual and stays on it and kind of protects the long haul so I Would try or products like that it's very simple fairly inexpensive\nAnd see if that doesn't pay and then if it does then you've got to know what you're dealing with um one natural thing that you can do to ... though that group down and teach me try to get a little more sunlight on that area sometimes I've told folks ... trees and and that's should just enough weight on it 'cause sunlight is a natural middle decided as well so it makes sense\nBy right I'll give it a shot and hey you\nGot to foreign project in mind we got a two hundred dollar gift certificate going out to one lucky caller from our friends and lumber liquidators you'd like to when it got to pick up the phone and calls with your home improvement question ADD money pit and Leslie it's not hard to think about one area in your home and could use ...\nI I mean there's really so many

and ... batters everywhere have a lot of march around at our apartment and\nPlanting flowers and it's that that they are tiny spiders and at that are low spiders and then there's brown fat or that or the corps\nBattered I've ever seen in a boy\nAnd in the brown spiders that are as big as quarters they sound like a brown recluse spiders which can bite so those we don't like it all\nRight [laughter] I have ... stuff on live side by our kind of fat out inside my house that our ran outside that impossible to get rid off\nSo I hate to say this but have you considered hiring a professional and he probably stays saving some money but whenever I hear somebody is buying lots and lots of pesticides spraying it inside the house in spring and outside the house I'm kind of the opinion that by the time you do all that you've expose yourself to so much\nAccess pesticide that you would have been better off just having a pro come in because they can buy stuff that you can't buy plus they're specifically trained on where to put the insecticide how much deployed\nAnd also the insecticides that they are very specific and they remove only the insects that they're supposed to remove and they don't remove the beneficial insects that you want to leave behind so if you're having that much of an infestation\nI Would stop shopping around pesticide and call a pro and have them treat the house and once you get the populations down to where they are manageable kind of more normal than you could try to use some of those other products just on a maintenance bases that makes sense\nSure death that hears that here's down the question when everybody else\nAll I care neighborhood it's made by and going to help stop\nWell yeah it'll create sort of a barrier around your place but let me ask you is this a apartment you rent or is this a townhouse what what's the form of\nThe blackout at that gets built this how labor labor head at new apartment there's like forty three apartment\nSo they're rental apartments okay so if you get the ... the exterminator out there and they tell you that you've got something like a brown recluse spider there\nAnd you bring that to the attention of the rental

me first say Anthony welcoming buddy how are you\nA good to have your mark always good to be with you I'm doing doing great ... you had a good week since last week\nI had a very good week and I saw that you had a little quick trip to ah down to catch some fish with your boy I sure did I looked like that was fun I sure\nDid we we took a little a father son trip went down to Venice, Louisiana which is about sixty five miles south of New Orleans guy caught some red fish are red snapper and even killed some ducks while we were there oh oh you're\nGoing to offend Peter [laughter] well that's

I got to keep you cracking down on a I got to keep you on that you don't\nWant to talk to Anthony about your own retirement journey look whether it's through Social Security questions or you've got questions about possibly a pinch and maybe you're lucky enough to have one of those uh lots of different things that we cover on the program he and his team are here to help you out as I mentioned they got an office in Cookeville Knoxville\nAnd Chattanooga triple eight five five seven one nine nine three that's how you get on the counter to have a consultation no costs are obligation to do so eight eight eight five five seven Nineteen Ninety three we had a lot of response last week so we do ask that you call in\nAnd at least grab one of those calendar slots because they do fill up pretty quickly and he can only be in so many places that so many times to reach out to them AAA five five seven\nNineteen Ninety three and speaking of pensions Anthony let's talk a little bit here on our first section about\nThe people that are maybe pushed into retiring earlier or earlier than they planned it you know whether it's you've been presented the option to retire early whether you've been unfortunately may be forced into retirement early whenever the situation there are some common questions that people have\nSo let's see if we can provide them with a couple of nuggets to think about should this situation arise sure uh so if you you know first question and most have is well should I accept that retirement buyout offer with includes a severance as well or do I take my chances and just stay with the job knowing that you know maybe they could ended at some point\nWell you know I mean that's kind of a should you accept the retirement buy out\nI mean it really depends on what the retirement ... he is right when you least should listen to it right yeah yeah I mean you should you should at least listen to it take your chances stay with the company that he was he a risky that's uh it it does it is risky I've seen it happen over the past ten years\nI've seen it go good in some instances where they take the buyout I've seen people stay and work and it worked out okay I've seen it go bad I mean so\nReally I think you hit the nail on the head the answer is listen see what the offer is and then we can sit down and help you make that decision based upon what it is they're willing to off yeah now let me kind of tell the listeners\nA little bit about what's what what this is here I just happened about two weeks ago\nAnd um and I had to come in had a really really good work work for a long time for this particular company\nAnd if I said who was everybody would know and so it's a really good solid company and he was going to take the buyout I said okay what's your deal right so he told me tell me what it was and I said well it sounds to me like that in the event of you're passing\nIn the event of your death your wife is not going to get anything and he was like oh no no no no not at all I got it set up were were my wife will will be taken care of and she gets it\nAnd I said well based on what you're telling me that isn't true and I said do you happen to have any paperwork\nAnd he said sure I Do right here so they handed me the paperwork and I looked at it and sure enough it was set up for her to not get anything and I said All right here it is exactly what you told me in right here it is in writing and I said if you don't mind let's call the company and let's just verify this because\nHere it is in writing and I think you're I think you're stuck with it okay we call them up and sure enough\nBack into our conversation about retirement Anthony let's talk a little bit about some indicators that maybe things need to at least be addressed whether you're a D. I. wire I think things are going pretty well whatever the situation it never hurts to get a second opinion\nOr thinking about it like the lights on the dashboard of your car right we get the lights the pop on when things happen all these new fancy cars now they'll tell you when the tire pressures low they'll tell you when there's ice on the road they'll\nThey'll tell you just about everything right on on these new cars but there's there's a indicated that pops up so let's talk about a few financial indicators we may\nComing into contact with him and we should hopefully recognize these and say All right maybe I Need to get a second opinion here so first and foremost and this is a big one I think this catches a lot of people off guard Anthony is if you ask someone to say\nTell me right now what do you think it's going to cost of funds your lifestyle and retirement most people have no idea and when they make that educated guess\nYou'd probably wind up more often than not telling them well actually your way off so you might be like oh I Need a nine thousand dollars a month to get by you know or or three thousand dollars a month to get by and retirement or whatever and when you do the hard numbers\nThey're way off so I'd say that's the first indicator that you need to get a second opinion or get a plane in general because you may not have any idea what it costs to find your lifestyle\nOh absolutely I Know one hundred percent of the time\nHow how do you see that is it ten I don't think we have a man I yeah absolutely\nThink I've ever had anybody command that that really got it right I I had a I had a couple in my office I'm just a couple of months back and he just swore up and down that he couldn't retire for a couple more years\nAnd by the time we got finished with the plan and and his GPS and doing everything for him he already is retired\nNothing's October yeah so so yeah people don't they really don't uh most of them have a gas but the gas is generally way off\nAnd I think there was a couple of reasons for that one is I think it's because they come from a generation where they're thinking we have to live off four percent of our money yeah so that just isn't realistic today\nAnd so a lot of times that throws people off the rule of one hundred drove people off people are very educated\nThink that they come up with a good number that they need to retire and at the end of the day it really isn't true they're they're normally away often sometimes are way off in a good way and sometimes are way\nOff right you're right you might find out that you are in better shape than you thought you might find that you're not so it's always good to understand and have have a good grasp on what it is actually going to cost to fund the lifestyle that you do want to live in retirement and for most people Anthony I Know we're off topic a little bit maybe we're not but for most people\nThe the funding of the lifestyle it's really the same right I mean I'm pretty sure you've never had anybody came in and go Anthony I Want to downgrade my lifestyle and retirement\n[noise] wow [laughter] so I put too fine a point on it and no [laughter]\nNo and and you know most of the time you know you're focused on attaining a a certain network or a camp which could get in trouble as well yeah instead of being focused on how much income that you need to generate so we always kind of tried to back into it with what income is it that you're wanting to to make and\nJust earlier this week I was teaching one of the educational seminars and a gentleman said hey\nWhen when can I retire window I Know it's okay to retire\nAnd I said well the market hit an all time high this week right and he said yeah right it did\nAnd I said well how much of that four O. one K. are you comfortable losing because what ... what goes up must come down\nAnd he said well I don't want to lose any of it and I said well if you took all the earnings that was in your four O. one K. today could you retire\nAnd he said well I think I could\nAnd I said All right well let's take a look at your statements so we took a look at his statements we begin digging into diving into it sure enough as it turns out as long as he don't lose a bunch of money he could retire so guess what now he's making plans to retire and we're making plans to send him up the pension and get that payment\nWell I'll say let me ask you then so with that situation are you having to pull some of his investments off the table to protect the in the event of a a a possible downturn\nYeah we are cautiously right because look at the world we live in today okay I'm sure Iran going on random ... and things like a random tweets spiraling I mean it's actually let me let me let me mention that to you so I was reading earlier this week and ah that ah when the fed chairman talks\nThis was I forget who put this out so I Can't cite the exact source\nBut it was a news article I read that when the fed chairman talks that the um but the S. and P. five hundred\nMoves zero point for a percent and it's cost about one point seven trillion dollars in investments\nJust whenever he's made comments about the market this year alone so I Know that's kind of like massive numbers but it gives people an idea that even though the markets looking pretty steady and obviously it's still climbing we're we're inching our way closer to now twenty seven on the Dow there's still things that happened that cause things to be volatile move around\nIn some volatility is to be expected but depending on where you're out on your time horizon you may not want to experience some of that\nOh you might not want to experience and in and especially because look what does everybody say mark everybody says buy low and sell high the problem is nobody sales when it gets high\nWell because we go we're going to talk about this later by the way because we all are motions yeah because we go I can just squeeze out a little more Anthony yeah we use out just a little more you know yeah yeah they just want to squeeze\nOut a little more in a little more in a little more and that's called greed yeah yep and and when that happens it it that green monster ... by ... and and I mean look at the world we live and it's not what's happening today\nI mean you know we're trying to nominate a Supreme Court justice they're bringing up things that happened thirty eight years ago forty years ago\nA look at look at all the lawsuits that's happening today I mean holy cow who would've thought that you could be held responsible for things you did back in ...\nWe won't get political but yeah I get your point yeah ...\nYeah the point is is you don't know what's headed trigger something you don't know what's going to trigger something in in you you've got to not only protected\nFrom stock market loss but you've got to protect it and make it lawsuit prove yeah which is why I'm bringing my attorney on line here with me in a couple of weeks I'm going to have him on air yeah looking forward to that we're gonna have him yeah by yeah we're gonna talk about how to protect your nest egg from law suits and from nursing home settlements in\nAnd from from assisted living facilities taking it away so we're going to talk about you know there's several different ways that that we can protect your assets in one of those is is getting a trust one of them is taking some money off a tale absolutely\nWhere you're listening to retire the right way we're talking about some financial indicators kind of like the blinking lights on the dashboard\nOf your car that may give you some heads up that you might want to reevaluate what you're thinking about what you're doing here when it comes to your retirement journey with Anthony Wright\nAnd to retirement specially group triple a five five seven Nineteen Ninety three your number to call for no cause no obligation consultation AAA five five seven one nine nine three you can also text\nText R. S. G. to five five five eight eight eight if you'd rather do that and I have talked to anybody right away this text R. S. G. to five five five eight eight eight you'll get a response back and you can fill out the information there as well and it's just basic contact stuff\nAll right so let's let's continue on with a couple of more indicators before we take our next breaking Anthony I'm so let's think about our parents okay for a second a lot of times when an indicator that things may be off as if you find yourself feeling like\nWell how are you talking about this quite a bit before how mom and dad did it will work just fine for me because it worked just fine for them and that mental image can get you end up into a pickle because as we just mentioned the world is a whole lot different even if your parents just retired Twenty years ago\nOr Thirty years ago or thirty five years ago where it's massively different and you can allow that to skew your own vision\nAbsolutely I mean the amount of what your parents retiring early sixties let's say for\nI think that's and think that that's how it is still should be for everybody else but considering that you're you're likely going to live much longer than them then you probably don't have the pension that they had either\nSo you know the cost of health care is rising and daring during your retirement years you're going to have to worry about that and and I mean it's a whole different era that we are going to war what it calls the oh yeah I mean holy smokes healthcare is totally out of control\nOr you know you don't feel entitled to retirement at a certain age unless you've got a plan in place that shows you\nWhat and how that's possible now when you know when I when I say playing you and I talk about a plant a lot and that's because we really specialize in\nRetirement plans and we we have trademarked ... Patton there's cone our financial GPS and so that financial GPS tells you what those expense ratio fees are mark we see people on a daily basis that don't even know what their expense ratio fees are\nHow can you be comfortable in a retirement when you don't even know what the expense ratio fees are\nPeople don't even know what their risk score is\nI mean that's how out of control things are today so I'll ask people off say what your risk or they just look at me like I have two heads and they're like I don't know why I'm here hopefully exactly and I say you know what are your expense right shows they don't know how say bring your playing with me when you come they don't have a plan\nSo that's what we specialize in we do Social Security ...\nWe do tax maxim as I should we do tax savings strategies we do estate planning strategies so it might be a will versus uh\nThough hope to me it was like I think about ... when I think about that like well if you just if you decide to just try and ... and for those of you don't know what it is it's when you're basically stick your arm in what you hope or you I guess you assume the catfish hole or someplace and the catfish is going to bite you and then you're going to pull him out right\nAnd ah and I guess you got to hope that it doesn't hurt and I'm missing\nSo ... guy know them better hope it's not a path oh yeah right yeah well there are a little turtle there you go\nSo a lot of these guys that do this you know they really enjoy doing it and there's nothing wrong with it but they have a strategy they don't just go willy well most of 'em right most if you if you have too many beers by the lake maybe this and that but for most people that do this are they really enjoy newly they have a strategy they don't just go out and randomly stick their arm and a whole\nYou know they've they've got stuff on it they've got gloves you know so on and so forth right there's things that they are prepared for so same kind of concept\nIt's ... it's great to have hope and be optimistic\nBut when it comes to your retirement plan let's just not use hope as a strategy and actually have a plan in place and that's what we're talking about here on retire the right way with Anthony Wright triple a five five seven Nineteen Ninety three get a plan or\nAsk questions to find out if a plan a with Anthony and his team is going to be right for you by getting on the counter coming in talking for an hour and saying here's what I'm thinking here's what we're all about blah blah blah blah blah and Anthony will do the same and see if they can help you out there's no cost relegated in Tripoli five five seven Nineteen Ninety three\nOr another emotion Anthony I Want to talk about that gets us into trouble a little bit\nIs pride um you know you and I are in our late forties our dads you know in their sixties or or late sixties early seventies and there's different generations feel differently when it comes and they were all people but definitely there's in general\nTo do it by myself I'm not going to ask anybody for help that's commendable in some aspects of life but there are times when it's totally OK to ask for help and if you don't know what you're doing that's always a good time right\nWell yeah I mean look at the end of the day would you would you I mean I wouldn't but\nSome people are doing their self people but I wouldn't dig a hole in my backyard and try to put a swimming pool in [laughter] you might be a money pit it would be a money pit so that you know that's the same thing you you know I I Do run across people a lot of times\nThat pride comes before a fall and they are very pride full and as sad as it is the story I told you about\nThe guy was very pride full and he left all seven hundred and fifty thousand dollars in in the market one hundred percent at risk\nAnd lost their entire savings and it ended very tragically right so so pride is something that really get ya especially when you think that you you know that you're doing really good and you've got this system and you've got this plan\nAnd that tends to be the person that the stock market really really makes a fool of\nAnd and when they when they're trying to do it on their own and they have this little you know it's kind of like going to Vegas and you go you know hey I got this figure it out and this is what I'm going to\nDo I got a system [laughter] yeah I got a system you know I guarantee they got a better system [laughter]\nThat's right and I you know and I told I told the gentleman one day that you know he was like oh I'll tell you this is what's going to this is what the market's going to do and and it didn't he lost everything he owned\nBut but I was like I told him then I was like you know man if you can predict what the stock market's gonna do you are way smarter than I Am just about everybody yeah because there is no way you know a a tweet as you said earlier king king go out something on Facebook can go out and the and the market will drop\nA you know a hundred points\nSo you just don't ever know what's gonna happen and that's the reason that you really really need to getting involved with a professor and let that professional help you and you know ...\nRight I mean just it's okay to as guys like we could use the old adage we use the old joke Anthony Wright since our shows retire the right way and you've got a financial GPS it's OK to ask for directions sometimes in the\nAbsolutely absolutely you need to and you know to be quite honest with you ... you know we have found that most people don't have a true understanding of of three basic things in in retirement and I mean basically these are three things that people really need to know one they don't know how\nUh how much they're paying in their fees and what types of commissions they're paying that's critical you need to know that too they don't even know how much a necessary risk that they're taking with their nest egg I mean how\nCan you how can you invest with something you've saved your entire life and you don't even know what your expense ratio is are you don't even know what the fees are you don't even know how much risk you're taking and then third they don't even understand the tax implications of that retirement savings\nSo I've had a lot of people come through when we do the one we do the tax planning strategy and I'm like look all you've got that you can take out is five hundred dollars if you take out more than five hundred dollars it's gonna bump you to another tax bracket and that's going to cost you Fifteen hundred more dollars\nSo people are very thankful when we do that and so what I really get a lot of enjoyment out of is letting us sit down with people and help them understand these issues and so\nThere's a lot of our radio listeners who go through the process that eventually do become our clients I mean that's ultimately that's what we're you know we're hoping for the that\nProcess is it really designed to turn every listener into that client\nSo it it's just an extension of the education that we provide in their community to try to offer on our radio show in as you mentioned you and I've been doing this now for about five years and it's hard to give specific advice when you and I are on here talking with folks because everybody has a unique situation and we just can't\nDial it down and get right into the nitty gritty we have to just kind of\nQuestions in general as we possibly can so what I'd like to do today for the next ten callers\nThat called me I Want to go ahead and offer them a one hundred percent complimentary financial review of their entire financial plan and also their retirement plan and if they don't have one\nWe're going to help them build one and it'll cost them absolutely nothing\nSo costs you an hour of your time pick up the phone give me a call AAA five five seven Nineteen Ninety three texts five five five eight eight eight put the words and there are S. G. and if you do that\nWill help you get a plan and we'll make sure you're not only on the road to retirement but we will get you through retirement so pick up the phone and call me triple eight five or seven Nineteen Ninety three look forward to meeting with you\nAgain that number is eight eight eight five five seven one at nine nine three no cost around ... triple eight five five seven Nineteen Ninety three to get your financial GPS underway with Anthony Wright and retirement specially groups do more to come here on retire the right way we're going to take some questions from you around the area on the other side\nTennessee Volunteers stay home loans rocky town Iraqi Tom ... who that is one of my favorite songs and wish you know how to do things a right way here in the volunteer state that keep listing\nAnd there is more retired the right way in just a moment we're\nCruising down the home stretch today here on retire the right way with Anthony Wright we're casting out our last line of the day to\nTry to catch some fish I'm going to continue on with that fishing analogy solving I thought that he liked that yeah so here we got an out there we're going to try to real one more in here before we get out of here for the day we thank you so much for your time each and every week on the program as we talk about the world of finance investing in retirement\nAnthony is the founder

seven one nine nine three your number to call a day five five seven Nineteen Ninety three Ari as we always do Anthony mailbag time of questions that have come into the website retirement specialty groups dot com\nAnd we got a good one from been bends over in the ... as to say and ah been Scott a pretty good business question we don't get a lot of business people sending stuff and so he says of all my own business Anthony for the last Twenty years I'm thinking about retirement sometime in the next three to five years\nMy question for you this week is am I better off to try to sell this business and you know use the money for retirement or retain ownership and hope my employees can run run it effectively without me being there where there's a hope word ...\nWho there's hope we talked about that earlier right yeah well you know first of all you know a band I appreciate your writing in and and as the other listeners that we're going to read their emails here and cover but I you know being what I Would probably say to you is is it sounds like there needs to be some type of succession\nIf you're talking about selling the business taking it lump sum then you're going to have a huge massive tax burden on your hands\nIf you're talking about retaining ownership and hoping the employees continue to run it sometimes that that doesn't work out because nobody cares about our business as much as ... yeah\nSo I Would tend to look toward and lean toward a good succession plan of I'm putting some things in writing and and maybe doing a a good business\nIt's news talk Ninety four point
