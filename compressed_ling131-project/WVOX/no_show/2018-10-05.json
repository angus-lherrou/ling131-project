Donald's or a twin the owner or whatever Dunkin' Donuts but\nThe point is our school board made a conscious choice to not put in the job description of our attendance teachers the responsibility to

officials were very supportive of that and also the fact that there's a lot of green technology is being used it's very green building that we're building\nWell Ron Belmont mentioned it a during his statement on Monday he was very happy about it obviously\nYeah he was he was saying that it's it's kicking off the renaissance for downtown Harris who just one or two and a in a few weeks or understand that Avalon them be breaking ground on the much awaited decades awaited NBA project which there'll be some\nUm apartment units and the stores right at the train station so I'm Harrison will become a new destination kind of a moving itself closer to dry and and uh I'm earning village in vibrancy\nWell it's a wonderful local story do you see the development across the sound you know one of the things that people uh they may be aware of it but if they're busy in their lives they may not\nThat did that to happen while the economy support we and as you recall we had this boom\nAre going on before the crash of two thousand they stopped trumped up here in New Rochelle next stop boom that was it and now the ... it's almost like we need to get stuff done now my guest of course\nA John Bernie political analysts talk show host also is you know an attorney and in his own right a real estate developer of of of the very original type [noise] do you have\nTo let me add to other things my interest on one of the local over here it is\nI'm kind of staying local news is that is excellent in in ... ah the old movie theater um which has been a four screen movie theater and\nI had to close down or received a special permit last night from the ... and it's not going to be an ...\nWe ... as you recall we had this boom\nAre going on before the crash of two thousand they stopped trumped up here in New Hampshire and then it got boom that was it and now the ... it's almost like we need to get stuff done now my guest of course\nA John Bernie political analysts talk show host also is you know an attorney and in his own right a real estate developer of of of the very original type deal to\nMe it to other things my interest on ... of the local over here it is\nI'm kind of staying local ... in in ... uh the movie theater um which has been a four screen movie theater and\nI had to close down or received a special permanent last night from the ... on it's not going to be a screen theatre with smaller screens\nAnd luxury hiding up which is the way some of these small theaters are are are going so I'm while we're taking a risk a movie theater we shouldn't have adequate parking limerick theater does have had it before if you find it so it's going to be a you know\nCorrect and and and property and the county budget makes up about twenty to twenty five percent of your budget so when my own are always says he's going to cut thirty percent of your budget\nOr thirty percent of your property taxes\nI'd like to see it but at least I mean ... look to things as a longtime west Chester resident and homeowner I've watched my a high school classmates from Thirty years ago\nThe part or leave for Arizona Georgia the Carolinas taxes because of property taxes I'm always looking for someone to highlight that issue that's why I was a big fan of as the Reno for many many years though I think a lot of weight he he he bit my he he you know me\nInto his plan and I wanted to feature it and because Westchester homeowners pay the highest property taxes in the nation\nA it's a worthy issue but I agree with your Bob or give me give me the details\nSo I'm just saying look at all the school districts that we have\n... and ... and ... a long time calling all over the coldest it gave me a good education was he says you know if that's what people want to pay and they can afford it in an upscale community local government work and there's a lot of truth to that\nBut perhaps isn't the real answer to have more of an income tax or rather than than than train homeowners the way we do\nThey get a caller that you referred to he's right but um\nWhat it's doing is if you can't afford it you have to leave and that means seniors who've been in their homes for forty years they have to get out young young students graduating high school staying home with their parents maybe to college they can't afford to buy a home here\nWorthy issue but I agree with you Bob uh give me give me the details\nSo I'm just saying look at all the school districts that we have\nTo look at and and and a longtime calling all over the coldest it gave me a good education was he says you know if that's what people want to pay and they can afford it in an upscale community local government work and there's a lot of truth to that\nBut perhaps isn't the real answer to have more of an income tax or rather than than than train homeowners the way we do\nYeah they get a caller that you refer to he was right but um\nWhat it's doing is if you can't afford it you have to leave and that means seniors who've been in their homes for forty years they have to get out\nYoung young students graduating high school staying home with their parents maybe through college\nThey can't afford to buy a home here or other people from a you know middle lower and middle class and comes\nOut of how they afford a house with a with a down payment at two hundred thousand dollars property taxes twenty thousand dollars I don't I don't think I could never afford to get back into the or the west Chester a home market here above so we're seeing a lot of people out Jim Jim ... talks about that\nA lot he's very fearful of that and uh you know so that's my I I wanted to have the discussion again Bob ... why don't you agree\nMore now Jim ... and I talk every Monday morning sometimes and and and I'm a great supporter of what he wants to do but sometimes we go round and round because there's no real solution there because it's in the question of policy in the style a government that you have\nWe need more affordable housing but uh you're not going for example the ... where we go round and round is you're not going to get retail until you get the demographics\nAnd the only way to get the demographics and to get people who spend money so that you can get retail um affordable housing is a huge problem but it really goes to the top you know the better than I Do stand\nUp if we're going to have the police and fire departments of most municipalities complicit in in stoking pensions the way they do and we have our elected officials take money from them yeah we are doomed to high taxes for the rest of our lives\nAbsolutely everybody can't make a hundred thousand dollars on the on the public role of the retirement art\nYou know one other thing I Want it to refer to because of the ah mall an arrow story that I wrote about is I Want to get your thoughts as I see that with the Kavanaugh hearings or there may be a backlash across the country\nAre you know Republicans getting fired up polling indicates that and my my thought and wonder was\nAre we to deep blue in Westchester feel effects of that or could that could we get some rippling so that in fact here in West you're not in\nWest Chester plus I think a lot of it has to do is you know it's like when you put a searchlight on hockey players coming on the Rick\nSearch lights on it now but if you don't think there's going to be a huge backlash of women in this country we have a paradox here if he gets nominated that the Democrats are going to come out if he does since the Republicans are going to come out\nUh no I

put the system we see that now and what's going on in Washington\nReason has no place anymore it's all about tribe and politics and God help us\nDo want to do on on the other reason I put it on the front page by lead story this week mowing era what they're thirty percent property tax cut I wondered if anybody would actually care and if no one cares in Westchester highest taxed county\nAnd the country um all of our focus now on Washington and Trump Kavanaugh and Mahler and Russia I Wonder about\nThat time nobody believes anyone who says they'll cut taxes thirty percent it's the fourth

... good morning\nGood morning Bob how are you\nVery well we've got some home not homework for you but the question we're seeing in the Kavanaugh hearings and I bring that up because it's I propose the problem people who are generally with the exception of this last caller Trump supporters want him confirmed no matter what\nDemocrats have not confirmed no matter what\nAnd both sides are using events to make their case rather than to make the objective case it's tribalism going to be with us this way for ever and do you deal with that in your practice\nTribalism has men with us and we'll probably continue to be with us for quite a long time of course you deal with that as long as you dealing with people so I also deal with that in my practice yes\nWell how to get people to think objectively and to realize that how they feel or be separate from what they believe\nWell frequently thought does not monitor itself that closely to really determine what it believes it may think believe something but his behavior indicates quite different\n... will give me a simple example will use me as the guinea pig so I don't front anyone I don't like it when I go in the store and the people that work there I couldn't order Sam was the other day\nBecause the people all three people behind the counter never heard of a salami before I get it like once a year and English or something\nAnd it was frustrating I hate that I don't like it if they're going to be in the business or they have to learn to live which in my view but\nThat has nothing to do with my beliefs of their right to be here uh and the need for better immigration policies and my admiration for their working hard in it I saw how I feel is separate from what I Believe but some people think that they'll call the radio station\nWhile I'm saying that like it is no you're not saying like it is you're saying how you feel feelings are not reality\nFrom what I Believe but some people think that they'll call the radio station while I'm saying that like it is no you're not saying like it is you're saying how you feel feelings are not reality\n[laughter] I don't know if that's true that feeling that they're not reality I think feelings are good indicators of what we are really thinking and believing\nDenver is ab salute we exhausted it's been on the road it's last few games they're worn down from media reports I have we search me while Donald is continuing\nImprove yes he's had his rough spots yes she's been inconsistent but I see Sam Donald having a good a good outing lives\nEven reading Denver that'd be nice of course we're talking with family or a sports guy here in fourteen sixty Wu ... for those of you who regularly to listen to the seven o'clock hour or rather the eight o'clock hour you might wanna most weeks to get on the radio a little early listen to test for seven fifty his usual spot\nOr we will make you the bad guy and he liked finished\nBob I still say no I still say no the offensive line continues\nTo not given any support I think he's a quote serviceable and quote quarterback that can do it with the proper amount of sport I still think he's got some stuff left in them\nOkay let's go to hockey then since it started the rangers looked pretty good last night I couldn't finish a little sluggish and the first but then they played some good hockey and the second and then through the third I didn't\nTake it yeah they did play really good hockey\nNot a winning gave you for coach David queen but nevertheless his team looked ready it quite good defense and you know Bob this is what's what is going to be with the rangers this year they're going to be good spots and there are going to be disappointing spots last night was a disappointing spot\nYou'd love to win in the home opener you love to get David Quinn\nEight when in his coaching debut but all it all a very impressive outing for the rangers they they really stood up against the Nashville Predators\nNatural is one of the best teams in the NHL\nIs not the best absolutely\nYes so not a bad day do you\nKnow or only came was excellent uh he he recovered from whatever problems he had in the uh pre season or how can you got controversy again its usual controversy and and a paradox here Tom Wilson part of the Stanley Cup winning team got suspended for twenty games and rightly so did you see the hit that hit [noise]\n\nI did see the hit absolutely and I would agree with what you just said up\nNow here's the paradox the next night like creature that plays for Boston\nI didn't like the way a member Lars Heller who never had to fight in his life didn't last\nAll a very impressive outing for the rangers they they really stood up against the Nashville Predators natural was one of the best teams in the NHL\nIs not the best absolutely yes so not a bad day you know king was excellent uh he he\nRecovered from whatever problems he had in the uh pre season uh hockey's got controversy again its usual controversy and a paradox here Tom Wilson part of the Stanley Cup winning team got suspended for twenty games and rightly so\nDid you see the hit had hit [noise]\nI did see the hit absolutely and I would agree with what you just said\nNow here's the paradox the next night like creature that plays for Boston\nAh didn't like the way a member Lars Heller who never had to fight in his life didn't like the way he celebrated a go so he went out and beat him up [noise] I and here's the paradox in hockey which still as much as it got tougher Wilson still can't get its act together about violence because here's the truth\nIf Tom Wilson was in the line up that doesn't happen because Mr marsh shop would have had to answer to Wilson\nFor a trip now everyone knows now the reason they didn't spend him they gave me the game misconduct can we say didn't suspend Marsha ... was because Ehlers try to do the manly thing into office gloves to say All right [laughter] and he got to say that he got his butt kicked\nIs like saying that the ... Christian did okay with the law [laughter]\nYou know I didn't believe that much uh you can't have that you mean you know we used was imagined when Severino when you have the other night if somebody in the other dugout when I'm being I'm up hockey for all its wonder in splendor hacked to move on\nHand allow that\nI absolutely I totally agree and speaking of hockey let's not forget a nice when by the New York island yes I was going to that was going to finish up with the good news to\nBury trucks air as head coach the aisles get a win over a pretty tough Caroline that seem to want an overtime John barely with a goal take that John too embarrassed\nYeah I Know that by the way one to merits comes back for those of you who are big hockey fan\nThis will be the moral equivalent of of of let's say ... I don't know that there's another equivalent but he lie manning when he was in his prime a changing the giants that he was going to stake and is taking the saying then walked out before they could by trade him and that's what happens\nThey ought to boom but will they\nI think they will I said well I don't think it will be overwhelming but there will be some Boeing because of all the talk that he distributed before leaving for Toronto so I could yeah I can see there being some bowling huge volume is but I\nKind of got something for the feet of announces his intentions because I don't blame him for leaving I mean that place was run like a zoo what a Mickey Mouse shop\nYes but uh and he should have left but he should have told someone I mean it cost\nIn the long run it will cost millions of dollars he's playing some responsibility to the people that make them rich you know I agree with that anything else before we go and then you can tell us what you're talking about as you now switch your hat and he's going to take his baseball hat on and put on his hind change because he's a real estate man a as a show\nCalled building knowledge at eleven thirty every Friday what we'll be talking about today\nHave a great show today Bob the building and realty Institute which the sponsor of building novels with the building and real the Institute will be featuring a show on the wall of the owners representatives in the construction process there are tremendous amounts of construction going on in\nBecause I don't blame him for leaving I mean that place was run like a zoo what a Mickey Mouse shop\nYes but uh and he should have left but he should have told someone I mean it cost\nIn the long run it will cost the millions of dollars these players have responsibility to the people that make them rich you know I agree with that anything else before we go and then you can tell us what you're talking about as you now switch your hat he's going to take his baseball hat on and put on his hind change because he's a real estate man a as a show\nCalled building knowledge at eleven thirty every Friday what we'll be talking about today\nWe have a great show today Bob the building and realty Institute which the sponsor of building novels with the building and realty Institute will be featuring a show on the wall of the owners were presented to us in the construction process\nThere are tremendous amounts of construction going on in our area and few up in New York metro area we are going to show how the owners' representatives works with the G the wholesale\nArchitect a lot I can my eleventh or did I think a great job Jeff family coming up open phones we've been talking about schools we've been talking about Kavanaugh\nAnd you all have carried the show today continue to do so when we come back and just a few moments is the one the only fourteen sixty W ... or wouldn't you global media station we'll be right back\n[noise]\nMission to lose here is the latest updates from Fox News radio\nOn fourteen sixty Seventy feet away\nFox News on Chris foster ... this morning on whether to advance Brett Kavanaugh Supreme Court nomination to a final vote tomorrow North Dakota Democrat Heidi Heitkamp that I Will not vote to confirm him Iowa Republican Chuck Grassley says about centers who haven't committed yet publicly\nI've been in that same position and so I'm not going to hold it against them for not announcing ahead of time but he\nSays judge Kavanaugh should be confirmed the Nobel Peace prize winners or announce\nDennis ... recognized\nFor there to [noise] to end the use of sexual violence has been with another war\nDennis ... has spent decades treating injuries inflicted on women in conflict in the Democratic Republic of Congo not Moorhead was captured by ISIS in Iraq in twenty fourteen now campaign boxes\nDiamond Ellen the economy added a hundred and thirty four thousand jobs last month unemployment down to three point seven percent of the forty nine year low\n\nI Know you've got\nNation coming perfect and be the personal\nStationed on gum now Fox News rundown the weekly morning ...

everything's fine you know one of the problems with the health care to conversation that I Want to have is that we're not talking about health care\nWe're talking about the issue the flavor of the week and I just wanted to make a couple of comments in my view point of this a confirmation struggle a first of all the most telling interview I heard was that Jeff Flake\nFrom Arizona when was that on day Sunday night uh on on on uh CNN on sixty minutes\nOr when he made the motion to hold back the vote until the FBI investigator and he was asked point blank by the interviewer [noise] would you have made that proposal if you are not if you're running for reelection instead of leaving the Congress\nAnd he said no you're preaching to the choir so therefore here's this is the example this is the essence of the struggle we have we have politicians at all stripes or colors or religions all races all genders grab one interest and that's getting reelected\nThe most telling interview I heard was that with Jeff Flake\nFrom Arizona when was that on day night Sunday night uh on on on uh CNN on sixty minutes\nOr when he made a motion to hold back the vote until the FBI investigator and he was asked point blank by the interviewer what'd you have made that proposal if you are not if you're running for reelection instead of leaving the Congress\nAnd he said no you're preaching to the choir so therefore his fish is the example of this is the essence of the struggle we have\nWe have politicians of all stripes or colors or religions all races all genders grab one interest and that's getting reelected and so instead of having men and women of courage\nWe have tribal politics where the only purpose is to win the\nAttacker it it it is flabbergasted now you chose the medical profession and you're like dentistry and and this is Pollyanna but if you want to be a senator\nOr president or a job or or for that matter a cop or a fireman or a woman\nSacred obligation [noise] yes ... ... if if for example if a fireman God Bless them\nOld woman how to save a person but it was politically incorrect to do so they would feel safe to Paris and you know what happened to the sacred calling of politicians and judges both I\nMean is it the judge at six thirty at night that doesn't want to take a phone call from a battered woman ... calling for about a woman because he or she is having dinner with no judge it all\nThree quotes from our great founding fathers\nGeorge Washington be where we will be aware of political parties because they will put the part of your head of the people whom John Adams right after the formation of our new union he said that he fears that future politicians will put self interest ahead of the the ah the will and that sets cities of the people\nFinally Thomas Jefferson democracy is wonderful it only works for an informed electorate all man all three men had predicted where we are today because none of those principles are being obeyed well and followed by the people of America were not informed\nTheir misinformed by listening to their their selective media that ... that just reinforces their viewpoints the politicians are feckless\nAnd we are not informed culture\nYou know and and what makes it so dangerous doctor and every news person we interview\nConcert can can can cars\nWe have a Republican form of GOP Ninety percent of America doesn't understand what that means that our hands are our future in the hands of these people right and they are do not have our best interests at heart [noise]\nYou know if you want to look at this climate of America look at it over the last probably\nMy opinion it began in Nineteen sixty street when John Kennedy was assassinated we began to lose our innocence and we'd been unraveling for a long term wants to be a good thing though well it's a good thing except that we've had moved into partisan camps\nThe rise of the media as the message as McEwen and said the media is the message rather than the delivery of news\nUm along those lines interesting Ted Koppel was interviewed and he made the people on CNN very uncomfortable because you said CNN should thank Donald Trump because their ratings go up because all they talk about is Donald Trump MSNBC ratings got up because all they talk about is Donald Trump there's a lot of things to talk about folks\nBut remember in the news room when they make the decision whether ... whether it be ... Anderson Cooper or or Mr Cuomo\nOr Don Lemon on I'm just picking CNN they make the dust\nIn my opinion it began in Nineteen sixty three when John Kennedy was assassinated we began to lose our innocence and we'd been unraveling for a long 'til must have been a good thing though well it's a good thing except that we've had moved into partisan camps\nThe rise of the media as the message as McHugh in and said the media is the message rather than the delivery of news\nUm along those lines interesting Ted Koppel was interviewed and he made the people on CNN very uncomfortable because you said CNN should thank Donald Trump because their ratings go up because all they talk about is Donald Trump MSNBC ratings gone up because all they talk about is Donald Trump there's a lot of things to talk about folks\nBut remember in the newsroom when they make the decision whether ... whether it be ... Anderson Cooper or or Mr Cuomo\nOr Don Lemon on I'm just picking CNN they make the decision of what to the listeners want to hear to keep glued to our station that is true of Fox is true of MSNBC and true stand and they are no longer prevails of information there prepares of ratings and money\nPeriod than he was right about that um and I don't want to belittle point but one thing that's clear from the struggle in the Congress\nIf ever there was a call for term limits if Jeff Flake said\nThat I Would not have brought this without that if I was not if I was running again it tells you clearly folks they don't let these folks are told that they will not serve after two terms or whatever we decided on\nAnd across this great land the average cost is now twenty thousand dollars in New York still higher than other states a year and who's paying for it the employers paying for it or the employee or the municipality if there were shells paying his teachers for that this cost is is not sustainable\nAnd I have heard nothing but Donald Trump talk about everything but health care I've heard on the news everything about health care this is a very serious problem for this country and we can talk about it and and if an item we have a wonderful free enterprise system\nBut I mentioned before on the radio the two things that are not the ... the go shovel in this country one should be an excellent education because it matters to our future and the other is a healthy population than to have access to affordable health care [noise]\nWe we haven't had a conversation about that the Democrats talk about on the left talk about Medicare for all ... you know what we let's have a conversation I Know the cost or problematic but folks either I pay taxes that are more to get health care or I paid out of my pocket for it to buy health care it's not like there's a ... out there\nHis frog of legitimate you may not know this doctor but one of the concerns that a lot of people have about Medicare for all right now it's like sixty eight billion dollars in Medicare and Medicaid fraud\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe unbelievable SCHIP within twenty four hours from his posture on one day this week of expressing some degree of empathy I was actually almost open Charlie encouraged\nBy by is um is expressing some understanding of what a this then this Ford had been going through and the very next day within twenty four hours mocking her at a at a rally I Believe in Mississippi\nAnd you know I mean this is just this should be in Colorado because anybody\nAny Trump supporters should look at this as you know as an example of\nAbsolute complicity it's it's tantamount to somebody you know meeting somebody at a party and taught me about some accidents that they added and you know you expressing empathy towards that person or another person in the room expressing apathy towards that person maybe not knowing all the\nAll of the details were the true or not but you know showing some sort of human connection to the experience of that accident and the very next day in public mocking that per stopped\nBottom you know what Bob I think your point too well done and I think here's the problem\nThe people that support Donald Trump St loving on the right they they don't care what I'm saying like and the people on the left no matter what he says they're going to criticize so I'm just going to share with you Bob\nSet the tribal nature well politics are such that Donald Trump as he said can go on to Fifth Avenue and shoot somebody and still get reelected deference\nTo this caller and Bob I commend you because ... literally in the second in front of me not like the president but he was encouraged by what the president is that right oh Bob is a political guy at the table I can tell you\nWhen he realized that his followers like anger who like his beside Cindy even though it's up to speak to all some support is being massage and it's like yeah like it's a football game\nThat's unfortunately what he wants to play so let's see our money\nIs the irony is is that these supporters are realizing that he's lying to them every bit as much as he's lying to the the anti Trump or element and the rest of society\nI mean every time this guy opens his mouth is lying to his supporters equally as much so they're there to bring themselves to the it's the\nThe human willingness I think is to spend you know critical thinking and to allow this you know this visceral nastiness to cook permeate the conversation I asked you know it's just\nStriking and it's very very disconcerting is the society because the the man behind his capable of supporting somebody like\nThat they've done it really made it there are people that were better at it to him and coal confidence\nYeah the whole nation to war so remember we've experienced the twentieth century in Italy and Mussolini and Germany Hitler we have a world where people will follow their lead it to their own death\nAnd you know it's easier to die in the private didn't live is the general and have your own thoughts yeah well that's a great call if\nI could just add one more thing what what I what I think you know in I work in a mental health profession I've actually been interviewed by you guys before and I've enjoyed I enjoy your tremendously but the you know what I think is unique about this particular face in our history\nA you know John meet him in his book talks about these these past experiences in in American history and with no knock things and the Ku Klux Klan and so on all of which is true but I think there's something unique that's going on in the in this particular day and age that I see\nIn the work that I Would I think that there was a there was a wheeled diffusion of fought there's a lack of critic ... critical thinking that people are are experiencing now because of their minds\nLeading to their own death and you know it's easier to die in the private didn't live as a general and have your own thoughts about that's a great call if\nI could just add one more thing what what I what I think you know in I work in a mental health profession I've actually been interviewed by you guys before and I've enjoyed I enjoy your tremendously but the you know what I think is unique about this particular season the art history\nOr you know John reach him and his book talks about these these past experiences in in American history with no nothing's and Ku Klux Klan and so on all of which is true but I think there's something unique it's going on in this particular day and age that I see\nIn the work that I did when I think that there was a there was a real good fusion of fought there's a lack of could've cut critical thinking that people are are experiencing now because of their minds are so fragmented and so many different directions\nBe all these different news sources you were just talking about earlier ... movies on your phone texting emails and so on people are losing the ability to think critically\nAbout but we got to take another ... ... you're almost Dr sundberg good morning Mitch\nHey guys how you doing good thank you\nI just a couple of things first of all drugs like ... which costs about sixty thousand dollars a year while giving out like Charlie\nI'm actually surprised by what you do want to go quite stock bought them cut your cash

hit it right on the head and you know I've rented brought up before when they took people was problems like yours and they gave them a one group went through the door to the physical therapy there they went through other Peters did random study and they found out that they both had similar outcomes except once spent\nTen times as much money for the same procedure so the bottom line is that the medical model the medical model we have in America needs to costly and inefficient and you were a victim of that and unfortunately\nThank you very much so that makes me go to Chris Chris you're on TALK just turned ... good morning at his\nThrowing Dr ... office Chris you're not just to add to the conversation about the state of the country I I I Would think that it's a false our forefathers didn't drafting our constitution\nLike yours and they gave them a one group went through the door to the physical therapy did they went through other Peters random study and they found out that they both had similar outcomes except one spent\nTen times as much money for the same procedure so the bottom line is that the medical model the medical model we have in America is too costly and

you're not just to be a conversation about the state of the country I I I Would think that the false our forefathers when drafting our constitution\nWell early in the year when they'll play soldier

thick up\nRight so early on this became an issue locally and she said at that time\nIn the papers that she's very supportive of me and she certainly wants to see me reelected the working families

[laughter]\nYou know who's working families Hondros saying oh well you know but it's going to come out of you look at it this way that's just not nice\nWell look you know I've been in politics for a long time and you know you think you've seen it all but I think I I've always believed that one's reelection Ninety percent of it is doing your job doing it well working hard\nAnd I believe I have the confidence of my constituents I just think\nYou know certainly the primary electorate is a more focused and I'm In informed group of folks and pay more attention to these kind of machinations the general election\nOr in a gubernatorial or presidential year is a much larger universe of people and so that's what we have to be sure we reach out to to ensure that they understand I mean when I've talked to people on the street or about\nFor a long time and you know you think you've seen it all but\nThink I I've always believed that one's reelection Ninety percent of it is doing your job doing it well working hard and I believe I have the confidence of my constituents I just think\nYou know certainly the primary electorate is a more focused and I'm In informed group of folks and pay more attention to these kind of machinations the general election\nOr in a gubernatorial or presidential year is a much larger universe of people\nAnd so that's what we have to be sure we reach out to to ensure that they understand I mean when I've talked to people on the street a about this\nOr people have asked me they're quite clear that you know they're going to be supporting me but um you know the average voter is not paying attention and if they voted for instance the er once\nUh they may be inclined to do so again without understanding that this is not necessarily what\nHer intention was so I'm doing what I have to do\nSo you know I have an observation for you assembly woman to regret it and that is when I was talking to the working families people like suppose I'm not supposed to say the name based on our early conversations\nLet's fellas told me that this was what they were going to do because they were under tremendous pressure from Andrew Cuomo\nAnd they wouldn't the rank and file in that party would not name Cuomo as their candidate they did that once before when the Blasio intervene for him\nThey don't like them but some of these leaders decided who have all the money to give the working families party you do it or else this guy was caught between a rock and a hard place and basically they outlined the strategy from the moment they put her on the ballot because they had to because there are people who want it or they're\nWell you know the they face in excess central threat to the they're established party when like they need fifty thousand votes are in a gubernatorial so they have to have somebody\nUm and Cynthia was I think clear from the beginning that she didn't win the primary she did not want to be a spoiler nor did the working families party want to be a spoiler and see any a path for Republican to become governor and I understand that\nUh you know it's great to feel like collateral damage but I'm going to ensure that the end result is that I Will be taking my seat in the assembly in January\nI get it and you know I certainly love the concept of the outcome that you've just described\nNevertheless I think it's thirty disgusting stupid politics and I don't think that the people in the I'm\nIn the working families party the rank and file are happy about this the first few that I've talked to certainly indicate that they don't like it and I can't imagine what it's like to be in your spot but Cynthia Nixon and seems to me was always a long shot and she should stay right where she is just as far as I'm concerned I sit on my commentaries and\nAgain and again because it's the right thing to do and I know mark falling arrow who is now being beaten two to one in the polls is not going to take\nA Andrew Cuomo's governorship away from him\nI think the governor is very strong obviously there are places where um [noise]\nIt's not all the level of his accomplishments for which uh I think he outlines very clearly a but rather the way he goes about doing that you know we got George Bush because people thought they want it to have a beer with him obviously we've learned that the earth\nPilar happy about this issue that I've talked to certainly indicate that they don't like it and I can't imagine what it's like to be in your spot but Cynthia Nixon and seems to me it was always a long shot she should stay right where she is just as far as I'm concerned I sit on my commentaries and\nAgain and again because it's the right thing to do and I know more following arrow who is now being beaten two to one in the polls is not going to take\nA Andrew Cuomo's governorship away from it\nI think the governor is very strong obviously there are places where um [noise]\nIt's not all the level of his accomplishments for which uh I think he outlines very clearly but rather the way he goes about doing that\nYou know we got George Bush because people thought they want it to have a beer with him obviously we've learned that beer is more dangerous than I ever knew um [noise] so you know the likeability of somebody a becomes an issue when in fact the competence and\nAh their capacity for doing the job probably should be the first marker of whether one support someone or not\nI Will just say that it was interesting to me that in my district or there was Seventy six registered working families party people are five of whom showed up for the working families party primary [noise]\nSo that's kind of a bitter pill a or a bitter coda to the whole story that they count on obviously Democrats and independents are not on their own registered voters\nJust so everybody understands as you just mentioned to they need to ... thousand votes to stay on the ballot basically the next time and they have to win in the gubernatorial election\nSo certainly in the Democratic who qualify for the Republicans were qualified and I think would Cynthia Nixon there that would be their best bet to qualifying for those who the thousand votes don't ...\nI Believe that a democratic voters will be smart a and there are you know obviously a I'm a self interested party in this matter\nSo obviously it would be easier in my life is the she stayed on the working families party line I don't think it would affect the outcome of the old\nGubernatorial election uh and I think that the working families party would see that a reasonable vote that would keep them in business so to speak\nOn the other hand you know there are people who say let's leave nothing to chance and I think they could have Andrew Cuomo turned around and have the line and then said don't vote for me on the working families party line\nCan you know he doesn't like them very much because he's always been an adversary do you think he's a bully\nI think he has\nAn aggressive style that um is single minded towards his whatever he sees as the uh end result and are clearly there are times when I'm that\nComes across as I'm tough guy and I think he likes that persona you know you know he's a the the muscle car guy and I have to say when there's an emergency that persona where there's a natural disaster or whatever that persona is actually a positive thing\nOr it's not necessarily as positive when there are delicate negotiations\nOkay so ... tell us a little bit about your stumping around ... the place that historically first had the boss is like

always felt the tied to this issue\nBut I didn't really think about gun violence of impacted me personally and and it was only later I connected it back in a way you know a year after I graduated college one of our class\n[noise] Hi Ron Paul finer and I'm the Greenberg our town supervisor I were discussing um um moms them in action for gun Simpson America or with Catherine assure Walter and you don't have to be your mom we will ... who was um\nOn the phone berry and you you were going to talk a little bit about you know what got you um involved\nSearch fall and yes it's a start to mention your politics is probably a bit in my blood gathered we traced it back a little bit a couple of generations but\nFor me a lot of this um you know I always felt the tied to this issue but I didn't really think about gun violence of impacted me personally and and it was only later I connected it backing away you know a year after I graduated college\nOne of our classmates and lost his job at a bit of a ... a bit of depression we didn't realize it at the time I'm the one he came home he took a gun his father kept in a store and took his own life\nUh and that's one of the things that really has impacted music you know gun violence touches all of us I'm no community using some shots were mentioned the media tends to focus on mass shootings but we see\nSuicides wishy domestic violence taking loves right here in West Chester a lot of that is preventable show these are the things that are kind of draw on me to get involved in this movement and really focus on ways\nTo reduce that number we're Ninety six Americans die every single day from gun violence and the easy ways we can reduce that number if we work toward a\nRecovering you organize the forum I think it was in Yonkers a couple of weeks ago dealing with suicide\nYes that was that was a big part of the program because suicide on it's a big issue in terms of gun violence sixty percent of gun violence stats\nAre suicides and you know if you think about it so if you take some pills or if it first of all suicide it's something that usually is a fleeting sang at least that's what the professionals say this is part of our presentation that we had from some professional talking about\nSuicide and it's not something that you're necessarily going to do again there might be a moment where that hit you\nUm if you take pills or do something that can that somebody can help you with and you get in the hospital you don't die but if you have access to a guy and it's kind of ... ... it's very hard to say people from that\nAnd not only suicides but there could be a child who sees the gun on a table and it could be you know they could start shooting and the hope somebody and they have um um\nHow was turnout at your event\nIt was very guy we we were at the ... library I Would probably over fifty people there um we had you know\nThe presentation was on the side of wearing his mind on the issue with gun violence and suicide and what he can do to prevent that uh one of the things that we that we've been talked about is um they called him red flag laws are also extremely ... risk protection order\nAnd this is a law that we are than working for to get pass in New York a number of other states have passed that\nUnfortunately New York has not a Thirteen states including Florida has passed that and so what that basically means is that family members and law enforcement can petition\nThe court for the order when they see red flags with somebody so whether it's somebody that they worry about harming themselves or others\nI'm half of New Yorkers killed by fire on between two thousand twelve and two thousand sixteen with the results of suicide I'm forty two percent of mass shooting the attacker exhibited\nShe would kind of violence in suicide and what he can do to prevent that\nUh one of the things that we that we can talk about um they called him red flag lives a salad ... risk protection order and law that we are than working for to get passed in New York a number of other states have passed that\nUnfortunately in New York has not a Thirteen states including Florida has passed that what that basically means is that\nFamily member in law enforcement can protest in\nA court for the order when he had flags but somebody said whether it's something that they worry about harming themselves or others\nOn half of New Yorkers cared backfire on between two thousand twelve and two thousand for teen whichever thoughts of suicide\nI'm forty two percent if not shooting the attacker exhibited warning signs beforehand or to put that back to what I was paying nine percent of the time comes with a gun resulting gas\nHas to accept that ... death by suicide\nUm are there any other proposed legislation at the state level that you're going to be pushing\nWell that's our big one right now on bury their art the money you want to talk about that or\nSure of huffing too so yeah so the extremists protective order a has been twenty eight team that was our biggest push a and it was quite disappointing the the the assembly passed it the governor was supporting it\nAnd the minority leader and and the Senate minority uh we're very strongly in favor of it ultimately\nIt came to a vote in the Judiciary Committee and\nAlmost all of the members wanted to pass it so it past Eighteen to three\nBut rather than sending it to the floor for a floor vote were were this Senate leadership knew it would pass they buried it and coach committee so we're we're challenged by the current Senate in New York but our bills that were focused on her\nPosed this red flag bill another big bill we're focused on his research Institute Catherine mentioned that organization only we are very much um\n[noise] you know evidence base we we\nWe don't want to change laws just because we have a gut feeling that this will save lives we want to go look and then there's\nThere are there's a lot of science being done although you know Congress has made it very hard to use we can't use federal dollars to do research so we're looking to do some of that at the state level so we've got a [noise]\nA bill to ah\nCreate a research Institute that would be within the SUNY system\nAh that would allow study for what what the causation is for gun violence in ways to reduce it so that's\nAnother bill a there was a package of about eight other bills I won't go into all the details that I'm senator ... cousins and others in the ... in them in the Senate minority had pushed for this year\nThat many of which we field would be great uh and then on the federal level we're very focused as well on\nA ... you know a couple of things one is you know they're the bump stock ban right we heard about this a year ago and then they buried it and they talked about it the other day on the anniversary of Las Vegas there's no reason for those to be legal there's nothing to do other than kill people\nOr so we want it banned those ban bump stocks we want to ban high capacity magazines\nUm and you know they're they're they're trying to make it easier to get silences so we're we're playing defense a little bit on the federal level\nBut on the state level Democrats take over the Senate which is likely a vendor excellent chance that the legislation that you're pushing would be adopted exactly we're we believe that yeah yeah\nAlready had pushed for this year that many of which we feel would be great uh and then on the federal level we're very focused as well on\nA ... you know a couple of things one is you know they're the bump stock ban right we heard about this a year ago and then they buried it and they talked about it the other day and the anniversary of Las Vegas there's no reason for those to be legal there's nothing they do other than kill people\nOr so we want to ban those ban bump stocks we want to ban high capacity magazines\nUm and you know there there's they're trying to make it easier to get silences so we're we're playing defense a little bit on the federal level\nBut on a state level with the Democrats take over the Senate which is likely a than there are excellent chance that the legislation that you're pushing would be adopted\nExactly we we believe that yeah yeah and you know that's a big part of our focus right now um we got a day of action October thirteenth\nIt's not really have have a major impact\nWe have a a meeting that happens once a year and we are they called done sense university and it's really a way that we get everyone together that are has leadership roles across the country\nAnd we get educated on different things that are happening on laws on policy objectives for the coming year and you get to meet people from across the country and you meet people in the state like Wyoming Montana or Arkansas and it's amazing that the work that they're doing even in a case like that so it makes you feel good at a university\nShould give honorary degrees people change their mind they are there are of elected officials um anywhere that have gone from being like strictly gun pro gun\nWho who are supportive of\nReasonable ... them I guess ... is one person has changed\nMy great if there was no go ahead\nAs I say I phrased it a little differently and even when you were talking about you know Eliot Engel and\nNita Lowey I don't think they're anti gun I I think they all are really focused on commonsense gun laws is Catherine this mission we're a national organization\nSo think about a week and we've had successes in every one of the fifty states in terms of getting commonsense gun laws passed so there are a lot of legislators who may have felt a ... a particular bill was not appropriate for them or or uh\nFrom being like strictly gun pro gun\nWho who are supportive of\nReasonable like your guest Gillibrand is one person has changed\nMy parents had I not that I had\nAs I say I I phrased it a little differently and even when you were talking about you know Eliot Engel and Nita Lowey I don't think they're anti gun I I think\nThey all are really focused on commonsense gun laws as Castro was mentioning were a national organization\nSo think about a week and we've had successes in every one of the fifty states in terms of getting commonsense gun laws passed\nSo there are a lot of legislators who may have felt us a particular bill was not appropriate for them or or or had you know\nAnd then we're their environments uh was focused on it we even see in a race right now upstate New York there's an assemblyman Anthony Brindisi who voted against the say fact\nBut he then came when when we had the vote on or Poe earlier the extreme risk protective orders this year\nHe voted for it and he co sponsored the research Institute bill um he's actually running now for Congress against Claudia Tenney but he was you know upstate New York is very different than than the the New York city metropolitan area but they I think a lot of the change has happened we've we've changed hearts and minds\nWhich you know where where you look across the board and and that's helping influenced legislators to look at this issue is being nuanced it's not or you pro or anti gun it's or are you willing to do the things that can reduce the the gun violence in our country while still allowing law abiding citizens to have guns\nExactly in fact we have a lot we have members that have gone um they they feel that they should be safer and Saturday\nRight I mean there's no reason why and somebody's having assault weapon a a um uh you ever get frustrated by how well the government acts and\nYou know how frustrating it is that you know the Congress hasn't passed the legislation despite all these these acts of violence\nYes of course then that's why they just you know keep going as we'd like to say um we just have to keep working at it\nWhat's the next event but you're right now I guess you're focusing on the election which will take up a couple I'm In a more weeks and I wonder if there's any meetings coming up\nWell that and I said a very I think mentioned that we have a guy at the action coming up which is the thirteenth of October and\nThat's ... ... ... instead of a meeting without really going to be driving people to either found bank um we're still working at some of the details of boy that will take place probably in the ... campaign office or in a camp that\nI'm for a ... in a way that the chemical area\nUm I had another question about the state so you know it seems like the Democrats are going to take over the state Senate are all the Democrats\nWho are running statewide are all of them supportive and do you worry that the Democrats take over that some of the more conservative Democrats may decide to flip\nSo if I can jump in there one of the things we introduced in the past year I'll fall was a thing called the gun sense candidate distinction kind of the counterbalance to the un already has their report card grits by the way I Will note you you mentioned we're we're supporting Pete hearken he's running in ...\nProbably in the ... at a campaign office

the un or a state senator in Westchester County uh but we've we've introduced his gun since candidate distinction and this allows candidates to go on record or this requires candidates to go on record before we support them\nAnd we are seeing you know over and over we're seeing great results now from candidates who are on record as saying on specific bills like ... like the red flag bill like other bills that are going to make it [noise] give law enforcement more power\nAnd to make it a little harder for those who shouldn't have guns to get them they'd gone on record as saying they support them

L. dot com mission of the show is what God all that's going on in the world from the perspective and today was going to be talking about peace and conflict resolution\nWhat we're talking about today and it's always we have a centering piece that to get us grounded as we get started and we we've actually been here before today the prayer is the prayer think Francis please Pruitt's me\nLord make me an instrument of by peace where there's hatred let me so love or there's injury pardon where there's doubt faith or their despair hope where there's darkness light and where their sadness joy oh

declares that there are no absolutes and belief that he escapes responsibility is the man for all the blood but it's now spilled in the world reality is an absolute\nExistence is an absolute a speck of dust and an absolute until the human life whether you live or die is an absolute whether you have a piece of bread or not it's an absolute whether you Easter bread\nOr the advantage into a leader stomach is an absolute there are two sides to every issue one side is right and the other is wrong but the middle is always evil the man who is wrong\n... and dined we are born to eternal life um and and I've\nA a quote here from an ran from Atlas Shrugged\nAnd she says that the man who refuses to judge who either agree or disagree who declares that there are no absolutes and believes that he escapes responsibility is the man for all the blood that it's now spilled in the world of reality is an absolute existence is an absolute a speck of dust and an absolute\nAnd so it's a human life whether you live or die is an absolute whether you have a piece of bread or not it's an absolute whether you Easter bread\nOr see it vanished into a leader stomach is an absolute there are two sides to every issue one side is right and the other is wrong\nBut the middle is always evil the man who is wrong still retain some respect for truth if only by accepting responsibility of choice but the man in the middle is the naval blanks out the truth in order to pretend that no choice or values exist\nWho is willing to sit out the course of any battle willing to cash in on the blood and be innocent or to crawl on his belly to the guilty who dispensers justice by condemning both Rob and both the robber and the robbed to jail\nWhose fault conflict by ordering the thinker and the fool to meet each other halfway and any compromise between food and poison it is only ... that can win\nAnd any compromise between good and evil is only evil that can profit and that transfusion of blood which train the good to feed the evil the compromise\nHits the transmitting rubber too and that's an ran from Atlas Shrugged and then just a short want to hear from Patrick\nLin Yoani from the five dysfunctions of team a leadership fable he says I don't think anyone ever gets completely used to conflict if it's not a little uncomfortable then it's not real the key is to keep doing it anyway and we're talking about this because what I've noticed is especially in leadership [noise]\nLike to call what I've noticed a crisis of conscience or especially with and churches are of a crisis of conscious that leads to like a crisis in morality and you know our decision how we handle conflict\n\nTime\nWay\n\nStraying gym\nYou been doing you know and\nI Can't be with China\nKnow what you\n\nWe know\n\nThat was new wave to trying to take the dog named Doug pretend the holy Bible and\nYou know I've I listen when I listen to its album for the first time I was just I'm not sure what I like to but I Would not accepting what I end up in political surprise which is why we're working our way through it and but I like the song because it talks about\nFinding a new way a new way to do things any way to behave and\nOh [noise]\n\nAnd that was new wave of ... music that's Snoop Dogg Snoop Dogg prevent the holy Bible and\nYou know I've I listen when I listen to his album for the first time I was just [noise] I'm not sure what I expected but I was not expecting what I got enough and pleasantly surprised which is why we're working our way through it and but I like the song because it talks about\nFinding a new way a new way to do things any way to behave and operate and\nWhen we look at resolving conflict trade what resolving conflicts really boils down to is finding a new way of operating\nFinding a new way of being in the world with the people that were in community with and so I asked on Facebook and you also said you know I said what's your conflict resolution style and and what have you said fisticuffs and continued with just kidding of and they said most of the time of opt for giving space and then confronting the issue\nAt the tents are heated exchange and another you said have a whole list and I'm just going to work through this list really quick they said number one pick what the parties involved individually\nAfghan to adopt information gathering questions three is ask each party if they'd be OK with meeting with the other party to find a solution for\nDefined resolution to each party five at both agree planned meeting informed them at no point during the first meeting or to are they allowed to address each other directly there to speak to the media only six me of with both um begin questions to help each side understand the other's thoughts and feelings\nAnd feminist tried to reach an agreement of common ground giving each person a chance to respond take turns no interruptions and hopefully it'll be a peaceful path towards Lucian is thinking about the the thing that comes up for me\nPeter Lee is there the passage of scripture\nAnd Matthew chapter Eighteen\nI first Fifteen and then it specific to if a member of the church um harms you but I think it can be applied to where we live in where we work in maybe where we volunteer and some other space in it so that\nIf another member of the church since against you go on point out the fault when the two of you are alone is that the member listens to you you've never gained outlined but if you are not listen to take one or two others along with you so that every word may be confirmed by the evidence of two or three witnesses\nAt the member refuses to listen to them tell it to the church and if the offender refuses to listen even to the church lead such a wind BTU other gentile on a tax collector\nI'm truly I tell you whatever you bond owners will be bound in heaven and whatever you lose some of those will be ... and having again truly I tell you have two of you agree on earth about anything you ask it will be done for you but my father and heaven\nFor two or three are gathered in my name I'm there among you up and I I liked his passage because it gives you kind of a framework you know if you try to talk to the other person so sure at work\nRight and maybe your co worker the person who share a cubicle with Doug thing [laughter] right all the time I don't know what it is because only you know who the people are that you work with\nBut try talking to them first you know don't go directly to\nThe supervisor and say hey you know can you make them stop you know tried talking to that person first and then if there are other people in the area you know if that doesn't work you know maybe take one or two other people who you find you know that you have a good relationship with maybe somebody that the both of you\nHad a good relationship with bright and tried to talk to the person like that and and then then if the\nAnything you ask it will be done for you but my father and heaven\nFor where two or three are gathered in my name I'm there among you up and I I liked his passage because it gives you kind of a framework you know if you try to talk to the other person so sure at work\nRight and maybe your co worker the person who share a cubicle with Doug thing [laughter] right all the time I don't know what it is because only you know who the people are that you work with\nBut try talking to them first you know don't go directly to\nThe supervisor and say hey you know can you make them stop you know tried talking to that person first and then if there are other people in the area you know if that doesn't work you know maybe take one or two other people who you find you know that you have a good relationship with maybe somebody that the both of you\nHad a good relationship with bright and tried to talk to the person like that and and then then if all that doesn't work then you can go to management and say hey we've been trying to talk to this person and this is what happened\nUm can you help right though because there are [noise] you know when when you look at mediating conflict we can actually make conflict worse and a lot of times it feels like it's getting worse before it gets better\nBut I've found every time that I've tried mediating conflict in this way it's so much better than times when I tried other ways for mediating conflict or you know like the one on Facebook person responded and you know with that list right you may need to get someone else involved to help to work at the mediator\nAnd to help you through the conflict\nEspecially if you're trying to have a conversation and it seems like the conversation is going nowhere and so so that's important to to just be able to name how things are going I feel like so often especially in churches were not honest with\nOne another um when there is conflict and we're we're feeling some kind of way about how a person is treated us or something a person is said\nAnd I found that was helpful to be honest but to do it in the spirit of love you know if you if you're a regular listener to the show you know we talk about love and accountability accountability in love and there's another way that we can address accountability\nBut to do it in a spirit of laws so that we actually are making peace and so that we are on the track to becoming peacemakers and because I think that\nA responsibility to all of us have as as peacemakers in the world and you know just to let you know [noise] um [noise]\nYeah just to let you know about some things that are coming up at I'm In New Rochelle I think we've probably got we've got a Harvard stays on Saturday So between the hours of ten thirty AM and new and we will have free\nFresh organic produce it'll probably be our

your stuff with you um yeah so please do join us on Sunday\nAt New Rochelle United Methodist church and I want to and and you know when we think about resolving conflict you know resolving conflict really does just lead us into healthier relationship it leads us into healthier relationship not just with other people\nBut it leads us into healthier relationship with ourselves um because of because we have a responsibility to to be honest with ourselves and also leads us into healthy and write relationship with God and our creator you know if you pray the Lord's Prayer then it then you say you know God\nSo it's important to understand who the direct client is who's the head of the organization is the board and so forth understand what their goals are if they have a specific budget restrictions if they have a schedule it's a lot of information gathering and also personality gathering understanding and make ... developing a relationship with all these\nPeople you speak about developing relationships that would of course include developing a relationship with the owner as well as the architect\nYes the architect but often uh and and the best situations were brought in before there is an architecture and design team\nOr we can help them identify\nPossible groups to be hired we can help or figure out who the team that included whether it's mechanical engineering structural a VIP and so forth um send out an RSP make recommendations so I'm ideally we can be in that part of that process\nGuarded understanding the owners quality standards scheduling budget that is also a very important process\nRight critical uh especially are starting with the budget because often there may be a set amount of money they have from a public body or a from a government or they may have a donor or they may be fundraising every client we have is entirely different and understanding that uh those\nWere brought in before there is an architecture and design team\nOr we can help 'em identify\nPossible groups to be hired we can help or figure out who the team that included whether it's mechanical engineers structural a VIP and so forth uh send out an RSP make recommendations so I'm ideally we can be in that part of that process\nGuarded understanding the owners quality standards the scheduling budget that is also very important process\nUh right critical of especially are starting with the budget because often there may be a set amount of money they have from my public body a from a government or they may have a donor or they may be fundraising every client we have is entirely different and understanding that uh those parameters this is critical\nMeetings they report of any construction project their report of what involves any construction project organizing and leading those meetings\nThat were regular project the meetings that LeBron is involved and who would like to talk on that\n[noise] I mean why don't you take the oath\nOkay so um once were up and running we have often weekly meetings bi weekly it depends where we are in the project\nDuring construction it might be a bi weekly once we start with construction do we want to be there every single week because so much happens um and of course there's a lot that happens between the meetings but the meetings or an opportunity to have everybody in one place\nShare ideas figure out where the communication might not be so smooth is by email or by phone\nOr and it's critical to uh make sure everything's covered in the meeting everything's documented both informal minutes but I also like to follow up with a quick email saying this is what we decided this is what everybody has to do ... everybody's next thing so it's kind of a double way to cover thing\nIf I could jump in for ... minutes are extremely important because they become the history of the project we like to write the meeting that us because\nWe want to ride from from the owners perspective which the architect may have their view of what's important the contract and they have their view of what's important we feel very strongly that maybe minutes should be written by us because they are from the owners perspective [laughter]\nI'm In addition um as issues come up and people say well I didn't say that right to say that ah these men it's become a history of what was said\nAnd that in the long run I Would imagine it was very important you have every step by step process documented in case someone needs to refer to that situation down the road\nYou know I Want to add it's not even in case it all the way throughout the prize okay discrepancies and memory loss and being able to sort of ... we say we did decide that three weeks ago or two months ago last summer here's the record and then everybody can sort of be back on board but it's it's all the time all the time\nTo Lebanon forty two AM here I W view at fourteen sixty am you're listening to building knowledge with the building and realty

and project management on\nMost types of construction projects that love you isn't often project documentation who would like to address that ...\nThe preparing of customized written reports and monthly costs reports and we talked a little bit about that is now is there anything else that we need to add on that\nAh I guess I'll jump in um so I Am the project manager definitely has to manage every piece of the budget every dollar\nEvery changed or every agreed upon a contract um and we create a a a document that had the costs are poor and has backup with all of the of costs that have come and pay costs um\nWhich we review all the time usually we share on a monthly basis at the extra thing I always like to do is find out who at the institution is also tracking the costs internally and set up a relationship early on so that I Know that my numbers\nBut I think has been processed hasn't sac then process and what what the owner has which might be other costs that I don't know about\nAh I can track as well that is critical because at every point in the project you want to be sure you're on target with the budget if there's something that comes up the early you know that it the better that or else it is\nI mean did you want to add anything else on that point\nNo I I think Amy covered it very good\nBy the way I failed to mention the ... leader and please forgive me anyone with any questions for living in a company called W. B. O. X. fourteen sixty am at nine one for six three six zero one one zero ten and Amy would be more than happy to address any questions you have\nOn the important work that levee can conduct and the role that his company plays and he's\nVery important construction project about the New York metro area schedule management\n[noise] anyone on that\nWell that's I'm obviously key a great many of our projects um our educational project I'm independent schools and and various other types of university buildings etcetera [noise]\nUm and they all either an opening a usually right after Labor Day I'm so I'm being able to manage the schedule is an extremely important aspect of what we do um [noise] the schedule during pre construction is controlled by us\nBut scheduled during construction is controlled by the contractor and it's extremely important\nThat um that scheduled to be reviewed every week so that as issues come up or they can be addressed to determine whether overtime is required or if there are some of the sequencing of construction that will ameliorate any delays [noise]\nOkay ... the project team obviously such a vital vital component of the construction process the project team and defining the scope of services for each involved party\nAmy would you like to talk\nTo obviously the the owner comes first a project manager the design team\nWill is an extremely important aspect of what we do um the schedule during pre construction is controlled by us\nBut the scheduled during construction was controlled by the contractor and it's extremely important\nThat um that scheduled to be reviewed every week so that as issues come up or they can be addressed to determine whether overtime is required or if there's some other sequencing a of construction that will ameliorate any delays\nOkay put the project team obviously such a vital vital component of the construction process the project team and defining the scope of services for each involved party\nAmy would you like to talk\nSo obviously the the owner comes first a project manager the design team are generally you have the architect is the lead design person on that team ideally\nThe architect or has under hit its um previews the other some consulting structural mechanical electrical uh funding I like it when ... he is under the design end of the architect doesn't happen it's helpful if it does\nCivil engineering again it's good if it can be part of that design team because the more you can put that all in one place the better it is and we are involved in every step of the way of putting teams together for the job early enough we also ... ... and depending on to a municipality were in that sort of very I think up here in West Chester\nIt's often a civil engineer that does the expediting with the local city agencies and the city it's a separate company altogether um estimators important lawyers usually the client has its own lawyer but it's important to touch base with Hillary and make sure they\nAre uh want to be involved in putting together the contracts or if they want to bring in somebody additional who's more familiar with construction um goes on the furniture consultant often at sound can sell it goes on and on\nWhite ... as we said we said that some of the welfare\nOf preparation for the show that the team and its roster of players to use the sports term is very very important we have a caller someone called into W ... morning welcome to building dollars with the building and real the Institute you have a question from Amy in can go right ahead\nI came in late on the show I Apologize or because I usually try to catch the show every Friday but I'm just curious to ask your two guests so what's the what project or do they feel what project was the most exciting most interesting projects that they've worked on\n[noise] okay well I'm going to take that one this is Ken I'm two projects that are actually currently underway we we've been fortunate to\nAh worked for many of the independent schools in New York um and we will talk about one in particular she just completed in your area but we're currently renovating or the very historic Ford Foundation building on forty second street\nUm which was an iconic buildings landmark both inside and out\nUm it had been touched and about fifty years so that's a very large project that will be finished the years that and the second one\nI Would tend to guess is probably uh the shut up the Hudson Yards which will also building right now which is the cultural building in the Hudson your large of the west side of Manhattan\nUm and then there's something called stipulated from where you complete the drawings you\nBetter like I said I Will build this building on these drawings for X amount of dollars we created hybrid events of reconstruction into construction and we'd negotiate the contracts with multiple phases so that it's the contractors incentivized to do a very good job and hopefully make a few more dollars\nAnd the quiet knows they're protected\nBy um issues that may come up with the contractor contracting is an extremely important part of the projects often not given enough attention and\nThank you so much Amy thank you so much if anyone would like to reach living in a company called the ... riots two seven three zero seven zero we thank you for joining us this morning

supporter of em [noise] I I don't need to go over that any more it was a matter of choices but as you correctly was allowed to get away with this craziness\nI Lived in ... religion the famous quote from some of the Bible which is you have a needle in which\n... editor of the kingdom at I haven't yet remember that\nNow I understand that I have no problem with people being which\nBut if the catch ... that's why many people like the fact that the most biggest supporters realtors\nPoliticians take this money so they can give these guys the books yeah but to think about some of what your friends from Westchester mhm ... ... ... from themselves\nIt's the talk show was allowed to get away with this craziness I guess that's why in the least in my religion the the famous quote from some part of the Bible it's easier for camels to get through the idea of a needle and for which\n... the editor to kingdom haven't yet my mum and that\nNow I understand that but you know I met some I have no problem with cable being rich\nBut it's the talk shows last Saturday That's why many people like like the fact that Governor Cuomo's biggest supporters oil realtors\nOldies politicians take all this money so they can give these guys the brakes half way to think about\nSome of what your friends in West Chester mhm not use the tax purposely impoverishing themselves so they don't have to pay for their parents medical care\nWhen they get older yeah that's it that's it I wouldn't like\nTo have supported the idea of what kind of transfer of wealth to get on Medicaid the support that idea\nBefore before I get to that I think the curriculum is and I heard you wrong you're you're telling me or or tell me nuts and the only that what Trump did with the tax stuff was just plain that this bill was that was the one who\nWas that it was a ... I don't know much more you need to know that it was ruined unless you just don't believe anything that reporters do research is doing to\nBe honest with you I I as I say I haven't read the material so I Can't comment ballots\nTree miss a lot that is committed for them that showed in court\nI think you mentioned the statute of limitations there was that perhaps civil penalties for Thirty years ago I don't know still apply but if there was found what they did something illegal\nThey let them pay the price of a problem with that\nYeah okay okay well the template again so did you hear what you think about that I just wanted people to transfer their Medicaid\nI don't mind talking about that I just would rather have heard you say we don't know yet it could be\nOkay but I Know some people can watch as if it's a fact I got you\nOkay let me go to your point of view because I sadly no a lot about that from my parents and their old friends who were some of them getting a willing to stick to be cared about\nThere was no ability and yet congressmen and then all of the government knew that it was such a shame for a man or woman to pay so much money over there working lifetime and find it having to be totally a emptied out of their savings bank that they worked hard for\nA war because they had to spend it first on nursing homes or something like that\nUh because they was alive so they were told by ... by lawyers in reality ... if you'd divorce the person you're no longer legally responsible and he can then or she can then collect\nWelfare and go to a nursing home that the government would pay right because there was no provision to help working hold on to the money they had said\nThat was one aspect of it and I think what Sandy become people have\nWill will be done similar things in order to make sure they can be money to their children to their spouses\nBut ... but it would be nice if somebody in government would create a little protection for the working guy who maybe could save a hundred thousand dollars and nursing home which cost at least sixty thousand dollars will be bankrupt within a year and a half\nMhm and until the is the cure of that I think people have to do spell smoke even when advised by lawyers\nAllied so they were told by ... by lawyers reality ... if you'd divorce the person you're no longer legally responsible and he can vent or she can then collect welfare and go to a nursing home that the government would pay right because there was no provision to help working hold on to the money they had said\nThat was one aspect of it and I think we're savvy become people have\nWillfully done similar things in order to make sure they can be money to their children or to their spouse\nBut ... but it would be nice if somebody in government would create a little protection for the working guy who maybe can save a hundred thousand dollars and nursing home which cost at least sixty thousand dollars will be bankrupt within a year and a half mhm and until there is a cure of that\nI think people have to do self hope even when advised by lawyers who uphold the law that this is the only choice you have\nYeah just just as bad as\nWell you don't need to have the sympathy for a person who told\nMe they would just make sure we wish will come to America that's what the Trump ... and that's what was your door okay\nWell I Know that but I Would rather cuts black for a person who has twenty thousand dollars and tries to say but\nThen a multi millionaire who pays ... didn't believe he's still live with billions of dollars I have no sympathy for that because he's going to be wealthy whatever and the poor person you were saying it's good for the good good for the gander he's gonna be bankrupt and on the street\nYeah but the thing is what we're talking about is a and I think ... you you would totally agree we we I think we all share the idea that cheating is just wrong\nBut taking advantage of what is and clearly this is something that uh the the Trump's lawyer is saying about the the past dealings and ... and all this you know amount is that\nThey were just taking advantage of things that have ... that have been written into the law so um I you know there is a different steam cheating and and uh taking advantage and and then somebody who's just got the ability to really hire people accountants lawyers who really just make it their life's work to find these sort of niche areas where you can squeeze\nA squeezed piles as money into the cracks of the door and I think that that's a\nThat that has to do with legislations and that has to do with ah with with uh with crafting legislation and it has to do with having the money\nTo hire people to help you keep your money I don't think any of us are opposed to the idea I mean I think we all share the idea that we like to keep more of our money than a than we'd like to give to to to the government and giving it to the government the I've I've never had a problem paying taxes I\nI have a problem paying taxes when you know I'm making thirty thousand and suddenly I have to turn over nine thousand adamant that is a huge hit\nFor someone like me but uh but I have no problem with the concept of kicking in for the common good for roads for schools for police for fire\nBoy that would be so on so much that would be so unseemly mentioned I I Know what and and\nWhen we no longer can be because cancer will because you can't sue you're not going to do something whether it's true you don't want that way\nYeah I Know what you're saying but I I I get to a point thanks thanks for the call Mitch ... and so we're I guess that's where we're going now uh you know the wall Street Journal or the article I've never seen anything like this before I mean and I you know obviously I haven't been around for a hundred years not quite shy a few\nBut I've never seen a Supreme Court justice nominee ah right ah in any newspaper article or on the opinion in the wall Street Journal does Kevin wrote\nBasically saying you know he'd gone a little overboard he was very emotional blah blah blah he said I'm really you know independent even tempered you can count on me by the way it was really missing in that whole ... you know I'm sort of sorry I'm really a level headed guy never said a word\nAbout doctor for it you know\nAbout uh you know he ... about\nYou know the pain that that she was feeling and I you know if it happened to her it it just wasn't him whatever whatever he could have said he just was completely silent about it was all just about him him uh he was in the victim and him trying to explain that really had don't don't hold it against him he was just a guy who's\nFalsely accused and uh that's why he went off the rails he had his but he won't happen again you know and by the way it was too emotional he can have meant he was too emotional said things he shouldn't have said about his prepared speech because it was a prepared speech right to say that you were to emotional\n... it used to talk about how you have lost lost track of it you've lost your your your sense of\nOf propriety or your last sense of decency lost control the in the heat of the moment right sort of thing and that doesn't apply to a pre written statement that is just what he was thinking if that's what he's talking about now he may be talking about how he conducted himself\nWrote the op ed I'm says what abusers and drunk say I'll never do it again it's not me ... you know a\nA ... he's going to do it again and another first in the wool the Washington Post for the first time yeah mhm it took a stand and said he should not be nominated for the Supreme Court they've never had an issue where they talked about a Supreme Court justice\nAnd just the female artist going back to ... yeah or just a pool Stephen ... a retired Supreme Court justice said he should not be confirmed not because of the unpredictable allegations of his in his youth\nBut the course of his demeanor he can\nTo a pre written statement that is just what he was thinking if that's what he's talking about now he may be talking about how he conducted himself\nWill the op ed I'm says abusers of drunks say I'll never do it again it's not me ... you know there's a\nA he's got to do it again and another first in the wool the the Washington Post for the first time yeah\nMhm it took a stand and said he should not be nominated for the Supreme Court they've never had an issue where they talked about a Supreme Court justice\nAnd just the people are going back to ... yeah we're just a pool Stephen ... a retired Supreme Court justice that he should not be confirmed not because of the on approval allegations of his in his youth\nBut the course of his the meter\nHe cannot ever tell people you can't say\nThat it was a conspiracy it was revenge on the part of the Clinton [laughter] dark left wing money back send you a visceral site right that's not going to go away and that's why Justice Stevens for the Washington Post say he's not found out about the question of how brave or cow or to\nThe uh the people who voted mental\nYeah we're going to see Justice Stevens John Paul Stevens a retired justice by the way and and as we we're saying here that this is unprecedented for retired justice to weigh in on somebody else when people are calling it inappropriate oh blah blah blah folks get over it First Amendment rights [noise]\nUm and ah the fact demand matter is that this this man has first hand experience sitting on the actual actually sitting on the court he knows of what he speaks\nA Justice John Paul Stevens says quote they suggest he has demonstrated a potential bias involving enough potential it against before the court that he would not be able to perform\nHis full responsibilities and he said further more for the court for the good of the court he said it's not healthy to get a new justice that can only do a part time job [noise]\nUh so uh you know there are other lots of people weighing in but this these comments now uh have to do with temperament because as we know or the FBI investigation if you will follow follow up investigation really\nOr was it was very limited now the Senate is pointing at the White House the White House is pointing at the Senate saint who limited this to\nA interviewing the six witnesses or seven witnesses by the way not including judge Kavanaugh and a doctor for which in my experience having done you know criminal work and worked with ... and the FBI in the past to an over the last thirty eight years it's unprecedented if they can\nUh talk to somebody and somebody's willing to talk to them they do especially in key witnesses and these are key witnesses to not talk with them is just it it's just unheard of what it's not their fault the FBI\nWe know it it Dawn Dawn McCann who is shepherding a white having a loss to finish ... short you know he's ... he's in charge are telling you

first friday once again here's Sherry Gordon Esquire\nEverybody and I want to thank you again for joining me on the youthful for friday we're cutting the raising the age of criminality here in New York state and what that means is that we're basically not going\nTo treat our juvenile as adult we're going to recognize the fact that the children's brains just simply don't get formed probably age twenty five but right now and you're also going to be treated a sixteen year old not as adults\nAnd I want to hear from you miss the Jackson County attorney thought that what do you what is your department dealing and how do you get involved\nRight um what happens is we represent the county or the preeminent in family court when there's a juvenile delinquency charge was murdered was talking about adjustments it's an adjustment as unsuccessful kept referred to our office for juvenile delinquency tuition\nOr the ... the basis for all proceedings are but the responding to the new supervision treatment or conform and so we try and work through the family court to make sure that they get those services that they need to make sure they don't commit for credit charges are we talking about what we have everything from uh well\nIf they commit certain crimes serious crimes that goes a juvenile offender which poll was talking about\nBut we handle just about everything I'm from\nAnd I want to hear from unit Jackson County and he thought that what do you what is your department killing and how'd you get involved right um what happens\nIs we represent the county or the present in the in family court Mr juvenile delinquency charts was married was talking about adjustments it's an adjustment as unsuccessful could refer to our office for juvenile delinquency and\nThe ... the basis for proceedings are but the responding Indian supervision treatment or confinement so we try and work through the family court to make sure that they get those services that they need to make sure they don't commit from Atlanta Georgia we talking about what we have everything from uh well\nIf they commit certain crimes serious crimes that goes the juvenile offender which what Paul was talking about\nBut we handle just about everything I'm from\nYou know serious down to the pet larceny ... and a four person nations but has to be misdemeanor we're above and we generally handle them as juvenile delinquents\nWe had based on the line is that yes it is how you doing Hi Ben thank you for calling in who do you have a question for\nWell a gentleman from the district attorney's office\nSo that would be I think we all know now that I'm\nA firm probation is at hand but he only a couple\nOf questions if a person is arrested and initially charged with a felony or if it gets reduce coming misdemeanor poor and would it be sent down to family corporate Judy Judy ... and that's one thing but\nThe the thing to look through the definitions and some of the concerns about ah you're saying misdemeanors will now be handled in court you know like a class a misdemeanor assault\nThat can result in physical injury a that's a concern to people um you know when we when we talk about you know the kinds of people that are real family court already have a lot of on happy folks to begin with\nBut ah and and I know this may not be something you can comment on but there's been a big discussion show of moving about family court to an area wide across the street for Web bunch of senior citizen residences are and where we have our elementary schools\nAnd one of the concerns about raising the age is if you are now going to be handled class a misdemeanor assault cases\nAh that might be a concern for that but uh yeah the last thing maybe you can comment on a in a ... foot probation my understanding is that people on probation now or being charged to go see the probation officer\nOr like in the white cases in such a which I find rather troubling but a couple of conduct on on what I've just mentioned\nIs that if someone is charged with felony when it gets reduced to a misdemeanor what about the judicial hated as such in family court\nFirst deputy district attorney Paul known okay so let me ask a lot of multi part question so your your first question was um if it's a misdemeanor any all misdemeanors got a family or even even the salt in fact we had our but I think is our first\nA raise the age of rest yesterday in shallow but it's all three [noise] uh and that young lady will be going to family going I Hope\nI Hope the police correctly and I'm sure they did um but anyway so if if it is reduced as part of a plea agreement in huge part then it would probably the disposition would remain in the ... part of the superior court or as you know\nIf someone is charged with felony when it gets right to move it a shot in family court\nRight this is the first step in the district attorney Paul not okay so let me ask a lot of ... a multi part question so your your first question was um if it's a misdemeanor any all misdemeanors got a family court even even the assault in fact we had our but I think is our first\nA racy age arrest yesterday in Rochelle all three [noise] uh and that young lady will be going to family court I Hope\nI Hope the police hit it correctly if I'm sure they did\nUm but anyway so if if it is reduced as part of a plea agreement in huge part then it would probably the disposition would remain in that part of the superior court or as you know oftentimes someone maybe originally charge says a felony and then as a plea agreement with the reduced to a misdemeanor but I don't think\nThat if they knew that it would necessarily go to family court they would take the plane and and they use part I'm right I think yeah yeah we\nAlso have the um the possibility of a transfer\nRight yeah if we're if we're gonna yeah that's a good point well we can do is if it looks like early on that it's going to go a re reduced to a misdemeanor then we were transferred to cater to the family court and then the county attorney would pick it up a at that point so and then the disposition would be in the family family court and what happened on the Jackson\nWell we would go through at the same way we'd go through our current cases which as we have the same standard as the district attorney we have to prove it beyond a reasonable doubt on the differences we have charges nah the jury\nUm and then we would then referred to probation for what we call disposition a probation can make a recommendation for an determine accomplish that dismissal probation supervision um or conditional discharge or placement where we place to you\nIn a facility not at home where they would go for a limited period of time generally one year\nThe answer to your question though is we handle salts right now for Fifteen year olds um the sixteen year olds are going to be\nYou know relatively the same uh we're hopeful we have the ability to have orders to protection so obviously if there's something going on that we can make sure the charges of where to to get an order of protection and we try and protect our victims as much as possible\nUm [noise] the services that we get in family court or a really a broad spectrum of services we know probation have access to\nOwned her family court has access to a counseling services drug treatment will sort of in community services in fact a former commissioner who is in marriage a office started a program where we now keep or sex offenders in in community\nTo actually a system where two years of probation supervision to provide\nServices to that person so they understand what we call victim empathy making sure they understand the nature of yes versus no those type of issue is to make sure really correct the problem with the young in fact if judge black with calls and\nShe'll tell you that one of the things can hurt experimental youth corps to Mount Vernon she really wanted to have access to our services in family court so this legislation kind of gave her that opportunity\nTo that person so they understand what we call victim empathy making sure they understand the nature of yes versus no those type of issue is to make sure we really correct the problem rather young in fact if George black recalls and\nShe'll tell you that one of the things can hurt experimental News Corps to Mount Vernon she really wanted to have access to our services in family court so\nYou can always get it right the first time so our job is not to look for the one thing they do want it to look for the things that they're doing right we try and build on the strength and identified the needs and put in what's needed to make the case\nSo your department has more peels working on his shirt a commissioner posed a must have hired more appeal to deal with the juvenile um age group as as\nPart of three the age we hired ten additional probation officers but I think that the ... the what I like best about what she did he didn't put the new rocket rookies in\nWith family court he actually it's moving over the seeds into office or to work with the juvenile which I think we're allowed to read a book called the commission yeah I'm really our we're very lucky and what does the county attorney's office going about\nIt well we're we're we're of course some people would remain too but I think you know where I Want to get on with Mary there's a lot of the kids that we put on probation actually find it harder to be on the juvenile probation an adult dog they have a commitment that they require\nIn terms of counseling in terms of service in terms of reporting probation that is\nSignificantly more than what you would expect in it and just some adults with some 'cause we really try and George was tried wraparound services to those kids to make sure that they're getting what they need our goal is to keep these kids and community as much as possible we used to play some number of kids in facilities\nOn the form of social services the county attorney's office in Pomona probation\nWorked extremely hard to reduce the number significantly to keep the number of kids that are in our county from going to a facility whether it's in our county or outside of our county where working hard to get them services we need to keep them right whether or not that's working towards\nYou have any statistics any one of the department probation days off the county attorney's office on whether or not\nFor the past years is that the that that the rate of crime has gone down for juveniles or I mean the set of at the rate I should say you'd see the thing is\nThe rent is a little different from juveniles because what happens is once they get path or it used to be sixteen though it will be some pain in the middle\nServices accounting attorney's office some prominent probation\nHave worked extremely hard to reduce that number significantly to keep the number of kids that are in our county from going to a facility whether it's in our county are outside of our county when working hard to get them services we need to keep them ... where they are and that's that's what we're working towards\nAny ... any one of the department ... the top ... county ... going on whether or not\nFor the past year it's just that uh that the rate of crime has gone down for juvenile court I mean if I'm right ... you think ... or the divorce\nRate is a little different for juveniles because what happens is once they get ... used to be sixteen now it'll be Seventeen and then ultimately Eighteen but\nYou know that kind of changes because we don't see them past that um what I Will say though was that\nAlways working with policemen kids are kids that would have normally going into place from this dropped about eighty percent ... significantly ... the department of probation and the department of social services working together to really put service has a place to keep these kids\nAnd the community keep them in their schools provide whatever assistance they need and find ways provide assistance ... victims to make sure there are protected richer than we're giving everybody what they need but these kids eventually come back so the idea is to keep them where they are and and to try and fix the problems while go there\nIt sounds like ... three departments working with the same juvenile at the same time ...\nI mean two large extent you know it goes from probation tune the department of social services\nIn certain ... certain aspects the county attorney is just the the prosecuting attorney but once we get to disposition and when I say that I mean our our court we have in the ... which the same as the conviction\nUh then they have sentencing we have disposition broadest positions are designed to keep those kids there and it's been a large part two ... Rocco and\nUh the the ... assistant commissioner ... probation and you know all of our commission McGuire department social services to really keep the services to kids to keep them right where they are\nAnd so they don't if it was exactly the secretary so I\nIt's it's true I mean I I think a ... that's ... great description of\nWhat they try to do so that they don't graduate two more violent crimes and it's it's interesting um yesterday I was at the same thing for the day and I I go every year with our new eighty eight to five are training program and we spend a lot of time with the inmates\nAnd we said you know there's a group of and made ... as part of a program that we meet with and and\nYou know we talk about some ... some these are intimate who have been in since I was sixteen and state prison I'm there and for twenty five to life have their their ensure our founding murder murder manslaughter I mean they're in for a long time they've been in for a long time\nAnd they're very forthcoming because we talk about you know changing the system and and you know what what changed and some of them their parents were in jail and ... there's ... there's a cycle here that just continue ... head\nWhat break that cycle you know 'cause they talk about their neighborhood and growing up and they were dealing drugs when they were twelve and Thirteen and and they said well one thing they could do it when they are that young and the system do more with them to break this thing to get them to understand that these choices are fatal and that they they don't have to do this\nAnd they need to get the kind of programs that supplement which sometimes bad parents ... or no parenting um you know some of these kids don't want to go home they find gangs because the gang is uh\nWho have been in since they were sixteen in state prison I'm an air in for twenty five to life if their their ensure our founding murder murder manslaughter I mean they're in for a long time they've been in for a long time\nAnd they're very forthcoming 'cause we talk about you know changing the system and and you know what what changed and some of them their parents were in jail there's ... there's a cycle here that just continue to head what break the cycle you know 'cause they talk about their neighborhood and growing up and they were dealing drugs when they were twelve and Thirteen\nAnd and they said well one thing they could do it when they are that young in the system do more with them to break this you know to get them to understand that these choices or you know fatal and that\nThey they don't have to do this and they need to get the kind of programs that that supplement which is sometimes bad parenting or no parenting [noise] um you know some of these kids don't want to go home they find gangs because the gang is the word family or they don't have anywhere else so and these were inmates tank so we're going to talk\nMore about what happened at things from yesterday after the commercial break is about raising the age of criminality here in New York please call in with your question but nine months for\nSix three year old woman when they're out and joining on there that shouldn't look it department of probation Chinese off and the county attorney's office me Sherry Gordon on you to buy [noise]\n... here is the latest updates from Fox News radio\nFox News I'm Krista ...

actually when when you said off we go um I continued with the sentence if the wild blue yonder [laughter] which I actually wouldn't mind going [laughter]\nAh because in in this very moment um\nI'm feeling a tension and stress my body just just tension and stress of the day and realized that uh actually coming to the program was going to be sort of a nice little break to stop for a moment and perhaps be in the moment [laughter] [noise]\nUm so I'm going to get quiet here for just a moment if I may [laughter]\n[noise]\n[noise] no it's a guru I'd I'd like to just touch upon um stress\nAnd ah [laughter]\n\nThere aren't enough hours\nIt you know it was interesting the other morning I was out early I'm walking my dog and and that that was walking you know just thoughts sort of moving about and I realized my thought and that moment was gosh\nOur collective unconscious feels like it's so exhausted just in terms of where everyone is it's a rare that I speak to somebody\nWho's not feeling some degree and many are feeling a tremendous degree of stress um everyone seems to be fatigued [noise]\nAh I Know even just in my work environment everyone feels that they're stretched and at capacity\nAnd so as I was having this thought actually thinking about our collective unconscious I ran into another dog Walker and I think a morning how are you and and he looked at me and he died and he said\nI Am so tired [laughter] and so it just uh it I I laughed quietly not that it was a ha ha funny\nBut that gosh this is really where it seems that everyone is and just a you know I don't pay close\nIt's a rare that I speak to somebody\nWho's not feeling some degree and many are feeling a tremendous degree of stress um everyone seems to be fatigued [noise]\nAh I Know even just in my work environment everyone feels that third stretched and at capacity\nAnd so as I was having this thought actually thinking about our collective unconscious I ran into another dog Walker and I said good morning how are you and and he looked at me and he died and he said\nI Am so tired [laughter]\nAnd so it just uh it I I laughed quietly not but it was hot ... funny but that gosh this is really where it seems that everyone is and just a you know I don't pay\nClose attention to the news cycle because it is so draining but when I Do pay attention um it just feels that it's it's so taxing and again it's stressful so just feeling\nThat stress out there um even people driving people walking\nShopping just it seems that it's been difficult for people to just even connect everyone's everyone's in a hurry everyone's just moving moving moving to try to get to the next thing um and it just it creates\nAn environment that what I thought of today just in terms of where we are just exactly today with the cabin on situation is that I thought\nI really feel badly for our children a because\nThere aren't a lot of good role models out there and I don't think we're setting\nExamples of\nMorality of kindness and I know that I'm speaking in general terms but I just thought gosh the kids today what they're witnessing it's [noise] it's got to be so difficult and I I feel that we are really saying to them loud and clear\nI don't believe and now of course I Do have to also understand that there was nobody\nIn America who is not racist or husband hadn't been touched by wasted some on some level in their lives so that being said\nThe wheel grind fine and it's got to be a very difficult um\nLine to walk but until\nWe as individuals can begin to look at our deep\nFeelings and then ask the questions what are the belief that are attached to these feelings\nI think until we can look at that\nIn America who is not racist or husband hadn't been touched by wasted some on some level in their lives so that being said\nThe wheel grind fine and it's got to be\nA very difficult um\nLine to walk but until\nWe individuals' can begin to look at our deep\nFeelings and then ask the questions what are the belief that are attached to these feelings\nI think until we can look at that we cannot here as a nation and I think all of that is occurring right now and everyone's upsetting and their their dysfunction and their Hangst nearing society it's connected to on resolved\nFeelings of separation from love it's really that's the bottom line is when had boarded thrilled she just wants love I think\nWe need to really begin to look deeply and I think we are we're being made to look deeply to this cabinet situation and forward situation\n[noise] um what do we hold as valuable\nFrom what do we hold as goodness what do we want\nYou know is it money isn't money and fame is it love ...\nAnd it it can get complicated\nBecause there's so many layers to this aspect of ourselves we're talking about a mass movement within our thoughts in America into our unconscious and it's all coming out to everything that's occurring right now now his gun and I'm I'm realizing also that this is how God Knows the waters\nAnd how perfect in a way that is\nBecause we're becoming better from it I I Do believe we will\nNot much to say thank you very much [laughter] thank you so and so we go to\n\n\nTo everything that's been spoken about today there is a lot of stress um and there's a lot of tension there's a lot of um of people in the news it seems every day there's more and more um this\nHarmony and so I I guess the thoughts that I've been thinking about from the beginning of the program is from the\nWild blue yonder thought of trucks traveling getting away from it all to what has been stressing me lately and it's interesting that those two things have come together is the same thing because I'm planning a trip\nAnd that trip has become stressful for me that I haven't um travelled in many years I used to love it\nBut I've had a different type of um\nLifestyle you know being a mom raising kids and being sort of a home body to start now again to go and travel and this time it's a situation where I'm pretty much out of control I don't have um a lot of say so over the ah situation so it's created\nUm something for me to look at in terms of how much control do actually need can I just go along with the flow of things and just let it happen and see what I can enjoy in it and so um it's it's I'm bringing it to a personal level\nTwo things have come together is the same thing because I'm planning a trip and that trip has become stressful for me that I haven't um travelled in many years I used to love it\nBut I've had a different type of um\nLifestyle you know being a mom raising kids and being sort of a home body to start now again to go and travel and this time it's a situation where I'm pretty much out of control I don't have um a lot of sites all over the ah situation so it's created\nUm something for me to look at in terms of how much control do actually need can I just go along with the flow of things and just let it happen and see what I can enjoy in it and so um it's it's a bringing it to a personal level you know this is a feeling of overwhelming I'm\nA people to stress in the world um it's also in my thought but I'm also with time getting used to it and planning and saying that that can be you know fun it can be different um we'll see what happens but I'm looking forward to the freedom of getting away now\nWhere it's at the beginning I was like well I don't want to get out of my routine I don't want to do anything different I Want to be we're uncomfortable so it's about comfort zone for me I'm seeing where that comfort zone is and how it's changed over the years and now allowing myself to be in a new situation with new people and\nLook for the fun in it and see how good it can be\nSo that's where I Am I don't know um [noise]\nHow else it relates to the topic\nBut um those are just not yeah thank you thank you thank you I'm Wendy\nGo I I'm listening to everyone certainly relate to it all and um and grateful for the teachings in that you began is certainly made with meditation and how important now meditation isn't ever\nAnd how schools are beginning to pick up on it and more and more and certainly in my district where I Am talking about this whole mindfulness initiative both funny about that\n[laughter] is that as being handled through thoughts that require certifications and more stress [laughter] so it's um [noise]\nThe world it's just the world the world can seem very heavy at times and I'm nonsensical and did you go through without a foundation where there is a God\nAnd recognizing that not only is there a God if you can go there and your thoughts are certainly have the faith and trust to let it follow and unfold\nUm it helps to recognize also that it's ... all of what's happening is part of a divine plan to hopefully make us better people hopefully make me a better person\nThere's some things that you spoke about long long ago grew way way back it must have been\nTwenty years maybe Fifteen Twenty years ago and you talked about certain things that we're going to be\nVery much looked at in our society and number one was racism\nAnother aspect of it was um\nActually what I'm hearing right now is the role of male and female extremely important in terms of male and female and also you talked about um what you were hearing and that was looking at immigration looking at our borders and\nAll of what's happening is part of a divine plan to hopefully make us better people hopefully make me a better person there's some things that you spoke about long long ago grew way way back it must have been\nTwenty years maybe Fifteen Twenty years ago and you talked about certain things that we're going to be\nVery much looked at in our society and number one was racism\nAnother aspect of it was um\nActually what I'm hearing right now is the role of male and female extremely important in terms of male and female and also you talked about um what you're hearing and that was looking at immigration looking at our borders\nAnd several other things but was fascinating to me to watch how over time things unfolded to begin o and morality and and the idea that there is such thing as a law that there is law under God and there is such thing as a truth and that\nWithout moral understanding we lose our way to all of these things aren't folding and if I can get quite enough without moving into this\nGravitational pull on this wave of the outer world thought around what should and shouldn't be and I don't get as angry as I have been as well [noise]\nI can recognize that or try to recognize that a missile purpose\nAnd if I as an individual can grab onto a higher level of thought within it\nI can move to a place where not only do I gain understanding but I also gain awareness of the pro funded in the perfection of God trying to or working through man to show him that\nHe is so much more than he thinks he is that in ... he was born noble he's born of a divine essence he's born to become\nA manifestation of God's thought\nIn in a in a body that has to transcend its attachment to itself as a body and it sounds very ah can sound confusing but the only way this can actually be understood or certainly incorporated through meditation\nAnd so I I just returned to that at this time especially as I'm looking at the screens in watching 'em what's going on in the world and I'm Kevin off for all of that\nAnd just have to turn it over to God and say God you know best what to do and just show me my thought within this process so anyway that's my challenge to to get caught enough and not permit myself to be a stress is I've been over it was All right\nAnd I'm so glad you mentioned meditation because without it I don't know where our bodies would go stress would be a little too much to maintain so would you like to swing da da\nDa da da\n\nDa da da da da and dirty\nNothing not permit myself to be a stretch since I've been over it sounds All right and I'm so glad you mentioned meditation because\nWithout it I don't know where our bodies would go stress would be a little too much to maintain so would you like to swing non stop\n[laughter] follow [noise] yeah [laughter] well mine\nIs [laughter] show I ever find the right now\nWe can get lost on this unbelievable unknowing\nJourney that we've been barked upon\nTo understand something about ourselves better to go beyond the stress factor which can be a new one enormous you know\n\nYes that's\nSo embarrassingly after twenty some odd years I'm going to ask this question [laughter]\nSo you said it takes work what is the work\nThat the work\nStarts with a realization that work does not mean necessarily something negative [laughter] it means self application where ever we are\nIt means putting our hands to the plow and permitting us thought to dig deeper and deeper into the unknown\nEarth of so [noise]\nSo it's asking ask questions desiring to know number one\nAlong with that\nThe work ethic is the great great\nForce desire\nDesire that\nYou must cultivate over and over again\nTo help yourself to rise above the unknowable\nBut this country the pain the whatever the shame whatever you have\nDeeper and deeper into the unknown earth up so [noise]\nSo it's asking ask questions desiring to know number one\nAlong with that\nThe work ethic is the great great\nFor us desire\nDesire that\nYou must cultivate over and over again to\nHelp yourself to rise above the unknowable\nBut this comfort the pain the whatever the shame whatever you have put upon experiences in your life because what you put upon it doesn't necessarily mean it's the truth of it\nSo ultimately it's to desire truce more than you desire appearance [noise]\n\nAnd kids are not ... I think you answered the question that I was going to ask because it was around kicking it would be times you would say don't\nYou know with your thought going and try to to find find it the rather asking let it come forward and so that digging I misunderstood but that digging I think if I'm if I'm hearing this correctly or [noise]\nI I I'm not sure I guess I Need some clarity on that which is [noise] that digging is\nHaving an open heart to receive were ever to allow it ever comes forward to expose itself to you around your thought rather than you going in to pull it out\nLike he would it starts with the desire confronting the understanding\nThat you do not know that there is that which is within you that's greater than anything in the world and you do not know but\nThe digging has to do with I Want to know ... and there's the asking you have to believe in a higher knowing entity\nAnd allow it to bring in its own timing what needs to surface [noise]\nAnd so that said it's actually the desire and the heart to ask and it's passive at that point because now you're waiting for it to reveal itself to you so then you can be be brought into more understanding\nSay okay it's certainly been considered the greatest richer because it would only patients\nThat we can reap the rewards of wanting to know\nWhat you've been on the journey long enough to know that when you have vast mhm at a certain point the answers begins to surface and they may not have surfaced in the way that you have to seize they should\nBut those answers do surface and so if they surface at anytime it means the answers\nAre answerable finds that which is greater than the little I mhm mhm oh just one more part of that\nSay ... certainly been considered the greatest richer because it would only patients that we can read that were the rewards of wanting to know\nWhat you've been on the journey long enough to know that when you have\nVast ... at a certain point the answers begins to surface and they may not have surfaced in the way that you have to seize they should but those answers do surface\nAnd so if they surface at anytime it means\nThe answers are answerable finds that which is greater than the little ah mhm mhm\n[noise] and uh just one more part of that if I can [noise] and so most of it really\nAnd it goes back to what cow but photo around the discussion this morning with Bob is really on the unconscious level we ... most of what we do is motivated by the unconscious so using that example that was put forward can you have a cop\n[laughter] who the good cop and still racist well that's hard because the unconscious in going to surface a behavior or thought that hadn't been looked at the route itself so that we moved to la unconscious\nPrompt things\nThat have not been resolved and that then couldn't formulate our world and many many ways and so once again that digging is getting quiet because I Do not know means I Do not know that unconscious part of me that has taken on so much in has anger\nAnd hatch fear and has all of the things that can then come out in ways\nThat can be even fatal to myself for somebody else on the SCA can be\nBut we have to learn the courage to face whatever we have to face and yes those feelings sit there and you don't know what they are most of the time you don't you're not conscious of a lot of your thoughts\nAnd yet\nYou know you feel what you feel when you feel it\nAnd to deny that\nIs also a certain amount of self sabotage\nBecause I Believe that feelings I'm very connected to the intuitive part of ourselves which is a great teacher the sixth grade teacher and when you experience\nCertain strong emotional currents you don't pooh poohed\nYou don't try to analyze them either because you don't know the debt but you feel it your face it and you don't close to rise\nWith respect to it because at some point you're going fine that those feelings were probably very accurate and\nYou just didn't follow but we're taught feel strongly in order to assist us and understanding form an outer experiences in our world\n\nI'm\nOn a personal note I should just an example for the past like two weeks you speak about feelings on the uncut\nYou don't try to analyze them either because you don't know the debt but you feel it your face it and you don't close your eyes\nWith respect to it because at some point you're going to find that those feelings were probably very accurate and\nYou just didn't follow but we're taught [noise] feel wrongly in order to assist us in understanding form an outer experiences in our world\n\nYeah I'm\nOn a personal note to them as an example\nFor the past like two weeks to speak about feelings on the unconscious I had been getting dreams of spiders oh my God two weeks every night spiders on one level or another\nAnd I could not understand what it was I going to meditation have what is it was it and I hear ... from within\nUm just leave it alone you that's the question just leave it alone\nAnd\nRecently just came to me from within from hire mines tend to fear\nFear operating and it's around the maternal line\nAnd um\nBut then I only got that\nAnd you have taught us through the years to ask and then wait and then receive a writing\nAnd for myself that helped a lot and I'm Still unraveling just part of my unconscious that I'm not quite understanding what exactly it is\nBut I'm beginning to feel the understanding of what it is and since that has come to me the dreams have stopped and the the sleep has been much more peaceful\nBut it was only until after I began to open up that book so to speak or that you know that part of my thought\nThrough um a desire but the desire\nWould not conscious the desired came because I didn't want to be um agonized by these dreams anymore and you know and I realized that that's the failsafe system that we all have within are being built in to our DNA are ... are\nVery unfolding as humans\nAnd that is\nLike for instance to a woman so a friend would say to me why do I keep attracting the same guy over and over and over again and getting into these bad relationships well\nThat's the beauty of it so that eventually one has to say okay\nIt's enough I've had enough what is it I really need to know\nAnd I'm\nSo there's a beauty in that but in answer to to Stephanie's question one of the things that you've always taught us what is get quiet\nAsk an unleaded unfold\nSo there's a beauty in that but in answer to to Stephanie's question one of the things that you've always taught us what is get clients\nAsk and then let it unfold\n... his life very new ways\nWhen I did not hear\nThe day the CIA [noise]\nBut it all on the on the\nThe guilty or not [noise]\n\nFind and do you find ...\nHaiti\nAnd that love is who is really

the Trump voters if they come back out again it's likely that the Republicans will not only not lose the Senate but they will gain Senate seats and strengthen their majority so so\n... what do you do to suppress a Republican from turnout what do you do what you do is you try to get the Republicans to blow up their own Senate nominee [noise] so uh you know right now we're waiting to see how the Senate votes on culture today and how they vote over the weekend on the confirmation of Brett Kavanaugh\nAnd these last minute allegations I mean the Democrats I mean Trump wrote the book the art of the deal the Democrats should have a a book out called the art of ... the artist belief hit\nBecause their masters at it when you look at Trump's campaign in they threw out the bully Billy Bush tape from NBC that you know and right before the election and we were able to survive it\nUm you know it goes back to Bush were not two thousand they trusted drunk driving the Thursday before the election and nearly cost them the race\nA cost a lot of other Republicans the race that year I'd Arnold Schwarzenegger we're prepared for it they had a late hit the Thursday before the special election about stories about him groping whatever we were able to a muscle through that [noise]\nUm so the Democrats this was nothing new Kavanaugh was on his way to being a point all of a sudden I think it surprised a lot of Republicans that Democrats would play so hard and so ruthless to try to take the Senate majority\nThat'd be through this out there and what you're seeing in the polls right now is ... is Trump voters getting re engaged in the election before that like our last national poll on Thursday we uh we have it on line on our website McLaughlin online dot com\nI last national poll had or the Republicans down for the generic ballot had the president's job approval sliding into a forty six to prove from last month we had um a forty eight\nSo all the all the indicators war that the Democrats had more of an edge that's gone away the Rasmussen poll has the president's traveled through all of the fifty now\nAll the major pulses are reporting that huge generic ballot is closing for the Republicans so there's real enthusiasm\nAnd the danger is if\nThe Republicans don't get all fifty one votes together or fifty of those votes so that parents can can't tie breaker\nIf Kavanaugh does not get approved the ones who will be most disappointed\nAnd before that like our last national poll on Thursday we uh we have it on line our website McLaughlin online dot com\nI last national poll had uh the Republicans down for the generic ballot had the president's job approval sliding into a forty six the proof from last month we had I'm forty eight\nSo all the all the indicators war that the Democrats had more of an edge that's gone away that now ... Rasmussen poll has the president's channel for all of fifty now\nAll the major pulses are reporting that ... generic ballot is closing for the Republicans so there's real enthusiasm\nAnd the danger is if\nThe Republicans don't get all fifty one votes together or fifty of those votes ... tiebreaker\nIf cabinet does not get approved the ones who will be most disappointed will be Republicans and I'll be the ... the independents who voted for Trump and some of the may not come out again and that's what the Democrats are playing for so today and tomorrow those boats are critical\nSo that our base stays happy and the key for the Republicans to\nContinue to hold the house to pick up a more Senate seats ... the final four weeks to get our base that okay we just dodged the bullet but you know what's gonna happen over the next four weeks ... Nancy Pelosi's making a point of comes speaker the house Nancy Pelosi really believes that she you know we should end\nUm we should end ah you know employer paid health care we should end Medicare as we know where to go to the big government healthcare system we ought to end a lot of other things that Trump has done to make a stronger and guess what those Trump tax cuts they're making the economy ... record ... record levels\nWe honor roll those back and put back ... tax hikes and ... regulations and lose all the jobs that we've been gaining and go back to the way it was under Obama so that it is a real the final four weeks needs to be a real contrast election where\nAll the progress that Donald Trump has made the Republicans need to embrace it and point out the contrast with the Democrats\nJust hold on for a second season breaking news here ... the nation Senator Susan Collins ... Maine one of the undecided say she'll vote to advance cabinet nominations announcer confirmation decision well this afternoon okay I mean if you're gonna vote for advantage it's kinda hard to imagine\nThat she's not going to vote in favor of it have you read that\nI read it that she's ... she's under enormous pressure right now and uh all the feedback I heard yesterday yesterday morning I was in Washington to speak to the faith and Freedom Coalition are supporters and after my after I spoke a center gave ... produce folk and Senator Lindsey Graham spoke and uh\nThey were nervous about whether they would have the votes or they weren't sure but they were they we're cautiously optimistic because they had seen the FBI report\nAnd they said that there was nothing there that are there was nothing ... nothing was corroborate that's what made this this attack on Cavanaugh so sleazy\nI mean it was just ... who was no car operation there was no proof\nYou know even ... even worse than actually honestly now because what\nYou can offer enough corroboration didn't corroborate\nAnd in fact rejected the claim which suggested that she was lying or there's something ... something else going on there that we don't know about it but it's not simply know core operation they offered ... operation or preference ... uh ... operation blew up in her face\nRight and and and now you're seeing stories well this was coordinated with contact the center ... humans offers than refine things off your I mean they use I mean that that poor woman may I've actually had something really bad happened to her that affected her but they they used her\nThere was nothing new nothing was corroborate that's what made this this attack on Kavanaugh so sleazy I mean it was just ... who was no cooperation there was no proof\nYou know even even worse than actually on as we know because what you can offer doctors Corrado ration didn't corroborate\nAnd in fact rejected the claim which suggested that she was lying or there's some on something else going on there that we don't know about it but it's not simply no core operation the offered her operation or preference ... a ... operation blew up in her face\nRight and and and now you're seeing stories well this was coordinated with contact center humans offers Sarah find things off your\nI mean they use I mean that that poor woman um may I have actually had something really bad happened to her that affected her sure but they they used her she didn't want to public and they use er and they put this out there and they leaked it out there and there was this like I said it was a last minute\nSleazy ruthlessly hit and people are recognizing that four and Susan Collins to her credit you know ... or maybe you know more moderate than a lot of the Republicans there\nBut when she comes back and says there's nothing there that really I never really ruining this and you haven't charged with a great record\nI'm very qualified extremely well qualified a great record and had been pretty open minded on a lot of things that you can't pre suppose what he's going to rule in you know in the future on the Supreme Court for her to come back and say you know you know there's nothing there\nUm that's a pretty strong indication that uh uh this this was this was I mean this was really a a an evil thing that they did to this man and what they're doing to the country all in the relentless pursuit of control and power so it's it's a you know if you get Susan Collins\nThen I think we get Senator Murkowski and\nSenator Flake I Know there's enormous pressure being put on those three Republican senators either way we won't get any Democrats\nUntil we have the fifty or fifty one votes in place than we might get mansion Heidi Heitkamp a for North Dakota people speculated 'cause she voted for Gorsuch we're not going to get her she announced that and that's because she's down ten points so that they probably promising are some states landing after the Democrats have just you\nKnow when you hear him high when you use a description like a moderate Republican and sometimes you hear about moderate Democrats you assume or do you think that they send your years of knowing these politicians are working for many of them that they're genuinely\nModerate or do they just come from states where their survival depends on they're trying to please at least a portion of the voters from the opposing party or people who are on the other side of the political spectrum so that\nBeing a moderate is simply a a kind of um uh you know a calculation that said just a matter of expediency and not a matter of principle what's been your experience on that\nWill specifically with the center column about better before and I've never worked for about a matter of foreign talk to her\nAnd she's she's generally and fewer moderate that reflects what you would find in Maine you'd find these a moderate Republican New England Republicans up there and that's who she is and and I you know I I I think the one thing is her integrity or she's an honest I Believe he's an honest person\nWho uh when you when you think about what was the Democrats have done to capitalize this ... of you know an excellent judge what you've done to his family\nKnow what that's what I'm getting a job and it just seems to me moderate conservative liberal has no relevance to whether you think cabinet as qualified or not it should be an object of judgment on the facts and to me and I think that you as well especially for a Republican like Susan
