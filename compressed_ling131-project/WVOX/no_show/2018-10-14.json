thanks so much in Florida it's great to see you again and I am delighted to have received the sanitation I look forward to our time together\nWell we're certainly grateful and um but we'd like to do of course I realize you're involved with a wide range of of a a concerns and efforts are in in your in your work but one of them has to do with relationships between\nA Jewish and Christian and um I Know you've done and have had a lot of ah various programs here at Sacred Heart but I like to introduce topic to our listeners\nAnd so well maybe they just begin a discussion by just asking what do you find to be the important elements in Jewish Christian relationships\nWell relationships between Christians and Jews is critically important for a number of reasons one and we can talk about this a bit later there's a long history of hostilities animosity between Jews and Christians as it went on for centuries\nJob on the twenty third a ... as his relationship the same or or similar to drugs or or was he coming from a different perspective when when you thought of the ... commission\nWill see a a pull the six\nI'm Monte Carlo martini right he was a John the twenty third but it's only hope for three years right he began the council but it was pulled six to really carried it through that had to work with the aftermath of the cats\nJob on the twenty third or did he has his relationship the same or or similar to drugs or or was he coming from a different perspective when when you thought of the ... commission\nWill see a a cold is six\nI'm Monte Carlo martini right he was\nA John the twenty third but only hope for three years right\nHey began the council but it was pulled the six to really carried it through that had to work with the aftermath of the council\nA pull the sex was a very different personality I'm see roller when I spoke of the toy that there's something about his personal\nHabits like a minute to Santa Claus and that you saw him want to hug him and gives you your life [laughter] and you're throwing the dog to offer I met this guy was the type you eat it with you on the twenty third you cannot be afraid you're so close right\nI think by the way this is anecdotal the day after he was elected he was walking St Peter's Square\nA group of women said oh my God he is ugly [laughter] if you look at them and says it wasn't a beauty contest you know you had that kind of number for the sex was much more serious personality it was just it was a personality trait of his having said that\nHe was just as committed and see some of the structural changes which will I'm sure we'll get into his post conversation really came\nUnder his pontificate he continued um the energy and joined the twenty third began and he was equally as committed and it was pulled the six who created began to create structures to institutionalize if you will\nOur relationship with the Jews\nCame was more the thank are more than the uh low chin John the twenty third was barren spontaneous politics bought everything through a joined the twenty third used to call him my hamlet [laughter] because we agonize over things but actually went agonize\nHe would then come to his decision in the case of the June ... some very good choices [noise]\nWell isn't there in the document the Vatican two specific a document concerning Jewish relationships with Christian\nYeah the and that that's a great point Dorothy ... and this is important because it's really that document that got the ball rolling right of the document is called no strong Taipei\nMy which meant that same thing with with these documents I take the first to buy and words and that's what it means but very briefly\nIt was a watershed document\nI'd never to documents at the council that had to deal with our member station ship with other religions one once our relationship with other Christian religions which is not our purpose here today and the other was our relationship to non Christian religions much mostly it's hot date is which by the way\n... and a half hour and a five page five pages are packed\nWith a vision that is to set the church on a new path it for this sense you know straight talk today with a document says is is that\nAnything that is helping other people\nFor ... for us to buy and words and that's what it means but very briefly\nIt was a watershed document\nThat they were to documents at the council that had to do with our relationship with other religions one once our relationship with other Christian religions which is not our purpose here today and the other was our relationship to non Christian religions which ... which by the way\n... and a half hour and a five page five pages are packed\nWith a vision that is to set the church on a new path it for this sense you know straight talk today with the document says is is that\nAnything that is helping other people anything that's about the good anything that's about beauty\nWe're on our side right now so it's aimed at church we checked but only one who sent some of the good will checks no one wants to be involved with this we accept that taught me check you know this is new\nTown kind of very simple but it's there were opening doors right before the doors and windows were pretty shut it I'm not criticizing I'm just naming it but it's opening the doors wide open\nRight or to other members traditions now specifically talks about the heart of the matter it talks about\nOne of them it's just ridiculous and he even atheist by the way however in light of our conversation here the heart of the matter\nIn that document inside relationship with Jews and Muslims it's ... that's the heart of the tax civically in terms of the Jews opens up a whole new chapter not even chapter book that's opened in in that in the document\nNow you brought up that important issue between religious as between other religions Judaism but especially in Muslims 'cause you're right smack in the middle east now\nAnd are um diplomatic relations I guess are developing the logical and political a ... ... with the state of Israel\nI Believe those set Nineteen Ninety three um I guess a two prong question or how did that or what\nImpact that have in regard to our um the logical of political understanding of um being indicted or relating to a growing a sense of unity\nIn in what aspects that was maybe could talk about that but also what also did that mean to our relationship with the other Arab states um so so perhaps some but maybe beginning with Israel itself that idea of establishing diplomatic relations ... what impact that that have in regard\nTo uh uh yeah right now we're going into the politics you know and my mother used to say we don't argue religion or politics or anything that comes into the frying pan [laughter] I read the frying pan we have both been here for ... for this this this is now moving into the political dimension and of course\nIn a positive sense or the church has a political agenda because ah the Vatican is it's a country of people to stay because ... so the fact that we would open up relationships or a a a structural political relationship with Israel\nUh at the state of Israel now\nStates um so so perhaps some but maybe beginning with Israel itself that idea of establishing diplomatic relations ... what impact that that have\nIn regard to uh uh yeah right now we're going into the politics you know and my mother used to say we don't argue religion or politics or anything that comes into the frying pan [laughter] I read the frying pan we have both been here for ... for this this this is now moving into the political dimension and of course\nIn a positive sense or the church has a political agenda because ah the Vatican is it's a country if you go to ... so the fact that we would open up relationships or a a a structural political relationship with Israel\nOr at the state of Israel\nYou know this is a side point which cannot come back to\nWhich is opposed to include the Palestinian territories see now that's very complicated and the fact that if you if you're interested in I I Do a lot of work in that area but to states that stay on message here that the opening up of of the language Nineteen Ninety three right\nNow the church has a formal relationship\nWith the government of the state of Israel and so in Nineteen Ninety three we open up an embassy there like any other country would have an emphasis the embassy we we now know embassy so significant that in Nineteen Ninety four but uh the uh Israel\nUh went to the Vatican and the way they have an embassy there as well so we have a diplomatic relationship\nOr with the state of Israel so a father re ... the the diplomatic relations um was important for for many reasons prior to Nineteen Ninety three the app colleague delicate\nA teacher who slum and Palestine the pope's representative\nTo that part of the world was to both um are we supposed to Jerusalem and Palestine you wanting both right\nTo also there is the Latin patriarch of Jerusalem right and so the patriarch also\nIs representing the pope and there was also the custodian of the holy land a princess ... so he had those those three structures if you will that represented the Holy See right\nSo now in fact those street structures are still there\nBut now with diplomatic relations being open we have now it it's a unified effort and that in fact we have an actual diplomat appointed by the holy said that they both have their\nUm the the post representative it isn't just that they have to solve their hands and not see all the special delicate of the Holy See a tremendous real [noise]\nSo what it does is that it gets into 'em in the logical and a political motive action All right so there isn't a theological issue that comes into play about our acceptance of the Jews and the Jews accepting us\nBut it also get into the politics of Israel\nRight in terms of its relationship to the United states but more importantly a relationship to Palestine I uh and and especially to fast forward on that that's become more complex and so the Holy See Rome or Holy Father\nHas to have to juggle both right and we also now it's separated we also have um a\nDelicate of the Holy See a tremendous real [noise]\nSo what it does is that it gets into 'em in the logical and a political motive action All right so there isn't a theological issue that comes into play about our acceptance of the Jews and the Jews accepting us\nBut it also get into the politics of Israel right in terms of its relationship to the United states but more importantly a relationship to Palestine\nI uh and and especially to fast forward um that's become more complex and so the Holy See Rome or Holy Father\nHas to have to juggle both right and we also now it's separated we also have um a Palestine\nA representative to the Holy See and see now that's a bad rep Palestine as as as a separate from Israel because they're two separate entities side by side so bad that there's a deep complexity of all of this I think it's important to name this has implications\nFor world politics and much of our life today especially post nine eleven world\nBut that amazing that these three religions live side by side because they didn't have the wailing wall you have a whole except for a church and then you have a lot from a Muslim and they're all be twenty five steps from other\nOf of great to worse than gold\nParishes even though the play by fire may result in praise glory an honor when Jesus Christ is BP better
