say okay let's get to Labor Day let's get to Columbus Day let's get the Thanksgiving and then Thanksgiving Christmas New Years\nAnd then you know then you have the winter which is a little a little bit of a long drag\nWhile I I think so let me ask you something to you in in in teaching the students radio and broadcasting in journalism are they willing to put in the work do they know that this is a business that requires awesome amounts of work just to get to the first wrong and how did they react to that\n[noise] Bob it's a great question it's it's something that I deal with on a daily basis I Try and stress to them the amount of work that needs to that goes into this career\nSome get it some don't some just like they have to show up to class and\nThat's not the way it's done 'em and the ones that are you serious about their careers are the ones that I invest my time and the others I just make sure they they show up to class they do the work and\nI can only do so much in the biggest

W. F. M. and\nI'm ... you had to be dedicated and I remember you know Dave Harmon had it's certainly a checkered past before passing away\nBut I remember him saying on the air you\nKnow this business ... it has to be more important than your own mother and boy was he true about that because it for myself I have to go up to Toronto for about five years I Know I was away from my family for a while my mother wasn't well it's just you know something you have to sacrifice and it's hard personally\nThat they have in this manner as you would make it very clear that this is unacceptable and you figure out what actions that then the United states or NATO has to take as a result and you know the president has given lip service to the idea that you know he wants to know what happened it's\nUnacceptable but you know in typical fashion the president seems to think things are more transactional on the foreign staged um and and you know has a very little you know philosophical\nWrote a philosophical or ideological you know\nMeetings in these things and and I think that's gonna come back to be a real problem for him and for the United states\nAs a whole but I Do think there are things that he could do but the first thing he needs to do is to demand that we get to the truth and for him to come out and be sort of acting like the PR firm for you know the Saudis yet unacceptable and you know\nAsking this excuse me professor I'm Sorry about asking the Saudis for the true Susan's are Connell like asking the devil to say math\nWell [laughter] you know I I I think you know ... it may be the case but I I think the fact\nIs the United states and president\nThis say that we demand to know with the rest of the world community what happened to this journalist um it is not a hard thing to say and what the president shouldn't be saying is using trial balloons outside the White House outside the rose garden\nTo say oh you know this is what I was told may have happened he should let Saudi Arabia\nFor the United states as a whole but I Do think there are things that he could do but the first thing he needs to do is to demand that we get to the truth and for him to come out and be sort of acting like the PR firm for you know the Saudis yet unacceptable\nAsking us excuse me professor I'm Sorry about asking the Saudis who the true Susan's are Connell like asking the devil to say math\n[laughter] well you know I I I think you know it it it may be the case but I I think the fact\nIs the United states and president\nThis say that we demand to know with the rest of the world community what happened to this journalist um it is not a hard thing to say and what the president shouldn't be saying is using trial balloons outside the White House outside the rose garden to say oh you know this\nIs what I was told and they have happened he should let Saudi Arabia gave us the facts as they are willing to give them and then we can make a determination with NATO in the rest of the world community as to how to respond I'm ... so there\nAre ways to do this and you know I Do think that there are other concerns than those concerns for economic and those concerns are certainly um you know in terms of allies and other things I'm not suggesting that this should you know over\nRight every other relationship we have with Saudi Arabia but I think we also have to take a stand and I would say you know\nIt the CEOs of major corporations can take a stand I think the president the United states can take one as well it's not easy for those those corporations either I mean distancing themselves from Saudi Arabia they will lose money I mean but in in most cases that's that's that's what happened that they've done it\nIsn't it of course those Saudi Arabia just got caught by me they'd been slaughtering civilians in Yemen for a couple of years now\nAs you can see I got out of mud bonded over this country and to get away with so much I mean well what a diplomatic be saying to the Saudis you know you got to get away with it to cover all boats next on black ops shouldn't read this transparent [noise]\nYeah I mean day to day gotten away with it you know we ... it ... countries around the world stage including the United states are guilty of horrific crime is absolutely true and you know that\nSaid when we have an instance in which it is you know it's unfortunately we don't always know and they are covered up better than this one was apparently but that doesn't mean that because of that we say with an incident at curves\nWe're we're not going to care because it's happened in the past and we ourselves may have been guilty or Nathan guilty in the past you know we have an obligation and\nYou know this is again I mean we have to reiterate this is a western United states journalism you living in the end I ... I had a country in the country killed in the conflict of Saudi Arabia\nOr yes but here you are talking about principles and what has become the most principled administration and the history of the

takes three six zero\nSee we have research\nA theory phones sixty one year old sixty six zero\nOne one zero general bell and the other side of the glass you set the agenda we threw out a few topics but whatever you want to talk about including what you might do if he wins a billion dollars going to end up being a billion dollars by Saturday I Am going to own the station and the team\nThey sit on the line ... good morning and thank you for calling everybody to well what did you think we got that most that I told you leave a cat I just had it in front of me but say you about the mood of the court\nWell I haven't I haven't seen the numbers yet but you were saying that the thirty year ... is a problem road was what was it ... some six million something\nNo I don't know what do these things but the estimated project cost over Thirty years is forty two point five million dollars I'm assuming it includes the\nOkay the peso forty two million over\nForty three point five ... years\nAnd what was that the stop and shop\nOne I like the three point seven million dollars over the years\nWe right now the the stop and shop there does that include renting the entire space of sticky nine thousand square feet and it it doesn't break it down\nIt doesn't say that but those are the kinds of questions that I Will ask the total ...\nWhere do you see that's critically important a sport it sounds like your last caller seems to know about what we're at these numbers are being derived from but the thing is this\nA if over Thirty years the additional cost is ... is say you know Fifteen million or so uh [noise] I I Would suspect that\nMany folks around would say that's inappropriate allocation of funds for a truly a visionary redevelopment of our core of our downtown\nWill do lists that I'm not going to restaurants because you know this thing I just want to add something else to keep up with something you don't go blindly that may also them would it not make the case for garden street which is vacant land and you could form the court any way you want for the mayor probably forty nine point seven million over Thirty years\nWell see ... that's another thing but you see a sometimes on a are you are you do find it curious that when people want things to go their way who more or less on the left then all of a sudden they become fiscal conservatives\n[laughter] that's true you're say that's a that's a rather interesting dynamic but I I don't think the citizens in New Rochelle\nOr Westchester County at large ah would object to the idea of spending a few more dollars over an extended period of time\nFor what the elected officials of our town want and what appears to be the actual best site according to Mr Friedman the gentleman who was charged with looking at these things as I said he can speak for himself\nBut when he was gracious enough to return my call the status I told you earlier well you know Mr Mao for channel decided to stop and shop here is much better site but we don't want to pay for sixty nine thousand square feet so I'd like to know what those numbers for\nMe I I went over to town and see if it splits space or the whole time we will I Will call the or the county executive directly\nWell uh you know maybe Mr Friedman is I don't know who's ... is the county executive actually involved in this\nOut in the eye and I am ...\nThen the period of time for what the elected officials of our town want and what appears to be the actual best site according to Mr Friedman the gentleman who was charged with looking at these things as I said he can speak for himself\nBut when he was gracious enough to return my call the status I told you earlier well you know Mr Mao for channel decided to stop and shop here is much better site but we don't want to pay for sixty nine thousand square feet so I'd like to know what those numbers\nMean I I went over to town and see if it splits space or the whole ... and we will I Will call the or the county executive directly\nWell uh you know maybe Mr Friedman is I don't know was it is the county executive actually involved in this\nOut and bomb the eye and I am speaking from a memo from the county executive to Mr Friedman based on research\nSo uh he he he's the one is likely to know I mean I'll call middle to whoever I have to call because I went to your question and and let me just waiting for the audience a little bit because they may not be as happy as you are a lot of times numbers are presented folks and this would be your contention and understandably\nIn a way that favors and how come that the officer on\nAnd so sixty three point seven million or could be we're not saying that it ... it could be a result of the entire space rather than one half the space which is oh that would be needed because even in the preamble teases matters\nWhich does the assessment\nUh the minimum of thirty two thousand square feet of space maximum thirty five thousand square feet he's one of the parameters\n[noise] right well you know interestingly enough uh when I spoke with Mr Freeman rights for Mr Friedman I\nDidn't get a chance to go back and look at the June twelfth meeting you had with judge David sitting in your team with the city council but I seem to recall judge Davidson telling the mayor and council that the family court needed forty to fifty thousand square feet\nAnd he says no we only really need thirty five pounds and I said well if I met ... correctly or the judge I guess there's wrong but I guess she wasn't speaking with you or a or the people who know but I Would suspect the judge\nOr knew knew what she was talking about uh so it's an interesting dynamic but you know or we're going to see how this goes\nWell we're gonna play on it but I Do want to go back to something to you elect say these numbers are on the spot all other than where I'm going\nTo come to compromise and and again I don't have a horse in this race I'm just presenting this garden street fake inland do it the way you want a valuable to begin construction little lake those September to Nineteen forty nine point seven million that's the only another five million as opposed to Thirteen million why not do that\nWell that that is a is an option I Would consider over ... Singh ... road of the three is the worst choice\nFor many many reasons its waterfront property it's across the street from a nearly a thousand or more vulnerable senior citizens there's only one bus line that goes there periodically\nThan it's right near a junior high in elementary school and to the people who say family court is not a real problem as I said to her doctor will break from the guinea pig and city council well Dr Wolff right maybe you can ask the court officers to not go there with guns I said why do you think the officer\nRecord will always have guns that the state law they have to\nWell it's not the reason why they have scanners and guns is because courts can sometimes have people who are in conflict you're going to lose your kids\nIs that is an option I Would consider over ... Singh ... three is the worst choice\nFor many many reasons its waterfront property it's across the street from a nearly a thousand or more vulnerable senior citizen there's only one bus line that goes there periodically\nAnd it's right near a junior high in elementary school and to the people who say family court is not a real problem as I said to her doctor will break from the beginning she paid city council will ... will right maybe you can ask the court officers to not go there with a gun I said why do you think the ...\nRecord will always have gone back to the state law they have to you know\nThey look and that's the reason why they have scanners and guns is because courts can sometimes have people who are in conflict you're going to lose your kid while\nBe habits in the ... the real downtown Howard Stern street ice Koch usually cost more per square one then something I'm ... so that's all I was saying that ... and I and I think any any to call you up with you know\nThat I Want to put down the questions using I presented swelling last caller because now no less what comes full disclosure I have I Am a moron when it comes hoping it offend anybody\nI'm a moral when it comes to real estate but at some [laughter] I heard you generally agree\nUm [noise] it seems to me\nThat if we're redoing the downtown but this is just total naked thing I Want your response to it I it seems to me when we do in the downtown when moving city hall when moving the police station we may we may lose the courthouse we are building a robot central downtown\nBut the compromise seems to be hardened street we get a whole brand new court in a brand new downtown for only about not any more but a couple of bucks more why not do that\nWell first of all I don't know if the courts are willing to wait [noise]\nUh and you know I don't know if they still that is the best but that's okay what do you have some qualification say and got\nThe problem load is waterfront property\nIt's true it's true it's not owned by the ... the man now owned by a private citizen who says I Want to get the best you turn on my investment so he doesn't care yeah he's got to say you're going to pay me more made maybe just a few dollars more the water\nBut he wants the best investment shall we you know the fact that I just wonder if we don't get to pick and choose what would be the most that they're not\nAnd I'm going to do this for a little a pepper\nIn New downtown for only well not any more but a couple of bucks more why not do that\nWell first of all I don't know if the quarks are willing to wait [noise] uh and you know I don't know if they feel that is the best the best okay what do you have something called a suitcase saying that the problem load waterfront property it's true it's true it's not owned by the ... the\nIron Man now owned by\nA private citizen who says I Want to get the best you turn on my investment so he doesn't care yeah he's got to say you're going to have more made maybe just a few dollars more the ... but he wants the best investment show we you know the fact that I just wonder if we don't like to put you to choose what would be the most\nOut and I'm going to throw the for little or pepper to this food is this meal at the end of the Lacey Pete should've kept their nose out of it\nWell I yeah again I I'm not sure I Know you've been got up and I'm not sure\nI'm bringing it on that because they made a big case about it as if somehow this was an eye on it\nI I understand that I I guess I don't know you know Mr my attitude is I I Would suggest that it be as close to the other city to city court it's possible to me that that seems to be the best location like\nYou know what what we think is the best location may not the cause of all possible\nBut I think everybody seems to be an agreement that you know if if you could pick and choose print it put it right as close to a city court as you could possibly by the way you just step that we might lose Judy collect not happening my family paid about thirty million\nDollars I thought you were talking about just OK okay and I don't know like that and I kept city always moving\nGod yeah I won't be okay or anything else before we send you on your way and I L A general\nBobby I'm just waiting for you to win that million dollars and and take me out to lunch\nI Will I Will take every every regular call

President Trump in the election and most recently he's refused to where he did refused to say that he thought that Brett Kavanaugh's should or should not be confirmed\nTo the U.S Supreme Court not exactly would you expect from a Republican candidate well this morning\nHe was quoted in the city paper\nA and I treated out a link to it under the heading you can't make this stuff\nUp he was reported to saying mile an arrow this was a report mowing arrow called\nFor a less heated rhetoric then he found quote in Donald Trump's America close quote and more of what he called the quote let's find some some commonality of Iraq Obama's America\nSo you have mowing arrow praising Obama conditioning condemning Trump putting aside putting aside the fact that Obama certainly up to the time of Trump or was arguably one of the most divisive\nPresidents in American history and really one of the reasons if not the key reason Donald Trump got elected president and it was because of the anger so many Americans felt towards rock Obama and his policies well just a few minutes after right\nUh and I tweeted out a link to it under the heading you can't make this stuff up\nHe was reported to saying mile an hour oh this was a report now and they're all called for less heated rhetoric then he found quote in Donald Trump's America close quote and more of what he called the quote let's find some some commonality of Iraq Obama's America\nSo you have fallen arrow praising Obama conditioning condemning Trump putting aside putting aside the fact that Obama certainly up to the time of Trump or was arguably one of the most divisive\nPresidents in American history and really one of the reasons if that's a key reason Donald Trump got elected president was because of the anger so many Americans felt towards rock Obama and his policies well just a few minutes after I tweeted out or that quote from a newspaper in New York City\nI did hear it was unusual for mowing arrow themselves than usual and that he sent me a direct message via Twitter\nAnd he said this quote justice and therefore I wasn't what I intended to say I was speaking more about the tone of both the public and how the Democrats were at least not so outlandish\nDoes better than other states and that's again reflected the demographics are reflective of the population\nWas talking of course the state controller Tom than athlete just a final question is if I could I'm Brock Obama Democrat was president for eight years the Democrats control the Congress for several of those years and certainly historically Democrats have been in a position to address this kind of concern\nWhy do you think that this imbalance as you describe it or is that many of described it exists why hasn't it been corrected or is it just a simple matter of fairness that states like New York that have an unusually large number of wealthy people and successful companies wind up paying more because we ended up and progressive system or taxation\nI think that's a piece of it I I actually think that's the piece I think the other piece of the\nThe reality is is the nation's population has changed the political clout has certainly moved away from not just New York you know Massachusetts New Jersey Connecticut other states for that but don't fare so well in terms of this relationship as well\nSo I think it's been ... partially because of of of of of losing some cloud and I do think one of the reasons why the numbers got a little better it is in this report versus the year before is that health care particularly as you know it was a priority of during the Obama years and more money coming in through Medicaid program\nYou described it exists why hasn't it been corrected or is it just a simple matter of fairness that states like New York that have an unusually large number of wealthy people and successful companies wind up paying more because we ended up and progressive system or taxation\nYeah I think that's a piece of it I I actually think that's the piece I think the other piece of the reality is is the nation's population has changed the political clout has certainly moved away from not just New York you know Massachusetts New Jersey Connecticut other states but don't fare so well in terms of this relationship as well\nSo I think it's been ... of of of of losing some cloud and I do think one of the reasons why the numbers gone a little better it is in this report versus the year before is that health care particularly as you know it was a priority of during the Obama years and more money coming in\nThrough Medicaid programs through child health plus subsidies and the central plant that I think that's partially accounts for why the trend is going up so I mean my concern is in terms of where we're headed for the future particularly depending on the outcome of the elections this year what where will that leave New York in terms of of\nWho's representing us which party will be in control a you know both New York and and now the northeast states or what will be the political dynamic as you know in\nIn my my other reports on the budget one of the big risk we always point to is is what will be the impact of federal spending particularly on health care\nWhere we've leverage is a lot of money and if that changes that will that will certainly disrupt our finances in New York so you know that's absolutely a concern and\nYou know we put out a report not that long ago showed that the number of folks without health care coverage has been cut in half over the past decade percentage wise in our state because we benefit from these program so I I I Do have a concern you know moving forward as to what the impact will be and besides the obvious concern is the economic cycle where you know where where is that all headed\nAnd a lot of time to do with the federal deficit obviously part of how they're paying for the tax cut his\nIs with an expanding federal deficit you know the the old a deficit hawks if you will on the Republican side seemed to have disappeared or at least been quiet but to to cover that deficit will that mean cuts to programs that states like New York depend on and that's the big question mark and to to be determined post November sex I think\nYou touched on something that is very important it's not necessarily just a partisan divide\nThat accounts for what you're describing in his report on New York's sending more money to Washington and it's a regional divide and out of power and you're used to be number one of the nation of population our number four\nWe used to have what forty seven or forty eight Congress members now we have now twenty seven twenty eight and we're going to lose them so it it's a regional desires as much or maybe more oh what do you think that in a part of that one\n[laughter] yeah no I think you're absolutely right I mean ... that's why the concern ... when we do have people moving out of the state that's considered part of what keeps us you know you know somewhat stable and with a little bit of growth is the fact that we still have a tremendous impact from immigration you know and and and you know I've been [noise]\nYou know reminded as they travel to in many upstate counties in recent weeks or you know sometimes people think of the\nYou know the the the ... the melting pot of folks coming in like New York's everybody goes to New York city well you travel across upstate whether it's a city or a small town or the diversity is all over our state and in some neighborhoods I think I'm particularly the\nCity of you to cut its been really the immigrant population that's come in to many neighborhoods where you had a lot of vacant homes and decrease population and they've been the one ... been revitalizing neighborhoods but\nHad it had it not for the impact of of of of new folks coming into the state we'd be even in a in a worse condition in terms of that uh impact on our political representation and that's a concern moving forward\nHeard from a listener who says based on an apple Ethan Allen says Trump's tax cuts should help reduce what New York's tends to the federal government\nDid as they travel to in many upstate counties in in recent weeks a you know sometimes people think of the you know the the the ... the melting pot and folks coming in New York's everybody goes to New York city well you travel across upstate whether it's a city or a small town of the diversity is all over our state and in some neighborhoods I think particularly the\nCity of Utica it's been really the immigrant population that's come in to many neighborhoods where you had a lot of vacant homes and and decrease of population and they've been the once been revitalizing neighborhoods but\nHad it had it not for the impact of of of of new folks coming into the state we'd be even in a in a worse condition in terms of that impact on our political representation and that's a concern moving forward\nJust heard from a listener who says based on an Applebee's and Alice is Trump's tax cuts should help reduce what New York's tends to the federal government and he also says that Trump's economies making things a lot easier in New York worried about that kind of observation\nWell I don't I don't think I Would go that far it's clearly say yeah we have to give them more time to see what the impact of the the tax cut will be\nAnd uh you know it's too close to election day and I'm Still a Democrat in France you know I don't want to get an a part of the debate of one of the Trump is is is good or bad obviously a way to me I I I Would have some concerns about the policy that has that helped me here especially on health care I mean that's the way you know to repeal the Affordable CARE Act\nThat would really disadvantaged real people in New York but putting aside the state in terms of dollars come again so I you know I I think you know some of what\nUh the reality is is that he's not been able to Institute of complete agenda so I I worry about who's going to control Congress and what kind of power will have to implement everything that he hasn't been able implemented I think some of that will be very hurtful to New York\nI was saying wait a minute wait a minute and not because of anything you were saying other than you are saying that\nIt's right before the election and you're not going to weigh in on something that might be positive for Trump that it was going to say wait a minute it didn't stop mark mowing arrow from repeatedly attacking Donald Trump what do you make of that as recently as this morning he was quoted as saying this is it in New York City ... corner they're saying that\nThe Obama administration had a more a a kind of friendly tolerant climate and the nation and the Trump Administration and before that he wouldn't endorse Brett Kavanaugh and he said he hadn't voted for Donald Trump I mean this is a Republican candidate for governor\nYeah well you know I don't I don't want to I don't want to mix in the Republican politics I think it's fair to say the polls show that Trump is not particularly popular in many parts of New York state and he's trying to appeal to a base you know beyond just Republican voters so a\nReally good they only in aiding his own party on\nWell that's always that's always a challenge right you you you need to keep your own base but certainly from the Republican prospect of talk about shrinking ah numbers you know it's clear Republican can't win or New York just with the Republican base\nYeah I'm sure you've heard the conservative party ads have you heard them which kind of a ... and it says\nWe support conservative support Donald Trump were supporting the conservatives' ... mile an arrow book from all an arrow in the conservative party line ignoring the fact that mowing arrow had didn't vote for Trump and his proudly or other that well\nBut that's all about getting the fifty thousand or or as much as they can to I mean look the conservatives have bad rosy for a long time I'm sure they they they want to not only get to fifty thousand but get enough votes to still be rosy that enhances their leverage\nYou know especially in the year like this where a lot of people are expressing concern about the whole fusion\nProcess that we have in New York state so I think that that is less about the substance of more about branding and and saying you know hey you know remember us on on roe see an end to the extent that they their base probably has a lot of Trump supporters are rather have\nThe Republicans who support Trump vote on row seat to help them as far as ... position about access than ah than just photos\nSporting the conservatives have already marked on an arrow vote for mile an hour on the conservative party line ignoring the fact that mowing arrow had didn't vote for Trump and his proudly other that well\nBut that's all about getting the fifty thousand or or as much as they can to I mean look the conservatives have had rosy for a long time I'm sure they they they want to not only get to fifty thousand but get enough votes to still be rosy that enhances their leverage\nYou know especially in a year like this where a lot of people are expressing concern about the whole fusion\nProcess that we have in New York state so I think that that and is less about the substance of more about branding and and saying you know hey you know remember our son on roe see an end to the extent that they their base probably has a lot of Trump supporters are rather have\nThe Republicans who support Trump vote on row seat to help them as far as ... position a ballot access than ah than just vote on the Republican line I'm I'm not predicting about what was the year that\nWe're in ... almost went down to see what he was going to be like that but uh I'm sure they're trying to boost their numbers that's what that's about\nAll the time that apple is that controller who is known for being a pretty candid politician in this day and age in New York state in my view that's really something to value or you're not sweating your campaign I take it you think you're in pretty good shape\nWell you know [laughter] I've been to the campaigns are are you know what a particular I thought it was a show or whether it didn't work out and and I've been to get paid for I figured this is never going to happen in the dead so\nI you know the challenge for me now is that we're very busy with the job so I haven't practically have as much time to do the outing out campaigning that I Would would perhaps would normally do but I'm also the opinion when you're in office if you're doing a good job that's going to be your best to your\nBest advertisement for why should get reelected and uh it's a good year let's just say Fred generally speaking it's a good year to be a Democrat in New York state so I think we're in good shape\nLet me know that at times an athlete comes out of Long Island he was in his own and then from Nassau County certainly knows Long Island and now so politics very well with that his back and let me just ask you quickly if I could ask you to be as Canada's you could be how likely do you think it is\nThat your party the Democrats will take over the state Senate and to do so of course they'd have to win a few seats on the island and what's your sense of what's happening there\nYeah a lot of activity I'm more races that are competitive than I can ever recall the first thing they have to do on Long Island is defend the Brooks seat that was kinda upset of two years ago when he was elected to a ... a south shore seat [noise]\nUh I think that's a very close race uh but I think people like John Brooks has gotten to know him and then you certainly got you got the open seat the coaches seat that's become very competitive um the Marshall Leno's see there's been a lot of attention Jim Gordon is a democratic candidate he's raised a lot of money in the rematch\nFrom two years ago when it was a very very close race I think that I'm\nNot convinced ski a is safe he's the Democrat that has ... seats\nAnd where I live on the north shore a link filled sources on a caplin that seat probably has the most Democrats of any of them are very competitive race or both candidates working very hard\nJust Long Island along get to the balance right there you don't want the races that we just went went through the primaries indicative of democratic energy um I think it'll be a good night for Senate Democrats\nBut it still remains to be seen the elections about three weeks away\nParticularly in some of the you know more urban districts the primaries often already decided the outcome I'm concerned about what democratic turnout will be in some of those areas you've you've got a competitive race in Brooklyn to for the state Senate which was somewhat unexpected a few months ago so\nHard just Long Island along could tip the balance right there you know what the races that we just went went through the primaries indicative of democratic energy um I think it'll be a good night for Senate Democrats but it still remains to be seen the elections are about three weeks away\nParticularly in some of the you know more urban districts the primaries often already decided the outcome I'm concerned about what democratic turnout will be

filled bogus\nUs all the right questions the logic use is all cars are blue but all corn is yellow I eat no connection\nFrom another person or New York state's high watermark of this has got a a correcting me a little bit in congressional clout\nWas having forty five members of Congress on forty seventh electoral votes in the Nineteen thirties and forties every decade since we've lost two to five seats and almost certainly will lose another or to\nOr in the twenty twenty cents is sad but true New York has been stayed on the decline for many years not just in terms of electoral power in

your opponent did not show up for debate last night but he was there this morning that you guys just had a spirited debate is that correct\nThat is correct\nHow did it go this morning I haven't seen any reports on it yet\nI thought it was fine I thought it went very well in fact ah it was say I'm a forum sponsored by the Dutch his chain gr and each candidate got to make opening and closing statements and the guts to answer I'm\nQuite the same question asked by the members of the audience that were provided to the moderator of the chamber of commerce and it was I thought it was a good exchange I think that the I'm proud of the fact that I've worked on behalf of a small businesses in our district and I think the contrast between our two approaches\nOne very government oriented and one private sector oriented were were was very apparent\nWhen you made a very very strong case and I think it's a true on the face of it that they all got a really is that organically rooted in any way in that district he just recently moved in\nAnd it's really a national campaign in many ways but this morning at the debate did you see evidence that Delgado does not have the experience in that district which you lived in most of your life and certainly represented and worked in a in for many many years did that she does that I'm a merger at all and if so how\nIs it really did that his answers on agricultural were extraordinarily superficial and display it a real lack of knowledge as to uh the issues that agriculture faces in New York state\nHis answers on a regulation small

something that the uh the government has the first claim on the income of the citizenry and that the government is the vehicle through which are a a new mold a multitude of issues and problems gets address and\nI so I think there's really a a stark contrast here and I I don't think at the end of the day of the people of our district or want that most of them are but I have to tell you also Fred the amount of money that is being poured in from\nThe left of love radical left democratic socialist and an eight week democratic donors across the country is really astounding\nWe'll talk about that and I mean it was a report yesterday that I guess in the latest filing cycle they'll go out and raise you four to one or something like that that whether that what it is a disproportionate there is one between you and his campaign and where is is what I mean from compared to you or\nIs it is he outraged us he raised about three point three million I'm told in the third quarter I raised a a million or twenty thousand or so he outraged that's basically three to one right in the third quarter and this is this is being reflected in in a pattern across the country\nWhere are the activists

thought appeared before her because she's the civil war and as you well know\nI Love being in front of the criminal court\nAnd the crime is my but I Do all the time\nBut don't tell us how\nYour estimation you're working with a good judge you walk out of shape but he's the chief judge of the ... second department he's the presiding judge yeah and the it's interesting lens jumping the second department there's two departments in the southern tier of the state there are a force apartments in the entire state\nThe first apartment is Bronx or Manhattan that saw the second department is Brooklyn queens Staten Island national county Suffolk County Westchester County and\nDoes it go further north both Rockland County ... county and adults and also those who died this Dutch is orange is the orange red and putting them and partner so you have a lot of a lot more physical territory to recite over\nMany many more cases it's huge volume of\nCan't use absolutely yes it's a completely different department and actually cases can appear in one department and the law could be different in another call but at least is interpretation by the by the the uh\nUh cultivation when there's a conflict in the decision at one department another what happens to the procedure\nThey can take whatever they want to take\nIt in other words the first the public can take a different view than the second apartment first apartment has their own their own view of course is that resolves eventually up to the higher caught in a court of appeals hopefully if it if it goes up their shore and some cases I just don't go up to see how\nDivert divergence loss interesting yes one more in the Bronx and another Laura Westchester Long Island that's right I mean that's the way it is that's the way it's always been\nIt's true that necessarily adjust position to take\nIt is what it is it is what it is and it's this way we can people can argue well the first department says it's well the second department says it is and then they can put a judge in a position which way you want to go if you're in the first apartment\nThat usually go with what you're probably division in the first department and if you're in the second department usually could cite that\nAlthough the onset the starry decisis means that previous decisions in that particular department should covered is that right it's true yeah and what it is not being required of them to follow that the ... in that department follow the law as this determined in that department\nThey should but they could do what they want they don't [laughter] but everybody everybody has their you know using their discretion\nDo I mean I I often hear clients and say well I don't know how they do it the law is the law but the law does not to look up to ... is an interpretation of ...\nPeople can argue well the first department said well the second department says it is and then they can put it in a position which way you want to go if you're in the first apartment it usually go with what your appellate division in the first department and if you're in the second department usually could cite that well the simplest starry decisis\nMeans that previous decisions in that particular department should call but it's not about right it's true yeah and what it is not being required of them to follow that the ... in that department follow the law as just determined in that department\nThey should but they could do what they want they don't [laughter] but everybody everybody had their you using their discretion\nDo I mean I I often hear clients and say well I don't know how they do with the law is the law but the law does not to look up to ... ... ... ... ... a judgment interpreter one way and another jurisdiction may taboo\nWe hardly the ranch and he could work with the law do sort of make it work the way we want it to work in the sense that we try to do what's right at least I Do that oh it's your attempt to do that which is right right I Try I Try all the time to do that I tried to do what works\nYou know I I reached the red in the paper in the times about an attorney out in the Long Island\nWho when he got a different decision from the court wrote quote back nasty letters I don't know if you saw that and the lawyer was actually suspended for the bar\nFor insulting the court I saw that yeah ... it's happened before I've I Know and lawyers can really get into trouble for that I have to lose the that the parents got to be very careful what'd you say to or about a judge\nThe question is is there a balance in the rough sense of fairness does the yard that's disciplinary rules of a lawyer\nHave greater ... of violence over lawyers writes that the constitution of the United states which cause of freedom of speech not a difficult situation\nWhat is your view on that I should be a certain amount of respect for the corps um and you can criticize the judge's decision but it shouldn't be with some nasty words that I saw some of the word yeah he was\nHe would have been a little bit overboard I Know in one instance he he said it to the judge you question in Long Island did you even read the papers are but it's the same time even though it may be objectionable and\nWe have another call Vincent Vincent you I'm sure you're going to comment on the subject but All right just raised\n... well yes and I don't know if this is the same thing from earlier but\nI I wanted to ask the judge or I don't know if she can really comment on this what you were just talking about you know judges and others and for lawyers should not a insult the judiciary and make remarks like light certainly understand that and I was just wondering what the judge thinks\nOf I think it's a retired Justice Stevens [noise] making a remark that\nOh you're going to political army ... you know you're getting political I mean I Know you're going to say\nOh I I'm just asking whether she thinks it's appropriate for a ... a Supreme Court a retired justice to make commentary about another justices\nOr rebuild it for the court\nI retired judge usually is in a different position than sitting ... cells they can endorse candidates and they can say things that I Am sitting judge can't say\nI've never heard of it before view\nWas that the reason being is that most of the retired ... most of the judges when he got off the bench and Supreme Court or you can go to bed\nThe judiciary and make remarks like light certainly understand that and I was just wondering what the judge thinks of I think it's a retired Justice Stevens making a remark that\nOh you're going political army ... you know you're getting political I mean I Know you're going to say\nNo I I'm just asking whether she thinks it's appropriate for a ... a Supreme Court a retired justice to make commentary about another justices or\nRebuild it for the court\nI retired judge usually in a different position than sitting judge so they can endorse candidates and they can do things that I Am sitting judge can't say\nI've never heard of it before have you\n... the reason being is mostly retired ... both the judges when he got off the bench the Supreme Court or you're going to go to bed because you're dead well I just thought I'd not going to have so much for every man arrested in but I\nTheir elected all elected every ... every fourteen years just because the ... twenty eight years she will be the first\nJudge to be one of the third time in her uh her period\nOn never has happened before simply because the fact most judge has a very old when he got on the bench just was a child of thirty seven years old when she got on the bus so she knows her way around the course she knows the situation and I asked them to be here when it wants to see the quality of the judiciary we have in Westchester County I have\nHigh regard for her and the way it works in the top seven and get the votes it doesn't matter what their party is and uh so it's just the listing is will they just arbitrary lifting and heart case she's listed number six\nOut of the seven on the Democratic side so it's theoretically there she could be made a mistake because if they don't know the name people just go out and vote arbitrarily\nHere we have a qualified experienced judge and who may lose because the citizens don't know about it and that's one of the reasons I'm concerned and that's why I asked her to join me on the show is because I live each anyway a judge who is now it was very nicely said it right but so this is my concerns\nAnd Chris you gave me the opportunity to jump into this and say when was\nYes I think that was how you doing otherwise\nAll right I'm going in there you know what ... what everything that's going on yeah but I say\nLet me use this as an opportunity last week we spoke about bail and some of the rules of bail and what happens if a person doesn't show up in court ah interesting I have a list in ... was from England they've Allen who follows me every week and I got an email from it\nTo go out and vote arbitrarily here we have a qualified experienced judge and will be a loser because the citizens don't know about it and that's one of the reasons I'm concerned I that's why I\nAsked her to join me on the show is that I live in any way you judge that was you know it was very nicely said it right so this is my concerns\nAnd Chris you gave me the opportunity to jump into this and say what it was\nYeah I I think that Chris how you doing otherwise\nAll right I'm going in there you know what ... what everything that's going on yeah but I say\nLet me use this as an opportunity last week we spoke about bail and some of the foolishness of bail and what happens if a person doesn't show up in court ah\nInteresting I have a listener who was from England they've Allen who follows me every week and I got an email from him on that very issue and he said to me Murray why don't we both just doubled the sentencing those persons who don't show up\nAnd I wrote him back by saying we can double the divorce it's a matter of law you can do it but they can charge to person when it doesn't show up\nFor a case having been bailed you can charge them bail jumping which is a separate and distinct crime with a crime that were chance charged for some new Chris as an opportunity to respond to Dave in England to his question about ... which we raise last week\nAbout bail right how's that skillfully done yes it was not beautifully done the way I just can't lift yes absolutely [laughter] Chris thank you for

quarter results with\nTerrible so I think so I guess or window uh [noise]\nWell I think we do have some really a strong corporate um players in West Chester county and I think that\nWe may be able to do more to bring them in and to explore sponsorship opportunities which I Know is something you've been talking about for a long time\nYeah because the main thing that we have to do for this county executive reforming collapses\nAnd get the ship loading properly absolutely a and I\nThink there are a number of things we can do and while you know we were talking about the sales tax and other things before they don't all involve raising taxes\nFor example um we have not been shrinking um our real estate leases\nA commensurate with the decrease in the amount of county staff and the last eight years\nAnd I know that one of the things that the new administration is doing is studying um whether we can um get 'em terminate some of those leases one as they um expire\nAnd on like selling a piece of property that you own which is what's known as a one shot which is generally frowned upon\nIt if you end up not renewing a lease that's forever that's an expense that you are no longer going to have going forward in future years in an operating budget\nSo if we can if we can get rid of some of them that will take a certain amount of the pressure off for example um if we do a better job with our information technology\nIf we do a better job with energy efficiency those are also things that are going to increase our worker productivity and keep\nCertain ... in our budget down\nIt's like you know I I Want to build the I've been toying with the idea of building a convention conference center up the grassland reserve\nRuined right or not there but we we have to use them around you know this is a very vibrant county yeah and uh [noise]\nThe unfortunate part is that it's difficult to reach the public mhm schools in the schools that are\nThe best that eroded the drivers\nYeah and they're the ones that have historically been raising the property tax\nSee those are also things that are going to increase our worker productivity and keep certain ... in our budget down\nIt's like you know I I Want to build the swing with the idea of building a convention conference on throughout the grassland reserve\nRuined right or if not there but you have to use the magic mentioned this is a very vibrant county yeah and uh\nThe unfortunate part is that it's difficult to reach the public mhm schools the schools that are\nThe that eroded the drivers\nYeah and they're the ones that have historically been raising the property taxes the most yes and it's the people who keep the roads and bridges and the wastewater treatment plants going who are largely taking it on the chin but the fact of the matter is\nAnd when you talk about roads and bridges those are actually considered non mandated county services you're mandate accounting services to some extent the waste water\nUm some social services and so on\nAll ... and ... ... yes yes included in that is\nMedicaid which is becoming an [noise] well it's been frozen by the state but it's still a rather outsized percentage of our county budget at this point\nAnd if we it so what we're left to cut you know people keep saying well cut something well if we go to the stuff we can't cut which roads to we close\nWhich bridges to vent which parts do we sell for real estate development and that's what we're down\nTo you know I I brought that up on on the foundation would pause when\nI was in ... park land that we could sell ... um and that should be the last thing we do because the parks on there for forever for children grandchildren and great grandchildren\nAbsolutely um I understand though that we do have small slippers land a part in it to to many of our parkway some roads which are considered county Parkland but basically um grow we eat at this point\nYou know what the first part and they're counting you\nIt's not the Bronx river reservation as citizens which is also the first a limited access um highway and the United\n... yeah you're not anytime\nYou drive at your driving on a living museum\nI have to tell you those old rods and really care about county\nOh yeah and and that era was the era for example when the war Burton avenue bridge connecting northwest Yonkers with the village of face things was built\nUm around the time all of that wrote the railway infrastructure and then the road infrastructure was built\nThere were often other pieces of infrastructure or other amenities that were needed\nAnd when the municipalities couldn't do them themselves they would come to the county and quite often the borders that then board of supervisors would see the wisdom in them and would say absolutely will be happy to build you that bridge or will be happy to put in that road or whatever it was\nBut you're right though you don't\nI have to tell you those old versions really cared about county\nOh yeah and and that era was the era for example when the war Burton avenue bridge connecting northwest Yonkers with the village of faced things was built\nUm around the time all of that wrote the railway infrastructure and then the road infrastructure was built\nThere were often other pieces of infrastructure or other amenities that were needed\nAnd when the municipalities couldn't do them themselves they would come to the county and quite often the board is that then board of supervisors would see the wisdom in them and would say absolutely will be happy to build you that bridge or will be happy to put in that road or whatever it was\nBut you're right though you don't have your bridges fixed you know your roads [laughter]\nYeah well we're we're starting we're doing reasonably well on the bridges at this point we're starting to get that\nUm that situation under control I mean even the last administration understood after a certain point that you can't have bridges falling on highways\nMhm [noise] I um there's always problems financial problems I on different scales in different parts of government\nAnd uh for example New York city had their terrible financial crisis in the Nineteen seventies and managed to turn it around\nI'm One of the things I worry about now is with uh the federal government I'm taking away um our state and local tax deductions\nUm it's really going to hurt I mean it will probably cause the most amount of pain I'm In the short term to the schools but it's going to hurt all levels of government\nUm and one one of the reasons why we have such a vibrant county Herman and why we have so many um [noise]\nWhy we have so many people wanting to move here and live here is the quality of our schools and telling 'em ours are um property owners in our school districts that\nUm they're essentially going have what's tantamount to a ten or twenty percent property tax\nIncrease is ... is going to cause really serious damage to um our way of life and it's going to cause serious damage to the cause of public education\nThat's the reason why I'm mumble soon sex mhm yeah well that's not property tax\nYeah and as I said I\nHurt all levels of government I'm I'm One of the reasons why we have such a vibrant county Herman and why we have so many um [noise]\nWhy we have so many people wanting to move here and live here is the quality of our schools and telling 'em ours are um property owners in our school districts that\nUm they're essentially going to have what's tantamount to a ten or twenty percent property tax\nIncrease is ... is going to cause really serious damage to our way of life and it's going to cause serious damage to the cause of public education\nReason was mumbled soon stuck mhm yeah well that's not\nYeah and as I said I think um for our long term fiscal wellbeing I think our sales tax is going to have to be adjusted up somewhat to be a little bit more comparable to or the other counties in the state\nAs I said I don't think it requires a radical increased by any stretch of the imagination but a little bump up is probably going to be necessary to ensure the proper functioning of county government and our municipal governments\nAnd we don't have to consider as I Know it's regressive tax over maybe we can find a way to give some some exemptions low income wage earners won't them so much\nRight and one of the things you do with the sales tax to if you're trying to make sure that it does not her lower income earnings is you accept certain things from sales tax write you you exempt clothing that costs below a certain amount of money you exempt food because everybody has to eat\nUm there there are ways of doing it to make it less for aggressive but on the other hand\nUm property tax is not exactly progressive taxation either no because there are many people who own houses at this point who are at best low to middle income for example are senior citizens who are retired\nUm people who has been downsized in the job market as it's played out\nThe last half generation or so\nSo there are a lot of people for whom the property tax is regressive tax as well and I think\nWe need to really take a careful look at how we how we define progressive it in our tax the one in there and\nHow we want to county income tax\n[noise] I'm not going to go there at this point I mean we need a more comprehensive study and if we were going to go to something like an income tax I think there would have to be a decrease in property taxes\nYou can't use these as a way to get large amounts of new money from people because let's face it even in an affluent place like west Chester most people are taxed pretty much close to the limit\nBut what we do need to do is figure out the fairest way and the most the way that makes most economically sense\nTo apportion the tax um the tax rolls and the tax load so that people um who have the most problems are not being forced to pay a disproportionate\nGo there at this point I mean we need a more comprehensive study and if we were going to go to something like an income tax I think there would have to be a decrease in property

them you know\nI Am familiar with the Mikhail in Institute and I think there is still some work being done there but I think some of these larger questions\nUm are we are we being too dependent on property taxes for schools the whole idea of doing property taxes for schools came from the very early years of this country when basically\nYou had one room firewood black boards and a teacher who you could get away with paying next to nothing too now with all of the technology that's needed to prepare children properly the books all the facilities\nAnd the fact that you know need to pay teachers a living wage um we really need to look at at the system of financing I really don't think it makes sense for the twenty first century\nFeeling lazy you if you can find a way that I think I

and make sure that you're watching our content\nAnd the reason was they were behind the eight ball and inflation and they just had to keep ... raising rates and raising rates I think it was Volcker in the fed back then and then they just kept raising them to lick inflation so when Trump goes out and says oh the feds ruining the economy by raising rates it's not entirely correct instead of responding to the strong economy and trying to make sure\nThat they're staying ahead of inflation because inflation can come quick and if you're behind it it's it gets really really mess\nIf you go online you see stories about we're going to do for another recession within two years we know the last recession was due to the bloated housing market would be the cause of the next recession [noise] well you got a few things out there um you know one of the interesting current events and all this is the situation in Saudi Arabia and\nIt's got the markets a little bit nervous depending on how this thing turns out it it means for people who haven't paid too much attention apparently a I'm based sort of dissident journalist in Saudi Arabia went into the Turkish constantly never came out and\nThere's evidence that the Saudis had a team of are agents of some sort and about a fifth yet the Fifteen hip and apparently right yeah it's right out of a homeland I was like an episode of homeless\nSo the Trump is caught in this quandary because the we have lots of money coming in through defense contracts with Saudi Arabia and then on the other side of the Saudis are huge investors the sovereign wealth fun to Saudi Arabia invested all sorts of things all over the world\nSo ... him with his business background and plus he's got personal interests over they are not going to say that\nThat actually matters to him but that's something to consider and if I'm you know you'd upset the apple cart on that there's a lot of money\nDepending on how this thing turns out it it means for

consider and if I'm you know you'd upset the apple cart on that there's a lot of money that could um go looking for a new home especially at a time when [noise]\nYou know we're concerned about China getting a leg up on us you figure that China would be willing to come in there and take over some of the investment opportunities plus the price of oil if the Saudis decided to stop pumping that sort of a response sanctions you could drive oil up to a level that could derail a lot of the growth in the economy\nWhat what's your perspective on\nNorth American fracking in looking for oil and a lot of the economy or people in the protecting the environment environmentalist say that can cause earthquakes in places where you don't see earthquakes well what's your perspective on it that like a last resort for this country if if the oil reserve ever depleted\nUm we've done some great work in the U.S I'm getting oil out and in particularly in the Permian Basin um in in other areas around North Dakota [noise]\nAh so the U.S has actually pretty thriving oil market and then the aftermath of that is is gas and some of the fracking a New York state there was a lot of fracking going on I think Governor Cuomo would shut down a lot of that are pulled back on it [laughter]\nUm so it requires a lot more of a of an oversight effort was you start to get evidence that there's geological issues earthquakes and other things that are going and water [laughter]\nI guess in some towns the water's been harmed um but the U.S is actually compared to Fifteen or Twenty years ago were pretty oil independent\nYou would look at global growth and where Saudi oil comes in our guys could ramp up here and probably um [noise]\nYou know do a good job of keeping that supply boy filled for the U.S but the rest of the world that the Saudis start to\nBeing completely independent isn't really good for the world is right is that my correct in that\nIt's not and and it we change that a little bit of I guess for years and years you couldn't U.S companies could not export boil\nAnd that changed I think in the last year the Obama administration they started exporting oil and gas around the world we were a net importer because we needed all the oil we could get and we didn't want any of it going offshore um so we're in a position\nAnd they'd be very happy in Texas I'm In the south and the problem

say year after year and then constantly performing in the postseason you get older than the Yankees\nUsed to have more championships and they're all all the other people can buy\nAll right well

about it with the Yankees you look down you know look in the Bronx you know boom couldn't do anything without you know Kashmir approval with anything\nBut which only got like this is where the GM

evergreen state college in Olympia, Washington welcome Stephanie ... is a real pleasure not thrilled to have you on the show Oh thank you so much\nSo you are really an expert in marriage and you've been studying it for a long time doing so many ah articles and books about marriage and the trends in history of marriage and divorce is you know part of marriage for for a number of people\nAnd ah but obviously it's not the desired outcome when people walk down the aisle and say I do know and thinking oh I Can't wait until I get divorced\nAnd so what are some ways that you think people can avoid divorce\nWell first of all let me say it's not always a important to avoid divorce if things have deteriorated to the point that they're difficult for a one or both for the children\nUh so the best way to avoid divorce is to pick wisely long before we get to that very good advice [laughter]\nSo you know I think that that I'm a historian not a psychologist and um I can give some advice based on on what I've I've read\nAnd and no but I think one of the most important things we can do is put this in perspective a how marriage is changing and what divorce means to us um\nThinking when I Can't wait until I get to more and so what are some ways that you think people can avoid divorce\nWell first of all let me say it's not always a important to avoid divorce if things have deteriorated to the point that there are difficult for um one or both or for the children\nAre so the best way to avoid divorce is to pick wisely long before you get to them which is good advice [laughter]\nSo you you know I think that that I'm a historian not a psychologist and um I can give some advice based on on what I've I've read and and no but I think one of the most important things we can do is put this in perspective\nOn how marriage is changing and what divorce means to us\nUm you know and up until it's really only in the last forty years that we have been trying to organize marriages that are not based upon a strict division of labor you know sort of cut and dried gender roles in which it was a man's responsibility to bring home the\nBacon so to speak that he was the one who is going to earn their living and what are you expected in return for that and got in return for that was a certain amount of deference from all the woman\nThat she would keep the house clean that she would take care of the kids that she would cater to him when he got home\nA and really it's only in the last forty years but we started to think maybe we want one that's based more on sharing rather than on specialization and a attraction to the opposite let's think about having friendships that are very important and shared activities and that's been a tremendous strain\nUm first of all it was just hard to negotiate we bought all these tapes running in our heads\nA in terms of meant many expecting women to be to defer to them men thinking that the way to show their loved women is to buy them things and teach them things\nUh and women are thinking well you know I'm really attracted to this guy who's you know he's dangerous I mean romance novels for two hundred years have a encouraged us to find attractive a man who is\nA taller stronger wiser richer and potentially very very dangerous because that's the other side of uh our expectation of him to protect us as a fine line between those\nSo we walked into this new situation with a lot of bad tapes that get us attracted to the wrong people and even when we got the tracked into somebody who is um you know really has a lot of potential we still have a lot of things to work out men for example\nUm have had until recently and this is really exciting news that this is changing was threatened when the woman had more education than he did or earn more money up until the Nineteen eighties so that was a big risk for divorce\nThat's changing now men are beginning to get used to um the fact that women can be equal sudden they couldn't even I'll shine them in some circumstances\nUm women are beginning to understand\nHow to negotiate for what they want instead of just shutting up an differing until they got to get so angry that they say they want a divorce instead of saying they want to change [laughter] so I think that we are learning\nI think we will never get rid of divorce\nBecause um people do have choices and alternatives outside marriage but the divorce rate has been falling uh especially for a young younger uh couples educated couples and I think that's because we're learning how to do um marriage better\nUp until the Nineteen eighties that was a big risk for divorce that's changing now men are beginning to get used to uh the fact that women can be equal sudden they couldn't even I'll shine them in some circumstances um women are beginning to understand\nHow to negotiate for what they want instead of just shutting up an differing until they got to get so angry that they say they want a divorce instead of saying they want to change so I think that we are learning\nI think we will never get rid of divorce\nBecause um people do have choices and alternatives outside marriage but the divorce rate has been falling uh especially for a young younger uh couples educated couples and I think that's because we're learning how to do um marriage better\nYou know I think that's really true although as you're talking through the list of traditional or old fashioned values are Dina roles for men and women I find myself somewhat disheartening that they're so still at least in my practice so prevalent and uh\nI'm ... percent so stubbornly holding onto our psyche [noise]\nYes I think that is very frustrating and you know and the thing that is particularly frustrating I'm sure to you and to me is a researcher is that some of these old attitudes used to keep marriage is staple\nI I think destructive to marriages that are more sort of progressive approach what do you think about that\nWell I think that that's absolutely true\nUm I mean there's it's a fine line in a situation like that and it's something that women should remember\nUm men have had to deal with for for many years you know the the the\nResentment of being the only one who is responsible for paying the bills um this was a burden on men and it's one of the reasons are excuses or whatever you want to call it that they didn't step up to the plate at home as much um and when a woman has that kind of um burden she should recognize that I'm\nOkay um this this is a normal feeling and lets you know to what extent can we work it out that either he's doing things at home or he's contributing to the family\nOr in other ways financially or in terms of keeping the house up or whatever the ... the little field there\nBut the other side of it is yes women for all the independents that we have achieved\nA and very few of us would give that up um we also still do have those kind of holdovers from the ideas at the met All right well we should be independent high earners but the men should be at least as good if not more and so I think every woman has to ask ourselves if she is\nAnd when a woman has that kind of um burden she should recognize that I'm\nOkay um this this is a normal feeling and lets you know to what extent can we work it out that either he's doing things at home or he's contributing to the family or\nIn other ways financially or in terms of keeping the house up or whatever the ... the little field there\nBut the other side of it is yes women for all the independents that we have achieved\nA and very few of us would give that up um we also still do have those kind of holdovers from the ideas at the met All right well we should be independent on high earners but the men should be at least as good if not more and so I think every woman has to ask ourselves\nIf she is um has got a legitimate complaint about an uneven division of labor in the in the household a or if she is in fact using those kind of old standards for it and other big issue for for women is what sociologists call gate keeping\nAnd that at whole ... very often you'll find women who complain that their husbands don't work uh help out at home\nOr with the dishes or with the children\nAnd when you look more closely part of it may be the demand is lacking off but another part of it may be that we women still have this idea that we are the experts on the east and so we invite the man in but as an unskilled labor [laughter] so\nYou know you tell him that he's doing it wrong with where are you telling you give them the least pleasurable parts of the job or you say well no year let me show you how to do it or or oh you did that wrong\nUm I I've been studying these things for years it's only just a year or two ago that my husband walked in the kitchen and found me we're voting this\nDish [laughter] I Love the dishwasher\nWhy should I overloaded at all and I said I Know okay I got it [laughter]\nYeah I think that that that's right it's not fair it's really not fair to say oh we want to ... we want the ability to go out there but it's really optional for us for you it's mandatory right\nAnd and and the other side of it is it's not fair to say we want you to be full partners at home and not let them have the responsibility and the respect to let them do it they're they're way even if it's not the way that we would have done it\nThis is dialogue on divorce on Katharine Miller I'm Talking with Stephanie ... today about a divorce and marriage and a trend over time and and Stephanie ... is our

that interspersed thing a honey or a D. or or an infection or a sense of humor into an argument really lowest people's blood pressure and allows them to recover more quickly from the anger on there's always bad feeling\nSpeaker at a listener listening [laughter]\nAnd so a lot of it has to do was um again to go quote Gutman and how many positive us things people do to to counteract any of the negative because we all do have negatives\nUm I've seen other research suggesting that it's really important to remember especially when you're distracted that the first thing to go when you're distracted or harried at work\nI'm worried about money is your ability to recognize things that your partner or your kids do that are helpful to you and to give them the gratitude there and do you start to when you when you're under stress you start to notice only the things that get your way instead of the things that\nMove your way and it's really important for a relationship to acknowledge and I think people for the things that uh that that move your way I'm a you know families work a little bit on an economy of gratitude\nYeah absolutely I think that sometimes people\nAh spend extra money or withhold facts in as a reaction to a lack of communication and can action in in the marriage and sort of as a as a I I don't want to use the psychological term but I Will anyway in a passive\nAggressive way of saying well if you're going to do that you're going to treat me that way then I'm going to fill in the blank [noise]\nYeah and again that's a something that people should talk out or whether it's with a therapist or with each other or just to yourself\nOr you know I'm not somebody up personally who has to have long heart to heart conversations but when I noticed that happening to either of us are just just we do something distracting\nBut on an economy of gratitude\nYeah absolutely I\nThink that sometimes people ah spend extra money or withhold facts in as a reaction to\nA lack of communication and can action in in the marriage and sort of as a as a I I don't want to use the psychological term but I Will anyways in a passive aggressive way to say well if you're going to do that you're going to treat me that way then I'm going to you know filling the blank [noise]\nYeah and again that's something that people should talk out or whether it's with a therapist or with each other or just to yourself\nOr you know I'm not somebody up personally who has to have long heart to heart conversations but when I noticed that happening to either of us are just just we do something distracting but fun you know\nOn so I just think paying\nI as I keep saying that I'm I'm not a psychologist and I hate to give advice about it but paying attention to the dynamics\nA and trying to step in to build on the strength and the fun parts of the relationship that's I think one of the most important thing that we can do that to recognize also that when we are under stress\nThis is I think so important for families um that uh have you\nKnow tremendous income problems um it's just normal to have negative interactions um it doesn't mean you just let the negative interactions go but sometimes it helps just to know that the problem is not in your psyche it's in your situation\nAnd to be more patient with each other because you know that this is just a stressful time for the family\nSo let's go back to your statement that you're not a psychologist your historian but I think I think that you're you're definitely a keen observer\nOf marriage overtime and so I ask you these questions in terms of your observations about that and not you know as a psychologist but what your impressions are was all the research and you've done [noise]\nFair enough I I just I just worry about the you know playing a psychiatrist on TV so to speak\n[laughter] understand\nSo Stephanie in terms of the trend for divorce over time you know what causes it and societal attitudes toward it obviously uh in in in the seventies or late sixties and seventies there was this sort of\nA weeping increase in in the divorce rate um my parents have been married sixty three years but many of my friends' parents divorced\nOr at that time when we weren't in high school I date myself now and I and you know I Know the divorce rate has her when I first sharply I think and then I think it's it leveled off and has come down do you think that that society\nAttitude toward divorce do you think it's less shameful I think there are a lot of people who feel deeply ashamed about it and many people who don't\nUh-huh uh-huh well you know attitudes toward divorce I'm generally kind of\nOne on one just historical facts that important to note is that people became more favorable to divorce really after the divorce started rather than you know they they became faithful to divorce and then they went off and divorced people who are divorced\nAttitude toward divorce you think it's west shameful I think a lot of people who feel deeply ashamed about it and many people who don't\nUh-huh uh-huh well you know attitudes toward divorce I'm generally kind of\nOne and one just historical facts that important to note is that people became more favorable to divorce really after the divorce started rather than you know they they became faithful to divorce and then they went off in divorce with people who are divorced\nWhich can block you from reaching Newark shoot potential and keep you backwards while the rest of the world continues to move forward\nHay bale when I was young I remember that raised a story we've my father\nI think I was in grade six or seven and yet this is a long time ago I did not remember I sat there which grade but I was younger and I came from school and I had a beanie minus yeah and I was happy okay because before I\nSee our the C ... and I had been ... and I was happy and I came I was so happy and I rushed\nTo my dad and I told him

that's going to be enough for you\nBut now I'm asking you to picture wants the world would be like\nWithout ambition without without a drive for more now I'm willing to bet that there would be no America\nThat the world would be in a very primitive stage because rather than keep moving forward rather than pushing toward something better or rather than wanting to be better than we are\nWe would have decided that where we are is the most that humanity can every evolve we would have decided that right where we are is where we should be and things will be dire today\nBut something something as deep at and passionate\nAs the American dream is built on the foundation that one day people came from everywhere from all across the world to this land of promise a land flowing with milk and honey and decided that they wanted more\nBe like just watch I've stopped me on the top of what you say absolutely that came from France they can find anger they came from across Europe\nAt that time in
