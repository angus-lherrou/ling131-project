these things happening by\nClothes washers are\nWell basically in every house I've been in\nBut until I came into power\nWhen I got to that point where I was rented a house\nI was like that's not happening only wait 'til now anyway how did you get to run\nThe house well I got to run the house I was in a house with a bunch of us from uptown in rocks and\nSometimes we take each other's time like you got to take it by force\nSometimes it's it's like well I'm cool with you when you take it by force how how does that work well basically you tell them\nLike well let's go to the back\nGets your

other houses [noise]\nIs it just was a thing to do like the warm up town near Brooklyn so it's like all the way I go and fight to die right\nThey'll stop what else is not like we just go every time when we start we don't start all the time and then it out of boredom yeah that was like to get recognition you get props so\nWhen the more recognition you get\nSo that's how I was able to have a house because I started gaining more clout you go to court some people go to court and they fight and opinions [noise]\nOkay now [laughter]\nThat's ...\nYou go to court and found guilty and you get twenty

committed a murder [noise]\nWhat bring you up for parole and if\nThat's because of my sentence the sentence required them to bring me up for parole so this so one of the main reasons why I'm here to date\nIs because of rules change [noise]\nBecause a lot of people who had life kid kept being denied\nBecause of its benefits\nIf you're locked up in serving time for the fed them why get denied parole for the offense when you served time\nSo the rule change basically saying that you cannot deny them parole because of the crime\nThat has to be what they'd done inside a prison non stop them

kicked in\nI wrote to novels while I was incarcerated swimming Solomon integral corruption\nAt I entered one into a contest and one they get published yeah publishers crop publish it I started ... publishing companies talking to publish books you read the book [laughter]\nFeeling closed in in New York so I left and I moved to Florida for five years so I could paint murals oh and then I came back and back in New York but\nI learned so much it's kind of like a college after college when I went there [laughter] I even went to college in Florida I went to college actually in Brooklyn I went to ... Institute yeah and then after that I I just I kept seeing on line that people were painting murals and Wynwood in Miami\nAnd you know I was so intrigued by and you know having being used to small pieces of work you know about the size Eighteen by twenty four if not smaller than that\nI wanted to paint bigger\nI wanted people to see my work [laughter] so and you know in New York and the huge deal to paint on a wall you have to have permission and everything like that in Florida it seems like most people were granted permission because it was influencing the population and the economy for people to have murals on Wall so\nI just thought what if I go there and I paint I learned how to spray paint what's gonna happen what could be the worst that could happen\nAnd how many years did you um do narrows on walls for five years\nAnd then I moved back two years ago and that's when I started changing my goal to wanting to paint murals and the whole world seeing accomplishing that and then now I wanted to gallery shows and finally did it\nIn terms of ... I'm\nTrying to uh\nYour your copy for\nOf the wall complexity of the design so most of the people that hired me I Would let them know you know your walls thirty feet by three feet or whatever the size of the mural was I Would just decide okay how complicated do you want to sign\nTo you wanted to say your name do you want to design\nWhatever it was I Would just figure out pricing\nTo um do narrows on walls\nFor five years and then I moved back two years ago and that's when I started changing my goal to wanting to paint murals and the whole world seeing accomplishing that and then now I wanted to gallery shows and finally did it\nIn terms of ... um\nAnd you get compensated for\nSize of the wall complexity of the design so most of the people that hired me I Would let them know you know your walls thirty feet by three feet or whatever the size of the mural was I Would just decide okay how complicated to you on that side\nDo you want it to say your name do you want to design\nWhatever it was I Would just figure out pricing based on their needs and\nDo most of them one of those yeah\nYeah I Would always do a little sketch and give them options for colors and things like that and show them what it would look like if you play sit here and if you place it their things like that and\nAnd the the um\n... or ... or\nThey don't know how does John\nIt depending on where you are like there are certain areas that they're really strict because if for instance you put I always remember this you know if you put bright yellow on the pathway like near where most cars are it would cause traffic you know\nPeople would look at it and it would always be an issue so certain areas of Florida they were really strict on what colors you can use and where but\nYou know if you're on a private property for instance where\nWell charted my paintings were they you know they weren't very strict on that they just wanted to do something family friendly and things like that on but I remember trying to get my work into the city and they had pages and pages and pages of documentation of what colors you couldn't use what things were appropriate if you were on a street sidewalks you know\nThat was interesting\nSo so during that\nFour or five is yet [noise] um\nI came back won yeah you actually can and Florida it's really profitable it's one of the biggest tourist attractions for people to come down\nEspecially in Wynwood it's it's literally people come from all over the world to see the art on the walls it's about three blocks of painting sidewalk St Paul's everything your\nHead to toe every building it's how they advertise and then after you know a while it turned into just a tourist site they actually have when would walls where you can go in and it's a little park and it's a mural gallery so every you know famous artists in the world to paint murals comes there to paint a mural they put a little black\nAnd it's just a rite of passage for mural is to be

Rockland County now or her district um so it looks like he's going to have to wait a couple more years if you want that seat\nBut uh I think she's running for something I'm the only thing that would hold Chelsea back is is an incredible backlash a\nBased on our parents and you know Hillary still out there a bill is out there building Hillary you're going to go on a tour um\n\nI guess discussing their political lives a like a hundred and fifty to a hundred and Seventy five bucks a ticket [noise]\nSo they're going to make this out to be like a concert or\nYou know they'll get another ten twenty thirty million I don't know if they mean that if they need it and what the point of all of it is um you know some Democrats I think Democrats are mixed on this I think that um some of them still support the Clintons while others want the Clintons to go away\nUm because Hillary as a lightning rod for the um for the opposition\nUm the other item I wanted to talk to was about was a\nTerm limits in Yonkers and I'm hopefully I'll get a chance to talk to Bob around about it tomorrow I've got some insight because um [noise] really covered Yonkers\nUm intensely and I'm currently\nThere's term limits in Yonkers two terms for the mayor to for your terms for the mayor to for your terms for the city council now in the county level there is a twelve year term limit the county executive can run for three terms and the board of legislators can run for two years terms\nSo um I I Believe in six who your terms for the board but it's twelve years on the county\nAnd the thought has been to um match Yonkers with the county so bringing Yonkers up from eight years to twelve years\nAnd make it equal with the county a government um you know opponents term limits in Yonkers says it's nonsense that's just an excuse\nTo make a ... fan I'll give him the opportunity to serve a third term as the mayor of Yonkers a span of was term limited next year unless this last changes\nThere is a twelve year term limit the county executive can run for three terms and the board of legislators can run for two years terms so um\n\nI I Believe in ... who your terms for the board but it's twelve years on the county\nAnd the thought has been to um match Yonkers with the county so bringing Yonkers up from eight years to twelve years\nAnd make it equal with the county a government um you know opponent the term limits in Yonkers says this is nonsense that's just an excuse\nTo make a ... fan I'll give him the opportunity to serve a third term as the mayor of Yonkers a span of was term limited next year\nUnless this last changes um he does not have a lot of opposition are running for mayor that was another consideration is that there was not any one out there who is um the heir apparent if you will\nUh two former counsel presidents truck lens Mick a Democrat and William McLaughlin a Republican\nAre both interested but have not really thrilled or the voters have Yonkers um you know if I was not allowed to run for a third term I think ... is the favorites or become mayor but um there's a lot of opposition to lessen the because of his\nEars are on the city council as president\nUm it's an interesting dynamic or the bottom line is a ... and the supporters of Mayer's ban all they have the votes on the city council thing doesn't have to go to a referendum anymore it used to have to go\nTo a referendum and the uh the voters rejected a changing term limits before\nI'm\nNow all the it was required isn't a simple council majority vote\n[noise] in my head count shows that [noise] for councilmember supported to council members oppose it\nOne council member is undecided so they have the four votes to pass this than the mayor is going to sign it they're going to try to do it before election day and mayor span I was going to run for a third term he still has to win now\nThat's the thing about term limits folks or abolishing term limits or modifying term limits\nIs the best term limits on the ballot if you don't like the guy or the girl with a woman throw him out of office and that's what's still can be done with my spine into\nIf you don't support what my spine always doing in Yonkers you could support another candidate and vote for another candidate and you have any here to find another candidate\nOn the flip side I think that there is um support for what mayor spinal has done in Yonkers over the past eight years\nHe stabilize things to a certain extent I'm there hasn't been a great turnaround in some issues like\nA education test scores up\nThe schools are still crumbling taxes continue to rise there was a six percent tax increase\nThey had the bus to the tax cap last year oh look so look things aren't great and Yonkers but there continues to be a development boom downtown along the waterfront I'm very challenging job to run the city of Yonkers Westchester largest city\nThe fourth largest city in West Chester\n\nHere to find another candidate on the flip side I think that there is a support for what mayor spinal has done in Yonkers over the past eight years he stabilized things to a certain extent I'm\nThere hasn't been a great turnaround in some issues like\nA education test scores are up\nThe schools are still crumbling taxes continue to rise there was a six percent tax increase\nThey had the bassoon attacks cap last year so look so look things aren't great in Yonkers but there continues to be a development boom downtown along the waterfront I'm very challenging job to run the city of Yonkers Westchester largest city\nThe fourth largest city in Westchester\nUm\nThat's an interesting story to me because there is vocal opposition to or the move that changed term limits to give span of a third term but that opposition is not organized it's sporadic and include um a lot of craziness um the uh\nThat's the one thing about that's the one race that I scratch my head\nIf the governor got him into the race like everyone says\nHe's got no money the governor is not pouring any money to his campaign account or there's the whole joke for cocoa connection between hearken my pre cocoa and uh you know the latest good news

[laughter] way\nHe'll come out and share and I'm of the president for Sanders and waters\nI find you know you know that the president is the head of the executive branch of government\nOkay and Sanders a senator or Maxine Waters used to Congress will but I think that um it's not really a an accurate comparison to say what they do as compared to what the president of the United states says and does\nWell yeah and the different ... affecting the impact you know well I'm sure\nHe's not quite true because you know when Maxine Waters come pick up and down like a not a people start attacking people in restaurants or so you know people listen to this nonsense yeah of course\nIt's all crazy you know that about\nYeah and and I think it was really wrong of the media and the only politician any politician\nTo say anything about this until I knew what was going on 'em and well you know the only state that should be made that this has no place in our political process and um you know wherever they want to be proud Trump\nSaid that you know Trump said that he was measured in that one I have to admit yeah uh but you know he he assumed responsibility you know again why Sunni\nYou think he you think you'd call do some some little mutt news garage in Queens and said hey put together a ...\nPound parts of sitting on the bed yeah [laughter]\nThey have to take the credit you know\nI mean it's just such a crazy stuff it really is hard to have a rational a discussion\nRational I think well you and I have a rational discussion but like ugly I think we all agree that we're

guys you know I I'm looking at um luckily white destroyed a country you know he said that at a rally\nKnow you want to you want him to spend a lot of stupid things but so is Hillary Clinton so as has many other political operative [noise] uh\nThis whole discourse\nTo get a ... pound parts of the city on the bed yeah [laughter]\nThey have to take the credit\nYou know I mean it's just such a crazy stuff it really is hard to have a rational a discussion\nRational I think well you and I have a rational discussion being like ugly I think we all agree that we're doing this as crazy as the bed bug\nRight absolutely okay well you're not well off the\nAir that the slowdown of stuff that's been said over the last three years okay I don't have to repeat like a couple\nOf guys you know I I'm looking at I'm literally like destroyed a country you know he said that at apple valley you\nKnow you want to you one I'm ... spent a lot of stupid things but so is Hillary Clinton so as has many other political operatives [noise] uh\nThis whole discourse who's been a horror show\nYeah but look I'm looking at last twenty four hours I'm looking at the last any finite not to\nSay I have never heard a president or of the United states or you know well you know we're in a no no well yeah but I'm Glad you know more uh what do you what do you think about the Saudi Arabia you know what's going on there\nWell there's no question that they align ah\nAh you know it just it came out today that Gina Haspel who's the head of the CIA went to turkey to listen to their evidence and see their evidence a and\nThis was a pre meditating murder the question that we don't have the answer to yet is how high up this goes well\nAll right that yeah there's no doubt that you know you you had secretary of state pump a audio with a photo op right after it happened at my church and the other day ... with the prince with another photo op so there's no question\nNo way he didn't he didn't go to the the first call was like\nNo but what was in the ... sitting with the prince and it's whatever wherever they were sitting and had a photo album than sitting talking\nSprints let me ask you a question of course is trying to protect his prints Miami question let me ask you a question about that\nIf this happened in Great Britain okay right same exact scenario or\nThe queen decided I don't like this person I Want\nTo eliminate it okay this is a little far facts\nGotta take highway but I'm saying it didn't claim is no longer you know that's why\nHave settled up a hotline silky I managed to whatever those will be let me finish the point and say no right arguing they\nIf they had done the same thing\nWhat are we hosted the queen you mean the queen or the minister of great\nBritain did this okay and they and they murdered a\nA citizen of another country [laughter] uh\nBecause ... and then American citizen or he was known as the I owe a he had a three year residency um\nAnd uh so you know if if they had done the same thing under their immigration standards okay when we would we be sanctioning are cutting them off from the rest of the world where we are supposed to be re measure measure to an old ally\n[noise] I mean that's watched it in comparison to say there's water is why I mean how could you think that Great Britain and in this day and age okay\nI'm I'm using online and not as an example I'm using as an example you know what do you know who what do you do with it or\nThat's since Nineteen thirty two what do you do with an ally\nThat really definitely screwed up\nKnown as the I owe a he had a ... year residency um\nAnd so you know if they had done the same thing under their immigration standards okay would we be would we be sanctioning are cutting them off from the rest of the world where we are supposed to be re measures are measured to an old ally\n[noise] I mean that's washed in comparison to sit there is a more that's why I mean how could you think that Great Britain in this day and age okay\nOn it I'm On using that money was not as an example amusing as an example you know what are you know who what do you do with it\nThat's since Nineteen thirty two what do you do with an hour\nThat really definitely screwed up big time okay but not to mention they might have done this ... where we don't know uh but they really messed up um and\nWhat do you do to him and cut off communications with them because they do keep a balance in the middle east uh what do we do with them you know I\nDon't have the answer I'm asking this rhetorical because I don't know what you\nDo well I Would say that you know let's just assume that the facts determine what we already know\nReally are coming to all kinds of conclusions without any fact whatsoever you know I couldn't you know you could go anywhere with this or should I say this was a a a a Mexican refugee that's doing this you could say and I want if you want to just make up stuff\nIt could even be a white suburban housewives watching Trump's guy\nYeah you know to me too movement women aren't excluded from doing this they they're just as capable as we are to make a these role I Can't but [laughter]\nI'm I'm lucky if they knew my wife lets me touch the screwdriver but uh\nBut you know you know I slightly disagree with you there for some reason women yeah this doesn't\nSeem at all I Would be really shocked they seem to be more like the one that Griffith lady member that weird yeah she did with the um it's more like a self harm that they would engage in\nWell usually have somebody that prepares something like that is that they believe was going to detonate okay right and I'm likely way we're trained in this whether they were trained by a terrorist organization but by the U.S military or another military uh yeah you know\nThere are still a very small pockets several really serious neo Nazi like way out you don't even\nBut uh\nBut you know you know I slightly disagree with you there for some reason women yeah this doesn't\nSeem at all I Would be really shocked they seem to be more like the United ... remember that weird yeah she did with the um it's more like a self harm that they would engage in\nBut usually somebody that prepares something like that it's that they believe was going to detonate okay right and I'm likely why were trained in this whether they were trained by terrorist organization but by renting US military or another military\nUh yeah you know there are still a very small pockets of really\nSerious neo Nazi like way out you don't even know how to describe than you do with it or light light or lack there just absolutely out of this planet ... very weird\nUh anarchic types yeah you're right the media they want to just rush out and paint these cartoons\nWell if you looked at Andy lack of CNN yesterday\nUh um he came he wasn't ten minutes after the building was secured that he came out with a statement blasting Trump\nYeah that was just ridiculous\nWithout any knowledge of what we're we're just came from what I mean I think we have an obligation as the media to at least get some facts\nWe can we can say hey I think\nI uh I'm I'm ... I'm waiting to get some more information but my my\nCommon sense tells me this uh you know it's it's that's editorializing uh yeah I'm Out and say this is news you know like like they have and if you look at if you watch I watch CNN this morning\nAnd they did nothing but have talking heads on their uh I you know just going after um the Republicans on this thing now I don't know whether there's whether the Democrats had anything to do with this I'd like to think they did\nLike to think the Republicans didn't have anything to do with it also I'm a but maybe somebody feels like they can maybe lock up this midterm election which by the way for those of us that are not talking about it is not a done deal for the Democrats\nYeah blue wave goes up and goes back it goes up it goes back or the candidates go up they go down I mean we've seen candidates that are running a Republican set up and down Fifteen points in the district and now it's it's a statistical tie a so we don't\n... you know people want to say was Kavanaugh was this was that uh but we don't know what it is\nUm the other thing is is that early voting is been skyrocketing\nYeah it's just um the more you think about this the acts of desperation and this election like with the um the mob\nA supposedly marching up from Honduras yeah I'm In this this package or not there's just an act of total an Arab desperation just live\nWell are not the aggregate or our governor has missed one press conference from one location since this thing started this is this just to him you know political fodder for the ... out there not only that he's put the national guard to protect the\nCrab or was this was that uh but we don't know what it is\nUm the other thing is just do it early voting is been skyrocketing\nYeah it's just um

tax breaks\nThere'd be these huge press conferences and then lo and behold nothing happened except you continue to see an uptick in a growth in poverty all of the pernicious affects the poverty has it low uh education achievement\nA up a increase in violence I'm getting a more a run more leaving housing stock I mean it just so there was a lack of seriousness of purpose about solving these problems and that was one of the reasons I decided to take this audacious challenge\nYou know the fact of the debate was on CBS that was only run locally is is that correct work you know I mean the CBS I thought the Phillies rented a oh they did where are you okay All right well\nYou know the the I mean I Know in Syracuse the affiliate there ended up there okay the because you know and there was but you know it ended up making upstate or feel even more frustrated\nBecause there was no there was no question about upstate other than to the end which was are you going to pay for a new Buffalo Bills stadium when you have one out of every two children being born into poverty in the city of buffalo and the question that's being asked about a new stadium it just shows you that there's a um a lack of understanding\nSure um you know or the or the you mentioned start up New York that was I mean I don't know about ... years we got rear ended with commercials and ads about sort of New York and it sounded like this great panacea you just mentioned it\n... I Know I'm I don't even know how many jobs were created as as a result right I mean it was like millions of dollars spent on on marketing of this thing and nothing happens\nYeah I think the last time I checked with first they didn't do the ...\nWhich was are you going to pay for a new Buffalo Bills stadium when you have one out of every two children being born into poverty in the city of buffalo and the question that's being asked is about a new stadium it just shows you\nThat there is a um a lack of understanding sure um\nYou know or the or the you mentioned start a New York that was I mean I don't know about ... years we got rear ended with commercials and ads about starting a New York and it sounded like this great panacea you just mentioned\n... I Know I'm I don't even know how many jobs were created as as a result right I mean it was like millions of dollars spent on a marketing of this thing and nothing happens\nCorrect yeah I think the last time I checked all first they didn't do the reporting for a for a long time\nAnd then when they finally forced to do reporting I think it was like seven hundred jobs in millions of dollars spent and then they quietly changed the name of the program and then said that they wouldn't have to do the obligatory job reporting so now we'll we'll never know and that again it shows you how broken system is\nBecause we need my uh my my policy is to say based on experience and what I've gone around the state of saying eliminate economic development programs and bureaucracy\nThat data from the New York fed from the uh EJ McMahon and the empire center to the upjohn into all show they are ineffective they don't work\nAnd that doesn't even talk about the corruption that they're mired in take that money invested in infrastructure invested in roads and bridges and water mains and sewers and new infrastructure like broadband that's\nHow you build economies would the free market that's how we became the Empire State building highways and building transit systems and then people are very clever could figure out how to use it to deliver wages to the market we need to go back to what government does well\nAnd we remember that government is not about delivering public benefits to people who give campaign contributions\nHe'll uh sometimes the governor sounds like you're more like the governor of the city of New York rather than the whole state that he's sort of comes across as the sort of\nYou know a opponent of the mayor of New York city and and you know and when he talks about infrastructure talks about all the great stuff going on with the airports are things like that any\nLately has not talked about the new bridge that crosses over from Westchester County to Rockland County and I wonder why that is that I suspect that might have something to do with the naming of the Brits support the name the Mario Cuomo rich with a new bridge\nYeah you know fill up for it on the issues that are wrapped up in the Mario Cuomo's slash Tappan Zee bridge\nThe naming of it is I Can't even spend any energy on that because I think about the fact that there are Seventeen hundred other bridges in New York state they're structurally deficient\nAnd we don't know how much it cost to rebuild that bridge we don't know how much is going to cost to go over that bridge and similarly with as a Andrew Cuomo announces these ... public private partnerships for airports in\nUh other things that he talks about being you know of course and went to Bob the builder\nThere are no details and ultimately the public's going to have to pay you cannot build billions of dollars of infrastructure and not be held accountable for how are you gonna do it and particularly when we have\nMTA crumbling around us and EU upstate you have roads and bridges which are in ... according to the society for civil engineers we have like a C plus rating\n...\nAre huge issues that he has been able to deflect because there have he refuses to answer follow up question\nSurely the fishing and we don't know how much it cost to rebuild that bridge we don't know how much is going to cost to go over that bridge and similarly with as a Andrew Cuomo announces these ... public private partnerships for airports in uh other things that he talks about being you know 'cause I went to Bob the builder\nThere are no details and ultimately the public's going to have to pay you cannot build billions of dollars of infrastructure and not be held accountable for how were you gonna do it and particularly when we have\nMTA crumbling around us and EU upstate you have roads and bridges which are in in ... according to the society for civil engineers we have like a C plus rating\n... these are huge issues that he has been able to deflect because there have he refuses to answer follow up questions\nWhen we don't even know what the polls are going to be I guess we're going to let us know what a couple of years interesting on the timing on that\nI'm no ah this also speaks to your experiences mare um uh we're talking with Stephanie motor I'm here in West coast or the average property taxes are sixteen thousand five hundred dollars um last last we checked I mean it's probably going up the suspects in from twenty Seventeen um\nThe local governments are or you know they're burning through the tax kept their their you know they're raising taxes is happening rather dramatically and stick in my home city of New Yorkers and so\nWe live in the highest tax county in the states and the only ones that are paying high property taxes as the whites than to the governance of the\nOr hasn't said that it's really up to the local officials to solve this problem by consolidating services which is a lot easier than it is it sounds a lot easier than it really is and cutting spending we're raising taxes and just living with the consequences of that\nAnd he was over the years I Know he's put him to come\nInto play some borrowing connects with only kick the can down the road um as as as the government cavalier in addressing the tax and budget issues facing localities\nAre absolutely I'm not here but it's been disingenuous when he\nPassed the property tax cat he said the first step was passing the two percent property tax got the next step was addressing unfunded mandate\nAccording to a study by Cornell University in New York has the highest level of unfunded mandates that have pushed down from the state level\nAnd when you look at governments like Yonkers and I saw a I think last week Westchester bond rating was downgraded her or upstate when you look at where they are spending the money they're spending it on a cop contractual mandated costs because of Albany policies\nSo it's pensions and health care that are driven by decisions that a state leaders in Albany make\nAnd then pass it down it's not wasteful spending\nAnd he's trying to distract by saying oh you know merger governments well you can merge governments but you're still going to have to pay those pension costs you're still going to have to pay retiree health care because of the decisions at all but he has made and candidly because\nNo ... there's a petition there's a group that has formed to impose your but some women burn up put a bill out to not take the named Mario Cuomo away but we store or tapping the to the new bridges may I mean would you support of storing the name of the Tappan Zee or if that bill came across it does\nYou know mark what I Would support is\nHave a do over where you had an open process that was allowed to be done when people could watch it 'cause I think based on\nMy subjective knowledge of the state that um if the process we're done openly and correctly and transparently I think it would be fine can name at the Mario Cuomo bridge it's similar to the same effect in a lot of ways that people reject and react so strongly to is the sense that\nGovernment doesn't work for them anymore or they're not included or they're somehow you know pushed out of the way when leaders think oh we don't want to hear their opinions we don't want to have them\nBe heard on these issues that to me is why you see people reacting so strongly and it's very destructive\nBecause you know if people don't believe that the government works for them then you you are not going to be able to solve problems are not going to be able to have buy in and you're going to continue to have this uh destruction so that is a long way of saying mark\nI Would support and open and transparent normal process where they could go through the naming rights so that the public would have a sense and inability to weigh in on that\nYeah that's the kind of thing that create sort of cynicism out there you know particularly when it's done in the morning like I was\nUm you know I'm Stephanie and we're talking to Stephanie minor candidate for governor I'm One of the you know the different Public Integrity or groups out there you know they\nThey they come up with grades on a level of corruption you know around the country and\nAnd uh you know New Yorkers pops up there on the Jersey\nAnd I was going to say thank God for Alabama man [laughter] yeah hello Caleb Amazon or number two right\nExactly so it was one that came out a couple of years ago that this is after all these indictments and convictions with state legislators and things like that\nAnd it came up with a like an old world creatively I think it was like the plus that I'm thinking why was the grid that good you know I mean right [laughter] I'm for it you know this is another thing that's really at governor Cuomo's you know uh\n[noise] you know on his front desk that his beat\nThe issue of corruption\nUm how corrupt as New York in your view and you think the governor himself as a corrupt governor\nLook I I think New York state is um is very corrupt and all you had to do is listen to what the judge said in the sentencing of Joe ... cocoa and talking about how\nI was going to say thank God for Alabama man [laughter] yeah OK Alabama's or wants or number two right\nExactly so it was one that came out a couple of years ago after all these documents and convictions and state legislators and things like that\nAnd it came up with a like an old world grew to like I think it was like the plus that I'm thinking why was the grid that good you know I mean right [laughter] I'm for you know this is another thing that's really a governor Cuomo's you know uh [noise] you know on his front desk that his beat\nThe issue of corruption\nUm how corrupt as New York and your view and you think the governor himself is a corrupt governor\nLook I I think New York state is um is very corrupt and all you had to do is listen to what\nThe judge said in the sentencing of Joe ... cocoa and talking about how New Yorkers would be and I'm paraphrasing here New Yorkers we'll be right to question if their views are important given all the money that's flowing through the process and I hold Andrew Cuomo to his own words when he ran\nFirst ran and he stood at the boss tweet\nA court Howard said he was going to ... uh he was going to clean up Albany and then he started the morally commissioning rent television commercials saying you know I work for the people and in very short order we saw that and you know the more land commission was over that the corruption continued on a unabated\nAnd that it goes right not just to his very doorstep but into his own office\nInto his are of economic development into two of the developers from upstate who gave him the most amount of money and just this week there was a story that the Rochester Democrat and chronicle ran which showed\nSince two thousand nine he's raised a hundred million dollars in campaign contributions an overwhelming percentage of that\nFrom people who have contracts are doing business with the state\nI think our ethics and our standards should be higher than just the ah federal criminal code but even if you do just the federal criminal code we've had the Senate majority leader a Republican\nOr go away we've had who was sentenced yesterday we've had the Democratic a\nMajority of the Democratic speaker of the assembly\nAnd the governor's right hand man there is a culture of corruption in Albany and both parties have been complicit in it and that is the threat that unites all of these ineffective public policies all the problems that New Yorkers have and the frustration that their views aren't being hurt and their problems are being solved\nWhen we pay the highest taxes in the country and yet our transit system isn't working our little worried about the quality of our education health care isn't working a property taxes continue to skyrocket\nOne has to wonder and then you say oh look he spent twenty seven billion dollars on economic development upstate and it didn't move the needle at all and what resulted in full time employment for criminal defense attorneys\nAnd one of the way he raises money it's spring called the L L U loophole which allows a campaign contributions to exceed the limit and he this was you know these kind of companies that are that are where the money is on all through\nUm you're supposed to be to go you eh well the loophole but it can make money when you finally get rid of the loophole\nIced I stopped taking yellow sea contributions in two thousand Fifteen I'm and I'm not taking them in this campaign which is by the way to put a serious competitive disadvantage yeah but I Believe it's corrosive to our democracy it's corrosive to the underlying\nBelief that people have and being able to understand who gives you a campaign contribution and the actions you take the L L C loophole allows unabated these backroom deals and for a backroom deals and benefits that go on so when you have a budget that's you know handed out\nWhich allows a campaign contributions to exceed the limit and he's that this was you know these are kind of big companies that are that are for the money is on all through um you're supposed to be the the L L L C loophole but it continues to take money would you finally get rid of that loophole\nWell I I stopped taking yellow sea contributions and two thousand Fifteen I'm and I'm not taking them in this campaign which is by the way but better serious competitive disadvantage yeah but I Believe it's corrosive to our democracy it's corrosive to the underlying\nBelief that people have and being able to understand who gives you a campaign contributions and the actions you take\nThe L L C loophole allows unabated these backroom deals and for a backroom deals and benefits that go on so we do have a budget that's you know handed out a and a big ugly with only forty eight hours and then you say oh my God how did they be or how is there a tax\nCut for yacht owners well you know it does take a genius to figure out somewhere in the L L\nFor no other break if you're going to hang on there Stephanie mortar sure we use and we're going to take another quick break can be right back\nHere is the latest updates from Fox News

start to wonder if somebody local doing this\nWell we all we all understand in Manhattan you can just put your hand out and get a bicycle couriers to to deliver something for you but it to go all the way up into the woods of north and west Chester county\nYeah no that makes it kind of yeah well I think that I think that the irony is Nancy it could be from Westchester or it might be Florida [laughter]\nYeah you're absolutely right [laughter] well we cook so who knows but I Do I you know I I think it's amazing how people have already started to uh you know the conservative movement is already decided that it must be Democrats who were doing this\nYeah just just like just like they're paying for the caravan [laughter]\nAnd I you know I saw on Twitter where there is a Westchester County Republican operative who says she is the ... well fed and showered and I'll say there are no showers on that bridge well I had to you and there's nobody delivering chick fillet too\nI just the level of conspiracy theory so incredible um first on the caravan can you imagine\nThe Democrats are paying for the caravan or the ... or or or George Soros is paying for the caravan somebody can hurt the Democrats and the general election because I only heard some adult male I'm just [laughter]\nI can understand that rationale\nJust just like just like they're paying for the caravan [laughter]\nAnd I you know I saw a Twitter where there is a Westchester County Republican operative who says she's a ... well fed and showered [laughter] and I'll say there are no showers on that bridge well I Do and there's nobody delivering chick fillet too\nI just the level of conspiracy theory is so incredible\nUm first on the caravan can you imagine the Democrats are paying for the characters are the ... or or or George Soros is paying for the caravan so that he can hurt the Democrats and the general election because I only heard some adult I'm [laughter]\nI can understand that rationale um and yeah I'm going to be\nThe first one but we do need immigration reform\nNo doubt about it but\nHow ... what Mr Soros in touch with all these people have to get them to form this that three thousand miles long human chain logistically it doesn't like pets\nNo he wasn't in touch with anybody here just in touch with the middle eastern people that are part of the ...\nAnd why was the middle east war three thousand can get on the air if I ...\nI it holds may stop so that you can run your base\nI think yeah\nBut and then and then they added a bombing that you know again this is the Democratic a plot we don't know who's done the whoever it is that is going to be someone who is an outsider who's either going to be probably someone on the far crazy right\nOr or the far right you know the floor crazy locked exactly but we but we don't know but it's certainly not in any normal member of any of the party's it's going to be an outside [noise]\nUm and uh my guess is it'll be the far right just because it why would someone the far left be risking hurting or any of these individuals\nBut but you don't know it could be we just don't know\nWhat we'll find out now believe hopefully we really don't\nKnow we don't but but but you know this just proves that the level of discourse needs to change and I hope our president a very responsible for the tone but he just sat and first rally being like WWE wrestling matches\nRight and that that creates the town that that we're all having to deal with uh these types of reactions both both on the left and the right because it's acting you know once you accept that tone at the presidential level\nThere's going to be response on the left I was going to be a justification on the right and you end up with this dynamic\nExact surprised who who who should be the night or not a divider\nYou know I was struck yesterday um by his initial comments which was a non Thomas\nTroy bubble there's no response on the left I was going to be a justification on the right and you end up with this dynamic exact suppress who could you should be the night or not a divider\nYou know I was struck yesterday um by his initial comments which was a non combat and Penn Penn but his wife was the one who actually at an event but first\nGot left well yes I was an eye out say they just had a yeah I I I I I find the right to use or that the Democrats who uses a responsible for creating the caravan driving around and now that we wanted to go to the news Louis possible for creating the bombs [noise]\nI never knew that Reggie Lafayette was so talented\nWell I mean the whole the whole thing is so absurd because we're responsible for the Taliban which is which which would only help the Republicans as far as messaging and then and then we'll responsible for the bombs that if they ... made would only be hurting people that we like well I you know what I'm going to\nTake ... Sandra Sanders a steel online and in fact the president's we're responsible for nothing on last week took seats and it was good that will respond\n[laughter] that's well that's true that's that's how they operate\nRight I I mean it's sort of you know look not playing politics right now we're all responsibility a for what's going on but the president has the bully pulp\nAnd he's the one he or she is the one that really needs to stand up and said Bush is not a matter of good this is not will not be tolerated\nA and stop and in both sides need to stop on the rhetoric president can't go to a a a a a\nState and say I like people who body slam people uh I like like I like people bunnies family quarters and not expect that guy is going to create negative problems\nAnd the answer we we we've had this discussion I'm you know back and forth and I know you're beautiful five foot not starting [noise]\nAh you you go into a crowd with these angry mobs\nI I don't care if you have six foot four hulking Florida you got to be nervous with the anger and hostility\nVendors shown procedures in place I mean again it only takes one person who's in the little coverage by the president or someone else to do something that we all would be\nMe to stop on the rhetoric president can't go to a a a a a\nState and say I like people who body slammed people uh I like like I like people bodies friendly port is not expect that guy is going to create negatives problems\nAnd the answer we we've had this discussion I'm you know back and forth and I know you're beautiful Pfeifer not starting\nA ... you go into a crowd with these angry mobs\nI I don't care if he was six foot four hulking reporter you got to be nervous with the anger and hostility\nThat was it was shown procedures in place and again it only takes one person who's in the little coverage by the president or someone else to do something that we all would be very savvy happens\nWhile I I I think that that you know the president has to take responsibility for setting the tone and everything else uh everybody else take responsibility for their reaction to that town but but the president is the one who was a set the tone\nWell yes and you would think I Am I'm Hi I'm so disappointed in in in the Republicans they know it's not that long ago that they almost lost one of the uh may keep a steep streets are because some looted tech\nFelt that was okay to the uh go to a baseball game and\nStart shooting up congressman [noise]\nUm you know and again we don't let you know\nIt as I say it only takes one pressure to be encouraged to do something that we all ... will feel is a great tragedy and decided that happens we have ... you can't put down the rhetoric the president again as the leader of our country\nHas the greater responsibility and and and the Santa Santa says he goes no responsibility she's out to lunch\nWell he failed to believe in the way that any other president would have in this circumstance\nI was just a complete failure on it and\nHe tried to be a ... ... and try to be above this type of petty politics he's not capable of of that he's not capable of being a leader in a manner that any other Republican president or Democratic president in my lifetime would have been\nWell and and that's that's the the the biggest problem that I think we have is that a whatever you say goodbye to ... they they at least try to unite the country and they didn't go out and practice so divided and that's that's what we have govern lineman out [noise]\nAnd you know as I think you're saying thanks for the grace of God nobody has been been injured or killed in one with one of these bombs and you know it's it sounds like it's not\nYou know it can be haphazard so you know sadly someone who wasn't intended to get killed may may be the collateral damage that occurred at the cause of this [noise]\nSo you know beat this is this is what is going on now is quote terrorism that that's the definition of a scary but public and that's what we have now and you know we all gas\nYou know all of us on a daily basis got like three or four packages now to our house thanks to Amazon and everybody else what

that he is working on right now his book the death of a nation which has now become a movie is probably the most important\nUh portrayal of the crisis in America since the civil war Mr dishes are you there\nI'm here and I'm Glad to be on the show\nOkay and I have to say I enjoyed you on the joke pitch to post show who's a dear friend of mine Frank Marino and I love watching you on Fox News show tell us a little bit to start out with about death of the nation the book and the movie and why you did it\nWell I like to do the in the book and the movie as a kind of ... to ... because the movie is in a moment no merit of\nAte a lot of that going on them be visually and emotionally engaged\nOr the book then lays out the argument that the more the adequate and had all the supporting a\nRoute so that detail is all in the book but the um narrative is in the movie for the movie theater it's now a on digital streaming will be out in DVD very quickly\nAnd the book is in the book stores so um I like you know I started out as an odd or twenty five years ago and I'm not written something like Fifteen or sixteen book or a made for a documentary film so I'm a little bit of a new come right that this film making\nBut uh I've done four of them and they have all they have all been among the highest grossing political documentary but have been made\nAnd you've been in this for quite a long time way before Donald Trump or announced his candidacy for president so a lot of people think oh a tenacious just choose to always be an apologist for Donald Trump he's been touting\nAmerican values for very long time and now it seems that we've come into a crisis situation since the election of Donald Trump\n[noise] yes I was not actually a a you could call it and they're written a crumb gr and by that I mean um my wife and I were married in March when the ... by rock created\nA Ted Cruz is bad but um and we would have been identified probably a little bit more with the crews camped just because of our association with a family and now of course when Trump became the nominee\nUm I came on board um I made the movie Hillary America and also I recognize that American politics who fought in team and so the issue for me\nHe's an apologist for Donald Trump he's been touting American values for very long time and now it seems that we've come into a crisis situation shouldn't the election of Donald Trump\n[noise] yes I was not actually a a you could call it an original Trump gr and by that I mean um my wife and I were married in March twenty sixteen by ... who's\nA Ted Cruz's sad um and we would have been identified probably a little bit more with the crews camped just because of our association with a family and now of course when Trump became the nominee\nUm I came on board um I made the movie Hillary's America and also I recognize that American politics 'cause it's fought in team and so the issue for me was\nA there are two choices on the table that Trump is Hillary it's going to be one or the other and I certainly for thought out that choice\nAnd and I think a ... to ... that many fish feel the same way I I I was a Democrat or a registered Democrat I don't know why until twenty Fifteen and John I certainly wasn't a Trump supporter but I found myself liking Trump and supporting Trump and defending Trump\nBecause he just he didn't like the people who are lining up against Trump and what they were doing and it reminded me a lot of what happened when Abraham Lincoln was elected president back in Eighteen chick ...\nI made the controversial thinking a movie that of a nation to more the images of Lincoln and Trump on the poster and even come to Republican through the double tape and they were like oh you know how can you compare Trump\nWith Lincoln and I said look I'm not comparing them in terms of personality or actually the\nMan Lincoln was was brooding and melancholy in philosophical I caught the very different but\nIt's such a waste of her actually eerily similar I think about it if you had a ... a candidate the Republican Lincoln was elected quite narrowly and from that moment of his election you might say that all hell broke loose the other party which was the Democratic party or was absolutely a gaffe\nIn the north undermining Lincoln every what could they weren't that many people calling for his assassination which happened late later in the south or the southern Democrats decided to break up the country rather than indoor Lincoln collection so\nWhile one can never find inexact parallel in history we find a a resonance between what happened in the Eighteen sixties and what's been happening since Trump's election\n[noise] and I think that would would really make people ah get up in arms against Trump\nHe fights back but you know what we back then\nIn the early Eighteen sixties Abraham Lincoln fought back to only he he didn't have the opportunity to tweet what to be on TV but you know part of surviving and having the nation should live and I think we're no survival situation\nFor the president to fight back\nWell this is ah as you say this is Trump's distinguishing characteristic or his political bravery\nAnd his refusal to be cowed by really an unprecedented level of a pack not just from the Democratic party\nBut from academia in Hollywood and the media and even some guys in the Republican Party a Republican or cause them to the in vertebrate type of candidate or a McCain or a Romney win attacked immediately\nWay back then in the early teens ... Abraham Lincoln fought back to only he he didn't have the opportunity to tweet ought to be on TV but you know part of surviving and having the nation should live and I think one of those survival situation\nIs for the president to fight back\nWell this is ah as you say this is Trump did speak English uncharacteristic a have a medical bravery\nAnd his refusal to be cowed by really an unprecedented level of attack not just from the Democratic party but from academia and Hollywood and the media\nAnd even some guys in the Republican Party a Republican or cause them to be in

and our all had a lock the offer was what follows all thank you so much I think yeah\nThose are the you're just joining us um some of it in and out of correlate it a little bit to being similar to shape the gray and um I Know you were saying you're not exactly sure why but you don't take it I'll tell you that they don't have to leave all very well and I hope all the best you that it's similar to that\nAnd I'm going to get the little bit to my next cats in general you know\nKind of um had were you talking about her book being very similar twilight and the funny thing is she thinks she doesn't see it either but hey I Hope our book on this road twilight as well you know\nThat would be awesome things so I have to say we were reading all these reviews I read on the back of the jacket of it and they'll do that and if I Want to relate\nHow you see the story how would you sum it up when I'm reading this back over without giving away too much the story\nWell if it's got a love story first and foremost um obviously when people make fifty shades of gray comparison\nUm they may be thinking more of it's more a romance novel than it is ironic fiction there are elements Rodney fiction has the story it's basically a love story that takes place I'm On a basically a yoga studio between a yoga teacher and the students\nAnd the the yoga students and struggling with anxiety issues\nUm [noise] and he comes basically you know a baby in the woods where yoga is concerned and that's basically part of his character arc where he he basically need to discover what's going on inside his heart and inside his own mind and in learning about himself he ended up falling in love with this yoga teacher\nAnd John it's one of those that you're one of those forbidden love story\nIs one of those stories where um it's a complicated situation it's a little model of books [laughter]\nUm and it's um I I honestly think I'm a ... it's a it's a story you know this is my sales pitch but I usually give to people if I have to try to figure out a way in which for them to decide whether or not the book it for them\nI say after yourself to question the first one is um do you believe in the power of love and the second question is do you believe in the healing power of yoga and if you've answered yes to either one of those questions then there's something in this book for you [noise]\nSo that's that's pretty much my\nSo you know again I mentioned on Amazon argued that you've had hit the really cool and I would be a shame not to mention so some of the ... and what a great read I'm a lover of yoga but not always one for romance novel\nOne of those that you're one of those forbidden love story it's one of those stories where um it's a complicated situation it's\nStill a model of books [laughter]\nUm and it's um I I honestly think I'm a it's it's it's a story you know this is my sales pitch but I usually give to people if I have to try to figure out a way in which for them to decide whether or not the book it for them\nI say ask yourself to questions the first one is um do you believe in the power of love and the second question is do you believe in the healing power of yoga and if you've answered yes either one of those questions then there's something in this book for you [noise]\nSo that's that's pretty much my\nSo you know again I mentioned on Amazon argued that you had hit the really cool and I would be a shame not to mention in Britain what a great read I'm a mother of yoga but not always one for romance novel that being said this book and definitely changed my tune the perfect mix of love law spent\nThe characters are very reliable and definitely make you get lost in their world should definitely check the book out amongst Reid if you're looking for something a little bit different but also hopes of aiding and really\nSo like I said I'd ask you before what you know\nWhat you were proud of the most out of so many things that people that about you but I Know you've been going around in time doing oh signings and things like that and just for the time sure for signing you've been doing I'm sure you've met people that are already read the book what are your most memorable experience and the people that you've spoken to\n[noise] well I mean um there was there was one particular person who came to the uh we had a signing a Barnes and noble on a on Yonkers in a central avenue in Yonkers New York and I'm someone came to the to the table or and they had actually bought their coffee with them that they had already purchased on Amazon\nIn order for me to sign it and they said that when they saw that there was a finding that they were really excited to meet me which was which I mean I was blown away by the enthusiasm and she said that um that the book\nHad basically convinced her to join a yoga studio [laughter]\nWhich I mean again I honestly think that it's not just the love story it's also love story with the art and practice of yoga now so I mean the idea that she ... she kinda got it she got the idea that it it it's more than just a story about a lot of things to people it's about the yoga itself as well\nChange what sport because if you want to call their article [noise] so I you know I Want to know to an all you want to ... tell me a little bit about\nHow sure um well it's a it's basically a it's called the and I eat a finalist metal now I'm full disclosure I'm In in my particular category they're probably about a hundred books and they gave away a winner model winters metal\nAnd a two finalists metal is kind of the equivalent of a goals into Silvers or the Olympics [noise] um so basically uh [noise]\nUh it's um uh if it was kind of the equivalent of getting the silver medal at the Olympics are but then again being in the top three out of out of a hundred books are more than happy\nWell again that is amazing complement and I know you've been doing writers' workshop where can people find out more about that if they'd like to get into another one yeah\nBooks are more than happy well yeah and that is amazing compliment and I know you've been doing writers' workshop where can people find out more about that if they'd like getting that one yeah\nUm let's trust that people have when it comes to that time whether it is [noise] supernatural things are being evil you have all that much hunting stuff going on at that time period so anything that's different is\nBad but of course there's romance\nSo you know I have that there has made a really cool reviews that I you know look I was saying also\nAbout the last thought that was on both of you guys I didn't hear all negative review on Amazon for you I Want to read some of them and\nTell me what that means you so one of the review the characters are both even touching their loneliness caused by misunderstanding and fear well written on par with the novel twilight so I Want to ask and I know we've spoken about that before would you agree with that that there are some similarity twilight and were you influenced at all by that her right and that way\nUm but it's not influenced at all but I can see maybe how they see the romance end up supernatural element as being similar to try a lot of time but other than that it's more of a murder mystery so totally not your intention not my intention that although\nI Will say this I'm hoping that you\nGet the you know the tension in the way trial I did it and if people want to make that connection so be it [laughter] that would be pretty cool\n[laughter] we'll cross our fingers or a ... a little bit about your because like I said the show was also about the person and what makes them who they are you know so tell me about your wife how did you grow up how did you get is a writer\nI've always wanted to be a writer as far back as I can remember but mostly around my dad was military so every couple of years we picked up ... and that experience has given me a lot of things that I wouldn't have had otherwise just\nPicking up moving you go and you see new things that gives you a different aspect in a different view for called hers everything so would you say like having an experienced in maybe like gave you more ideas who have told me to write about more ideas and\nThe ability to take my opinions from one person to another of ice so Mickey my character ... says really helps with that\nSo one thing I have to say that's really cool and like I always say I always put\nLinks website thing like that on my website for my gas and I'm going to be doing the same for you know when you guys get home you know if you're driving right now check out the only way to put on give me a day or two for her it was really cool thing I was saying before as a teacher I thought I Would love the show my food\nAnd that experience has given me a lot of things that I wouldn't have had otherwise just\nPicking up moving you go and you see new things that gives you a different aspect in a different view\nFor called hers everything\nSo would you say like having spirit is maybe like gave you more ideas who have told me to write about more ideas and the ability to take my opinions from one person to another guy so Mickey my character's diverse who's really helped with that\nSo one thing I have to say that's really cool and like I always say I always put\nLinks website things like that on my website for my gas and I'm going to be doing the same for you to do when you guys get home you know if you're driving right now check out the link to put on give me a day or two for her long really cool thing I was saying before as a teacher I thought I Would love the show my food your website\n'cause you get tips to writers um I happen to think and I know you were saying you were just giving it to writer in general people that want to write\nBut I feel like it really would speak to the younger audience because it's put in a way where it's not overly worthy and if there's

the word curia Brian Geri thanks running on a here we're talking about Chelsea Clinton running for office we are talking about Hillary sort of playing zombies you won't go away you were starting ... story I and I had to have a job\nAnd I was in my early twenties one of my first my first primary hours running for a seat on the Republican state committee and I've been involved in politics for over a decade I'd been a city council candidate done a lot of stuff\nAnd it last minute the party bosses put the son of a former Republican congressman into the race against me thinking that his father's name recognition and all that would make me you know easy pickings and the conventional wisdom was that I was going to get my butt kicked\nWell you know I get a mailing basically asked the borders are my district who do you have more in common with the son of a congressman or the son of an iron worker I got sixty five percent of the vote\nSo it may not be the decisive factor that Chelsea's mom is the former first lady and her dad's the former president the right kind of candidate the right kind of campaign if she's not really willing to do the legwork and nothing's impossible East Asian politics\nI Know that no no question in ... times are very different now with with all the media that that you can use and everything else so perhaps you're right but\nBut we do have a sense of entitlement Jerry let's talk about this says the situation there who's involved in the last uh thirty six twenty four hours what have you with these now can I Believe I heard on the way in here purported pipe bombs\nI said purported because there's all this talk none of them exploded the the the the police commissioner of New York who's on the radio about a half hour ago I heard him completely puzzled it sounded like\nBy the fact that not one of these things thank goodness but no one of these things have exploded there was some talk this morning that they would didn't grind not to actually detonate um so so I that's why I guess I'm kinda calling them alleged pipe bomb or something like that I'm\nA look any way shape or form this this is the work of a crazy I'm I suspect in this day and age will know who they're crazy used in a matter of days get given the way they investigate these things um\nBut ... to me there's the bigger issue here you know it it's really easy and of course the Democrats have done it in the media is doing it well you know what do you expect with rhetoric coming out of out of a Donald Trump\nAnd you know Jerry nobody is more disgusted by the rhetoric that comes out of them than I Am\nBut no one of these things have exploded there was some talk this morning that they would design not to actually detonate um so so I that's why I guess I'm kind of calling them alleged pipe bombs or something like that I'm a look any way shape or form\nDo do the work of crazy I'm I suspect in this day and age will know who they're crazy used in a matter of days that given the way they investigate these things um\nBut to me there's a bigger issue here you know it's really easy and of course the Democrat some done it in the media is doing it well you know what do you expect with the rhetoric coming out of out of a Donald Trump\nAnd you know Jerry\nNobody is more disgusted by the rhetoric that comes out of them than I Am I'm but to me it's bigger than Donald Trump frankly that rhetoric Donald Trump's no stupid person and that rhetoric would be coming out of him if it was not working with a certain group of people in the ... base\nWe saw what went on with the Brett Kavanaugh hearings and and you can again agree or disagree with the result there and with with professor block sea Ford\nBut there were an awful lot of otherwise rational Democrats who were more than happy to believe his outrageously absurd gang rape charges for Martha Lebanon the and and and the woman that heat the book book to the party um\nThere's just something that's wrong with our politics and and how did it happen and how do we fix it and I know those are questions we can discuss for next week but what's the what what are your thoughts\n[noise] well I mean my basic thought is one of the cornerstones of American democracy is that we solve our disputes with ballots not bullets and when that stops happening we have very serious problems you\nKnow I've always believed that one of the reasons why America has been as successful as it is but a lot of without a lot of the internal strife is that we've had\nA separation of church and state here so that neighbor versus neighbor because of their religious differences has never really been an issue now that has been somewhat war underway in recent years thanks to the work of evangelicals and some of the other cooks in the right wing movement they want\nChristian version of sharia law and try and into law because they feel somehow threatened as white Christian Americans not just nutty\nUm there is something very base going on in politics and it's not just in politics we seat and they aren't receipt and media\nWe seen an entertainment seat in sports there is a coarsening of character that was not here forty or fifty years ago and it's not television or the movies I think they're more reflection of what's going on in society than anything else if something wasn't going to appeal to an audience\nThan the networks in the studios would never aired it wouldn't have a release it into the theater's so there is something about the American character that is turning towards a course are more violent approach to public life and it's damn ugly\nOkay but but but to play the devil's advocate you you're you're talking about right wing evangelical\nUm some of those even those who would argue that yes there used to coarsening because we don't have prayer in school were not allowed to teach character in schools were not allowed to punish\nAbout the American character that is turning towards a course or more violent approach to public life and it's damn ugly\nOkay but but but to play the devil's advocate here you're talking about right wing evangelical\nUm some of those evangelical would argue that yes there is of course in ... because we don't have her in school were not allowed to teach character in schools were not allowed to punish\nOr this city council is clearly afraid of the voters they know that the voters don't want them to repeal term limits I'm so they are doing at the back room way they're just going to happen\nHere in New York City under Bloomberg it yeah they were repeated referendum for term limits and they always won overwhelmingly right and it's it's the elected officials who seem to forgotten the word to Charles de Gaulle which were you know the cemeteries of the world are filled with indispensable met\n[laughter] well you know what you you you bring me to my first point I invited a my Seventeen or the majority leader and Mike Breen minority leader I reached out to both of them today asked them to call in\nAnd explain what they're doing defend what they're doing a I never heard back from Mike bringing the minority leader I did hear from Mike sabotage you know the majority leader\nAnd what did you say well before I tell you what he said just a little perspective I remember back in Ninety four young and naive thing that I was I couldn't understand why any politician I mean eight years to me was why would you even want to be in office more than eight years [noise]\nUntil someone was in my ear and explained that you don't fully best in the state pension system until you're ten so for example I served eight years in the city council I lost the mayor's race I left office\nI get I got like a lump sum of I don't know seven or eight thousand dollars which was my pension contributions\nAnd I used to pay my son's tuition I get nothing else I'll get no health care all get no nothing if I was in office just two more years and reached that magic and then when I hit the right retirement age my wife and I would get lifetime healthcare subsidized by the taxpayers of New York state I'm\nLike an even better reason for term limits to just simply [laughter] I'm like oh\nNo so so that's the that's the argument of course that they don't talk about the arguments they do talk about it and then at least here in Yonkers Seventeen oh in bringing have used it as oh young patients doing so well Yonkers is moving forward Yonkers is so so in fact my Seventeen are said to me\nIn the city council I lost the mayor's race I left office\nI get I got like a lump sum of I don't know seven or eight thousand dollars which was my pension contributions\nAnd I used it to pay my son's tuition I get nothing else I'll get no health care all get no nothing if I was in office just two more years and reached that magic and then when I hit the right retirement age my wife and I would get lifetime healthcare subsidized by the taxpayers of New York state I'm\nLike an even better reason for term limits to just simply [laughter] ...\nWell no so so that's the that's the argument of course that they don't talk about the arguments they do talk about it and then at least here in Yonkers Seventeen oh in bringing have used it as oh Yonkers is doing so well Yonkers is moving forward Yonkers is so so in fact\nMy Seventeen are said to me and it very polite email but he says\nJust one thing to clear up people are saying I'm doing this to make myself eligible for pension and healthcare\nIt does to those that don't know I'm already invested in here three and qualify for health care already\nOkay so he gets to pass on that one then he goes on to say my feelings are the there's been a great renaissance here\nAnd there is still more work to do and I'm happy with the mayor's team well not to put too fine a point on it but first of all he's probably happy with the mayor's team because his husband is on the mayor's team whose husband works for the mayor so I got to be a little\nI hate to say it just one man's opinion satisfactory opinion but I have a question the independence of any legislator\nIn in in in city hall whose spouse\nGets a paycheck from the mayor\nYou know two ... two floors down that's number one number to be the arrogance to your point in Charleston goals point Gerry the arrogance of these people to believe that\nIf things are going well and there's lots of people who would debate whether that's things are going well you have a six point lead encouraging you to do well the only ones who can really\nHear leaders well Gerry Ewing with me the whole way you've got me reelected dino seven you help me run for mayor in in twenty eleven I I like to think I Would have done a good job but I have been completely out of Yonkers politics in and and Yonkers government for seven years and you know what\nYonkers has mobile belong just fine without John Murtha\nThere is nothing more obnoxious than the arrogance of incumbents\n... it's ... and yet and yet this well this is what they're going to try to do I I've got a little\nNote in my pocket to myself 'cause you know under the court's decisions because people try to challenge Bloomberg and the court said no even though this was approved by referendum you can change it by a vote of the city council\nA I think that's what they're relying on I'm not sure they read the Yonkers charter as closely as they should have and I think there's an argument that they can't even do this\nUh but that will have to wait another day until they cry but\nUm but uh but it it just it's mind boggling to me and and\nOther than the mayor's cronies there's nobody out there supporting this thing\n[noise] you know it's one thing to believe that you have something to offer public service uh you know a scale mindset and approach whatever\nIt's another to feel that you know the whole thing will fall apart if you're not allowed to continue an office

Would like to tell you that I was surprised but what you have seen over and over again is that the government has taken care of vested special interests and I think the business council a represents a number of vested special interests they are only talking to a few\nA few people not everyone and so the next time that the business council complains about the\nLack of good infrastructure or the lack of a good business climate you know that this I think everybody should remember this that there there is accountability and consequences for decisions like this and everybody will say they want change

have is to stand in line for Hunger Games types of competitions or a benefits you know tax\nCredits and benefits that get handed out to a lucky few\nUh and that the state is picking winners and everybody else's losers and so they're really faced with this consequences can we actually fix the system and part of what they were saying to me is we believe in your message that the system is

out\nVery rich benefits to a favorite few and paying lawyers and lobbyists to do that is not working for most of New York and by the way for that doesn't even include of course all of the people who

of grudge match where the choice was either I'm a Donald Trump or Andrew Cuomo and I think that voters understand that it's much more sophisticated decision and that and that's just yet again another reason why that debate was a disservice\nTo our political system um and as long as we continue to tolerate that we're not going to get better results you\nKnow many people who saw the debate ... I'm sure you know commented on the governor's seeming a nearing our origins and that's widely a description as widely used for him did you see that you agree that he is that way and did you see that when you were working with him at the state democratic committee\nYou know Fred I like I don't really pay attention to those kinds of things what I saw as a matter of the city of Syracuse is that we had real issues and every time I turn to the state leadership asking to help\nI was met with a policy that was perfectly constructed for optics and the press release in a on a groundbreaking but was ...
