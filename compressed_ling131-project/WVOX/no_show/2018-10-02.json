B. O. X. fourteen sixty are still coming I'm sure you're my charm and co hosts as nice as I get evening great show tonight very and we haven't we had a very nice experience we have been\nA I Would say we've been going to the west especially with dinner theater probably for the last ... over Twenty years oh well it was a well there was one of us don't don't do what is your cells to most orders but recently we had the opportunity to see\nFavorite shows it's phantom of the opera\nAnd we have on the line now we have the star of ... it was absolute truth or she has a gorgeous voice and she was a terrific actress\nAnd we'll get a chance to talk to the show by the way ran originally now we we have to what the people know this is not the fan from the opera that they think there'll be ... or later whether version what spoke told her that and we'll talk about our okay well let's introduce our guest now and I miss the came a\nPsycho Bible or later okay well we'll get through there how are you good welcome thank God how are you ... you played this great role now after seeing you in a hearing you are for God this woman's name or\nWhat is her name from Broadway Sarah that were bright men [laughter] okay we should federal primary issue harder family much better\n[laughter] ... I have a question now when you get ready for these shows are especially if fans will be opera but you go back to the old one beer Andrew Lloyd Webber person that you have a chance to look that at all\nUm I mean I have no you're right that for sure but I stopped looking like part of my process are getting ready for that um show because I have questions really winding down into character there you know little decorating exactly based on the same novel by running that too\nI'm good how are you\nYou're worth this great role model if you want to know when you are going to ... or\nWorse than I Am from abroad one syllable right there were brought them [laughter] ochre abroad when you're older family much better\n[laughter] generally an arm of course you know when you run or your friends will be our ... year old woman rubber personal\nUm I mean I ... familiar with it for sure but I that wasn't really part of my process for getting ready for this um show because I\nOf course just really wanted to do with the characters are you know a little different there's definitely based on the same novel but run the two the two versions definitely have their own take on the characters and so I just really wanted to delve into this version and what I could\nOpen his own them that Kaylee why don't you tell the audience without giving away too much [laughter] oh some of the basic differences between the Andrew Lloyd Webber version that I think most people are familiar with and this version\nSure um well to me I think the biggest things are the ... version is definitely a lot more\nFalling through whereas the um yes and coke at version that we're doing has more books than if there's more dialogue okay um so I'm more like a you know what you think of when you think of the regular um musical\nUm but then something that I find really special as I just think the characters are\nUm more developed and this bird and\nMore believable I think the biggest difference um comes with the fans send because then the ... version he tends to be more sex the doctor which I find it\nHard to wrap my head around because he spoke to has been secluded for his whole life so it's like how did he learn how to be that way whereas in the ... version he's a little more socially awkward honestly just he's finally having these experiences\nI'm an experience with a woman you know and willing and love it it's kind of like you know how a middle schooler would be have with a woman like not really sure what to do and so there's I think it's easier to really get into the heart of the phantom\nYeah I I have some version I think he's much more sympathetic character which one yeah much more you want to go yeah definitely don't really sympathize with the one that mantle Lloyd Weber version opens right\n... ... or we know you've done some burnt and learn more work to address that you're working on recently ... every one of those words [laughter]\nOriginally I Know that kind of\nA don't burn on

I was handed now when people when people find out about your philosophy use and you're in a group ... how\nHow does it work typical into session is it individual why what happens how how old are your best to take advantage of after I've read the book\nWhat would I Do next will be my next step\nBut it's a great question so I Do have private coaching that's somebody wants to apply this knowledge in their life and let's say they want to change career or they wanna\nRelationship that's gonna work for them than I coached them and it's just words pun intended I coached them to play their cards right now because it's when we actually for example play like Susan when you really focus on playing a ton of clubs as well which sounds like you've probably already are near hosting the show\nAnd it's a way for you to share your wisdom in life\nWhat I've noticed with my private quite coaching clients is that when we play cards right magic happens really and truly like synchronous city serendipity the right people show up and so on so I had the private coaching practice\nI also teach classes online for people who wanted to learn how the system works and so that's if you are wanting to kind of dig into well how does what's acts of terror mathematics work and how'd you calculate the Thirteen cards and\nWhat all the cards mean and what does it suits me so that's a little bit different that's for people who want to learn this system so I have classes that people can take some online on the website lifestyle of life\nIn ... when you tell us some uh now how long have you been having me sessions or the or the whole concept of your organization how long have you been doing that now\nI've been doing this for ten years now okay and um you know it was very challenging for us that must say and I remember when I ten years ago first decided to do this my family thought it was crazy\nBut he is the right people show up and so on so I had the private coaching practice I also teach classes online for people who want to learn how the system works and so that's if you're wanting to kind of dig into well how does the secretary mathematics work and how'd you calculate the thirteenth cards and\nWhat all the cards mean and what are the suits me so that's a little bit different that's for people who want to learn the system so I have classes that people can take and I got some online on the website lifestyle life\nOkay and then you tell us some uh now how long have you been having sessions or the or the whole concept of your organization how long have you been doing that now\nI've been doing this for ten years now okay and um you know it was very challenging first I must say and I remember when I ten years ago first decided to do this my family thought it was crazy um you know I was appointed comparison my younger sister is a partner at Deloitte and touche\nSo they're very conservative family and I come from that background I went to Harvard I worked on Wall street\nAnd my family was like what are you doing this nonsense playing cards and I ... I was so moved by it in my own search for answers\nThat I was I was like everybody needs to know this this system of knowledge is so accurate and so helpful and it's been buried for so long\nUm that I just want to bring this out and share it with people so but it was challenging it first and there were a lot of skeptics but now I built a following and have regular students I have an advance circle of students and the mentoring group\nAnd I have a a number of coaching clients and you know now published book and um you know things are rolling and there's a lot of interest\nI was in a lot of people yeah\nOK to tell us the most success that your favorite give us a little example of something in the in the ... and the parents that you know to your your most proud of\nLike a much more border point where many will get clients of his many um\nSo uh well I guess I could pick this one as as soon as we send 'em a woman who had a fairytale wedding I really like an in her own words fairy tale outcome where she was jaded and she'd given up ever finding love\nAnd by understanding her heart's to play by changing her entire outlook\n'cause this is what often happens is we're going about it all the wrong way and not getting the results we bought\nAnd we're not in tune with our energy it's a little bit like a golf or musical instrument cuts out of tune were clanging through life and when we learned how to be in tune with these patterns when these cards and we start to play them well we created a beautiful sound energetically speaking\nAnd then we attract to ourselves what we want it in her case it was the man of her dreams after she'd given up hope\nAnd had many disappointing relationships and then when she ... we've touched she played her tune found that this man showed up for her and they recently got married and to her it was very tell wedding\nSo that happened yet on whether I help people and relationships or business by tuning into yourself then truly being authentically who you are then you create what's right for you when your life\nAnd I think that happens yeah yeah I Know I just wanted to ask you something so let's say you're you're dealing with a married couple and their kind of\nDiametrically opposed shall we say I'm ... is there a way to like work through there so that you can you can stay together and both be the people you are but\nAfter she'd given up hope and had many disappointing relationships\nAnd then when she ... was touched she played her tune found that this man showed up for her and I recently got married and to her it was er into wedding\nSo that happened you know whether I help people and relationships or business by tuning into yourself then truly being authentic Lee who you are and you create what strikes you when your life\nAnd I think that a little bit yeah I Know I just wanted to ask you something so let's say you're you're dealing with a married couple and their kind of diametrically opposed shall we say\nI'm ... is there a way to like work through there so that you can you can stay together and both the the people you are but still be\nYou know compatible and still work through things what kind of like astrology where you know ... why should never get together because they'll never work\nYou know it's funny the partners who I'm with now that split her astrology both told her when she first met me okay I and uh but yet we're actually very good match and the cards and that's a great question I imagine there's room for irresponsibility in utilizing this\nKnowledge found in the playing cards as well because I find that the irresponsible to say things like that um but the way that I Do about it is and the way I teach my students\nThat we can't ever so if the relationship is going to succeed or fail all that we can say is what are the patterns going to be what are the dynamics going to be so I can look at a relationship and I can say oh\nThis is a relationship where you're gonna learn important life lessons or oh this is a relationship with is going to be a lot of intimacy what a lot of romance as as a relationship where there might be a lot of expansion a lot of financial blessing\nThis is a relationship where there may be some shadows then you don't see each other clearly and then I often ask\nThe clients all say well is this what you are is this how you want your relationship to be because these patterns or they're they're not going to change\nIts really just a question of are those the patterns that you want or would you prefer different patterns ...\nMentioned it very interesting I mean ... but by the way that wasn't about describing Susan my we do everything together to a point where she hates\nMe [laughter]\nWe do so many things together we do a radio show together wrote a book together we do actually do tours of New York city we've been together for fourteen years so a really awesome to making excuses on that\nI'm ... now how did you first uh what's your background and I'm I'm looking at your back Ron ... a woman in Wall Street I'm like I Love the fact that you have\nYou spent many ah I guess I'm not sure how long a period of time in India which has spent time in ... by the way we have a um a tour business and we we will do about Seventy towards the people from India\nWhile I'm teaching them Hindi as a matter of fact I'm worried about him and we have the expressions that we learn which I won't even tell you in the air because Trump will we get in trouble with but we have a\nWe're fascinated by Indian culture so you have all this back round when when did the reading ... reading of the cards is that is that the correct correct yeah you can say that\nMy wife went to the world is ... and being a or you know studying to be a I guess in a slum in meditating and doing well in fast thing that all the things that you've done in in in culture when did you win the playing cause first come into being and how did that start\nFor me\nTime in India which has been telling me to do by the way we have a um a tour business and we we will do about Seventy towards the people from India while I'm teaching um Hindi as a matter of fact I'm learning how to do and we have the expressions that we learn which I won't even tell you on the air because Trump will we get in trouble with but we have a\nWe're fascinated by Indian culture\nSo you have all this back round\nWhen when did the reading ... reading of the cars is that is that the correct correct yeah you could pay that many more wind up in the world is ...\nAnd being or are you know studying to be a I guess in a slum in meditating and doing well in fast thing of all the things that you've done in in in culture when did you when did the playing cause first come into being and how did that start\nFor me or when they come into being for you have your from you I'm well it was\nIn a lot of two thousand and eight I'm all animals\nI was going through divorce at the time I'm soul was in the crossroads moment of my life\nAnd the way it happened is actually worth telling because it's really interesting synchronous city of it um it was the day after I found out I was getting divorced with divorce papers on on the table and I went out to a party in Brooklyn\nI just needed to clear my head and go out from see some friends and\nI go walk into the party and I see an old friend who I knew from burning man safe to go to burning man\nAnd he says to me what you did a bird\nLike a August thirtieth why any says oh your birth card is the night of hearts and mind what was going on in my life and he says oh that means your life path is one where you're going to go through tragic endings at the heart and you gotta learn how to let go and move on\n... and I I actually did it affect my niece got weak and like the air felt around the added deja vu moment\nUh what what what did you just say and she didn't know what was going on in my life right now is my first introduction to the real meaning of these playing cards and well you know it hit me like a ton of bricks and I stopped when I was doing I was leaving you know we had a holistic business together and I was leaving that anyway and\nOkay um when everyone knows that the gallon bart kills Alexander Hamilton and many years later barbaric the richest woman in New York\nAnd like she

we're going to get right to our next guest or fortunately we have a some time to talk with them she's an attorney Lauren pie razor and she represents\nThe cupcake boutique that into the store in Mount Vernon owned by a step daughter of team and Jones who also he's the managing editor of West Chester a black Westchester magazine\nAnd he is suing or rather he is not to get the stores showing the mayor so let's hear from the water find the basis of that to a he let his mission draws one thing we do know feeling that this is the mayor of responding\nOr his position to the fact that he politically disagrees with him good morning counselor and thank you for being with us\nFrom Roanoke you for having this morning so what is the base of the last you\nWell we filed a claim the actual walks through has not filed a civil court so that the condition he is pursuing the city of Mount Vernon a you have to file a notice to claim that are that\nI think that was that was done 'em and you know we expect some level up response from the city of Mount Vernon\nI'm what what is the basis of the suit or what is the basis of Vince assertion\nWell what what we have is is is we have numerous violation\nOf federal civil rights law a poor example freedom of speech\nA freedom of association um we have quiet I'm On who are the ... the cupcake or because of their cars and a lot with their uh Damon Joe the black Westchester\nUm there were targeted by opposition if they were targeted by the mayor or so we have a federal civil rights violations\nI caught caught the traditional violation or we have to watch it there and with with the ... it's like we have violation potentially up are actually ... because of some of the state and that I Believe were made up of what I've read what bait on your radio station\nUp basically to think about the mayor would say my client\nFor example freedom of speech um freedom of association um we had quiet I'm On who\nAre the ... the cupcake cutie or because of their cars and a little with their um Damon Jones the black Westchester um there were targeted by opposition as they were targeted by the mayor\nOr so we have a federal civil rights violations\nEr Cox state constitutional violation a we have to watch his reruns with with the business like we have violation potentially a actually deprivation because of some of the statements that I Believe we made a from what I've read what made on your radio station\nUp basically some of the things that the mayor was saying on my client you and the NIH\nI'm coming to think that he did say so we believe that there is a ... for a long and also a negligence or you know coming into could stored it's not um that was in proper oh all of those screenings um we have in our a notice the claim\nNo ... perhaps we're taking for granted but this is based on the fact that the the plaintiffs believes in fact the store has been targeted by the mayor specifically because these reasons we'd we'd be correct in assuming that\nAre ... yes that that that is the fact that ... and the fact that we kind of investigated or to make that also to make that determination uh that appears to be\nSome sort of um that dictates or then better behavior\nUm in terms with this particular store and also you know members of the family claims that there has been been picked a behavior against ah the owner of black Westchester white so you know this seems to be a pattern\nOr that um that has been used\nTo intimidate go tour in opposition uh took a Mayer's policy and took a mayor\nOr we're talking with more and be razor she's an attorney and she represents the cupcake boutique and I'm going to try to cupcake cutie boutique yes I Know who's gotten a kick out of the name in ... in a bubble relaxing time can game and about that\nUm any of them very interesting problem because how does one prove ... and we again we don't want to be part of the news we just want to report it [laughter] what does how does one prove a vendetta\nWell without going to keep some of the teams but we pretty much know\nUm if if if you find\nThat there's no what the store that isn't a similar situation but you you've done those things to potentially a that could be shown a as a buy is a you know in addition to their statements possibly that have been made\n'em you know that seemed to target a priest is the typical establishment I mean there's all kinds of evidence that we're working with so I'm not going to get into the details of our case and what we are going to be able to prove\nThat could be shown a as a buy a ... you know in addition the their statements possibly that have been made\n'em you know the food the ... it's a great ... capital Schmidt I mean there's all kinds of evidence that we're working with I'm not going to get into the details of our case and what we are going to be able to prove\nAnd see what the additional cost of construction and we have three places to choose from a and that's pretty much where we stand now we're waiting to hear from the port is going to give us a deadline I don't know what it's going to be could be the end of the month\nThe basic kind of say a tell us what you got and ah and then we'll consult with\n... hey thirty nine we're talking with county decorative doors lie to me here in fourteen to God would you be a a a county deputy we had earlier today Richard Thomas on uh the mayor Mount Vernon and he was a seem pretty pleased in fact a\nKind words your way talking about that now everybody seems to be more or less on the same page regarding memorial feel um that is correct decadence if\nThey really are there is um has been now a helpful dialogue both a city and county representatives have talked to some of the issues and I think we're getting the uh the progress the cooperation we need as I've said all along I have one goal and that is to make sure the field gets fixed\nIt's got to be run by the city when it's all said and done which is fine with me um and then ah you know the city government or we'll we'll prioritize what they want to see in there but uh we we are working through the dumping on the ground\nWhich happened which I think DC it's just looked at\nAnd said that there is no um problem with the um the chemical component of the of the ... of the waste\nSo we can be ah it can be caught it or we used in some fashion you were worried that there might be some hazardous element to uh and that would be remediation but fortunately that's not the case or they're obviously is the case of the the tennis courts which has to be resolved by the court\nSo we know whether or not tennis courts are going to have to be we built a in that fashion on some other way [noise] but uh we're making some progress now and I think it's good and it's all in keeping with everything we've tried to do\nFrom what issue to the next which is just go in very pragmatic we try to solve problems work with everybody if if we can just sit down and work together we're fine and I think we're making progress on memorial field\nWe saw one of the things that was in an ... forgive me for not understanding if it's totally a county thing but that businesses will now have to make good on days for employees and came out of the legislators this law yet\nNew while the legislature passed in as of last night I read about this morning a and

for employees this came out of the legislators this law yet\nA new while the legislature passed it as of last night I read about this morning a and B not seen the law and its original form a now they're going to convey to this is the internal governmental stuff with allies Japan says something and you send that the executive we'll get to walk probably today on my desk\nAnd we'll go through it and we'll analyze it will make sure that everything is a you know called pathetic and that it's up to me the side of Oregon I could veto it but you know a will look at it it will apply to businesses a certain size and greater throughout the county\nAnd the fact that twelve legislators voted for it tells you that have enough votes to override veto so uh there is consensus on the board as to a policy fight\nYou know I look at it when I see it on my desk and we'll take it for their\nAge forty to one other item and then we'll see what other I'm Tate says that you might have we we learned today that tax revenues are down in white plains in fact I'm baby when we both know suggested maybe because of the closing of the Wal Mart there are any change so far as you know in in revenue for the county level\nWell you know the quarter just closed September thirtieth is the end of the thirty year so we're not going to know sales tax numbers for a while I'm a ... and that's really the big estimate of revenue now Walmart is in white plains in white plains gets the local tax share\nA in white plains wipe toward the four big cities get the local share county sheriff comes from the other communities\nAnd so if there's a big hit in white plains that does not necessarily meaning in Westchester counties revenues ... we'd have to see the other factor we're going to look and we don't know Bob so I'm just giving you a parameter no weather is what the back to school sales situation look like that is the second biggest\nConcentration of sales after the Christmas Holiday hunt interesting\nWe want to look and see what it back to school do around the county in terms of revenue we have seen an uptick in projection of sales tax revenue but it is true that Tom in white plains that it hit because of the closure of Walmart but I don't know that that affected the county and the same way there may be in effect but I don't know it's certainly not as direct evidence for white plains\nAnything you want to shout out about kind of executive\nYeah we're just average to a public forums on the county budget or the county budget has to be delivered a will be delivered to the

[laughter] so uh [noise]\nAll right so we were talking about the testimony and I guess I was the only thing that I saw bits and pieces on the ramp broadcast but various TV channels which I can I Do not remember it and you can do what I'm not even sure I Would do\nBut ah it seems to me that the testimony on both sides a doctor for an\nCapitals testimony was the printing will uh put together which yeah which tells me that from my own personal experience that they work a long time with the right word but\nShe had time to work and go over that statement for a couple of weeks with those lawyers yeah where is that they given made her come in for the whole thing was that the way that they're put together that's out there I Want I don't mean that the whole thing was practiced practiced practiced\nOut where they could have actually ask some questions where she thought or maybe they would have gotten more of a sense of what was going on there that I just didn't have a credit thing or are they didn't try\nWell you know it's very difficult difficult when you have a victim tests before it is very difficult to get a jury afraid I traveled particulars very difficult when you have the victim whether it's a sex club or or\nNot tempted murder or a robbery or whatever it is\nIt's very difficult to go after the victim and it's really difficult particularly difficult with respect to suppose the sex crimes\nAnd it's difficult for an end to do it to a cross examine or a woman like that yes I\nJust saw yup\nBut the point was that this whole thing in my opinion at this point those lawyers who were given to her by you\nKnow you have a claim or you oppose idly never told her\nThat the ... the Senate investigators would have gone to wherever she was supposedly she lives in California but she lives in ... but the whole thing as a fought my point of view and now you know I'm ... I'm becoming much more cynical as I keep reading stuff\nYes well I think that that's what you just added here I didn't know that I didn't know she was\nGetting robots I saw the same thing that you saw a ritually which has done it in two weeks ago with three weeks ago she's afraid to fly to blow up to where you work right\nUnder oh she said that they never told that they go to where she was okay well I didn't hear that so so that's why people didn't tell her her lawyers are made aware of that that's very odd yet and she was needing would be to lawyers yes\nWell the whole thing so so ... what did they do says to him that this is the problem right for over this it doesn't matter where you are Democrat Republican or not a bit to the problem for all of U.S Supreme court\nConfirmation hearings of turned into political theater and they'd been off and on all the time but often on political theater since the eighties Nineteen eighties but maybe boy be way before that but maybe way before that yeah and the Democrats have the tools here\nTo play political theater and the very fact that Dianne Feinstein kept this\nLetter supposedly or whatever it was from ... stay off for about a call from this woman secret and you know had it in July ... kept secret until the humans we're almost at the point of having a cup permission from the Senate floor you know what that tells you\nThe problem right for the better way of Democrat Republican or not a bit but the problem for all of U.S Supreme court\nConfirmation hearings of turned into political theater and they've been bluffing off and on all the time but often on political theater since the eighties Nineteen eighties but maybe boy be way before that but maybe way before that yeah and the Democrats have the tools here\nTo play political theater and with the for the very fact that Dianne Feinstein kept this letter supposedly or whatever it was from ... stay off for about a cold from this woman secret\nYou know had it in July ... kept secret until the humans we're almost at the point of having the corporations go down to the Senate floor you know or what that tells you everything you need to know\nThat there is I ... and they and since that time it became public it's been more and more and more orchestrated wrecked produced it's just like putting it on Broadway and it's\nJust out there instead of on Broadway in the public domain coming here to the Senate chamber where the select committee chamber and that's for all of us that's what that is in my view a set up the last what about the tragedy much whether it's true or not\nIf it's true it's a loss for this poor woman if it's ... it's a mess for this judge somebody who's ... station Kan needlessly disparate dispersed and that's the tragedy both but\nI think that you know what I look back and think people what people would go and watch for lunch or allegation brought on it but they're not talking about ... or ... or ... or what do I do so when people were seniors in high school on freshman in college there are people act like total jerks\nTotal fools but that's what they turn out to be doctors lawyers good fathers good husbands\nThey owned businesses they go on to the service they get to be generals I get to the lawyers or any any profession and they take care of their families and they don't act like that that this is a man who presumably has some didn't do it he's done this he hasn't done it in thirty four years or something\nSo that keeps somebody should this is the kind of stopped somebody should be examined done what they wrote in your book like put a bunch of idiots in high school when you're in where it's gotten absurd to me when\nYou're eating political theater right third [laughter] political theater theater in many respects and this is no exception if not prince to rule political theater is actually the theater of the absurd\nIt is any little stupid thing and nowadays with all you know with all the social media and all that stuff everything is in St ... around the world the world and the the [noise]\nYou you can't there's no you don't even know which one which social media statements come on sweats or whatever you call those things you don't even know which ones are overweight you which ones are worse and bought some Romanian about the war British bought\nOr Republican box or a Democrat you have no idea it's just complete confusion\nThat's caused anxiety there's this constant ... in the air you have this thing has got to get settled the one thing that I really got to me\nAround the world and the the\n... you can't there's no you don't even know which one which social media statements come on ... or whatever you call them you won't even though we're on the radio which ones are what and bought some Romanian about the war British Bob\nOr Republican bought for Democrats got no idea the complete confusion\nThat's caused anxiety this is ... ... in the air this thing has got to get settled the one thing that I really got to me\nRight and that's what makes people cynical and that would make them cynical lifted was in the jury room that would make them cynical about this kind of story once it's been rehearsed and are now there is now the person to members everything every member just this feeling that the tail and so on and so on someone that's just\nIt would be a difficult case\nWhat they call I think we didn't find this out I'm telling her testimony like she said oh I never knew anybody recovered Florida yeah I mean to California yeah that was during our cats to mine the other thing is they're going to go back and ask cabinet questions the FBI why don't they go back on after questions\nWell that's a good question but they're not asking her anything\nWell there may be that it may be that they're they're they are looking into Kevin O's back Ron background and they haven't been directed more entertaining\nVery odd yes navy guys I mean that doesn't seem right if you're trying to find fruit yet you know getting shot I\nAm with you OK we do have a cold who's been waiting patiently so let's say good morning good morning and fell rank in\nThe morning Ken Hi Chris how are you OK

anybody know that they pay the rent there\nI have no idea I also later that he didn't who now\nAm I still a lot of course the walk we're talking lobsters here Chris okay All right Chris sorry sorry we were just like well let's\nTake some things into consideration the fact that the\nThat Smith show or what's Republican appointed a criminal prosecutor that they brought in putting aside that Kavanaugh's attack on a system of democracy\nAnd putting aside that only probably six months ago a more conservative George Foy support to to the Supreme Court without any of this a circus going on [noise] so I had a little bit I should say\nHe was cake Gorsuch was filling in for ... years by hitting new game now because this is the majority\nYeah but what what was appointed okay uh you know ... by you know vice a shock to the Senate and we should you know they were supposed to get a no doubt about that but you got a point to a so what what do you think let me ask this question when did you get your point now where do you think about the advice and consent\nAnd how it's being applied in this situation this process\nI think this has been political theater from day one you had those people in the room for the hearings even open screaming carrying signs blah blah blah blah blah\nAnd it took an hour for the hearings to open you know nobody in on this planet can possibly believe that just happened to those people want to go with them so they were put up with by the Democrats [noise] so what\nYou have but you know you don't you have a lot of this shit consent pots and his advice locally political process there's no question about nobody's going to be a\nWay to go we're talking about the\nWhat we're doing in beer with a sudden you had the man said more more than\nWhat are you this is everybody on the Democratic side said virtually everybody on the Democrats are said as soon as the nomination without\nWhite for days what's his name Sanders, Bernie Sanders we're going to vote

Bernie Sanders has had an on a day in his life when you talk while he's a politician he's a politician says what to say to accomplish what he wants to accomplish so it sounds like\nYou don't believe in our system where it\nOh with sales like what's going on is ... what's going on open your eyes or politicians they're paid to do that this is their lives\nDon't give me your business about ... room there is room but there is is a show when when you lean one way or the other because you're in turtles and that's the way you think about things and so on and that's what they're trying to do they're trying to attract you\nThat's their job don't ever ...\nI Do when you were going to vote against him okay so what would\nBe like that going on you or at least shaming either you know what they're being punished Bernie Sanders has had an honest and it's like what are your twelve politician\nHe's a politician says what all has to say to accomplish what he wants to accomplish so it sounds like you don't believe in our system where it started with sales like what's going on is\nBeckley what's going on open your eyes or politicians they're paid to do this law lives\nDon't give me it's about

they're trying to ... you know them\nThat's their job don't ever below\nWhat what's wrong with that I was mostly I'm like what is wrong with that nothing's wrong with it but don't believe it's the

voters\nAnd your other signs of um a vulnerability and if in fact it remains a crowded field this poll shows Cynthia Nixon and working families party line ... stay get ten percent of the vote that

consider the opportunism of what Cuomo can offer them\nAnd versus the possibility that they got ten percent of the vote which I was pointing out before you joined us would be at least four hundred thousand votes which would make them roast the they knock the conservative party off road say and that kind of be tempting to them I Would think\nTension between ... ...\nYeah I was just going to say about it in a in a one on one according to the polls alone arrow picks up ten percent it goes up I think the thirty eight percent which shows the impact of getting Cynthia Nixon added there and Cuomo

weekly radio show happy to be here thank you WBUR extra hosting the show we enjoy coming in and have a lot of sports do you get off my chest or my very difficult weekend watching Penn State the jets and we all lose so that was kind of a bummer\nAlready on the other sports do I will point out is good luck to the Yankees and then we have a lot of Yankee fan or in the area Yankees have a playoff game this week the Oakland A's\nAbout what happened Saturday Night with David right\nYou know you know it's funny David right at his final game was a beautiful ceremony\n... currently met into something right that's what they always got him to be honest with you I mean it was a great met I enjoy David Wray got ... one of my favorite players\nAh but yeah it's been around a long time it's like the game but I was watching it and yeah I did I did yeah I wanted to watch I'd rather watch a real sport rather than a a tribute to a great player but\nDavid Wright was done like two or three years ago yeah and that's just the fact that\nI hear you but at the same time though I understood his mind that it's her reasoning for even even in twenty Fifteen when he was ... when he fixed actually came back when he was trying to come back and all these injuries and she\nAdds that athlete\nYou don't want that you want to go out and how do you have everything done without knowing you gave it every shot in the world to get back\nI said I Know probably the Mets and I have no problem with David Wright love David right where the game and I send us but to me it was a phony a nice thing to do with the end of his life I wanted to watch real sports real games do you\nKnow what that your progress but to a lot of people and especially someone who's in my general my my age bracket who basically grew up with him why he came on anti came through the organization and came in I'm not that old also by the way\nI mean my I'm In my mid thirties thank you very much but my point being is that the kind of want grew up with him\nBecause he David right yeah I Love it just wasn't something I was going to get that\nWell that that your prerogative yes but I'm just telling ... this is one of the rare times and that's actually got it right good\n... and also the probably the cutest thing in the world watching his little daughter Olivia Shay\nActually throughout the first pitch and and she actually throw it\nDavid right to me it's one of the athletes that I root for my life\nThat was pretty much perfect like the perfect guy ever been eight there the barest you you always proud of him he was first class\nBest of luck in the future I imagine you might get a front office do a great job you know baseball and say I I Wish them well and the other was or something I was going to\nSome came through the organization and came in I'm not that old also by the way\nI'm In my I'm In my mid thirties thank you very much [laughter] but my point being is that the kind of want grew up with him because he David Rice I Love it just wasn't something I was going to get that well that's that's your prerogative yes but I'm just telling ... this is one of the rare times and that's actually got it right good\n... and also it was probably the cutest thing in the world watching his little daughter Olivia Shay\nActually throughout the first pitch and and she actually throw it\nDavid right to me it's one of the athletes that I root for my life\nThat was pretty much perfect like the perfect guy you'd ever been any beer that barest you you always proud of him he was first class\nBest of luck in the future I imagine you might get a front office do a great job he knows baseball and say I wish them well and the other was or something I was going to\nThe other reason why is it hits a little bit more home to me it's because I just couldn't there and kind of a short version of the two degrees of separation\nMy cousin Rob who was one of the founders on the company baseball factory\nActually know them\nSo they were going through that company and health got\nAnd how people rave about people that know David Wright rave about oh everybody rate\nIn hand so he knows him so that's a little like and and my cousin Robin ... is one of my first cousin so it's like to see that I kinda know them\nBut but but I was you know I had met season ticket to those years I went to ... like hundreds of met games I Love David right but\nIt wasn't something I was going to watch that I'd rather watch a Penn State Ohio State although maybe I should watch that and I said but you would extend yourself as a whole new and just wants to start a heart heart strings targeting ride retirement and at the same time you had you not watch that they might have one\nOh come on I'm not that much of a drink nor are might look I Know I say that about my father [laughter] All right\nLet me get some of the consumer protection because we do a lot of sports already today I Love sports we can talk about sports all day\nSo one of the things you can do and utilize the wishes to consumer protection department I'm used to file a consumer complaint a we have a phone call coming in so just as I started talking to some protection we have a phone call coming in let me take this call good morning\nHello hello hello how are you doing it good Jim how are you oh to suddenly woman Amy Poehler out of nowhere\nYes how are you\nHow are you surprised I didn't know if you're calling 'em to thank you for calling how are you\nI Am good I Know that usually the first half of your show you have a a all of that your consumer protection department so I so I thought I Would try a little later\nOkay so good yeah so we're just actually we actually get all sports so far I talked about state Ohio State I don't know if you bought the Penn State Ohio State game but it's very depressing for Penn State bans\nAre caught a little bit of it they do and yeah uh\nDid you watch Penn State fall apart at the end\nI get ... yes although I'm not a fan of you know I just happened to the game on that I Love uh but I could I could\n\nDo we moved we moved to the moon Amy Poehler I think we lost her [noise] still very me on the air we lost it for a second there yeah when we went to a bad cell zone here and uh so you're on a cell phone\nI have I Am I'm driving from I add something in horse on\nFire right so anyway um [noise] yes and then the jets the giants both lost sight explain to listeners that I spent an enormous amount of time as we can watch it on my teams lose wasn't very fun\n[laughter] I'm not sure that happens from time to time right\nI've been a Mets fan in my life there's a lot of losing what the Mets I've been a New York Knicks banned the last couple of decades\nI get ... yes no I although I'm not a fan of you know I just happened to put the game on but I my ah but I could I could\n\nDo we moved we moved to the moon Amy Poehler I think we lost her\nStill there any ... on the air we lost it for a second that yeah we went to a bad cell zone here and uh so you're on a cell phone\nI have I Am I Am driving from I add something more than\nThat right through anyway um [noise] yes and then it gets insurance both lost by plane to the list that I spent an enormous amount of time this weekend watching one of my teams lose wasn't very fun\n[laughter] I'm not sure that happens sometimes your time right\nWell I've been a Mets fan in my life there's a lot of losing what the Mets I've been a New York Nick Bennett last couple of decades been a disaster or the rangers bring me a lot of happiness and hockey but they haven't won the cup and don't get me started on the ...\nWell you know what your kids like why don't you know a lot of people Sam and that that a lot of people say oh what a switch to the Yankees and that would be so that would be too easy high at at least feel very disloyal is wow\nI'm with you I Can't do that either I Can't switch but uh I Will point out what the guest Yankee driving a play this game a playoff game this week by the metro city and once again\nRight so those are the that software is available and the FCC recently said that ah the ah major companies telecommunications companies can\nProvide that to their ah customers and so what you know since it's available a\nI'm putting in a bill to mandate that these companies not only um uh provided but that they use it for customers so that\nNobody wants to an artificial call nobody\nYou know um and so on so I'm putting in a buildup they so that you won't have to download you won't have to know which one to download on your phone that\nYou know that the that Eighteen have arise that it's such a central are actually I'm doing it because they kept so we've been having some conversations with rice and in particular who's interested in the in while parading had\nYou know they say there's some software glitch as we're willing to listen to that but I I'm you know the bottom line is we know software exist and we know that should be used\nTo in a sort of what I heard and that was interesting and I'm a fairly this technology out there\nThat can combat situation a quote in the article that said we're getting to the point where nobody trusts the phone networks\nSo I'm putting in a buildup they so that you won't have to download you won't have to know which one to download on your phone that\nYou know that the that Eighteen people rise it et cetera et cetera are actually I'm a Jew and yet that 'cause they cat so we've been having some conversations with arise and in particular who was a it can be and why operating had\nYou know they say this some software packages were willing to listen to that but I I'm you know the bottom line is we know software exist and we know that should be used\nTo get it out so yesterday I sent you an uh an email I'd have to start with an idea that that was interesting and I'm a apparently there's also technology out there that can combat situation a interesting quote in the article that said we're getting to the point where nobody trusts the phone networks\nSays this principle technology guy lying telecommunications industry solution or\nAn hour and a very interesting to the extent that call can be verified you know I think ultimately these ... percent you know that will be in that direction because nobody wants to pick up I don't pick up for calls that I that are in contact that I Know\nWell let's hear what the listeners but short list there's was a this ... this article talked about basically to guy concluded that a head of the uh uh a line through telecommunications industry solutions\nWhen they stopped trust in the phone network they stopped using it leaving the industry is going to wake up anyway they the they talked about this to solutions stir S. T. I. R. telephone identity revisited and shaken which is it is your base handling of asserted information using token\nA the idea is make it so that every phone as a certificate of uh what's intensity attached to it a kind of digital signature that allows you to once again trust the caller i._d. so let me just read this paragraph in the article was kind of explain technology I'm Glad you read the article I don't know if the corporate anything to do\nA similar place in outbound\nThat coal container certificate verifying us a call is indeed coming from the number of claims to be coming from\nThe phone call is passed along to the incoming carrier which then check the certificates public the against the heavily encrypted privacy policy administrator run by the telecom industry was oversight from the FCC will be in charge of handing out typically\nAnd making sure everything is on the level boy that really sounds like a solution to the robocalls\nI mean as the article pointed out you know what I mean in between when I was on the radio show and when I called back\nI I saw I had an incoming call so I took it and what the incoming call was\nThat was by the beginning of my phone number nine one from fighting for and so I said oh this is a a you know maybe somebody I Know and it was it it was oh your credit rating blah blah blah blah blah you know which is a false call\nRight now so it it you know it's it's hot than\nBush will join us for what you lost your work won't Albany because uh you should see when they go so one big part in my job is I'm speaking regularly senior citizen groups and it's all they can talk about they and seniors type or home all day to pick up the phone and they're just bombarded by these robo calls a huge percent or more scams trying to rip them off\nWell the one thing that's interesting is um you know what the I'm a law also says and this is only true for a land mines that is that if you call someone you know and you know I've I've got landlines\nAnd so I said oh this is a a you know maybe somebody I Know and it was that it was oh your credit rating blah blah blah blah blah you know which is a false call right now so it it you know it's it's hot than\nBush will join us for what you lost your work won't Albany because\nWhen they go so one big part in my job is I'm speaking regulate the senior citizen groups and that's all they can talk about there and you're going to type a home all day to pick up the phone and they're just bombarded by these robo calls are you ... percent or more scams trying to rip them off\nWell the one thing that's interesting is um you know what the I'm\nA law also says and this is only true for a land mines that is that if you call someone you know and you know I've I've got ... for a live people right so if you get one of these computerized their their computerized so they they're not classified as live\nRight so they ... if it's a person um uh no actually the other way around so if it's a robocall I'm at it's not\nA a an actual person then they're required to give you in a way to opt out\nSo I usually it said very quickly it said kind of after you've already talked after the ... the calls today so that could be tweaked but it's there's no requirement if the person is live so if it's a human being they don't have to say um if you want to opt\nOut you know if you want to be on the do not call a and\nSo that's also a problem because\nMore and more they're using this squads I live thing to be able to get out of that requirement\nYou clean it up you know and you say it has to be in the run up to call it has to be clear it has to match people press a button and said do not bothering\nMe and we did you hear the music in the ... were you ever go to a commercial break\nRight then well I have a good\nHabit but rest of the show because I I have to get ready to get to\nMe to do great work on the road they'll keep up the great work any poll and we thank you working on this

W ... dot com this is weighing in on water ... was director of communications Deborah things that will be discussing that most vital substance in all our lives water at all things water really\nI'm jeopardy and welcome to weighing in on water on here today with reporter Hernandez are better with the manager here at our operations in Westchester County look how you doing that\nMakes it hard to hear this afternoon you got to be back and that they're going to talk about some exciting things that are going on I'm In the Suez operation that will definitely have an impact on our ability to improve customer service and I think the word to use is um a lot of digital changes [noise]\nTons of digital changes uh we've been working on some of these projects probably for the last three years or so I think maybe one or two shows I'd done before you Debbie spoken about some of those things as well and they're coming to fruition now which is great\nAnd I think one of the most public tracing things in some changes to the ah my Suez water dot com website\nYes ah we've gone through several iterations and we've got a lot of feedback from customers via email inbox we've gotten a\nFeedback from our advisory panels as well\nAnd some of the great things you'll be able to do now on march towards war dot com are starting and stopping service of one of the things starting it stopped tell us about that\nThat's going to be moving in and moving out yeah moving in moving out if you're a tenant or even if you're purchasing a property can now go on line create an account and you can move yourself into a property in or move your stuff out and we'll find out the account and send you a final bill looks address okay\nNow they're documentation that needs to be provided for that\nAnd some of our business and it's a in West Chester in particular and in a and an hour west back office you will need to sometimes provide a lease or documentation show you purchased a home and such like that will be some documentation and some ID requested as well on like\nThat you get scanning online and just put it in okay so it can be submitted electronically yes all the ... okay so my advice to as water dot com starting or stopping water service a\nTwenty four seven twenty four seven that's right there is um a really cool feature now if you haven't seen um the website the bill presented as so much easier\nService of one of those things starting it stopped tell us about somebody moving in and moving out\nYeah moving moving out if you're a tenant or even if you're purchasing a property can now go on line create an account and you can move yourself into a property in or move yourself autumn will fight all the account and send you a final bill looks address okay\nNow they're documentation that needs to be providing for that\nYear and some of our business and it's a in West Chester in particular and in a and an hour west NYC office you will need to sometimes provide a lease or documentation showing you purchased a home and such and so that will be some documentation and some ID request that as well on that you get scanning online and just\nPut it in okay so it can be submitted electronically yes all trying to like okay so my advice is water dot com starting or stopping water service a twenty four seven\nTwenty four seven that's right there is um a really cool feature now if you haven't seen um the website the ... is so much easier to look at the information on the bill it so much user friendly and it's it's it's um a lead into paying a bill a lot easier as well to this bill present because you understand that but a lot easier [noise]\nUm unfortunately we can't change the paper bill necessarily because of the way to reach 'em the regulations read on the information I have to put on the bill\nBut we have a lot of leeway on the Web which is pretty cool so there'll be there's a different bill present and they're easy to read you can see things broken out a lot easier and you click a button and pay your bills a lot easier as well\nSo that's very interesting I mean that to be able to see what's on your bill and I guess the show's water usage that\nOne more to use is definitely in that compares it to the previous year even compares it to your neighbor I Believe is well well yeah you're on your area general area [noise] so that's that's great we don't have that feature on a bill I'm On the paper bill but we do have that over the Web and um again as I mentioned that it's a lot easier to pay the bill as well\nOn line so before we go to their each way to pay the bill um I think the the one of the important things take away from being able to see how your water is used as you can actually monitor your water usage and maybe even monitor for weeks or determine how you can better use water more efficiently\nAnd I think I'm too much towards war dot com and you can do some of that and we're moving to another feature cold air my advice meeting infrastructure which I'll speak about it in a second which are really give you out of date if you want it to where we're going to get there and two thousand twenty [noise] um\nBut I think um as far as wrapping up with the march towards war dot com you can fill out a farm or a survey for conservation and they could give you a lot of great feedback and I think you've played around with that a little\nBit of having yes actually that's a fairly new feature you go to ... dot com on the homepage there the button where you can take a conservation survey\nAnd so if you're curious to know how you use water it walk she through very steps I'm indoors and outdoors desks now how many bathrooms you have one with the last update it\nAnd um it goes through a series of questions and ultimately your provided with the lift the tip of changes that you can make to save water in your home yet now these very from just personal habits for example um [noise]\nUh not letting the water run up to using a full load of full load for washing your closing the dishes to actually I'm making a change it to some appliances that much more efficient that for\nUm which is a great tool on my shoulders dot com ... orders that come and you know we had some input from our customers in developing that too\nAnd I think he made tenets of our customers logic meetings where we've had some input\nI'm actually a customer advisory panel members has had input on on the whole a website process and yeah so what's billed to look like and so forth they\nYeah we took a lot of feedback from them on on what they thought was an easy to read bill and a lot of that information or we put into the Web so we did definitely listen to our customers\nAnd Roberto one of the things you spoke about a little earlier that we can get\nNow these very from just personal habits for example um [noise]\nUh not letting the water run to using a full load of full load for washing your clothes and your dishes to actually I'm making a change it to some appliances that much more efficient that for\nUm which is a great tool ... dot com ... orders that come and you know we had some input from our customers in developing that too\nAnd I think he may have had it for our customers logic meetings where we've had some input\nI'm actually are cutting my budget panel members had had input on on the whole a website process and yeah so what bill to look like and so forth they\nYeah we took a lot of feedback from them on on what they thought was an easy to read bill and a lot of that information we put into the Web so we did definitely listen to our customers\nAnd so Roberto one of the things you spoke about a little earlier that we get into a little bit more detail is how can a lot of some people will pay by now you know but what if some of the other um electronic payment method that might be much more convenient for our customers\nIt's so important in this day and age that water management in terms of conservation and managing our natural resources then it's you know you don't think that you need are in those terms but when you understand what you can do what information can provide it really um it's all about sustainability\nUgly and you know if you look at our system and the way a um the way it operates would purchase a lot of our water from New York City ah from aquarium depending on which uh which district you're in as well and watches the jar water works so the more we can conserve and work with those other entities as well I think it helps everyone in the long run so\nHe's gotten a notification that you need to to be changed what you to customers to\nCall the call center a veil scheduled appointment for you can actually schedule an appointment over the phone system as well you don't have to speak to anyone if you don't want to or if you want to speak to our Web because bitter rap and they'll give you information that the closest schedule or close to the appointment of debatable and then ... will get out there and\nIt takes them no more than thirty forty five minutes to get in a change from your out clean up and then you know leave and you get to go and try and you have to you know he's systems upgraded so\nNow you were talking about leaders and the metering system that's a very important part of what we call our Asset Management program yes what what are the assets we have and tell us a little bit about how in Britain and into the digital age\nAnd that's a good question because right now we've gone through a two initiatives in our New York or business units a we have one an Asset Management tool that really covers what I like to call them ...\nThey are scheduled appointment for you can actually schedule an appointment over the phone system as well you don't have to speak to anyone if you don't want to [laughter] or if you want to speak to a rub because bitter rap and they'll give you information and the the closest schedule or close to the point that debatable and then ... will get out there and\nIt takes them no more than thirty forty five minutes to get in\nA change from your out clean up and then you know leave and you get to go and try and you have to you know he's systems upgraded so\nNow you were talking about leaders and the metering system that's very important part of what we call our Asset Management program yet what what are the assets we have and tell us a little bit about how in Britain and into the digital age so and that's a good question because right now we've gone through a two initiatives in our New York or business units a we have\nOne Asset Management tool that really covers what I like to call or below ... said are below ground assets so the pipes to service lines\nCurb boxes about\nAll those are managed by a a software called in for\n'em so if you can imagine this in the past we would have a cruise go out with all this paper\nAnd now they're going out with tablets and a great thing about that is when they go out with tablets everything digital cloud when there's an outage it updates and real time back in our office the customer service reps\nI have this huge screen up in a on display and they see when one of a cruise turn the water off because they're working on a main break working on a service line repair [noise]\nAh they continue affirmation real time which which is a great for our customers 'cause when they call the questions are the ... you had the information right in front of them to answer those questions\nI'm also we did a lot of our information or through our ... system so that track some of our assets as well and then um we have another piece of software going into right now actually in Westchester I'm responsible for that project but it's really are above ground assets [noise]\nUm and those are meters are F. devices back float devices well all those manage on a straw for which allows our uh our field service that to go out there with tablets you know look paper [noise]\nUm and as they make up the and the tablets to see it stars and the call center a call center wraps will have that information and real time\nThey can even take customer information in the field and you know building system that so if you watch ... phone number to someone who is just changing your meat or you can provide that information and it will get fed right into our buildings that something that's an option now as well [noise]\nThat'll be done um I Want to see the end of September of this year we're already kind of go into training we did this already in West Nyack and in our legal office and I'm rolling it's out now in Rhode Island and west Chester and we should be done by a beginning of October we should be done with this so when we look back at at this whole industry from\nGuys and and at the time just men right in the hands yeah Radio's Bryan\nI'm to cell phones which are still very important but to just tablets where you just enter something into the tablet and it's it's real time there's no phone calls back to the office there's nothing\nWhere you've got to have your little quick teen dating and say there's an out each year but everybody sees it in real time everybody is in real time which is fantastic and you know we spoke about the the kind of a medical situation or emergency\nThe great thing about these tools also was at a flag those accounts in the tablets right so before someone's out there to either performing outage or maybe a shuttle for collection\nAnd they'll see that flag on the account and maybe they'll ask\nUs to provide it to make sure that everything is good oh maybe we'll extend the courage to the call the customer just one more time before a services disconnected to make sure that you know everyone's good at it the property so that to give folks who are listening just to an understanding that we buy assets were talking about hundreds\nWhich are still very important but to just tablets where you just enter something into the tablet and it's it's real time there's no phone calls back to the office there's nothing where you've got to have your little quick teen dating and say there's an outage here but everybody sees it in real time\nEverybody was in a real time which is fantastic and you know we spoke about the the kind of other medical situation or emergencies\nThe great thing about these tools also is that a flag those accounts in the tablets right so before someone's out there to either performing outage or maybe a shut off for collection\nAnd they'll see that flag on the account and maybe they'll ask a supervisor to make sure that everything is good oh maybe we'll extend the courage to the call the customer just one more time before services disconnected to make sure that you know everyone's good at it the property so\nI put to give folks who are listening to the understanding that we buy assets were talking about hundreds of miles of water mains thousands of hydrogen cs dozens of vows pumping stations\nYeah you know enough for you know when you think of our utility company forty five thousand customers may not seem like too many customers compared to other utility companies but\nWith having one connection to that premise 'em and all the assets that come with that connection as you mentioned a or the pipes and the ground the vows to hide your ants um\nYou know we are pretty decent size network in West Chester another shower so definitely that this is great for us attracts all of our information or we we have these rotating maintenance planned schedule as we know when to maintain to hide joins uh went to check all the vowels for operations to make sure if we have to do shut down to those vows the opera herbal as well\nSo these tools are really taking us to the twenty first century which is great it's\nPretty fascinating because as most people myself included I go home I turned on the water I take a shower I make a cup of coffee and I don't really think about what's behind it so there is a lot of um\nKnowledge experience and and\nI'm going to call it science center that you know computer information scientists that are really playing a very important role in in how water systems and managed definitely definitely\nSo we're about uh we've got a few minutes left and I think I'd like to talk about a couple of other little things we mentioned earlier um the customer advisory panel tells a little bit that that group [noise]\nYou know I've been I've been working which was for about eight years now to be honest that this is the first company I've worked with in each of these space that actually has a group of customers come in a once a quarter\nYou know we have an agenda and sometimes the customers helpless craft that agenda sometimes we go off agenda based on what's the uh you know Bernie topics at the time [noise]\nUm but it's it's great to kill all the feedback from these customers on whether it's to build resentment or whether ... how our website is working for the Conservation Service they played a large role in that\nUm you know add that we're putting out um you know increased rates and how those come about and their input on that as well\nAnd the great thing about is that we take their input and I've worked with you on this you know to the cat meetings custom advisory panels\nAnd um we've made changes where we could you know based on their input which is great and right now to a team of bomb in West shut down how many kept members and we have faith about eight or so and we're looking for members definitely\nLooking for more members um basically the group serves as a a focus group and and as Roberto suggested we put\nTopics on the table we have them but they review materials they provide insight into how we work things out even that's Roberto spoke about earlier a bill presentation how it's how we people view that builds what they'd like to see and so if someone is interested that can give the officer Cole or provide them with some more information again it's cost\nCreates rates and how those come about and their input on that as well\nAnd the great thing about is that we take their input and I've worked with you on this you know to the cat meetings custom advisory panels\nAnd um we've made changes where we could you know based on their input which is great and right now to a team of bomb in Westchester how many cat members do we have faith about eight or so and we're looking for members definitely\nLooking for more members um basically the group serves as a a focus group and as Roberto suggested we put\nTopics on the table we have them but they review materials they provide insight into how we weren't things or even that's Roberto spoke about earlier a bill presentation how it's how we people view that builds what they'd like to see\nAnd so if someone is interested that can give the offers to call or provide them with some more information or again its quarterly um makes in the evening at our office in Westchester County and was certainly looking for folks who\nWould like to join us and provide some good constructive criticism that advice and helpless craft how we move forward in terms of serving in communicating with our\nCustomers and you know the the great thing is we've had such a wide range of of uh individuals and customers on that panel um you know some are very uh uh uh I guess a opinionated apple which is great [laughter]\nYou know and when we've got and really good feedback I think like as you mentioned very constructive feedback they a lot of good yeah a lot of content that shows that there's a lot of good to be that goes back and forth and I think\nYou know every every member that eventually kinda rotated off the cycle right um they both said it's been a a learning experience and and 'cause we educate them quite a bit on how we operate utility and you know sometimes how we have to follow these tight regulations on we came here from that sometimes and\nIt's very eye opening for them you know and at the same time as them being customers whether that senior citizens or millennials or whatever it is what we've gotten great feedback to see things from their perspective is at\nLeast I opening for us as a water managers as well sure sure sure what it is very helpful for us and we just have about two or three minutes left but you know what it's the summer's almost over that try and you know what happened back to school [laughter]\nI think this is a great time to just I'm just mention that ... has a water education program for a great mostly for games grades K through eight we can certainly comedy high school kids if needed\nBut there's a program called project wet and she was will come into the classroom it's free of charge it's about a forty five minute presentation at grade level appropriate\nAnd we talk about water in the water cycle and water resources [noise]\nYeah you know I think it's a great program um we also have it at some of our son to companies in West Mac and I've heard great things about all these programs so I encourage anyone out there and you're listening and you have access to some of the um the schools in the area please give us a call and we can try to set something up this year as well [noise]\nYeah um if your parents if you're a teacher for your school principal actually even will come to a girl scout or a boy scout meeting [noise]\nSchools in the area please give us a call and and we can try to set them up this year as well\n[laughter] yeah um if your parents if you're a teacher for your school principal actually even will come to a girl scout or a boy scout meeting\nEconomic development projects that have seen many of his closest aides hold off to the hooves gallop\nYeah it has not been particularly what the buffalo bill you know I mean that is a black mark on what he was previously ... you know the proud accomplishment for him you know they've poured I think one point five billion dollars or so and and counting into buffalo\nAnd there are some concrete accomplishments there but obviously the conviction of all I encounter heroes you know and the ... there was the biggest project seven hundred and fifty million dollars for the solar plants on the on the banks the buffalo ... river\nIt's tough to kind of than say the buffalo billion is a unanimous success when you've got this giant corruption All right at the heart of it\nYou know and and by the same token some of the smaller for stuff like start up New York you mentioned have really spot or do you know that was an idea that he thought would work he thought it was going to be ten years based what tax free for new companies would either expand ... start up in New York state and it just never really took off so\nYou know if you talk to his economic development people part of it is we got to try things you know we we have to try something that isn't so those are going to work and some are not going to work and\nX Y and Z and and I think that there is some validity to that but obviously during a political season a opponent like Mark Marlon narrow is going to pick up on the failures and he is going to attack those failures and he's going to talk about him again and again and again\nOne of the things it seems a bit short sighted my nose is now and I haven't heard a lot of criticism on this may be because both sides of these projects are the casinos I mean you see all these casinos all around the north east some of the latest including in Springfield, Massachusetts and they're all in close proximity that's got to drain the Robin is\nI mean the the word in the in the industry is saturation and you know we did a series four or five years ago where we kind of looked at this and I've covered casinos on and off for probably a decade and there is absolutely an issue in the northeast where\nIt used to be very rare to find a casino you know for decades the only place you could get them on the eastern seaboard was basically laid land accident and then\nAfter a tribal casinos came online you know yet foxwoods from Connecticut but still it was very small number of places where you could place at that nowadays you can place that pretty much anywhere and you mentioned Springfield you know obviously New Jersey has been aggressive about gaming they actually just got online gambling so you can bet on\nI mean you see all the casinos all around the north east some of the latest including in Springfield, Massachusetts and they're all with in close proximity that's got to drain the Robin is\nYeah I mean the the word in the in the industry is saturation and you know we did a series four or five years ago where we looked at this and I've covered casinos on and off for probably a decade and there is absolutely an issue in the northeast where\nIt used to be very rare to find a casino you know for decades the only place you could gamble on the eastern seaboard was basically laid land like city and then after a tribal casinos came on line you know yet foxwoods in Connecticut but still it was very small number of places where you could place at that\nNowadays you can place that pretty much anywhere and you mentioned Springfield you know obviously New Jersey has been aggressive about gaming they actually just got online gambling so you can bet on sporting sporting events\nWhich of course will be something that New York will probably have to take off on this coming legislative session you know people do like to bet on sports and now that the Supreme Court has cleared the way for that sort of thing [noise] New York is at least a year behind New Jersey and getting mad online\nAnd even in brick and mortar casinos you know the four that they authorized a couple of years ago\nHave been sputtering as well some of them you know the law go casino outside Rochester is not in great financial shape for most analysts of perspective the reverse casino in Schenectady I think has done better but has had some troubles\nOr you know initial reports out of Monticello or they build a billion dollar casino in the Catskills are that you know that has not exactly taken off the way they want it to all go that's owned by this giant gambling companies can thing so they they've got deep pockets\nBut still the the idea that casinos would somehow results and kind of broad prosperity that promise hasn't come true either now the only copy out I'd had with that is that they did create a lot of construction jobs you know these places are very fancy and they they have all the bells and whistles\nAnd so although they were being constructed they they look gray and people certainly were employed but long term you know it's probably too early to say but the initial indications are it hasn't quite than the boom that they don't have ... anticipated\nRight well let's go now to primary results and onto the general election we of course know that Governor Andrew Cuomo one big primary he not only win big for his own race but he gets his hand picked candidate for the G ... James\nYou know for all the talk of the corruption joke for ... for example and of course before the latest scandals deans gallows head of the Senate and of course the former speaker Sheldon Silver\nAlso involved in corruption scandals and the issue of you know just you and I ... and the rest of us political insiders were all over the stories we see it all the time\nIt makes is perhaps a little cynical about politics in New York state but is the general public really paying attention\nWell you know it's it's a great point there is often what seems to me it was hurting at this curious disconnect where you read the polls right the polls come out and how do you feel about corruption and you know eighty Ninety percent of the respondents will say oh corruption is a horrible problem that's awful it's awful it's awful\nBut then when we get to election days it seems that corruption very rarely puts a damper on ambition\nThat because it's endemic did you see it as part of the system we can't do anything about corruption they're all corrupt but we're going to vote for our guy or are are being\nBe it for me to confess any sort of a bubble but I think sometimes when you're interested in politics and you're covering politics and you're talking politics it is easy to feel like it really is the whole world but you do have to remember it\nNew York state but is the general public really paying attention\nWell you know it's it's a great point there is often what seems to me it was hurting at this curious disconnect where you read the polls right the polls come out and how do you feel about corruption and you know eighty Ninety percent of the respondents will say oh corruption is a horrible problem that's awful it's awful it's awful\nBut then when we get to election days it seems that corruption very rarely puts a dance an ambition\nThat because it's endemic did you see it as part of the system we can't do anything about corruption they're all corrupt but we're going to vote for our guy or ... or mid\n... for me to confess any sort of a bubble but I think sometimes when you're interested in politics and you're covering politics and you're talking politics it is easy to feel like it really is the whole world but you do have to remember that for most people\nPolitics is something that they pay attention to every two years or more likely every four years during the presidential cycles and other than\nThat not everybody out there is you know hanging on every political twist and turn and so when they do pay attention it may not be the first thing that catches there I I mean the political advertising obviously works I think Cuomo\nMaximize his political advertising during the primary to kind of both juices numbers and to help his down ballot people\nBut you know not everyone's paying attention all the time so when corruption scandals emergent make it a lot of coverage they might catch someone's I here and there but do they remember that you know six months or a year later or two years later when they actually go to the pole\nIt's not completely clear at all and and you know I think you're going to see a very interesting race on a federal level with Chris Collins who's the congressman out of buffalo\nWho is under indictment for insider trading and is running for Congress and I would not that against Chris calling us getting reelected I think he's in a very safe Republican district tea is popular in that district or at least was certainly before he got arrested\nBut you know even being arrested even being under indictment may not knock him out of out of the Congress so\nYou know he's he's going to run and and that's a pretty safe district people probably when he's you know he's facing a spirited challenge from a Democrat but you know I Would not that against Chris Collins and that and and then of course if he does actually get the you know\nConvicted that are left to give up his seat and all bets are off but for the time being he's on the ticket\nWe're talking with Jesse McKinley the Albany bureau chief for the New York times\nYeah so we have other congressional races to stick with that theme I mean one of the big ones of course isn't the mohawk valley you have a strange is there some sort of ... down to the Binghamton area\nClaudia Tenney the Republican and you've got Anthony ... as the Democrat that's quite a rate interesting dynamics now it's getting pretty dirty a with quite the accusations coming from the tiny camp being launched ... bin ... family is ...\nYeah I think that race is\nThat race has been pretty for some since the beginning you know I think if you talk to national Democrats that is an important said for Democrats if they want to flip the house it is as you mentioned are

which probably works out in that district I Believe he voted against the say fact which was governor Cuomo's gun control bill from a couple of years ago\nSo they're real dog find out there and you know if you talk to pollsters it's a toss up and and it it will really come down to probably turn out and I think in that\nThis has been pretty for some since the beginning you know I think if you talk to national Democrats that is more important seat for Democrats if they want to flip the house it is as you've mentioned a kind of an interesting geographical area Utica is a pretty solid democratic\nBastion but his surrounded by a lot of very conservative area is Tammy has a reputation for being a real true believer of the Trump Administration are real firebrand\nAnd sharp elbows ... he was coming out of the state assembly here I think has a good reputation for for being a somewhat of a moderate to left Democrat [laughter] which probably works out in that district I Believe he voted against the say fact which was governor Cuomo's gun control bill from a couple of years ago\nSo they're real dog fight out there and you know if you talk to pollsters it's a toss up and and it it will really come down to probably turn out and I think in that regard\nDemocrats both from DC and statewide are going to be in position of advantage because\nThe Democrats feel very bullish about this November they feel like they're going to get huge turnout\nAlmost certainly feels like he got a huge turnout primary day at one point five million people voted in in a primary that only drew for almost six hundred thousand people four years ago a those sorts of uh indications would would suggest that the Democrats are really engage they're really energized they really want to come out and said that\nThat sort of turnout will help democratic candidates I think also in the Hudson Valley that that that don't pass at rice with him to San Antonio Delgado\nThat's going to be on that nail biter too you know I think that Delgado is\nIs that Chris Medicare man and and is running a kind of spirit race I think he's getting a lot of money thrown against him by national Republicans and and fast as a fighter too so you know come November eighth November right I think that's\nCorrect oh you know those are the sorts of races where you you know it might be a couple of thousand votes one way or another that that's why is that and by extension those are the types of seats that that could conceivably flip the house\nWhich is to me is is other angle on the whole idea of the money for election so Reid's between Delgado and fast so for example the ads coming from the Republican National committee\nOver and over and over and over again going you have to do got all the ads on the side

W. W. P. as in Paul dot org or its and putting them or you can go on to the site and there was an interactive\nMap and you can pull together different regions to be able to look at the data different ways you can go into every uh every town\nWithin the county and look at it you can compare it against other areas of the state so it's very interesting but one of the things that was different in the study this time is it we added in Seventy five dollars a month for the household\nFor smartphone a because people are really that's how you do so many things now from paying your bells to buying things in the store or whatever [noise]\nSo we added that ... Seventy five dollars a month is very cheap\nExtremely cheap and it's really the very early days are done very most basic thing you can get and so when we took a look at\nAt Alice Alice was living when we look at the household figures is living in a two bedroom rental apartments\nHas absolutely no money and saving is driving an old car ah which you know that that means you know more cost for repair than a newer type car [noise]\nUm they are they are living at the lowest USDA food level a so they're not going out\nAnd and getting the stakes or even the London broil that are on sale they're really looking at what is the cheapest thing often their kids are eating cereal for dinner and again\nThese are kids in every school district every municipality even Scarsdale was nine percent Alice household Morrow die and people will move in and out of Alice and I think one of the issues you see people in poverty\nHave up a bit of a safety net now mind you that's not even across the country because these benefits are figured on a national level so what it costs\nWe're mature type car [noise] um they are they are living at the lowest USDA food level a so they're not going out\nAnd and getting the stakes or even the London broil that are on sale they're really looking at what is the cheapest thing often their kids are eating cereal for dinner and again\nThese are kids in every school district every municipality either Scarsdale was nine percent Alice households unarmed autistic and people will move in and out of Alice and I think one of the issues you see people in poverty\nHave a a bit of a safety net now mind you that's not even across the country because these benefits are figured on a national level\nSo what it costs to live in one area of the country is very different from what it costs to live in another area of the country so for example to live at the Ellis threshold in ... in New York in Westchester County takes about eighty eight thousand dollars a year which is up\nEleven thousand dollars for two years ago a much that much and if you take a look at the rest of New York state it sixty six thousand\nSo there is a disparate disparity in what you're able to see through the yellow studying to be able to make those kinds of comparisons on equal information\nSo to live with the federal poverty level you know in one part of the of the of the country it's a lot easier to do that for a family of four than it is in Westchester County\nNow will forty four thousand dollars a good\nThat's right and so now you're looking above that and and those federal support are based on that number across the country whether it's funding we get for the emergency food and shelter program or if it's qualifying for the earned income tax credit\nOr it's what the state uh can do and federal government in terms of childcare so it gives us an opportunity to take a look and decide how we want to prioritize our effort to\nTake a look as we go federally and say what can we do to equalize the field for people in our community so they're able to live at the same rate as somebody in another part of the country it's a very difficult in depth\nProblem but it's one that the first step is to recognize and Allison is helping us to recognize what that what the problem is and I'll give you just an example\nUh qualify for the earned income tax credit is sixty six thousand dollars a year\nWe look at Alice if it costs us eighty eight thousand dollars to live at the el threshold we have people who probably should be qualifying for that tax credit and do not [laughter]\nSo we're working to advocate a federal level to have a rise in that earned income tax credit and certainly to have an indexing for the cost of living\nUh in different parts of the country um that is just one avenue and ... let me tell you United Way in West Chester and putting them connected Fifteen thousand people to that earned income tax credit last year a where\nTwo dollars to live at the el threshold we have people who probably should be qualifying for that tax credit and do not so we're working to advocate a federal level to have a rise in that earned income tax credit and certainly having indexing for the cost of living\nIn different parts of the country um that is just one avenue and ... let me tell you United Way in Westchester and putting them connected Fifteen thousand people to that earned income tax credit last chair a will to every\nUm and we are a part of this and what you do is it will show you the price of that medication at three different pharmacies let me tell you for one of my own children I saved sixty dollars on a prescription\nDrug is for them to have it really it oh wonderful wonderful service and at this point of time we'd saved residents in West Chester um pot and I'm almost one million eight hundred thousand dollars and prescription cough through this\nAnd I'm urging everyone who was listening to take a look at family wise W. i.s C. E. and\nTake a look at it see what you can save on your prescription you know we're we're so maybe it was ...\nYears you can go either on to the United way of West Chester and putting them website or you can go directly onto the family was dot org website and download the card check on your prescription but you know what's interesting when we did the study we found\nThat Alice is an all age groups it's very high and the under twenty five which I Would probably expect\nA it's higher and Elvis versus in poverty on senior citizens and that's because of Medicare but those middle earning population as well or very high I'm Allison you can see the breakdown in our full Alice report but\nOne of those things that we find with seniors is that they will take care of their animals before they take care of themselves\nFor some of them they've lost spouses their living alone and fight do or their kitty cat are the most important thing in their lives so little for growing their own prescriptions\nWell if your dog or cat\nOr iguanas\nAre taking a people prescription you can have your veterinarian write out a prescription and you can look on family was the what the price would be\nUm at three different ... it'll show you three different pharmacies eight years that code and you can save on your your precious pets prescription as well so that's something people don't always think about food\nAnd our full Alice report but\nOne of the things that we find with seniors is that they will take care of their animals before they take care of themselves\nFor some of them they've lost spouses their living alone and fight do or their kitty cat are the most important thing in their lives so therefore goal in their own prescriptions\nWell if your dog or cat\nOr ...\nAre taking a people prescription you can have your veterinarian write out a prescription and you can look on family was the what the price would be\nUm at three different it'll show you three different pharmacies eight years that code and you can save on your your precious pets prescription as well so that's something people don't always think about\nWell so it's not only for people vote for people's best friends people's\nBest friend as long as they take people prescription [laughter]\nThat is actually really use it to the kind of resources so that you're providing the to anyone can use would you say are just so important for those of fall within the hours category\nUm you were comedy to me during one of the bridge the you're working all who was already but you don't you go to a little bit more about the within the context of leader I was a for\nYes well we're working with the IBM on a couple of projects one is around aligning a school and community\nBut the and we'll talk about that another day but the other one we're working on is around data mapping and mapping different kinds of data some of which isn't the Alice reports some of which is from other sources\nSo we're looking at things like distance to a supermarket distance to childcare distance just food pantries and in the different communities it's going to be very very interesting\nUh when it's finished and actually it's going to be showcase national way a United Way worldwide it's been so interested in what we're doing it that they were bringing the folks down from IBM to show leaders from across the country what we're doing right here in West Chester county uh with Alice ...\nIs really exciting so you're not only to talk to your brother does someone who enough money to buy the food but you do do you broke whether or not we have access to the food the first for\nExactly because what we're finding is that you know the problem Ellis has is that Alice is generally working and earning not the highest earnings tried a\nBecause it takes a lot of earnings to live in West Chester county [noise] so what this is doing and saying okay we have workers who are working in the hospitals how far is that for them transportation wise\nWhen they get home it might be late at night or they might be working chefs how can we get the food to them\nHow can we work to be able to get reductions in the cost of food for them\nHow can we get maybe some uh work with transportation providers or work knowing that their courage break down a lot is there something we can do with that\nBy having this data that we're going to be able to do pinpointing it's going to help us both in developing resources for Alice and developing some very pin pointed policy\nSo is it that we need more subsidized child care in a particular neighborhood uh for Alice or do we need to raise some\nHave workers who are working in the hospitals how far is that for them transportation wise when they get home it might be late at night or they

level um [noise] they qualify for some of the subsidies [noise]\nYou know it it it is just absolutely wonderful that IBM's has really to join with United Way of doing this when you're doing something I'm\nGood leading ... hopefully it can be replicated throughout the country\nI'm broke Gregory you're listening to your community today\nMy guess is the longest we need the president and CEO of the

engaging programs every Tuesday because Cindy has taken it upon herself\nTo help me and she's been an enormous help to a range so many or all of the gas So Frank change she knows very well yes and uh you and I never met before today but he knows just about everybody\nThe same that we look up to in our in our religious belief in our religious practice the saints I always remind people always always in in all the ... census thanks the modern science in the ancient thanks and all through history\nTeacher one very important thing and that is that holiness of life comes from whole mess of life and homeless of life comes from a balance of things\nBut nothing of everything but not too much of a thing that includes prayer in schools religious practice it includes a work it includes rats that includes time social time with friends and family and ... and that includes uh\nEating it includes drinking a all these things but in proper balance and moderation\nAnd you know that are so many children are growing at Potomac toward there's not a father a father figure right\nAnd so many kids are eating fast foods and we know that's not healthy for you know the issue that we need balance as you said in all things and and that that that a precondition we had about the impact of technology on our children you can you imagine kids coming to school and third and fourth grade with a cellphone\nRight unbelievable it is unbelievable and so they're going ...\nI you know kids don't I I have kids who come into the agency\nAnd they sit around and they want to say one thing and they all all of this they're texting right right they don't know even know how to talk to each other because\nWe have shifted the conversation from conversation or talking to technology\nMay I say picking up on that thought but\nUh all these things but in proper balance in moderation\nAnd you know that I'm so many children are growing up at home where there's not a father a father figure right\nAnd so many kids are eating fast foods and we know that's not healthy for you know so the issue that we need balance as you said in all things and and that that that um ... we had about the impact of technology on our children you can you imagine is coming to school and third and fourth grade with a cell phone right unbelievable it is unbelievable\nAnd so they're going to go and you know kids don't I I have kids who come into the agency\nAnd they sit around no one is saying one thing and they all all of this they're texting right right they don't know even know how to talk to each other because\nWe have shifted the conversation from conversation or talking to technology\nWell may I say picking up on that thought but I Believe very strongly\nThat this is part of the reason why we see so much violence among young people today\nWhen I was growing up you didn't have guns and they don't even have a knife or anything like that you had your two hands you had to fish and if somebody made you upset or picked on your anything else what and why are\nYou might make a faster than you might even try to defend yourself for you might haul off and you might you might give them a given the swat or something and that might turn into a little ... on the uh on the recess a court they are out out for for on the playground\nBut what would happen well your teacher would come over and then break it up\nAnd I would say All right now shake each other's hands tell tell each other your story and you wouldn't do that and you shake the hand of the other boy and his shake erosion and say I'm Sorry then you go back to playing\nYou resolve the conflict but today there's no resolution of any conflict nobody knows how to look somebody else in the eye and have a conversation and resolve the different\nWell you know the issue with the kids don't learn problem solving skills right and very ... and most times so many children don't have more than one or two friends right we don't build relationships with their young people so at times have changed and so our society has changed to what we do now is\n... and of course you know that what had happened I think to a state is that a raise the age I'm not sure if you had been talking about raising the age\nSo ... H happened or just have the the you know it became effective yesterday October for some you know prior to raise the age a young person who could be arrested at Fifteen sixteen or Seventeen\nHe or she could be a incarcerated with an adult now the age of criminal responsibility now if you were arrested at sixteen and Seventeen you'll go to a juvenile facility or in a facility\nOr closer to your age because we know that the scientists proven that young people sometimes don't develop fully until they're twenty five twenty six years of age in New York in North Carolina where the last two state\nWho um who dealt with this particular issue so New York just that would raise the age and so now a young person who commits an an an offense or won't be sent to unless it's a major offense when I went to the adult a facility\nWell that's good and uh you know it it might help them to get some direction before they might turn into a an adult offender and then have to spend a longer time of course I'm making up for the wrong but\nIt's very very important to today that young people or understand the consequences of their actions and um and also I think part of what you're doing news bureau is really helping young people\nDating for them on behalf of them\nFor public land but nothing for the public good well well that's what I was just terrible and you're\nRight well anyway with the fight that we have only just begun trust me instead of new\nYou know our ex Rochelle ideally there needs to be ideally hours again and that's what this station allows you have a voice and we'll have been rising up here in ... ... for zero three for eight to one for zero free for eight to one\nI've seen people hit by a ... bike who flew in Fifteen minutes downtown\nLarge community meeting had also get involved so you can help build home so I can live or and I can afford to live here let's take it back\nSo far\nSeems or W.

coming into people's attention\nUndesirable and that's what the Democratic party has become an elitist party that lives in an article a bubble and if you disagreed with him a particularly at the polls and you're not fit to be a voter are fit to be a citizen you're a deplorable yeah\nI mean now we're talking as your tomorrow and of course who many years ago ran for mayor of the city of New York as a conservative party candidate he's the guy who's been active in the New York conservative party in the past he's written about governor George Pataki and\nThe Catholic vote in New York a nationally you know it was a good deal about New York politics that I mentioned that an outdoors because I Know or at least I Believe you had a chance to take a look at yesterday's Sienna college poetry is very bad for Republicans in New York\nAnd let me know that right after my show ended yesterday or the mark bow and arrow Republican candidates for governor campaign put out a statement really ripping in to the CNN poll let me just read a little bit of it because it was unusually strong\nOn this show over several years I've raised questions about CNN Maris a Quinnipiac CNN Quinnipiac I think in particular\nAre partly for the questions they don't have in their polling which I raised the possibility was politically motivated for instance how can we not have had one poll in New York that has asked the question of voters in New York using governor Andrew Cuomo is corrupt\nWe haven't had that I think it's because they don't they don't want Cuomo coming down up down on them for asking a question like that but here's what\nThe ... campaign said we reject the CNN poll is part of Andrew Cuomo's corrupt rigged system we are in commenting on a specific result today more fundamentally we are questioning the independents\nCampaign put out a statement really ripping in to this year and a poll and let me just read a little bit of it because it was unusually strong\nOn this show over several years I've raised questions about CNN Maris a Quinnipiac CNN Quinnipiac I think in particular\nAre partly for the question they don't have in their polling which I raised the possibility was politically motivated for instance how can we not have had one poll in New York that has asked the question of voters in New York using governor Andrew Cuomo was corrupt\nWe haven't had that I think it's because they don't they don't want Cuomo coming down up down on them for asking a question like that but here's what\nThe mode arrow campaign said we reject the CNN poll is part of Andrew Cuomo's corrupt rigged system\nWe are in commenting on a specific result today more fundamentally we are questioning the independence of the pollster\nWho I'd say ... which I said to be references the Greenberg the fact is CNN address or dramatically altered its historical polling scheduled to favor Andrew Cuomo\nAllowing him to spend up words in twenty five million of his dirty pay a pay to play money in the midst of the worst month of staying governorship the head of a general election hole then they go on to make the case even further CNN has denied it\nUh uh of course if it were true they wouldn't admit it or what did you make of the poll is your do you want to make a claim that maybe the other of colors pulled out there really do kind of ... the polls in northern fame or their own political agenda sometimes\nOr the rangers\nSometimes the polls that done on the cheap and they don't have a large enough sampling and that has been a problem I've had with marriage Sienna from time to time\nWe know when the primaries you can do all the polling in the world is generally doesn't matter much because you just don't know what the turnout is going to be having subtle that I agree with you that they should have been some questions on the character and the corruption of the Cuomo ministry human interestingly it's been left out but\nDespite the fact that high level officials including his closest said had been corrupt I mean one thing if you were asking it gratuitously but there's obviously an obvious neat there's a clear nice asked that question yeah\nAnd yeah and to sections matter in politics as we know in a deep beyond that you're right a couple of his closest buddies political powers\nAre going to be spending time with ... so but even with all of that you still have this poll says wrong direction in New York forty four percent right track forty two percent that's not good for Andrew Cuomo\nA Cuomo do you have a favorable or unfavorable opinion forty six unfair both ... the favor of ... that's not exactly you know a resounding endorsement of that is a question here about what kind of job you think he's doing\nThey have fair good thirty two excellent nine percent thirty two percent good but fair twenty nine percent poor twenty nine to ... I don't know what your definition of the areas but when I was taught by the nuns in Brooklyn many years ago if you got fair on on a paper and exam or something\nThat was a charitable term for the lousy and my parents were not happy when I had something that said fair on and some people would fare in Port together\nThat's close to sixty percent don't think very highly the job he's doing so\nAnd there are legal differences in UC their doors down in New York City that's where he gets the strength shelf said that's where there's a great deal of hostility in the suburbs it's a little of both\nBut let me point out something else why\nFour years ago at this time ... Rob asked Reno is also about twenty eight to send these polls and he got approximately thirty nine point exactly thirty thirty nine point in the sense in that November elections so let's get forty percent but he is an interesting thing four years ago\nA ... Teachout and the other leftist candidate got exactly a hit with you\nOn the paper and exam or something that was a charitable term for lousy and my parents were not happy when I had something that said fair on and some people would fare in Port together that's close to sixty percent I don't think very highly the job he's doing so\nAnd there are differences in UC their doors down in New York City that's where he gets the strength show state that's where there's a great deal of hostility in the suburbs it's a little above\nBut let me point out something else why\nFour years ago at this time Rob asked Reno is also about twenty eight to send these polls and he got approximately thirty nine point exactly ... thirty nine pointing to send in the November election so let's get forty percent but he is an interesting thing four years ago\nA ... and the other leftist candidate got exactly a total thirty seven point zero eight to send\nIt was raining credit goes the other guy that's right\nA coma got three hundred and sixty one thousand votes so they got a total a of a hundred and Ninety two thousand votes so\nWhat is interesting in November the green candidate who for years earlier how he talking about one point zero eight percent of the vote he suddenly got four point eight six percent a hundred and eighty nine thousand votes almost identical number that a motive is a teacher\nUnhappy people with Cuomo four years ago voted for the Green Party candidate this year that number went up to five hundred and twelve thousand votes against them two things are going to happen in November first of all the turnout in New York City is going to be down why because the election is really not the primary in New York City\nAnd in recent times it's you know about twenty five percent of the voters ... that come out so you're going to see a drop they about what's going to come out once again all the people who don't like Cuomo\nSoda is very possible instead of having the green candidate Stephanie mine uh I don't know Cynthia Nixon is going to be on or off\nBut there could be easily a half five six hundred thousand votes of people in like Cuomo voting on these other line so that could bring his number down and got fifty three percent last time he's only fifty in this poll which is nothing get excited about for a guy wants to run for president but if you factor in\nAll things being equal this extra anti crumbled vote that could bring him easily down to forty six percent mile an hour and forty percent\nYou're maybe unfairly or wrongly minimizing the anti Donald Trump so that may turn out in New York City in particular energized Democrats even though\nThere aren't any important contest as guilty than New York city will want to make a statement and Cuomo will as we've already seen the running millions of dollars in ads saying he's the guy fighting against Donald Trump\nHe's running and Donald Trump basically I agree with you there are a hundred percent but to think a Donald Trump got two point eight million votes I'm such a presidential election off year elections numbers like that dropped dramatically so you can also begin to gin up\nYou know it could backfire were huge up that angry Trump folk to come out again and the one and number two we can second guess it's all we want but I'll stand by my stand that even with this anti Trump New York city vote\nIs depressed in General Electric they came out this time out to dump state Senate is to punish Andrew Cuomo\nAnd I think the angry anti Cuomo people will come out but you'll see it dissipate New York city 'cause it always does it's just it's because it's so them the general election is over\nThe election as the primary so they're not ginned up to come out in the fall and nothing Andrew Cuomo is going to do is get people excited you know in in Queens is just not going to happen so you know there'll\nBe an America was never that great again you don't think that's going to fire up voters\nWell yeah it is it fires up Trump's people up to fire up Trump's team in Suffolk County\nYou know it could backfire were huge up that angry Trump folk to come out again and the one and number two we can second guess it's all we want but I'll stand by my stand that even with this anti Trump New York city vote\nDepressed in General Electric they came out this time out to dump state Senate is to punish Andrew Cuomo\nAnd I think the angry anti Cuomo people will come out but you'll see it dissipate New York city 'cause it always does it's just it's because it's set up in the general election is over\nThe election as the primary so they're not ginned up to come out in the fall and nothing Andrew Cuomo was going to do is get people excited you know in in Queens is just not going to happen so you know there'll\nBe a ... and he says America was never that great again you don't think that's going to fire up voters\nWell yeah it it it fires up Trump people upset if I were up Trump's team in Suffolk County and that matters and that helps a ... mile an hour of the more important if he gets under fifty percent of the votes I've said this before and I'll say it again on your show\nIt could kill his presidential aspirations because a candidate who can't get the majority of the votes in his home state can't be expected to get a majority support from the ... for as long as you do that they come out just stick it to them the time\nThose are cheated after we see in the Sienna college poll and that Cynthia Nixon and it's pretty remarkable I think you can see if the polls accurate that she's still getting ten percent of the vote or would get is projected by Sienna\nYou know what that means in terms of the conservative party it would mean that the working families party would have row seat because that would be five hundred thousand votes or so\nThat has four hundred thousand but let me let me just point it may very well be the case you're absolutely right\nBut I mean if you stay in quantum always under fifty percent in my view so that would suggest he and his people will do all they can to buy the working families party off and I'm sure the parties for sale don't you see that happening\nOh yeah ah if they get a Roth okay there you have a ... some on the state committee who may say never Cuomo but I'll go back to my original point\nFour years ago when he wound up on the working families party line the Terry Teachout vote them and teach our vote came out anyway and voted against him on the Green Party line and that could happen again\nThis poll do CNN show that he that ... that the court has jumped six points from fifty to fifty six and mowing narrow I think John's\nTrying to think what he was actually I think he jumps ten points with her out of the race that was one on one but there certainly Cuomo's going to pick up some of those Nixon probably a majority of the Nixon voters don't you think or do you think there's only a no I don't\nThink so because she didn't get a majority of the deputy traveled four years ago well that's a good point going so this\nAnd they are a lot more angry people and I'm Out there you know so uh\nI Am of the opinion that he will get under\nFifty percent of the vote regardless Cynthia Nixon as in or out because they went to how he Hawkins last time they weren't getting his vote went up from one point one up to four point eight and you have Stephanie mine are out there who will take some traditional democratic votes out of the city of uh Syracuse have nothing else\nSo my prediction is he'll be under fifty percent he's going to try to a gym and stuff to get the size of Ken but he only got fifty three percent last time for goodness sakes [laughter] and here we have four more years of and plus the corruption plus the indictment spokespeople going the jail\nOne point one up to four point eight and you have Stephanie mine are out there who will take some traditional democratic votes out of the city of Syracuse have nothing else\nSo my prediction is he'll be under fifty percent he's going to try to gin up to get his eyes he can but he only got fifty three percent last time for goodness sakes [laughter] and here we have four more years of and plus the corruption plus the indictment spokespeople going the jail\nHanded attempts or a a you know convoluted attempt to bring back\nTrump supporters and Kavanaugh supporters I Would say to\nTo mark mile and arrows campaign by the conservative party in a a appeal I've never seen the likes of before\nAnd wondered if you've seen that if you heard about it what you make of it and then the more general question of how can a especially conservatives becomes filled with mark mowing narrow when he won't support judge Kavanaugh or the president of United States\nFirst of all the way I see the end of the coffee in the text in front of me second like for the record I did not vote for Donald Trump doesn't mean I support his policies when I agree with them as soon as the ... and I've been very pleased and happy reading today about the\nThe ah the ... treaty and the new treaty that will be coming in its place so and I also am a great supporter of cabinet and uh I was not familiar the mowing narrow has refused to speak on I think it's a mistake on his part so\nWe'll put out there having said that first of all\nAndrew Cuomo is running as saying basically if you're against Trump\nLow to me that I'm leaving aside in New York\nThat's the campaign I'm leading the fight against Donald Trump\nThis ad is a conservative party is not a mile an hour away in ... and the party which endorsed Trump is saying Cuomo wants you to vote for him because he's anti Trump if you're pro Trump namely the two point eight million people and vote for Trump in the last in the ... election\nCast your protest vote in favor of Trump on the conservative line\n... for a guy who got in trouble and while he or a guy who was born in from the king I don't I don't support tried and support Trump pilot what about owning from all in our own I'll\nVote against Cuomo because of this ridiculous campaigns running and saying if you follow me you're against you know for me because you're anti Trump\nAbsurd on his part so I have no problem countering that because we ... up\nAnd get out the\nTrump vote to point eight million people that voted for Trump two years ago this will be a completely different landscape so this is a party it's\nAlready hardy at eight and I'm like I don't know I'm a lot of things that he uh he may not party had\nIt's a party ad aimed at voters to vote for a guy who's about based on their support for Trump to vote for a guy who doesn't support Trump I mean they didn't try and just\nSaying go to the conservative vote for him and on and that's how you do it every day you vote for it\nFor a guy who got in trouble and while he or a guy who was born in from the king I don't I don't support tried and support Trump pilot what about owning\nFrom all in our own I'll vote against Cuomo because that is ridiculous campaigns running and saying if you follow me you're against you know for me because you're anti Trump\nAbsurd on his part so I have no problem countering that because if we get up and get out the Trump vote to point eight million people that voted for Trump two years ago this will be a completely different landscape so this is a party and it's\nAlready hardy at eight and I'm like I don't know I'm a lot of things that he uh he may not party\nHad it's a party ad aimed at voters to vote for a guy who's about based on their support for Trump to vote for a guy who doesn't support Trump I mean they're just trying to think that the editor\nSaying go to the conservative line vote for him and on and that's how you do it every day you vote for the top of the ticket the you know I agree with you I think he's made a mistake on Capitol but\nI'm Still going to vote for him because I Want the conservative party remain ROTC I think it's a strong message when you vote on the conservative line it sends a message state why not only to Democrats but Republicans as well such merely mouse the God's sake so I you know I I I have no problem with a party had its support\nLoading I understand that but I'm sure the mountain Arab people knew about the ad I mean that's the way why\nNot and he may not like it and quite frankly I don't care [laughter]\nBut let me say the election is it a ... a month from tomorrow member served today's October second this Sienna college so we were talking about earlier\nHas fallen arrow with the ... vote there's no evidence in that poll and we haven't really seen anything in terms of a reliable poll I Would say that to counter at that moment arrows caught on with anyone or has a single issue that grabs anyone you see I Am I wrong on that from what you say\nHas to Reno was a twenty eight percent as well four years ago and got forty percent of the vote right so I just I just wonder if\nHe's a loser now that he may get already presented a loaded up you're saying\nWell he may get forty percent of all marry an angel may only wind with forty fourth forty six forty five forty four with her out and if you're not a huge Trump focus their annoyed about cabin or they're annoyed Cuomo running against Trump you know every science reinvest can tighten up\nI agreed to how do you turn out or a strong in terms vote for a guy who was against Trump and won't even support cabinet summit\nAngry people come out to vote regardless of who's on what's it\nLook they are likely to come out and supported province\nHere some popular guy but a lot of people may just vote for him to send a message to Washington about Trump festival I Do I think it's rational not necessarily but I understand the anger that's brewing on both side and it you know\nAnd Andrew Cuomo is not the paragon for these liberals who may that's for sure be annoyed the Trump but they may vote for him and Cynthia Nixon she's still on line or the minority can't they just to send a message so even though mowing narrow in the eyes of some conservatives not the perfect candidate\nIf they're overriding issues to show their pro Trump it doesn't matter to them\nAbout the kind of your life and you're really making the calculations from them and now are among the narrow slash Kentucky side which is that if they present bow and arrow is the guy is not for Trump\nWho's moderate so called more close to the Democrats on a number of issues doesn't indoors cabin or that that will allow him to pick up voters who may be uncomfortable with Cuomo bitter it's kind of liberally oriented moderate voters as they would be described that this will offset the loss of conservatives this is obviously their calculation where do you think about I don't\nI don't think it's a good calculation personally you know the upstate voters the angry upstate photos of economic issues\nOr it's over gun issues um fracking\nSo even though mowing arrow in the eyes of some conservatives not the perfect candidate if they're overriding issues to show their pro Trump it doesn't matter to them\nThen what about the kind of your life and you're really making the calculations from them and now are among the narrow slash Kentucky side which is that if they present bow and arrow is the guy is not for Trump\nWho's moderate so called more close to the Democrats on a number of issues doesn't indoors cabin or that that will allow him to pick up voters who may be uncomfortable with Cuomo but it was kind of liberally oriented moderate voters and that would be described that this will offset the loss of conservatives this is obviously their calculation where do you think about I don't\nI don't think it's a good calculation personally you know the upstate vote as the angry upstate voters are economic issues\nOr it's over gun issues um cracking issues\nSo this is what turns out people and you're going to strike back cord and that's what he's supposed to be doing in my judgment sad to say where I disagree is actually when you're ... them all in our campaign has re hire the old recruits from Pataki land right who buy into something that\nI don't agree particularly worked back in Nineteen Ninety four even though Pataki Cuomo\nThey tried to run on the campaign when I was no issues they before they Pataki was forced to put out that tax cut plan because the club for growth crowd that initially supporting them put up the money for most of that campaign said we're taking a walk unless you put up this tax cut program\nHis campaign people ceremony and company didn't even want to do that they thought anybody but Cuomo ABC candidate was enough to win\nAnd with the same mistake was ... back in those days on the independents line and spending millions of dollars that strategy could have\nBackfired so you're dealing with the same old crowd that believe if you don't talk on issues you're not going to know anybody well you know wanting a lot of annoy people out there and you've got to appeal to them on the issues that matter to them so that's my free advice to\nThe ... mile an hour of campaign if they want to get hit that forty percent of the vote and really just up the the the pro Trump folks that's in the state upstate in the Long Island so that's my free advice to her\nYou're just in his time remaining let me ask you as a student of history to give us your reflections on the Brits having a situation I frankly never seen anything like it's the closest analogy to me is Nineteen fifties\nMcCarthy is communism where anybody who was accused of having any association with communism communist front groups could lose their job\nBe socially ostracized be condemned and you are guilty before or you know ... or the presumption was of guilt and we now have\nDemocrats and even the ACLU saying that the presumption of guilt really is what they start out with the facts be damned but what's your take on\nThe issue for you just sum it up it's a new ... and the only honest guy and the left has been Alan Dershowitz who's been ranting and raving about how the ACLU and others have walked away from the presumption of innocence or of any person it's accused of something but there's more to this\nFor the left there are no rules they will destroy anybody the other day they try to jump on Lindsey Graham because he did to speak out like implying well he's a homosexual\nWell that's homophobic you know but it's okay when the left does that is crazy but more important\nThan those without the homo\nYeah let's not forget that ah when you go back to the Clarence Thomas hearings they try to lead tried to turn them in to like the bad image of the black guy who will go after any woman you know have multiple children from a multiple women and walk away from being a father\nWith Kavanaugh now and Irish Catholic suddenly they're trying to make them into a drunk so it's the stereotype he drank in high school oh boy oh boy he drank in college oh boy well I went to a Catholic\nFrom the presumption of innocence or of any person it's accused of something but there's more to this for the left there are no rules they will destroy anybody the other day they try to jump on Lindsey Graham because he did to speak out like implying

oh boy well I went to a Catholic high school and the Catholic college and let me tell you Fred I drank a lot of beer\nThat doesn't mean I committed crimes that did anything else\nBut certainly they want to make him a drunk because his last name was cabin door so they will do anything to destroy and ruin and it comes down to one subject one word abortion and that's what this is all about and sadly you got we need people like Senator flake\nWho is a dope gang I reviewed his book called the conscience of the conservative trying to play off at Barry Goldwater he's not Barry Goldwater he's not John McCain he's uh we need guy who wants desperately for the New York times in an editorial to say he's grown in office\nHe's not running for reelection because he's about to run out of town in Arizona\nAnd so I say farewell to him but if this goes down it's because of this hypocrite because if you saw plate on sixty minutes this weekend when they ask direct question would you have done this with the Democrats putting this off of your free election\nAnd he said no I wouldn't say that tells you the measure of the man he's a self righteous hypocrites\nAnd his Korea and the Republican Party is certainly going to be over because this will not be forgotten\nThis picture George out there as we do live in this climate of intolerance coming from the left the people who ... thirty forty years

exciting day or a flagship show today we're talking about our ... plus program and exactly what that is and we have a line doctor ship bond Keely to talk about that for us right now and then we'll take it from there\nDr Kelly hello Hi\nHi everybody Hi Lisa Hi Jackie Hi thanks for having me Oh thanks for being with us we're team is\nA researcher are we're getting this thing going balanced ... plus program is very exciting and I'm very excited for everybody to get to know them put it out in the world\nGreat so why don't you I have an audience exactly what it is and how can help them\nWell we we thought strange plus is a weight loss program created\nBasically for women by women such as myself um and we focus in on the prairie menopausal age because that is the most difficult time as um many of our listeners may identify and identify with um we're not\nEighteen anymore I'm once we reach forty plus and it becomes more difficult to lose weight so we\nWe created a balanced reach plus a very comprehensive\nProgram which is targeted to the individual person I'm through many different of as as you both ... and Jackie we use post nutritionists I'm a doctor's myself Dr Kelly\nI'm a fitness instructor Lisa and we designed a six week program which is very specific and it involved the lab work and really comprehensive evaluation of each person to target why they're not losing the weight that they want to lose [noise]\nYou know it's it really is such a cutting edge approach\nTo weight loss and and natural hormone balancing Dr Kelly it really is don't you find that I mean it it just really gets to the root of some runs um weight loss issues and and generally there always hormonal when to stop and weight loss rate\nIs very true you know\nI'm I'm originally my background is family medicine primary care and in our modern day medical a system it's very different you know you see all the time you have the patient comes than they are eating a doll they say I'm eating three solid the day\nI and I run I'm doing everything and I just can't lose weight and it's so great to have a program which we can offer\nOffer these patients because in my traditional model where I have Fifteen minutes with a ... you know we've never really get to the source the root cause and now with this race we call it the three sixty five I'm three sixty five panel\nUm and we uh we target these ... these these hormone levels and it's something that's\nIs very true you know I'm I'm originally my background is family medicine primary care and in our modern day medical a system it's very different you know you see this all the time you have the patient that comes than they are eating a dollar they say I'm eating three solid the day\nI and I run I'm doing everything and I just can't lose weight and it's so great to have a program which we can offer\nOffer these patients because in my traditional model where I have Fifteen minutes with a patient you know we've never really get to the source the root cause and now with this research we call it the three sixty five I'm three sixty five panel\nUm and we uh we target these ... these these hormone levels and it's something that I have you know we've never done it is really cutting edge looking at cortisol and an insulin levels and these\nAre the things that are out of whack and causing um causing the difficulties\nYeah yeah and it really is um a lifesaver for so many women that year after year um they go to their doctors complaining of all kinds of symptoms and they're always told no everything's normal just eat less and exercise more which is not the right approach during this time is it\nAnd and just frustrated with the whole thing she's been trying to lose weight for quite some time\nAs we said gone to her doctor had routine blood work no answers there\nAnd just told to kind of eat less exercise more but she's already doing that and nothing's working so that the typical typical um client that we see\nAnd so we just you know inspired then to try our program and I want to tell you a little bit about that um it it's a function of medicine approach to weight loss which is really interesting and in my opinion\nReally the way to go because you don't want to keep on doing wind diet plan after another after another generic an an ending up gaining weight and set of losing it and so this is a way to find out once the drawl what your issues are through the blood work and then ... and be done with this [noise]\nA frustration after all that so Donald agree right\nAgree yep agree so this is what we do research has shown that the gut later on adrenal glands all play a significant role in who are mono excuse me hormonal regulation and so we don't\nFire them to try our program and I want to tell you a little bit about that um it is a functional medicine approach to weight loss which is really interesting and in my opinion\nReally the way to go because you don't want to keep on doing one diet plan after another after another after never an an ending up gaining weight and set of losing it and so this is a way to find out once and for all what your issues are through the blood work and then card at them and be done with this\nAh frustration after all that so Donald agree right\nAgree yeah I agree so this is what we do research has shown that the gut later\nOn adrenal glands all play a significant role in or a mono excuse me hormonal regulation and so we start\nWith killing but God and we see that's where our pre clan for a week and this is going to target your God how true probiotic digestive enzymes and what happens is the first week we take up some foods that your body is most likely I'm\nSensitive to cause any information so that very first week you're going to the incredible results [noise]\nI'm In the way of losing that blow that we all know and hate ladies you know what I'm Talking about that lower belly bloat that just won't go away that's what happens is the first week we start losing that and we start feeling better and we start having more energy\nThe second week we start our liver detox this is a very gentle approach delivered the talks of one of the reasons\nWhy this belongs to the program is that the liver is very very important to hormone regulation it's also very important for burning that deep this are all belly fat so that's\nThe second part of the belly that we get in Terry ... is that bloat last set deep visceral fat I called the nano belly and we really can't burn that gee festival fat\nUnless we do our liberty talks we really can't do it with diet and exercise alone so that's why that second part is all about these talks and deliver and it's a really easy programs actually enjoyable um it's true shakes that day one real meal and snacks and so I feel it's the best of both worlds\nAnd then we slide right in after that because of the has the the um pre clans and the detox a kind of paved the way for permanent\nHormone a weight loss and said we slide right and after that with our lean body program which is fantastic\nIt comes up and now and chocolate and it's the same\nSort of system as a de talked to she shakes the day one meal and snacks and I don't know about you but most women do I want to think about\nFood shopping preparing and all that kind of stuff at this point so it makes her life a lot more easier and it's really really successful in fact it's so successful that most women decide to continue it after the program\nWell it's medically created it yet ugly supported unsupervised and the medical grade products support every state that you just described\n[noise] yup it it it it really is a very simplistic I feel like that's a huge plus it really is it's it's um in fact that's what the plus stands for only kidding [laughter]\nSo but it just it really is very simplistic and and it works and you just start getting results right away and um and then you take it from there\nI think that it's really important that women today asked questions but not just that question but a better question that in very often when I Am describing this because it's not main stream just like looting free wasn't me\nSo successful that most women decided to continue it after the program\nWell it's medically created it yet ... supported unsupervised and the medical great products support every state that you just described\nYup it it it it really is a very simplistic I feel like that's a huge clock it really is it's it's um in fact that's what the plus stance for only kidding [laughter]\nSo but it should be on it really is very simplistic and and it works and you just start getting results right away and um and then you take it from there\nI think that it's really important that women today asked questions but not just that question but\nA better question and very often when I Am describing this because it's not main stream just like looting free wasn't mainstream Twenty years ago and so on and so forth so it's very often when I hear the word hormones they don't they're not understanding that these are\nNaturally occurring hormone aptly Whelan leptin cortisol and they might have heard of\nCortisol but the other two are just as important and these are the underlying hormones of the body so\nWhen you're in this program can you describe\nSo what I Want to say oh so that's very important is that the old school way of thinking [noise]\nIs counting calories as we said um they'll eat less exercise more but really counting calories and thinking that um you know eating a certain amount of calories a day is going to help you lose weight\nThat's the old school way of thinking the new school way of thinking is eating for your hormonal response to food [laughter]\nAnd it's really important um let me give you an example of that\nYou can actually gain weight on let's say one of those one hundred calorie packs of\nI don't want to say any plans but much to say cookies okay [laughter]\nOne hundred calories I owe it starts known ones [laughter] I'm not going to get in trouble today Lisa so just we'll just like [laughter] and lose weight on two hundred calories of\nLet's say like the latest rap with protein in it and even some healthy thoughts like avocado why it's because your hormonal response to food and\nCauses you to gain weight on the sugar producing snack and lose weight on the protein snack and there's a whole science the explanation for that but and then leave it at that if anyone has a question for the call and but that's basically the shortest along at\nAll I could think of it as like go and maybe the science they cause those what I Do like [laughter] oh I just think of it as down to like this well your little level like break your body down to the cell doesn't want\nThirties and sugar and\nA blue frozen plus she's you know I'm nothing is going to look like and then you then then amplify so did you all in the whole body nothing is going to work quickly especially on the top all of them right well I I you know that that's my way of kind of\nBreaking it down and and kind of thing that you just said Jackie\nYeah its own you know it's all about it's all like insulin you know when you're eating food to break that leg or you're creating insulin which is ... and when you're eating foods that\nAre more protein fat related you're going to excrete or it's when sort of um\nKissing cousin or among liquor gone which is a fat burning Oregon so quite simple which would you rather do I think cooking fat burning would be the answer right [noise] and um and that's really how our program works it's quite simple and um it just\nNo I'm nothing is going to look like and then you then then amplify will sell to the Oregon to the whole body nothing is going to work quickly especially and stop all of them right well I I you know that that's my way of kind of breaking it down and and kind of thing that you just said jak you\nYeah its own you know it's all about it's all like insulin you know when you're eating food to break down gr you're creating insulin which in fact George hormone when you're eating foods that\nAre more protein fat related you're going to excrete or it's when sort of um\nKissing cousin ... looser gun which is a fat burning ... so it's quite simple which would you rather do I think that getting fat burning would be the answer right [noise] and um and that's really how our program work it's quite simple\nAnd um it's a step by step approach and um it it just works it just works\nAnd we can actually see it you can see or level we can do your own phone level the instructor ... you know you could be Scott the patients are either sky high or their cortisol down in the garbage can exact and\nAnd and it's it's just fascinating when they say the wow this is why you know and that's the way and now you have something to work with exactly how we have a starting point because we can meet each person exactly where they're at\nExactly and it's just so exciting to give someone hope where they truck there wasn't any\nEffort to really um get those answers to their question I'm just you know they're they're wellness questions of why they haven't been feeling well and why they have this extra weight they can't lose no matter what um it's just it's very gratifying\nIt's very gratifying we don't yeah that's right yes I Know yeah that that's it kept tests don't guess I Love that it's\nLike if you wear a size seven you're not going out and buying a size Thirteen show that we can go on and on but it's really important the baseline assessment is really structured for you and that's why you're you're you're hiring a professional really support you along the way\nAnd not give you what you don't need feed your body so that it can heal itself and the liver can function properly and we just feel terrific\nYou know one of the exciting parts of this plan um is our fitness and I think we had a lead it's a film about that\nIt's really important that part of the program is the assessment very similar to looking at the blood panel the if there is a food sensitivity or an imbalance in a particular vitamin level and and hormone level et cetera but from the fitness perspective we understand the correlation between\nThe old max oxygen volume for lungs and also how we're feeling in terms of the tea and how they work together so similarly one can eat well but the malnutrition their absorption and their simulation so similarly\nHow movement affects a person is also based on that assessment\nIf they have had um an injury in the past or if they are trying to strengthen particular part of their body or if they are going experiencing any hormonal symptoms we factored that in in the customer the son of the program so you can get better results when you are\nFeeding your body giving it what it needs and with the same approach with the movement aspect of it\nSo bringing them a baseline so that their body can really feel in progress so I'd like to use the term a progression of focused intensity but it's a gentle approach and its customize great\nMen affects a person is also based on that if\nIf they have had a ... an injury in the past or if they are trying to strengthen particular part of their body or if they are going experiencing any hormonal than we factored that in in the customer station at the program so you can get better results when you are\nEating your body and giving it what it needs and with the same approach with the movement aspect of it\nSo bringing them a baseline so that their body can really ill and progress but I'd like to use the term progression of focused intensity but at the gentle approach and its customize great\nWhich can block you from reaching your true potential and keep you backwards while the rest of the world continues to move forward\nSay bail when I was young I remember that raised a story we've my father\nI think I was in grade six or seven yeah this is a long time ago I did not remember I sat there which grade but I was younger and I came from school and I had at ... yeah and that was happy okay because before I\nSee our the C SPAN and\nI'd be mine it and I was happy and I came I was so happy and I rushed to my dad\nAnd I told him that I got beat you know what happened what happened to my dad or look at me in my life and he did not it did not for this word I was expecting this word eighth ...\nHe did not say congratulations and that was waging a war day that he would leave this word to me only ... on it did not\nKnow what happened what happened to me I felt like maybe I did not do what what was expected from me by my it that they know what happened what happened I decided to war harder and I'm telling you I stopped work\nAnd work and work I studied at night and what happened next semester I got a minus when I got a mountainous my dies this time when you look at me he said son gone regulation you dated glued shop\nAnd he told me song if I did not I'm not too late to the last time it because I did not long she'll be satisfied wave that be because of lunch was satisfied wave that'd be it was not\nWhat happened what happened to me I felt like maybe I did not do what what was expected from me by my dad they know what happened what happened I decided to work harder and I'm telling you I stopped to work\nAnd work and work I studied at night and what happened next semester I got a minus when I got a mind that's my dies this time when you look at me he said son gone ... glued shop\nAnd he told me down if I did not let you lead to the last time it because I did not long she'll be satisfied wait to be\nBecause the ones who are satisfied wave that the you know we're not try to get a because eh man we satisfied with is shut down to a vote when not to fight the goal Hi\nExcuse me profit assignment yes now and thank you for your story because I think that is something people really an absolutely all of our listeners need to hear and understand now\nLadies and gentlemen if you are listening to me right now I I Want you to picture something in your mind I Want you to picture the world without ambition\nI Want you to picture of the world without incentives because I'm willing to bet that a lot of you are listening to meet today and ... and thinking you know bill I don't really get what you're saying because\nMy only drive is to be happy to be right where I Want to be to have everything that I ever wanted and that then and only then I'm going to be happy just being a right where I've always wanted to be I have my I don't know God Forbid your car\nAnd your kids and whatever it is that you think is going to keep you satisfied and that's going to be enough for you\nBut now I'm asking you to picture once the world would be like\nWithout ambition without without a drive for more now I'm willing to bet that there would be no America\nThe world would be in a very primitive stage because rather than keep moving forward rather than\nPushing towards something better or rather than wanting to be better than we are now we would have decided that where we are is the most that humanity can ever evolve we would have decided that right where we are is where we should be\nAnd things will be dire today\nBut something something as deep as and passionate\nAs the American dream is built on the foundation that one day people came from everywhere from all across the world to this land of promise a land slowing with milk and honey and decided that they wanted more just said\nBe light just want you stumped on top of what you say absolutely they came from France they can find anger they came from a crush air up at that time the Iraq was a beautiful place it is it a day yes but I was just a big field\nPlantation is only ...\nThere were a there was nothing and you hit it off was built the ones that are very advantaged saving in station\nBy cannot watch what happens does speed bumps out where you want more than chess why we have now\nThat's why they ... America and they built this nation yes there were not satisfied with what they had in France they were not satisfy what would they add in England, England or is that being able to afford\nWatch your say absolutely that came from France they can from England they came from across Europe at that time Europe was a beautiful place it is today yes but America was just a big field plantations oh no\nThey weren't a there was nothing and you hit on force field he was a very odd advanced civilization\nBut you're not like what happened does speed bumps south where you want more than ... why do we have now\nThat's why they ... and they built this nation yes they were not satisfied with what they had in France they were not satisfy what would they add in England, England or they're being able to fourth place we know that in the street by\nThose people those people came here they call themselves I\nI Want more than what I have ... day and that's what made them to travel across the ocean and come to her to come to America and they built this nation\nLadies and gentlemen I Want you to listen to me that place you are if you are a Christian ... not the Christian I don't care I Want to listen to read from your car\nFrom the comfort of your satisfaction ease that dropped\nBut it's actually an ease your worst enemy when you get satisfied that he's some say in you that will tell you I don't fly she'll go Hi you're that already everything\nAt once you get this feeling inside us you this was came into your dreams this what can you hear that drive for ...\nYou'll see beef that means they have very powerful story in the Bible yes about David and die in yeah that young David Was a teenager and he was a set but\nAs you know that's a shepherd your job is to take care of this cheap yeah the flock you off no ... in the ...\nBy the by above safe that lost a giant you used to calm and who used to in some of the army or the Israel and everyone was afraid of this giant his name was go live\nAnd what I think he's dead but he was a shepherd\nHe failed I Want more than just being ... and that's why he decided I was a fat but we know lord training we have no military pay rent\nThat the beside it should go to fight that giant\nAnd ... and and you know the story yeah he killed\nThat giant absolutely why didn't you know that giant big cold even though he was not a military man but he was Sam shepherd he was he was ... she room we have a burning desire\nShe'll go Hi ladies and gentlemen it might be if very poor men in you'll feel it might be full of that and maybe or thinking how am I going to get out of all those problems\nListen if you are burned each off on him which that there's ... there's desire we had you Joel world commensurate comes down to wander excuse me profit or profit I I think that I Need to understand you need to understand\nThat that giant absolutely why didn't you know that giant big cold even though he was not a military man but he was Sam shepherd he was he was ... she room we have that burning desire\nShe'll go Hi ladies and gentlemen it might be if very poor men in you'll feel it might be full of debt and maybe or thinking how am I going to get out of all those problems at\nLeast on if you are burned each off on him which that there's ... there's there's science that we had you Joel work miracles and wander\nExcuse me profit or profit I I think that I Need to understand I hadn't you need to understand and I think that everybody who's listening to us right now has to understand the ... the drive for more is bigger than just one man\nIt's it's bigger than just what I wanted to or or what you want or what any of us were meant to achieve\nBut it is about all this as a collective people as a collective species on this planet and what we can do to move forward to move further to keep evolving into ... D ourselves yes because\nWe're living now in an era in an era of crucial team because we are the product of people who decided that they were going to keep pushing forward\nBecause imagine that people never decided to keep pushing for me probably wouldn't even be born today so we owe it to ourselves we owe it to the human race we own to America to keep pushing forward and tonight to never give up and then never ever think of ourselves and being satisfied\nBecause that is when we stopped moving forward and we start to go backwards\nLadies and gentlemen I Want to remind your day my name is ... ... do profit\n...
