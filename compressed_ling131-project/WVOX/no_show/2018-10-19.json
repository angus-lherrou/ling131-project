I Believe in the last twenty thirty has become more involved in careers is fulfillment\n[noise] what is I have never really reflecting on that I\nKnow you have it you do what you love\nYeah I I basically just follow my heart and um [noise] had a little more than I used to try to balance the to the head in the heart but I'm a film that I Believe has much more to do with\nAn inner peace and satisfaction that\nDefies a a world that can attempt to negate goodness and then there's a sense of film that that you have that you that's within you and you carry with you wherever you go\nA lot of it I suspect based on the conversation that we've had a learning to live in the moment may be the most important part of fulfillment because it all goes by so fast\nAnd go remodeling today at three o'clock you're talking about anything special\nMaybe the most important part a fulfillment because it all goes by so fast\nAnd go remodeling today at three o'clock you're talking about anything special\nBut here's the catch all this always speak is behind the scenes and if you do it the same way the Russians hacked up you kind of get away with it because you don't get away with it it's an

today\nWell before I get started I at the end of last week's show Anthony called up and I want to apologize if in any way I um indicated that the people who need narcotics or opioids should not get them it's never my intention and I know that there are there's a significant number of people for whom that is necessary\nUm and I hope that that continues to be available dancing or my issue is really that there's a lot of abuse of it as a result of either doctors not being aware of the addictive nature\nOr something to various people as we well know we just got locked up\nTo the doctor you go being reasonable you're on TALK radio you're supposed to be obstinate didn't tell the Anthony why he's wrong but\nBut I'm asking me oh I Hope you stay well in the second thing I'd like to probably call Anthony I'm there was a discussion before I got here about immigration\nAnd it's a it's an issue that I it's near and dear to my heart to having been second generation American from Eastern Europe um you know we have a dilemma in our country\nI'm sitting in with a with the with an article about Harvard studies their admission call I did that story today I'll do here they know it well I'm just going to bring something up that yes we\nForty three percent of the students would be the the the\nMy issue is really that there's a lot of abuse of it as a result of either doctors not being aware of the addictive nature or some nefarious people as we well know we just got locked up\nTo the doctor you go being reasonable you on TALK radio you're supposed to be obscene they didn't tell the Anthony why he's wrong but but uh and and I hope I hope you stay well in the second thing I like the ... call Anthony\nI'm there was a discussion before I got here about immigration and it's a it's an issue that it's near and dear to my heart having been second generation American from Eastern Europe um you know we have a dilemma in our country I'm sitting in with a with the with an article about Harvard studies their admission\nI did that story today or do they know it well I'm just kind of bring something up that yes we\nForty three percent of the students will be the the the population of ... will be forty three percent\nIf it was done in grades below forty three percent it's now about Nineteen percent another forty percent what if they just looked at the applications academic oh I see forty three percent of the students at Harvard would be Asian\nThere is there's about eleven percent ... percent African American if they just looked at grade level less than one percent would be there\nSo here we have an interesting dilemma did a dilemma I understand the pros and cons I'm not going to comment on affirmative action that's not the purpose of my comment but what is interesting is that many of these Asian students\nWho are just knocking it dead at our universities are immigrants and whether we like it or not those of us who are of European descent\nThat the greatest academic achievement in America\nIs being performed by people from India or from Asia now but the question does come up you'll get calls to say well are they illegally so now I'm Talking about illegal immigration I Am only interested in immigration being legal\nOnce you lower the bar and say well now it's undocumented you're changing the nature of the word legal and illegal talk show oh I'm Sorry but I I had a question for you when you're done with this for so interesting enough there was also a story this week\nAbout a Thirteen year old young Indian boy from India\nWho at Thirteen developed an algorithm\nIn order to treat and diagnosed pancreatic cancer feel just for I figured out I almost ... at this point that's why I got out of the the horrible rise in Canada as and realized that it was it important things so we said his mind to it and it came out with an algorithm which is kind of a formula\nIn order to diagnose locate pancreatic tumors to better treat them the Thirteen year old boy from India\nYou know that's an immigrant family they're just a gift to America\nSo what we need to do is look at immigration how it affects America positively and that's that we should look at it not all through the lens of of all immigration doctor the other line story here and it has to be my horrible task to bring it up\nAnd it leads with the question why are these days and students so good at this you know what let's that's a tricky question again okay I really ask it could be a natural selection of people come here are brighter rose that are not don't come here\nAre we certainly know that the Asians are much harder working as in general than we hope that America let it go to the converse and conservatives get beat up for this and they should does culture math\nAbsolutely matters well you're not allowed to talk about I'm gonna tell you if you look at age and households by and large\nThe thing that matters number one two and three how old are you doing school nothing else and they are of one mind and they are putting us the shame that's native born American I have also in front of me a result of the uh S. ACT test which is\nHorrible task to bring it up and it leads with the question why are these days in students so good at this\nYou know what let's you know that's a tricky question again okay I really ask it could be a natural selection of people come here are brighter rose that are not don't come here\nAre we certainly know that the Asians are much harder working as in general then we open American let it go to the converse and conservatives get beat up for this and they should does culture Matt\nAbsolutely matters well you're not allowed to talk about I'm going to see how you look at age and household by and large\nThe thing that matters number one two and three how old are you doing school nothing else and they are of one mind and they are putting us the shame those native born Americans I have also in front of me I results of the uh\nAs ACT test which is a college readiness test given to students already graduated high school and the scores are down all over the country except\nInteresting enough to Dorothy sit in the west coast seems to be holding around the middle of the country is decreasing significantly\nDecreasing in the middle middle class scores are college preparation voting is going up though well [laughter]\nI Know that you know this is an interesting duality here we have this enormous explosion of academic performance among Asian Indian population and the rest of us Americans aren't going in the opposite direction and they're all getting a similar education by the way\nSo let me just give you my fear again about marijuana guy you know cause I build a candidate just legalize that everyone says let's legalize it and believe me the people that are going to sell it a banging the drum of course they okay\nSo you know what's what's happened is that kids are putting marijuana and to these raping cigarettes and you can't tell the difference [laughter] and they're very marijuana\nAnd we we are opening Pandora's box just like we did I Know I Know all the issues about the legality issues driving people to jail and not saying we should lock people up but once you open up Pandora's box with a long term studies\nYou are going to have some results that are going to come back and bite you Dr allow me to challenge it was part of what we do here start drinking [noise]\nWe have a lot of problems with drinking Bob ... we're not going to have problems with marijuana out it'll be another source of getting yourself stoned and then go on to maybe have other problems\nYou want to take calls yet or you got more hours I I I I think I've said enough I'll be happy to talk to people could listen to you for two hours straight line twenty images on\nHappened is that kids are putting marijuana into these cigarettes and you can't tell the difference and there may be marijuana\nAnd we we are opening up Pandora's box just like we did I Know I Know all the issues about the legality issues driving people to jail I'm not saying we should lock people up but once you open up Pandora's box with a long term studies\nYou are going to have some results that are gonna come back and bite you Dr allow me to challenge it was part of what we do here starts drinking\nWe have a lot of problems with drinking Bob ... when I was going to have problems with marijuana well it'll be another source of getting yourself stoned and then go on to maybe have other problems\nYou want to take calls yet or you got more hours the ... I I I think upset enough I'll be all never talk to people could listen to our straight nine twenty images on the phone and if you'd like to join the conversation you can call us the sixty six year old woman zero Mitchell thank you for calling doctor good morning Mitch hey how you doing to address that mission\nAnd someone who uh is the child of a parent who die from prescription drug labs prescribe by atop the ... legal legal medicine I applaud an incredible truth to continue to banging the drum is about ...\nHow doctors sometimes over prescribe but I don't watch because she knows that if we look at it many many people who like dictate to hope we're already today\nI are addicted declared stay hurt that fact dangerous and aid they got the drugs correctly a doctor to monitor that\nAnd continue to give them when maybe they should have withdrawn I'm sure those those people picked it not be a step dad people they clashed that Dr ... that the the the junkie which could knock that\nAre ... and may I also point out uh I don't know the percentage but days those who have hope lake in their house\nOr thing that children are helping them out just like they help themselves to the liquor cabinet right may help themselves to the medicine cabinet so I applaud your effort to bank to continue to ban determined that to the action\nOr if I could you ... you started with a um immigration let me give you a number that nobody talks about ... highly ... million five seven and a half million bacon position is trapped in in\nA United States right now that we can fail we don't have people who want to take their smoked him a trucking farming and so forth gas who who what type of people\nTake those jobs and it would put would love to have those jobs when he said you know if we can't have people farming in pecking I clapped ... will become more strength on what have less of it we need we desperately need to get the position spilt\nSo you know it's a two edged sword here and to to make a blanket policies they've never correct\nBut we have to come up with something where we could have people who are are coming from the United states to make a better life the opportunity to get the come and get the job can maybe there'd be violence now a a care for a certain amount of time wherever\nBut we've got to come up with more coherent policy and it and you're absolutely right uh\nAmerican I Know I Would have to be you said at the wave of emigrate immigrants worked harder than ah than those who are here now [laughter]\nThank you mention you know I I couldn't agree with you more and there's also a great need for people with high levels of technology experiences exist in India\nStrings felt so you know it's a two edged sword here and to to make a blanket policies they never correct\nBut we have to come up with something where we could have people who are are coming to the United states to make a better life the opportunity to get the come and get the job can they be valid now a a care for a certain amount of time wherever\nBut we've got to come up with more coherent policy is and it and you're absolutely right uh American I Know I was actually you said every way but then a great immigrants worked harder than ah than those who are here now [laughter]\nThank you much you know I I couldn't agree with you more and there's also a great need for people with high levels of technology experience that exist in India in Asia\nAround the world to come here because companies are having a hard time getting those folks and and you know what a joke that the issue is colored by a lot of dark haired and ferries feelings about people that are different than a\nWhole yet and America is changing\nAnd there's no question that we are you know as as Caucasians we will be a minority and a lot of people feel threatened by that um but again I\nHad two thoughts that could change things radically both medical costs medical costs and the issue of immigration and I and we're ... we're dealing with that one I mentioned a medical card that I should carry in my wallet because when I go to a new doctor I've got to spend a half an hour filling out forms\nBorn should be on the computer ... that will lower cost number one number two is a national identity card why\nTo have a Social Security card at a license [noise]\nBut I Can't repeat required to have a national identity card once you have a national identity card my name is ... whatever it is on there\nI go to a job I handed in if I don't have one of those I Can't get a job and I can't be here and I have no trouble\nWith what is it the loss of freedom bumped up you're going to help make sense soccer you got to talk radio it means the employer Ohio's you have to see your national identity cards and that means the employer the pork I and I guess there are people here already that are going to have a problem but let's begin with starting to fix the problem with that level you\nCan manage all these things it'd be easier to sign up for Social Security be easy to get your driver's license to be able to go to school but you can't do that until you come up with a sensible way to deal with the people that are already here and that is the is\nThe voting rights issue the same thing a national identity card that's that's that's a fraud proof so we'd have to deal with voting issue we have this constant struggle about people doing that I voted but it seems to me that unless you have this discussion outside the realm of politics left right middle you're never going to sell the product\nBut that's what the show is about the politics of politics in your house starting Dr ... started ... we want to reopen the phone's fixing their a woman's you're a doctor I have another issue for you to stick your seat okay thank you wait earring is this\nThe ah the White House it's coming out saying they support protecting people with a pre existing conditions at the same time they order the attorney general to do away with it you know speaking on both sides of their mouths what did they expect\nHave no idea people between fifty and sixty five to do is to have a pre existing condition what today\nThey should ask them to either take no insurance out or pay absorbent prices for insurance\nAnd and and and let's face it if you're over fifty an outfielder fifty and white God forbid trying to get a job\nKnow it is a real problem and I'm going to say that we have not again made this decision I said on this radio station numerous times are two things every American needs one is an excellent education of which some get most don't and number two is access to health care they can afford\nUnless you sell those two basic issues because then there's a human rights there's just not this is about the future of a country because of that in that\nA pre existing conditions at the same time they order the attorney general to do away with it you know they're speaking on both sides of their mouths what did they expect\nHave no idea people between fifty and sixty five to do is to have a pre existing condition what today\nThey should ask them to either take no insurance out or pay absorbent prices for insurance\nAnd and and and let's face it if you're over fifty an outfielder fifty and white God forbid trying to get a job\nYou know it is a real problem and I'm going to say that we have not again made this decision I said on this radio station numerous times are two things every American needs one is an excellent education of which some get most don't and number two is access to health care they can afford\nUnless you sell those two basic issues the U.S and there's a human rights there's just not this is about a feature of a country because of that an education without a healthy population we all suffer it's not just the poor guy goes to the hospital\nThat has no insurance and runs up a huge bill the hospital doesn't get an added my insurance costs go up Bob's insurance everybody we all pay for this there's no free lunch out their folks\nSocked I've been listening to you and working with you now for three years and one of the things when it comes to health care that I realized oh I shouldn't say we'll I I don't know what I'm asking your opinion a weird subject to an oligarchy now\nI mean it's the the the the medical company the insurance companies farm they are deciding what our health care is not us not the government either because they're getting money from these people to make the\nRemember when they wrote the Affordable CARE Act even the Democrats they only invited in by pharmaceutical companies the drug manufacturers\nThey wouldn't deal with tort reform they didn't ask the doctors there is a a you know I'm I don't want to be conspiratorial but there is an undue influence\nOf large corporate interests and making decisions in Washington because they've got the bucks and congressman like the money and senators like to get reelected and as long as that system exists folks nothing is going to change\n... years ago yeah for mentioned Anthony would call up and say what about tort reform because I was a big part of the Affordable CARE Act and I had no answers because it makes total sense to have tort reform\nHarry Reid when they asked them about tort reform each says my constituents withdraw the trial lawyers will not allow that to be introduced\nMe to remember that and you have another call Mitch is back on the line Mitchell your back on the I'm Sorry hold up the wrong side Chris is on come on and crush [laughter]\nMore not go more evolved I appreciate your confession this warning about yesterday's event\nThat I that I saw you and try to hit on your wife that [laughter] you know when I got all my burned all our sweat is [laughter]\nI don't have a a dream what questions do you have for the doctor [laughter]\nBut but I you know what are you talking about the um culture thing of all most as I think we might discuss a lot of the people that come from the Mid East a high end people to pay system uh mostly uh in the middle east and they come out there they're not the uh\nLower echelon people that come here\nBut you know let me tell you the flip side of it I'm not sure that's all the case but because a lot of the Vietnamese people at a scape Vietnam when the war and and I've done very\nWell or not yeah that's that's a different ... and and my grandparents who came out from the political asylum ... and my grandparents who\nCame in from Houston Houston or a part of Eastern Europe\nA world where we never went past a ninth grade and there was no education for them to do that with poor people and now two generations later every one of the grandchildren have master's degrees PHD's or MDs or dental degrees so\nFather to pay system uh mostly uh in the middle east and they come out there they're not the lower echelon people that come here\nBut you know let me tell you the flip side of it I'm not sure that's all the case but because a lot of the Vietnamese people at a scape Vietnam when the war and then I've done very\nWell when I get that should that should that for ... and and my grandparents who came from political asylum ... and my grandparents came from\nEast and he's been a part of Eastern Europe\nA world where we never went past the ninth grade and there was no education for them but the rights that were poor people and now two generations later everyone around children having a master's degrees PHD's or MDs or dental degrees so\nOr less the agenda for the Democratic party they used to be a group called the end of the sea new democratic coalition new democratic coalition that used to harass my father because he wasn't liberal enough believe it or not [noise]\nUm most people would say uh he was a great liberal\nOr many people would say he was too liberal but\nThere was a left to my father who complained that he was a not left enough [noise] ah he would say they were professional uh liberals or professional\nA political people meaning that ah they have a valid point of view but it's a professional point of view or as opposed to a populist point of view\nI think that's actually exacerbated now and if I can just take another second on it you have\nA group of political people who are are engaged on a daily basis for one reason or another they're running an organization with it\nA political reporter or blog ... and the communication and intensity among them is much higher\nThat is ... Instagram and the energy they generate among themselves is much higher\nThan it has been in the past than some of them then believe that\nIs reality uh it's not reality are that's their own political reality reality is what are people live day to day who aren't reading blogs because they have jobs and they're trying to make\nOn a daily basis for one reason or another they're running an organization with it\nA political reporter or blogger and the communication and intensity among them is much higher\nThat is ... Instagram and the energy they generate among themselves is much higher\nThan it has been in the past than some of them then believe that\nIs reality or it's not reality are that's their own political reality reality is what\nAre people live day to day who aren't reading blogs because they have jobs and they're trying to make ends meet [noise]\nUh and uh when it came to the primary uh this state is the most progressive state in the United states of America\nNot because of blogger whole pines but because people know it they know that we passed the marriage or ... it was a very big deal they know that I passed the gun safe the law they lived that they heard that they saw the controversy [noise]\nAh they know bed I raise the minimum wage to the highest in the country because to point three million people got a raise or that's how they know they see it in their paycheck\nOr they know that we have uh the best free college tuition for middle class families in the country because they're looking at it for their child [noise] so uh I understand the academic attack but\nYou're not going to tell the people in this state that I'm not a progressive because they know differently\nOr governor I Want to label you forgive me or that are you a centrist or a progressive ...\nI Am a pragmatic progressive [noise] whose definition was that bill those your father yep of\nYeah let me ask you but let let me interrupt her first I can think about that for a second pragmatic progressive now this is Mario Cuomo right the the greatest a liberal or the greatest intellectual politician pragmatic\nProgressive why\nAnd I I hated the term by the way I used to [laughter] you know one understands without me and he would say as only if they're not smart enough\nTo know where it means I don't care [noise] pragmatic progressive\nIt almost sounded like an oxymoron but his point was\nYou cannot be a pro grass of if you want to not pragmatic there is no academic progressive politics progressive ... politics happens\nIn actuality there is no theoretical progressive politics either you made in my life better or you didn't either I have more a bread on the table or I don't I don't\nOnly if they're not smart enough\nTo know where news I don't can't hear [laughter] pragmatic progressive\nIt almost sounded like an oxymoron but his point was\nYou cannot be a pro aggressive if you want to not pragmatic there is no academic progressive politics progressive ... politics happens\nIn actuality there is no theoretical progressive politics either you made in my life better or you didn't either I have more a bread on the table or I don't\nI don't want to hear your theory and your intellectual exercise and your academic\nPolitical\nAnalysis I Want progress in my life because I needed because I'm poor because I'm a working family because I'm disabled because I'm a victim of discrimination so I Need progress so his point was\nProgressive needs a model fire\nAnd the model fire is the word pragmatic\nNot because [noise] it is a an oxymoron or inconsistent but did as a model fire it is the practical\nProgress it is the actuality and the concrete accomplishment\nOf the a progressive theory that was his point and when you are and executive\nAh you realized very quickly as opposed to a legislative branch or\nA an academic a there is to make actual will change that is much harder that it often involves compromise ah it in ... it involves\nNuance it involves fashioning a specific solution or to a problem\nAnd it's not as easy as just ... pining or pontificate ing about absolute ideal as some of the pragmatic\nTakes you to a different place we now have to get it done that means I Need to get a piece of legislation passed that means I have to talk to Republicans that means I have to talk to conservative Democrats that means we're going to have to shift a little bit from the ideal\nBecause we live in the Rio and that's the pragmatic part\nA and he would voice this uh in the on growing debate he had at that time with the people who were to his left\nAnd he would say look it's very easy to be a purist ideologically if you don't have to get anything done right there boil it is about a writing a paper on it or giving a speech on it\nThen it's easy to advocate\nFor the perfect uh but if you have to get something done as an executive or because you believe people actually need help or and because you\nOh because we live in the Rio and that's the pragmatic part\nA and he would voice this uh in the on growing debate he had at that time with the people who were to his left\nAnd he would say look it's very easy to be a purist ideologically if you don't have to get anything done right there boil it is is about a writing a paper on it or giving a speech on it\nThen it's easy to advocate\nFor the perfect uh but if you have to get something done as an executive or because you believe people actually need help\nAh and because you actually want to improve the situation that then introduces the element of pragmatism so he was a pragmatic\nProgressive uh and that's what I Would call myself\nGovernor or what first of all the clock is ticking or the Democrat [noise] your party they got to pull out somebody again\nPresident Trump's first of all a I had ... risk our friendship of many many years or is it possible like Donald Trump President Trump and Governor Cuomo\nIs possible [noise] ah the can you like both a theories both philosophies ah no [noise] uh my philosophy\nMy theory of government is a diametrically opposed a this house so this president the lights in division\nOr he thrives in division it's not just that he thrives\nIn competition or he thrives in confrontation he thrives in division uh he he looks to energize people through anger I Believe\nUh I Try to do the opposite [noise] uh I Try to appeal to people's better angels now it's much easier to appeal to fear as opposed to love\nThat I hear the knocking on doors so all the a very recent wrap this up you've given his youthful tough so wonderful stuff are they the book on Andrew Cuomo governor Andrew Cuomo is that he is he's respected\nEven your critics respect a that he he's got dynamism he's a he nobody knows the levers of government\nLike Governor Cuomo he's the door or he's he's the cat\nUh you will the son of a man they called the great philosopher states one of the American ... Boston Globe and I hear that day I hear your voice\nI hear it in your thoughtful come as why the hell do to talk more like this [noise]\nYou know bill [noise] with all due respect man\nNow with ... [noise] the\nIt was a different time when my father gr burned they don't give you more than thirty seconds they there's no the the intelligence\nThe substance of government that theory of government the philosophy of government or there's very little appetite for that now\nAh I don't want to get myself into too much trouble but you know we had great reporter's back then where you could have a two hour conversation on an issue before they\nWould write a story and they would think about it and research it we're in an age of blogs and tweets and\nFrankly reporters who don't have the background or or the time to develop a a really substantive piece [noise] my father was a brilliant communicator\nHe was a brilliant intellectual uh uh uh but he also had that pragmatic side [noise] a part of it I think\nIs a reaction to what they said about my father because they said that about my father but also remember they said ah unfairly but so much of this business is unfair\nBut he didn't accomplish a enough right the naysayers the nasty ones\nUh and I won't mention it all blond argument yeah so articulate right he gave a great speech but he didn't\nNew cater he was a brilliant intellectual\nUh uh but he also had died pragmatic side [noise]\nA part of it I think is a reaction to what they said about my father because they said that about my father but also remember they said ah unfairly but so much of this business is unfair\nBut he didn't accomplish a enough right the naysayers the been nasty ones\nAh and I won't mention blood dog yeah solar to kill it right he gave a great speech but he didn't get anything done he gave a great great talker\nThat's right he called the dumb blonde you can't say that any more but [noise] but he did call it the dumb blonde singer was\nLet let me ask you as you go for a for governor or president or whatever's in your future and mark Columbus you want to be loved or they want to be respect because his I hear you today\nOn this lady drawn some day uh

of one\nRiver I was just a word and what inspired you to come up with that song\nJust a word is ah the the oldest song on the album I probably wrote that song about Eighteen years ago so I don't remember all that but it's been with me it it it's about goodbyes that we all have to undergo in our lifetime uh and so I think I was contemplating that having\nJust graduated from college in in a in a an intimidating transition myself that's interesting\nSo um uh you could now is a a a song on a I don't remember [laughter] right yeah that will be the next one how do you come up with all the songs\nIt's a great question most of them are grow out of my personal experience a lot of the songs on this record a emerged and were developed a during retreats with with parts fire\nUm each song um seems to be a kind of reckoning\nIn in my own life you know what's coming up for me how can I articulated then as I articulate it and and then share it more broadly ah how do I live in to what I learned in writing the songs so their little personal lessons for me that I Am grateful to share with the world\nSo I keep it daily diary yeah and you keep a music director\nAnd I wish it was daily I Know some great artist too who do ride home or a song a day I'm not quite that prolific but but yes it is an ongoing diarrhea\nHow long does it did it take you to you have ten songs on one river that album and by the way if people want a copy of the album how do they get it\nWell it's a streaming and all the usual outlets one river by one revert to save self titled album and you can buy it on iTunes or or CDs and vinyl are available on the band camp website\nHow do you um um\nYou know how ... how long does it take you to write a song\n[noise]\nToo long [laughter] um these ten songs most of them were written I Would say over the last five years and the recording process took a took two and a half years itself\nOr on and off a which was wonderful because I got to really luxury and finally creating creating the songs but they often will will come out are in short bursts\nHow did they get it well it's a streaming on all the usual outlets one river by one revert to save self titled album and you can buy it on iTunes or or CDs and vinyl are available on the band camp website\nHow do you um um\nYou know how ... how long does it take you to write a song [noise]\n\nToo long [laughter] um these ten songs most of them were written I Would say over the last five years and the recording process took a took two and a half years itself\nOn and off a which was wonderful because I got to really luxury and finally creating creating the songs\nBut they often will will come out are in short bursts you know so it could be a day or a week to write a song but maybe maybe I'll think of the bridge ten years later or two years later\nAnd I guess from the retreat if you speak to somebody and they're telling you their\nConcerns are problems or what their anxieties then you could do a song based on that [noise]\nWell yeah we're we're mostly sharing all those concerns and anxieties there is a song on the record called the gift of tears which is one of my favorites and as I was writing that song I was seeing faces of the different men who who come to join back for a men's group I sometimes hold at heart fire\nI was writing one verse to one friend one verse to another and they kept appearing before me why why did you call it gets to the earth [noise]\nWell it is about uh what we have to learn and received from our own vulnerability and trust and opening up which for men particularly at this moment in this culture is a really important [laughter]\nSo uh that kind of opening in our lives it really is a gift\nUm did you go to a musical I did not I am not formally trained in music although uh\nI'm formally trained in the theater I wasn't musical theater so the music part of it has always been a personal joy I'm self taught on the guitar and um your music it's not like a loud it's like a soothing music\nSome of it yeah but that clip we played so far maybe not revving people up for their morning commute\nUm I Would say are often they're reflective but as you a travel deeper into the record there are some uh some groups and and\nA more upbeat passages as well you know in\nYour um uh about one a river I looked at your website which is one river music dot com\nYeah I'm a it says one river is an image of our inter connectedness across space and time our ancestors ancestors flowed into us in life will continue the motion beyond our day on the planet bird as the river and body the boat and that is pretty deep for people\n[laughter] that is the central image of this one river project um and it comes from a book by an anthropologist Wade Davis who was studying the Amazon and the cultures in plants of the Amazon\nUm which I was reading when I learned of the passing of my grandfather and there was a kind of magical convergence in that moment I was of course grieving having lost my grandfather\nUh and I found some comfort in this book that was exploring cultures that were open to connection beyond a the physical immediate tangible world into the spirit realm\nThat's just flowed into us some life will continue the motion beyond our day on the planet bird as the river and body the boat and that is pretty deep for people\nThat is the central image of this one river project um and it comes from a book by an anthropologist Wade Davis who was studying the Amazon and the cultures and plants of the Amazon\nUm which I was reading when I learned of the passing of my grandfather and there was a kind of a magical convergence in that moment I Would of course grieving having lost my grandfather\nUh and I found some comfort in this book that was exploring cultures that were open to connection beyond a the physical immediate tangible world into the spirit realm\nThat is a ... so I guess you're from the book the location that you have and um you know and Terry town the ... center it's it's an opportunity for people to just\nAnd then at the end of your time you go back to the daily grind and it's a little bit different a little bit brighter or so is the is part of the free ... where people don't have time for them to solve or\nOur most most of it um programs that you participate in we\nWe bring in different teachers at times to guide experiences um but I Would say the most important\nTime of of our retreat and perhaps any retreat says the un structured part what happens between the programs particularly if you can be outside

all these children had of essentially been lost in the system and then we go to learn that\nI'm Out of um the last couple of months children have been forcibly removed from their parents um some as young as nine months old and Yonkers a newborn baby things forcibly removed from their parents because of the um\n[noise] new way that they're enforcing immigration laws and their persecuting or prosecuting a are bringing formal charges against everyone who crossing the border illegally which is why they've been separating children\nFrom the parents because they can't put children Indians adult holding facility so they're separating children from their parents um parents are gone one place children are long another place and I don't know if you've done the reading or not\nJune

and call them one morning noon and Vinci so with that\n\n[noise] a morning event or Georgia for a little work [laughter]\nYeah I thought I was thinking of you who was wrapping up where it matters what to say look racial thing of course I'm sure you would you use religion was big news but many people to just to\nLose or or whether you yep so I was pretty quick I was\nThere were some degree a religious ... ... secular actions or religious belief in much of a liberal\nBut we have a problem with his workers in Charlotte to bury but\nI Want to get some more troubling that folks coming to America [noise] legally\nBe construed racial\nBut I don't believe should be is a legal pressure which you could come to America I wrote a piece called me and if I was living with some of these countries will violence is Carmen\nCarmen you're just not good I Would like to come here to just a simple question do you believe in birders\nDo brain will look tree into you know then then\nThat response the ball and and I'm going to and I'm going to answer a question but I'm gonna cut you off now um but I Do believe that responsible\nUm immigration laws are important but what we can certainly seen is that\nImmigration laws are not equally applied\nAnd so black and brown folks are detained at borders in our our place in holding facilities like animal but then I'm going to happen\nFor you were coming across the border illegally of European descent and it just what we see over and over and over again and it's not that those folks are coming on but they often will use different means coming into the country but they're still not I'm essentially tracked down in in the way to\n[noise] right well then\nThat response the ball and and I'm going to and I'm going to answer a question but I'm gonna cut you off now um but I Do believe that responsible\nUm immigration laws are important but what we've consistently Spain is that\nImmigration laws are not equally applied\nAnd so black and brown folks are detained at borders in our our place in holding facilities like animals but that often doesn't happen\nFor folks who were coming across the border illegally of European descent and it just is what we see over and over and over again and it's not that those folks are coming on but they often will use different means of coming into the country but they're still not I'm\nEssentially track down in in the same way that we see black and brown folks and\nSo I'm I'm for equal application of laws right so if we're applying these ... the immigration laws and policies to to black and brown people and we should be applying them to everyone and that's just not what we see and historically haven't been ... with the um\nYou know folks who like at that folks were coming in from European nation tour of your illegally um\nUm they're not treated in the same way it's black and brown folks and so there is a problem with immigration reform law I'm you know and I know lots of people who came here as\nImmigrants who came here legally who will say you know I came here legally\nI don't understand what the problem is and why you know people can't come here just like I did but the immigration laws have changed to such a degree that it it's almost impossible for a lot of folks to get into the country now who would have been able to get into the country even five years ago and\nI'm not saying that it's a I'm not I'm not calling it right or wrong but what we do know is wrong it's tearing families apart and not that we're talking about today we're talking about the way families are being torn apart because even under the Obama administration\nUm there was a crackdown on immigration which people often don't talk about I'm not a lot of people were deported under the Obama administration but the other part of the conversation that we don't have it that the families torn apart the way families were torn apart here\nAnd that that's the important thing that we're talking about today um immigration laws are a lot like gun law [laughter] right like the problems not going to be fixed overnight um however what we're doing is wrong and for someone like Jeff Sessions that they are doing is this and you know like\nThe Bible says that the right in a correct way for us to enforce the law that's just wrong and it's shameful and so that's why we're talking about this today um and so what you can do um one of these rallies right we're having a rally New Rochelle United Methodist church\nI'm beginning a new one on the thirtieth you can go on line to move on dot org and sign up for the rally we'd like to know how many people are coming you can sign up or you can just show up but it is going to be a a multi faith rally it can do that\nUm you know to help pay bail will you know will will will um clicked fun at that rally to help pay bail because of folks don't realize is often when people um our place and I'm In jail\nFor immigrate these immigration um violation their bail or anywhere from Fifteen hundred dollars on up to in some cases that's been as much as eighty thousand dollars and\nYou know like out of the person who's playing into the country even come up with that kind of money and so people have often spent years in prison which has um delayed um I'm\nGetting back to their families right and so it's pushing these instances where parents have been separated from their children we want to help\nOr and sign up for the rally we'd like to know how many people are coming he can sign up or you can just show up but it is going to be a a multi faith rally he can do that\nUm you know help hay bales will you know will will will um ... fun at that rally to help pay the bail because of folks don't realize is often when people um are play and I'm In jail\nFor immigrate these immigration I'm ... and their bail or anywhere from Fifteen hundred dollar on up to in some cases that's been as much as eighty thousand dollars and\nYou know I I don't know the person who's going into the country even come up with that kind of money and so people have often been years in prison which has um delayed them I'm\nGetting back to their families right and so especially in these instances where parents have been separated from their children we want to help\nThose families get back together and and we want to help him on a dare do I'm just off the um\nYou know like equal access to the legal system and you know adjusted process like everyone else\nAnd so we didn't get to Antwon Rose we will talk about Antwon Rose next week\nOr next week will also have more facts about that case but I Want to remind you you are always welcome to join us at the United Methodist Church in New Rochelle services are on Sunday mornings at ten thirty and it really is a place where you can just show up ah we welcome you no matter where you are and\nAnd he gets put on um you know at night when it gets below sixty five sixty degrees they start to to pardon turn the heat on an after October Fifteen as you know\nI'm you know they expect that he'd be on so we first thing you want to make sure as if it's an oil building and there's still plenty left in in Westchester County you gotta make sure you have oil\nAnd a lotta times you know this this this call is really snuck up on us and maintenance people maybe at their head on other projects\nAre neglected pick the oil tank and then all of a sudden you know Saturday Night cold night and the oil so I Would just caution everybody to um take moment today or this weekend and make sure your oil and the Tories where it needs to be\nI Would also mentioned not for the a lot of a building owners over the last few years have gone with what we call gas into rock double\nYeah I understand what that is such Jeff have\nI have to be honest I Do not I would appreciate it an explanation\nOkay while gas interrupt the ball is a title gas supply that when buildings converted from oil and natural gas utility because you know there's a finite amount of gas and that's really what limits the amount of buildings that can be using gas and limits whether you're building ultimately could use gas\nBut there is a finite supply in the street so\nThe tank and then all of a sudden you know Saturday Night cold night and the oil so I Would just caution everybody to um take moment today or this weekend and make sure your oil and the Tories where it needs to be\nI Would also mentioned not for the a lot of a building owners over the last few years have gone with what we call gas into rock double\nYeah I understand what that is such Jeff\nHave I have to be honest I Do not I would appreciate it an explanation\nOkay while gas interrupt the ball is a\nTitle gas supply that when buildings converted from oil and natural gas utility because you know there's a finite amount of gas and that's really what limits the amount of buildings that can be using gas and limits whether you're building ultimately could use gas\nBut there is a finite supply and the street so I Want extreme cold days the utility will actually order a customer to switch off of natural gas and burn oil instead\nA customer that is willing to do that we'll get a favorable rate on their natural gas from the utility\nThe trade off though is is that on the coldest days of the year year now trying to get yourself heating oil on and you're competing with feeding loyal customers that also want that heating oil and the coldest days\nSo I Would tell anybody that has gone down this path of being a gas in throughout the book customer\nTo please filled the tanks with oil now while it's Bob before the interruptions because I can promise you when the interruptions common utility force all the news is to go to the oil you won't be able to get a delivery\nSo those are my first two important ... says just check you in the toys with your guest interrupt the bowl or oil\nAnd then the next thing is maintenance is the basic maintenance you know did you get you know the system checked before the season you know basic maintenance\nI guess those are those tapes were also hold true for single family homeowners as well as multi family buildings correct\nCorrect you don't have to walk the bowl a business a with a single family homes sprint so um you know it's not as pressing issue where all of a sudden you know on the coldest eighty or you're going to be switched over to oil and not be able to get it\nBut you know we did see that in January during that we get kill us you know what they call the bomb site called ... um you know all the people that do order oil on a will call basis and and at our company we're about Ninety percent of our customer base gets it up based\nOn an automatic delivery schedule which is a computer\nAlgorithm that tracks the weather and and we you get a personal consumption for your home and we track the weather and we and we know we take on the responsibility of making sure you have oil and if you don't that's our fault\nI'm of many homeowners so still use the will call method where they track their own usage and put the order in and um you know a ... we saw in January that you know when all those people want to oil on the same day it's not going to work\nSo I Would tell the will call people to try to you know use the weather as much as we gave her the anticipate your consumption don't wait until the tank is anti when everybody else wants the oil as well I mean just a finite amount of delivers that can be made\nAnd um and then you should put yourself in that spot and having a few uh you know need oil on the coldest days of the year\nSo it comes down to planning ahead thinking in advance and always checking it was a good things to do absolutely\nIf you don't have the appetite to do any of those things and you just want to be on\nMany homeowners so still use the will call method where they track their own usage and put the order in and um you know a ... we saw in January that you know and all those people want to oil on the same day it's not going to work\nSo I Would tell the will cause people to try to you know use the weather as much as we get to anticipate your consumption don't wait until the tank is empty when everybody else wants the oil as well and just a finite amount of delivers that can be made\nAnd um and then you should put yourself in that spot and having a few uh you know need oil on the coldest days of the year\nSo it's just simply comes down to planning ahead thinking in advance and always checking it was a good things to do absolutely\nOut you don't have the appetite to do any of those things and you just want to be on auto pilot we do do this and that does have the technology to put gauges in the homes\nAnd businesses but primarily in the homes that are monitor the tank and enjoy the ... uh why fi and sends email alerts or to your cell phone as well as swallow office when the oil tank gets to a certain in the toy in real time\nSo low you know all everything I just said about checking your oil in toys basically a thing of the past that you can get all that now on an app on your phone\nWow wow that's amazing that really use every day but that's off the charts no question about that I'm a property manager of a multi family building\nAnd I'm thinking about how can I make sure my multifamily building more complex is prepared for the upcoming heating season\nWhat would you offer in terms of chips to that property manager in other words how can a property manager best prepare for the upcoming heating season\nWell first thing I Would do is you know you want to make sure that it apartments for themselves a field you know fairly tight self is leaking windows or or or maintenance that needs to be done you know let's get that done you want to make sure that the pipes bringing the heat out of the boiler room are wrapped\nInsulated that something that could easily be done now um and and just make sure that you're getting maximum efficiency [noise]\nUm you know you had radiator valves and every apartment if it's a stain or or thermostats perhaps uh we'll be shocked how many times those things haven't been working for years um access to apartments that difficult\nUm I understand that but these are the ... of the time of year when you can tell a tenant this preventive may in fact need to get in and make sure that your seat is is on and functioning efficiently\nI'm balancing is a big issue a you know you'll find hot and cold apartment supper force at a hot lower floors of a cold you know tried five buildings in the windows open all those things mean systems not functioning properly and and you know deal with it now before the season starts\nWith an

burner would require but after you actually get the frame going\nThe rest of the system is very much the same as an oil system or any other system the ... the way the heat gets distributed through the building whether it's by base boards or by air ducts or by skiing a radiators\nThat's gonna be the same whether it's a gas or oil building you know a lot of people say oh I don't eat maintenance I use gas well the reality is the only difference between a gas and oil system as what the lighting the fire that heating the boiler once you get that boiler bowl and everything else is the same\nAnd most of the problems that you're going to find in a multi family dwelling is going to be in the distribution system it's going to be in the duck or it's going to be in the ... going to be in the base for

response to it ah people calling a cover up that making the United states complicit and why would that be\nA you know there's an old saying about follow the money and um you know follow the money is definitely part of a a very appropriate discussion here in terms of what the president of the United states is doing in order to demonstrate his abject ignorance of\nOf the right way to do things and uh the real politics situation here is a very transactional presidents who just got his hand in the pockets of the Saudis and ah you know they're expecting him to give in turn all kinds of ah graces so [laughter] and the press will be talking about the press is all had to do with the press because\nAnd and we were going to take calls maybe from a supporter yeah down there in a minute I think he is saying that he has no financial interest right in Saudi Arabia [noise]\nYeah I mean if you want to take a literally you does it have any hotels or real estate that he's going to review right when he leaves out is that he's making millions tens of millions hundreds of billions from the Saudi investors in his real estate by Martin moments or\nOr building something and reporters shift in America or somewhere else at Israel he does have financial interest with the stories but not in Saudi Arabia\nWell that's actually a bunch of bologna to the president is once again telling a lie and expecting will at least I don't know who the where these thirty eight burner forty percent of these people that are his quote base I don't know where they come from how they were educated where how they were taught to think about\nFacts if they ever had any experience with critical reasoning or if they're just\nAs a professor of his name just went out of my head it just published a book on fascism and how fascism comes about a dividing people are talking about money yeah and ah but it in the rise of fascism you know pick a side or the other guys the enemy make a you know why\nOr create fear create uh dissension and talk about conspiracy theories but\nThe president's foreign policy toward Saudi Arabia is in fact a very deeply compromised and he can lie only once he's told us he could shoot somebody on Fifth Avenue\nI think that was the ... I think he he he was meant you mentioned it as a metaphor originally but I I think he was just telling us by the way I Will do right out in the open right in your face anything I Want to but\nHis business interests uh make it impossible for him to come up with any kind of an honest a response with any integrity in Nineteen Ninety One when Trump was nine hundred million dollars in debt\nOr he was bailed out by a member of the Saudi royal family who purchase to two hundred and eighty one foot yacht the Trump Princess which I mentioned before\nA his other princess Yvonne ... is married to Jared Kushner and he has deep ties to the crown prince and twenty Fifteen or when President Trump was asked about his relationship with the Saudis he said and they've played this on TV quite a bit quote\nI get along great with all of them they buy apartments from me they spend forty million fifty million am I supposed to dislike them I like them very much he said that quite flip Italy so ah he's also had businesses\nTwo but his business interests uh make it impossible for him to come up with any kind of an honest a response with any integrity in Nineteen Ninety One when Trump with nine hundred million dollars in debt\nOr he was bailed out by a member of the Saudi royal family who purchase to two hundred and eighty one foot yacht the Trump Princess which I mentioned before\nA his other princess ... is married to Jared Kushner and she has deep ties to the crown prince and twenty Fifteen or when President Trump was asked about his relationship with the Saudis he said and they've played this on TV quite a bit quote\nI get along great with all of them they buy apartments from me they spend forty million fifty million am I supposed to dislike them I like them very much he said that quite flippant le show or he's also had businesses\nOr when he was trying to build a a a hotel in that part of the world and he is he adds up to his eyeballs in debt to these people but I think these people meaning of be at A M B. S. Mohammed bin ... who is the crown prince\nHas totally overplay its hand thinking he could get away with murder and uh they're trying to but by the way that they're they're now after the deniability a story that the president was floating last week that they knew nothing about it to talk to the king talked to the crown prince\nThey knew nothing now are under international pressure and economic international pressure it looks like a NBS is going to be on his way out\n... maybe ... ... possibly not but\nHe's never going to be accepted in polite company quote if you will a politically probably ever again with the staying on his hands but they're not trying to look for a scapegoat and it looks like they're coming up with something I suppose in the next forty eight hours will hear the name of somebody in the group ah that that he did give permission he says I guess it's going to be the story\nThat they're floating um gift get permission to capture the guy to interrogate him but the killing was totally a rogue event based on a you know this guy who anyway I don't know what the bones saw a\nHow the bones saw and the forensic a\nWritten which is the head of a white he says there is a a Saudi Arabia or human on the plane which is Fifteen guys with a bone store yeah maybe coincidentally\nAnd most of all was a member of the body you after the body was decapitated to do the rest\nAnd he would according to the tapes that the the Turkish F ... says it aside is the Turkish government to prevail these rooms in the consulate\nTrump would be going along with the been so I'm trying to figure out how he could deny it ever was anything but a rope group\nBut you have this bone specialist votes for autopsy specialist telling the people as they would just remembered it if you put headphones on and listen to music it won't bother you was much right what you're doing yeah so that's not something gone a raw\nI had I had a heart he had he had he had some feeling here I Know he was trying to\nYou know at least five was a man in that Fifteen group we're on the ground princes personal security\nYeah so that's not something you got a raw egg I had a lot of ... I had a heart he had he had he had the feeling he and he was trying to you know at least five of the man in that Fifteen group we're on\nSo that's something that needs to be looked at but in terms of this wave of immigrants so called coming for because they're being subjected to violence\nWhy aren't they seeking us they're coming from Guatemala and they're passing through Honduras El Salvador and Mexico why aren't they claiming asylum in Guatemala Honduras or El Salvador\nSo they can remain close to their home country which I'm sure they want to return true when the threat of violence is God\nBecause the choice of all why\nIs that that's not what it's about and we all know that\nBut let's assume that America wants to be a welcoming country\nAnd we want to grant asylum an or the other remedy to people who are truly victims\nOf abuse around the world as we've always done quite as only in the system right now is being abused last month alone sixteen thousand families presented themselves on the border the southern border basically none of them are being detained for custody 'cause there's no place to put him\nAnd none of them returned free hearing so what I like to ask you what is your solution to that problem if you have a solution that helps actually address America has the right to have sovereign borders but presently under the system that's being gamed by many\nIf you show up and claim asylum they can't keep you in detention you will be released and you don't return\nSo that's just a basic fact\nOK okay did you mean you made your point you know you want to reply on when you want to reply so he he used the reply for many years there's been a bill passed in the Senate\nOn comprehensive immigration reform\nAnd the only reason it has it and it was a bipartisan bill passed by the Senate which was controlled at the time by the Republican\nBut it has been passed the house because members of the what you call it the Freedom Caucus Tea Party whatever the house of representatives controlled by Republicans would never pass the bill so it never became law\nWould've made things better here seems to be in our opinion or my opinion at least a desire and I'll use the metaphor here for everybody who is in this country who was either brought by their parents from another country or\nTheir grandparents but his country as we say is the land of immigrants it was never a homogeneous sovereign territory like Holland\nMany years there's been a bill passed in the Senate\nOn comprehensive immigration reform\nAnd the only reason it has and it was a bipartisan bill passed either said it which was controlled at the time by the Republican\nBut it hasn't passed the house because members of the what you call the Freedom Caucus Tea Party whatever book the house of representatives controlled by Republicans would never pass the bill so it never became old law\nWould've made things better there seems to be in our opinion or my opinion at least or desire and I'll use the metaphor here for everybody who is in this country who was either brought by their parents from another country or\nTheir grandparents but his country as we say is the land of immigrants it was never a homogeneous sovereign territory like Holland or Denmark it was a land of immigrants and it seems to me that there is a desire now to pull up the ladder in Eugene that metaphor and saying we're here\nAnd no one else comes after that even though where the same as you were trying to get in or ... is like pulling up the gang like or dislike sewing the tent up because too many people are getting under it the way I did all my grandparents did\nAnd there's the desire to make this now a sovereign country that is not immigrants for him\nBut it's only a those of us who are here that's prejudice in a way and the and the idea of calling people who are still believing in that dream of give me your tired your poor your tied refuse from a team made sure\nThat was what drove everybody your your ancestors my ancestors ancestors\nAnd said the is here to this country and those Hondurans than those Guatemalans those Osama Dorian still remember America is the land of the free where we can go the other neighboring countries that you say they should stop at\nDon't or for that and that's why your grandparents or your great grandparents didn't stop in Spain or they didn't stop in France they came to America\nAnd that dream should still persist and the and the law of immigration reform that could have been should have been passed is and and I can blame that on the party that did pass which was the Republican Party that's my feeling is\nI couldn't agree more and I'm thanks very much for that call events\nAnd the other point that Vince to talking about is ah I mean he's talking about a constitutional change to say that or even if you're born in the United states you retain the citizenship you're ... you're you're limited to the citizenship of your your parents nationality\nIn which case I I mean that would be the end of\nOf any kind of immigration that the centrally saying as you said before this is the status quo now because everybody coming from another country is going to have parents from another country in the United states you get your citizenship by birthright on American soil\nUm or by birth through an American parents at just one American parent will will come first citizenship on you as well and then of course there's a path but my parents talk\nWhich was to become naturalized American citizen and um you know I I I think sometimes we lose sight of the fact we we assume we've been here forever our country it's still relatively young um our forebears in them and not necessarily mine but you know tracing back the roots of this country\nAh people pushed off the Native Americans who were living here um and it was at a time before there were states delineated states before there were border lines and yes we do I do agree events that\nThe country is going to have parents from another country in the United states you get your citizenship by birthright on American soil um or by burn through an American parents at just one American parents will will come first citizenship on you as well and then of course there's a path but my parents took\nWhich was to become naturalized American citizen and um you know I I I I I think sometimes we we lose sight of the fact we we assume we've been here forever our country is still relatively young um our forebears in them and not necessarily mind but you know tracing back the roots of this country\nUh people pushed off the Native Americans who were living here um and it was at a time before there were state delineated states before there were border lines and yes we do I do agree events that every country every nation even every state every county\nHas a right to to to draw the lines of its borders and to protect those borders but protecting them against incursion of people who are\nFleeing um brutality fascination birders starvation or political or abuse is it something that's very ugly and something that in our country we have very much said we turned our backs on that we we open our arms to all immigrants\nListening to level in ... we are going to be back to the next segment and a few seconds just two minutes don't go away\n... here is the leaders of

[noise] um\n[noise] you know I've just been experiencing an expansion of awareness and um and I think first of all the most important part of that awareness since that I don't know\nI don't know I don't know what someone else is aware of I don't know what someone else is perceiving and\nThat helps me to be less judgmental so I'm expanding in\nA part of the international relations club he made sure that we met people from all over so I think it was his influence more than anything that um made me\nAble to enjoy the concept of people from all over the world and that you could get to know\nTheir cultures and their interests and the differences and how they look at how fun it was just [noise] um explore being alive on the earth and so I had a little book when I was a young girl about a birthday party\nA part of the international relations club he made sure that we met people from all over so I think it was his influence more than anything that um made me\nAble to enjoy the concept of people from all over the world and that you could get to know\nTheir cultures and their interests and the differences and how they look at how fun it was just [noise] um explore being alive on the earth and so I had a little book when I was a young girl about a birthday party and all the kids would come dressed in different outfits\nFrom other countries and so that was that's my favorite book for a long time and I used to draw pictures of them and you know imagine being in places or whatever so that was one and then\nI remember I wanted to um be a translator at the un Chris I thought some movie I think it was Tammy or something and they had to think\nThat's a holiday that's what I Want to be 'cause that's what I Want to do so it was like I'm premonition of me being in the New York area back in time I had no idea that I Would ever live here and so on the other thing is I had a un flag with the blue background with white lettering and the sort of a I don't know a leafy kind of\nSemi circle imagery I had that in my studio was my father and so when he passed I ended up you know having that\nHas the memory and I you know had it in my studio and it home for several years so um that along with UNICEF the use of cards every year at Christmas Time and so there's a lot of good memories of the un and when I finally did come up here to\nLived up in this area we were in Connecticut at the time we went and actually visited the human building and I saw the mural you know the um tiles and and uh people coming from different places and it was just awesome just the idea that I could come full circle and actually be in the building where I thought I might want to work at some point\nThe thing about it is so I my dream of being a translator was sort of dashed by my father who was my main supporter of all by interest um I took Spanish you know as a a class in school that I ... I liked it I was pretty good at it\nBut I never really got to the conversational part very well but um when I told him I Want it to be addressed thinks that will stand why would they hire you and they could get a native speaker to do it you know so it was like wow you know so I didn't really pursue that because um [noise] you know\nI guess he had a point but then again if I was really good at it I could probably still be a good trip later as well because they had to learn English in the same way I Would lower than it is but that's another story but anyway um [noise]\nThen you and it's always been very special to me so I'm Glad that today is uh an honoring of that um multi cultural a humanistic um idea that we're all one we're all we're all like even in our differences and celebrating cultures this is something I like to do\nIs I think you your father was a history professor that's right at um college in Kentucky Kentucky State University actually now but he wanted you to have a broader exactly yeah yeah beautiful\nHow 'bout you win [noise] know\nScott ... um\nYeah I I feel like also um expansive the week and I will say that I directly attributed to last week classics\nSo to me so I'm Glad that today is uh an honoring of that um multi cultural a humanistic um idea that we're all want and we're all we're all like even in our differences and celebrating cultures this is something I like to do\nMm thank you your father was a history professor\nThat's right at um college in Kentucky Kentucky State University actually now but\nHe wanted you to have a broader exactly yeah yeah beautiful how 'bout you win [noise] no\nNo that's got to go through um yeah I I feel like also um\nExpansive the week and I will say that I directly attributed to last week class with you and you would ask us about a great fear you would ask us to go inside and to receive\nA fear of greatest fear\nAnd I\nThat was kind of mind blowing for me all week and um\nSo I just I'm very appreciative of that like I'm learning something about\nHow much I have a judge my fear\nWanted to change my fear rather than just accepting my fear and\nAllowing it to be an allowing you to teach me what it had to teach me [noise] so I feel\nI feel different also toward people\nAnd myself and [noise] you know it's been noticing I mean I've had lots of little experience that they know how an awareness comes in a layer gets peeled off and then you have all these experience it's a kind of teach you about\nThe thought that you're trying to let go far more aware of and so I was watching it so many ways what\nThat fear of mine which really had to do with the fear of life in so many ways to the fear of what it will take to\nUh get myself at yourself out of the way and what God would have to do what life would have to do to move me closer to love\nI'm the fear of being hurt in the process of my ego so\nWithin that I've been I received a poems and I've just been looking and also very grateful and feeling very blessed to for to the process and what it has to do to move me\nCloser to love\nYeah ... I think you can\nIt all sounds wonderful wonderful we have something around\nThat will be coming at some point to the poet's corner and ... you talked about that Stephanie\nA man by the name of\nPaul hell falls pound tell us about him\nA little bit thank God I'm so palm\nChappelle it's an international peace educator he um [noise] it's his father was a soldier and and he was a soldier he became a captain in the army and was deployed twice to Iraq\nUm he experience his father had severe post traumatic stress\nSounded wonderful wonderful we have something around piece that will be coming at some point to the poet's corner and then we'll let you talk about that Stephanie\nA man by the name of\nHalls hell falls to pound tell us about him\nA little bit thank God I'm\nSo palm Chappelle it's an international peace educator he um [noise] it's his father was a soldier and and he was a soldier he became a captain in the army and was deployed twice to Iraq [noise]\nUm he experience his father had severe post traumatic stress\nUm he was in the Korean War and I and I want to say and the Vietnamese war but I Can't give you a hundred percent on that but at least in the Korean War and I'm experienced things that just um\nAffected him for the rest of his life and so I'm Paul Chappelle grew up with this um [noise] desire to understand why you know it's war necessary and and having seen\nHow destructive it was you know it's it really productive at all with sort of the question the fundamental question um he also I'm so his father it was um [noise]\nHalf African American and half Caucasian and um his mother was Korean so he had three different backgrounds and he grew up in um Alabama\nAnd he experienced a lot of um racism and bowling as well so that also fueled this question of you know can we\nCoexist\n[laughter] you know and care about each other um without\nBeing without having a constant sort of\nA sub layer of aggression that goes on and so [noise] um he went to West Point and um study there and then like I said went on and became a soldier [noise] um but through this questioning\nAnd continually searching and reading and studying and and really digging into himself and um the trauma he had from his upbringing and the violence in its home\nWhen he came out of it at the other side was a an intense conviction that I'm aggression is not inevitable in man and that um\nIt is possible for us to learn\nOther ways of resolving conflict of relating and um his sort of outlook on it is that in the same way that for you know thousands of years we were pre literate society\nWe are but then we became literate and now literacy is it's like breathing with us it's the expectation that everybody will be literate\nUm it's the same with ... and that these are skills that we can learn and we can teach um our children and that we can create a world where violent conflict is not\nHow we resolve our issue [laughter] and that there is another way and it's in a than we have that capability and um so he will be coming to speak at the poet's corner I'm On\nFor the solving conflict of relating and um his sort of outlook on it is that in the same way that for you know thousands of years we were pre literate society\nWe are but then we became literate and now literacy is it's like breathing with us it's this expectation that everybody will be literate\nUm it's the same with peace and that these are skills that we can learn and we can teach um our children and that we can create a world where violent conflict is not\nHow we resolve our issue [laughter] and that there is another way and it's in a than we have that capability [noise] and um so he will be coming to speak at the poet's corner [noise]\nUm on November tenth uh doing a day workshop there and then he'll come to the un school in Queens and speak there on a Monday Tuesday\nAnd\nIt sounds very very very interesting so do you believe that we can ultimately eliminate war\nHer uh uh I'm\nAwareness of non violence within ourselves and only with that\nWhen the rubber hits the road\nAnd that we hold on to something higher and something better and we felt for them and we do what we need to do to look at ourselves can we really um have a peaceful world [noise]\nI it's a difficult question do I believe absolutely that we will at some point in in humanity lifetime I'm\nAnd no war\nWithout war I absolutely do and I think that's where we're moving for today\nAs at once the question is Wendy Wendy question is it possible\nIs it possible that an act of war it\nHas a moral component because we're so not in this non violent place at this point\nUm I think that\nI don't know but I think it's again of a good question\nAnd um [noise]\nThink sometimes just like Jesus had to overturn the money tables or whatever it is there are places where\nDo I believe absolutely that we will at some point in in humanity it's lifetime I'm\nAnd no war\nWithout war I absolutely do and I think that's where we're moving for today\nAs as when the question is Wendy Wendy question is it possible\nIs it possible that an act of war it\nHas the moral component because we're so not in this non violent place at this point\nUm I think that\nI don't know but I think it's again a a good question and um [noise]\nI think sometimes just like Jesus had to overturn the money tables or whatever it is there are places where\nWe have to stand up and say no this is absolutely unacceptable and I'm willing to fight\nWhat is right\nAnd then the question is\nYou know what it's everybody's level of\nWhat's right and I'm\nNot very\nAnd we tend to see a lot of ignorance at this point but certainly if than myself\nYeah I look forward to hearing culture pow into having more of the dialogue because\nIt's so important to just ask and do we even value um Pete and do we even value non violent or we even teaching it so all that I'm an important ...\n... ... one of those ... points of view you Stephanie [noise]\nHad definitely something I've been speaking about since you know learning about him and reading material um and I I forgot to mention you also um as an author he's written a seven book wrote a piece series so that's available [noise] um\nI think that from just personally for me I Believe in redemption and somehow\nWar doesn't you know it's almost like when you don't have for dumped in and this is never going to you know we can never resolved it then that's it we just have to blast our way through and so I feel like I've always\nHad a dream in my mind of a peaceful world and I think most people in their hearts have that dream and so I feel like it's a part of us and that it's an evolution question\nAnd that in our history we haven't and our history that we know of that we have recorded and in that information we don't have anything we can look at and say yeah we achieved that place but\nUm the fact that we can dream it means that it's something in us and so I Do believe it's possible and maybe we're at a place in our evolution where it's more possible because we know\nWe're right on the brink we might not\nExist if this keeps on the way it goes with me we can destroy ourselves than in about two minutes so [noise] um maybe we're ready to um\nBeyond I'm wanting to feel\nBetter because we've proven ourselves to be stronger in some way rather than I'm\nWanting goodness for everyone\nThank you Scott right thank you thank you and me\nAnd I'm ... I'm so\nSomething in us and so I Do believe it's possible and maybe we're at a place in our evolution where it's more possible because we know\nWe're right on the brink we might not\nExist if this keeps on the way it goes for me we can destroy ourselves in in about two minutes so [noise] um maybe we're ready to um\nBeyond I'm wanting to feel\nBetter because we've proven ourselves to be stronger in some way rather than I'm\nWanting goodness for everyone\nThank you Scott\nRight thank you thank you and has a you know I'm ... I'm so a lot of things have been going through my mind about war\nYou know the Bible is full of of for violent acts um led by holy men [laughter] you know Joshua would lead to go in and take over a whole area\nAnd uh but it was for I I my understanding it was for God's will it was to manifest God's will on earth so that awareness could rise above\nWhat man thinks he knows and a line more with a God conscious thought and you know I you know there's still a war in the Bible according to the the New Testament of the Bible yet to come and it's Armageddon\nAnd I think under your teaching ... my understanding of Armageddon is more of the war within us [noise]\nAnd until we're able to align fully with a God conscious thought that is purely love\nWhich is the man's purpose to discover here on the earth plane then we will always have for on on earth and the other part of that was that earth is is the place where we are here to learn about the overcoming of the evil\nAnd and as long as there's evil in in the world in our thought then there's always going to be war because righteousness will be the Victor and until the evil parts of us\nThat are not in line with truth and love are cleansed until we're purified then that will have to be war\nAnd so and in thinking about it being more a moral ... war wars could be moral I suppose in that way we could say war is almost a good thing [laughter] and um it's a ...\nWell you were talking I was just suddenly reflecting\nOn um the incredible character of Joan of arc there's what were you thinking\nI was thinking yeah she she heard the voice of God she was certainly open to here to ... ah she's sixteen years old when she lead an army the French Army\nAnd um men to to war and she had to be in combat and she was certainly [noise]\nShe had to feel the pain of that but she does out she was devout and very clear that this was that she was an theory of God and that that was her role and that she was born\nAnd I was ... ... ... well you were talking I was just suddenly reflecting on um incredible character of Joan of arc yeah so what were you thinking that\nI was thinking yeah she she heard the voice of God she was certainly open to hear ... ah she's sixteen years old when she lead an army the French Army\nAnd um men to to war and she had to be in combat and she was certainly [noise]\nShe had to feel the pain of that but she does out she was devout in very clear that this was that she was an emissary of God and that that was her role on that she was born to do this role and she certainly won the Victor Shih she won the war\nUm but she herself you know suffered great a great at the hand of those who actually she led [laughter]\nAnd um she died but even in that death knowing that what she had to do and what she did was\nRight and correct\nThem can be shown how absolutely to do it at father Lewis a senior year old girl a may ... yeah mhm so and now here we are today\nAnd\nWhere are we going to have to be in was a complete\nBreakdown of the old thought\n... construction of new thought than men will the brain have to be totally altered in order to be here and to understand life in New ways yesterday [noise]\nUm [noise]\nFor for what I'm understanding [noise] um in terms of the topic is that\nHave to move to a higher place we can't continue on the trajectory we've been on because it's contradictory to\nAn ultimate plan that\nExperiences\nTruth on a level that is\nOn a higher higher um thought plane\nThan one that is more concerned with keeping itself alive or keeping its own thoughts alive [noise]\nSo how we are today\nIt's so enmeshed in um personal we'll hear sickles Bible\nAnd so it has to be elevated in order for men to continue and if it can't buy a certain point as in reference to what's happening with thing if we keep going along the way we're going\nWe may not even have the\nPotential to exist as so change has to occur how it'll happen I don't know but I Do

sometimes well hello and welcome to the show today it's a pleasure to be with you on some great I'm so glad you're here\nAnd I I Know we've been talking and talking about what we're gonna talk about first I'd like to ask you what is more and more tell us about Lauren marsh\nLauren marshes of forty five year old company that designs one of a kind pieces with marvelous wonderful elements whether it be would mess whole glass or fabrics were just launching a wonderful swayed chagrin\nAnd uh also leather line which is just about to be presented and you're the first hear about it\nGreat so what you know I've been in the show for many years and we've known each other or Twenty years when I think of Lauren Mars I think of furnishings that\nOur school is it like each of them are like a jewel each of them are in hand crafted finishes hands Spanish they designed the detailing the scale the proportion one of a kind are they want us kind\nPretty much the one of a kind because they're designed for the customer the design for you the end user for the designer through the designer to the news or specifically if you want to some detail to be changed from one of our designs that we've created\nWe can do that with you and then they become one of the car and we do sell more than one bed two beds three but\nBut we twist them if you don't want would it could be lack or if it's not black or it could be open pore gray and it doesn't have to be high shine polish\nA macabre ebony for example and it could have glass it doesn't need glass as a detailed minored element on the head border for for it it could be metal mash\nIt could be fabric or could be leather so the combination of all of these elements create and make it one of a kind for you\nTo win the business of interior design it's called customize the bow furniture\nYes and the quality is certainly there because if you come into the shower room some things you can see online and I we appreciate all the people who see online but come in and visit us visit us at two hundred Lexington Avenue on the eighth floor\nBecause you'll see the quality those see exactly what you said Jonathan about Lauren marsh one of the time the the special\nThere's a cost ebony for example and it could have glass it doesn't need glass as a detailed moderate element on the head border for point it could be metal mash\nIt could be fabric or could be leather so the combination of all of these elements create and make it one of a kind for you\nSo when the ... of interior design it's called ... liberal furniture\nYes yes and the qualities certainly there because if you come into the shower room some things you can see online and I we appreciate all the people who see online but come in and visit us visit us had two hundred Lexington Avenue on the eighth floor\nBecause you'll see the quality though see exactly what you said Jonathan about Lauren marsh one of the time\nThe the special quality the woods the grain the depths of color all of those things and how it fits together I mean I was marveled recently to be in a wonderful building in New York high rise and seeing one of our beds put together\nAh to recommend for their clients in order to keep their ... their move as smooth as possible and um eliminates stress for their clients during this transition\nShare it with a little bit about the process so I'm a homeowner I'm moving or oh no I like the one where I'm a homeowner and I just feel overwhelmed with a quarter in my home I'm thinking of the of the clients that I\nThat had so much stuff in her home in their living room what is the ... how does it begin well\nIt's simply begins with a walk through so we get to know each other and know if it's the right fit\nAnd through that process I'm able to see every nothing cranny of where they would like to organize their home or their space\nAnd then I go about putting together what I call a flat project rate for one two three organize because I found when people are in barking and usually most of our projects are large\nThat they like to understand the financial investment and a lot of organizers tend to work on an hourly basis which is great but like I said because we tend to deal with big transitions\nIt's goes hand in hand for people to understand I had a time how much it's going to cost them and then I find\nThey really are involved and embrace the process opposed to resist seen it because the the uncertain amount is not there they know how to tie him how much it's costing them and they are ready to dive in and just make it happen in some cases they're not\nA flat project rate for one two three organize because I found when people are in barking and usually most of our projects are large that they like to understand the financial investment and a lot of\nOrganizers tend to work on an hourly basis which is great but like I said because we tend to deal with big transitions\nIt's goes hand in hand for people to understand ahead of time how much it's going to cost them and then I find\nThey really are involved and embrace the process opposed to resist seen it because the the uncertain\nAmount is not there they know how to tie him how much it's costing them and they are ready to dive in and just make it happen in some cases they're not even involved I have to be honest there's some clients I met but I I haven't even had the opportunity to meet rather\nI've you know only dealt with their homes and we deal with that as well whatever you know whatever it's a it's a tale are set to each by it\nAnd so when you're you meet with the client you're offering a proposal that offers us let me\nCorrect well said mhm and soon to be paid and in in ... mhm mhm absolutely\nDuring the ... look like Disney will deposit\nRight there's the initial deposit there is a what we call her midway a meant where we have a check and make sure everybody's on the same page and things that are running and is the way the client had anticipated as well as dealing with some unexpected things that come up naturally and then we have the a final payment\nMhm on completion mhm mhm\nAnd how the staging when that that type of project for you how does that work\nWell I could talk to that because one of our clients is a very large staging project that we're undertaking as we speak and um it was a beautiful family home\nThat the people have had lived in for forty years I'm both parents are now deceased so I'm working with the uh with the children the next generation\nAnd the home is too large for anybody to be able to keep in the family\nSo we are on we are based we are the ones who get the house on the market\nThat's why we have so many ... who use this as a referral service because what happens in most cases the clients can't or don't have the the wherewithal to do what it needs to be done for the home to get its best asking price\nSo that's where we come in and we uh we call it a Marlins magical dust we make everything shy and and um the home looks absolutely the best that it can be and usually very different uh like clients loved to tell me why do we do this for ourselves\nAnd where do you move you must have to move the furniture and things out right\nSo sometimes we have a pot onsite mhm other\nTimes we have a storage unit and then in this case because like I said the next generation is not taking over the home nor has the ability to keep you know so much furniture that's in the home we're on a boat to donate it to great causes\nIt will find a new life that other people can enjoy\nYou also help you you help uh bring you know give it to donate to the non for profit\nYes big a big part of our been actually watch every quiet and we do that\nThe home looks absolutely the best that it can be and usually very different uh like clients have to tell me why didn't we do this for ourselves\nAnd where do you move you must have to move their furniture and things out right\nSo sometimes we have a pot onsite mhm other times we have a storage unit\nAnd then in this case because like I said the next generation is not taking over the home nor has the ability to keep you know so much furniture that's in the home we're on a boat to donate it to great causes\nIt will find a new life that other people can enjoy\nAtsushi also help you you help uh bring you know give it to donate to the non for profit\nYes big a big part of our been actually but how much I require we do that\nHow do you know what the people want to edit out do you have like conferences with them\nAs well that is always discuss through the walk through so like we said for the de clutter we have the initial walk through it's the same for the stage but I mean let me go and we go room by room and discuss it\nBut there must be a lot of psychological and emotional attachment to the furnishings Oh yes\nHow do you how do you personally how do you manage that um I mean I Know I can barely throw away the clothes in my closet five higher years\nRight so in a lot and a lot of cases the furniture is dated and not valuable\nIt's well worn so it's easier to move on mhm or it has you know some sentimental value but yet not functional so we're able to coach the client through in order to move out of the family\nWho is a process or you literally tagging the furniture like putting little colored dots on it so you know where things are going to go\nHow well my sister has the notes for each item and then when I'm when things are picked up yes everything has posted\nMhm mhm so and again how do we find you um how to our listeners find 'em one two three organized\nWell it's just that simple all they have to do is go go on to three or nice ... and they will see a everything that we have to offer for every situation that has to do with transition whether it's moving staging or just organizing their home\nAnd it's um it's really important for your listeners to know that both myself and my team are very dedicated to what we do\nWe are environmentally conscious we do a lot of recycling we have very little garbage\nAnd above and beyond everything else we worked from the heart a it's a very kind team and we love to be there to be able to support people when they're going through tough times\nFor the wonderful you know and I want to remind our listeners that you can call and if you have any questions that non one for\nSix three six zero one one zero nine one for six six zero one one zero in moral will be standing by if anyone has any questions I Want to let everybody know that\nUm that this week um we've had I'm\nA I'm a I have a a secret to bring you to say on moral I just want to bring out the secret to human case we get a caller this today secret to\nHis is about how if you could of furniture living room furniture home how you could use newspapers to lay on the floor and the locations where you'd be possibly putting the new furniture without buying\nThat you can call and if you have any questions that non one for six three six zero one one zero nine one for six six zero one one zero in moral will be standing by if anyone has any questions I Want to let everybody know that\nUm that this week\nUm we've had I'm\nA I'm a I have a a secret tip to bring you to say on moral I just want to bring out the secret to showcase we get a caller\nThis today secret tip\nIs is about how if you're gonna furnished your living room furniture home how you could\nUse newspapers to lay on the floor and the locations where you'd be possibly including the new furniture without buying it first to feel out the room if it works for you so I'm just using the New York times or or or the New Republic and Haiti newspapers\nJust learning the furniture out in the locations\nAs you can feel out if it's feels right in the room before you buy it this is a a secret trip that I've used with clients\n'em over and over again for them having a hard time visualizing\nHow to um how did the room it's gonna feel with the furniture\nAnd I want to also let everyone do the today show is being brought you buy sure when William pain my favorite painful and I'm sure when William I've been using surely him for years is that particular part of the many many products that particular product that I use\nThe emerald product an emerald\nThis this has a and the prime of to advance stain blocking technology it delivers first in his class and overall performance\nEmerald is just beautiful there's lots of colors its moons long lasting finish and features are truly remarkable high washed ability and application characteristics\nAnd today's show\nOn a moral you still there I Am is there any secrets if you'd like to bring to our listeners about how to de clutter or something about staging\nAbsolutely so it to your point I've also done that and um\nI've used the butcher paper you know that rolls out in big you know you can cut it as needed as well so I I agree with you a hundred percent about your secret chat but how how far can be to feel the division I shouldn't have what your room will look like\nI'm In terms of organizing and I think a great cat is like quick like\nSo for instance if anyone is going to embark on something as simple as organizing an office\nThen begin by putting all your books together in the room all your writing utensils together and they're him because what happens when you see the amount of stuff that you have you realize I don't need all of this\nAnd by putting all your books together in the room all your writing utensils together under him because what happens when you see the amount of stuff that you have you realize I don't eat out\nAfraid of retaliation we have a governor of New York\nWho's known with just two or three basic word you know bully [noise] uh\nArrogance wire I mean that's what New York politics has come to that's why I was hoping and actually we're getting we're going to get some calls to hear from people out there as to who they're supporting for governor I mean ... mile an hour oh look at the polls he has no chance arguably Rob asked Serino even Carl Paladino\nWere more aggressive better candidates at least they had some fire in the valley from the current candidate for governor for the Republican Party and a place of music retailer editorial but we do have Tom from connect to the online wants to talk about Andrew Carnegie running Tom what's your thinking\nOh my thinking is law now because I'm going to come right now is breaking state and federal law a report anytime Judy ... front page story on the Sunday tree we should go come was putting level to level treat sex offenders out a maximum security prisons ... group homes for mentally disabled\nAnd you cannot do that by state law you that's a penal code six point two five you cannot in danger or injure a mentally disabled person by\nA ton level suddenly so why does why doesn't tell many sue him why doesn't the Republican Party quickly bring a lawsuit or something like yourself get together and some others and bring an article Seventy eight proceeding [noise]\nThat's possible you have to get the money to do that for\nUs you know it doesn't cost all that much and if you're running a campaign for governor and I think mowing arrow has been critical and Republicans have been critical crumble and that\nYou take five or ten thousand dollars you get your lawyers and you go and do it I mean I if in fact he is violating the law you ought to be challenged we're the ... where are the Republicans from the state Senate or from the state assembly why don't they soup\nOr the highest looking party as a whole bunch of free time because they're afraid of the S C I see a a we had a nine one one bill to actually make the uh the handlers are these are\nDisabled persons to call nine one one right now in nine one one if you have a single person a group home that eating or where they do not call nine one one that called that Justice Center which is covers it up well so I just tell me why you're supporting a bow and arrow [noise]\nAh 'cause there's no way I can I'm gonna do it I'm just not going to vote and I'm just going to hold a button come on narrow I'm not going to come out actually sure\nI understand but what's your wife vote for a bow and arrow I mean you think he could win\nDollars you get your lawyers and you go and do it I mean I if in fact he is violating the law you ought to be challenged where the whole room where the Republicans from the state Senate or from the state assembly why don't they sue [noise]\nAh they hired looking party as a whole bunch of trying to close the Strait of the ... the senior CIA [noise] uh we had a nine one one bill to actually make the uh the handlers of these are\nDisabled persons to call nine one one right now when nine one one if you have a single person a group home that's feeding or they do not call nine one one that called that Justice Center which has coverage at all\nWell so why just tell me why you're supporting mowing arrow [noise]\nAh 'cause there's no way I can I'm going to vote I'm just not going to vote and I'm just going to hold a button come on narrow I'm not actually sure\nNo I understand but what's your wife vote for Mellon arrow I mean you think he could win\nNo\nWonder why vote for him right I'm just curious why not one of the three others who are running out they're very sharp some minor how are we talking\n... I couldn't do it for a protest vote I could um the fact is that the again we need a Republican Party until we get people getting up and get now and becoming delegates themselves hacks do it and what kind of the same old same old Everytime\nYou gonna vote for him on our on the Republican line or the conservative party line\nConservative line\nOkay well thanks for the call appreciate it I think um some Republicans I think my own our own self has made Tom's point about level two or three sex offenders being near schools\nBut we have something in New York it's a wonderful opportunity anyone can do it doesn't take all that much money I mean it takes a few thousand dollars going to find a lawyer but if you're a political party or if you're a politician it's easy to do it's called an article Seventy eight proceeding\nUnder civil practice law and rules that thing and it means you can go into a state Supreme Court with a petition and articles Seventy eight of the a body of law\nGives the citizen the right to challenge public officials if you believe that public officials are not carrying out their legal responsibility or acting illegally\nAnd as soon as a good case for this\nAh then it ought to be done by the way to their credit I mean they have it Cox in the state Republicans were in court yesterday on an article Seventy eight I Believe in it has to do with their a lawsuit which is a good one but they're not publicizing it well pretty typical\nOr all of them but they have a lawsuit against Jake hope\nThe joint commission on public ethics or J. joke 'cause people call it a that's supposed to be the watchdog for ethics and New York state government they should Jay cope over its refusal to acknowledge that us investigated a complaint about Joe ... cocoa\nA time when he has been found guilty of being involved in criminal conduct being in a state office in New York City when he was not a state official using state material\nAnd the or a Republican Party correctly is alleged that this could have been a violation of state a state ethics laws and others maybe have been involved in the J cope investigating Jacob supposed civic knowledge looking into a complaint and the complaint was made\nIn the proper time in the proper way and Jake up his refusing to acknowledge it so the Republicans say Republicans trying to get a judge to direct they do this or that they

in ... in some ways still is today but it's a celebration by a ... member of the left\nAt one time when you go through as a member of the Communist Party and California are celebrating industrial

strikers I'll put it on the line before we go to the music wants to talk about the governor's race could warning time go right ahead\nWell go warning pregnant I got to tell you it's a very it's a privilege to talk to you well thank you very much good to have you [noise] I listen to you all the time I got to tell you people used to call me crazy because\nI was a conspiracy and this is proof to me that the new world water has now affect the local government races or from state on down and\nI'm kind of a write my own name on that as governor of New York because it bothers impact has been voting for any of the other politicians\nAnd it just shows you know why no matter who's in charge\nWe have things begin to show items that nobody can stop\nAnd it just goes to show you that that decisions are made at higher levels meaning national or global and all down the line and everybody gets their little piece of pie but that's all they can and it doesn't change very much\nWho do you think it is we're making these who is it who's making these decisions at the stage or national or global level\nWell Fred I Would tell you this I don't know who it is but I Would assume that drug cartels are involved [noise] I Would have shown the oil business is involved and I went through I Would assume that health care and food involved because if you put those three years shoot off the plate\nMost people wouldn't have a whole lot to talk about in the political world\nI appreciate the call let me say this I heard from others over the years when I say there's an all sincerity I understand why I think I Do a while you think the way you do if there was any kind of a conspiracy like that if there was a state wide or national\nOur global and all down the line everybody gets a little piece of pie but that's all they can and it doesn't change very much\nWho do you think it is who are making these who is it there was making these decisions at the stage or national or global level\nWell Fred I Would tell you this I don't know who it is but I Would assume that drug cartels are involved [noise] I Would have shown the oil business involved and I went through I Would assume that health care but the truth and Bob 'cause if you took those three are to go off the plate [noise]\nMost people wouldn't have a whole lot to talk about in the political world\nTom I appreciate the call and let me say this I heard from others over the years when I say there is an awesome Saturday I understand why I think I'd do or why you think the way you do\nIf there was any kind of a conspiracy like that if there was a state wide or national group of people are international group of people doing who could you kind of pull the strings it could not remains secret\nIt would get out no such groups group or groups exist in my view it's easy or because of how frustrating the reality is out there to think that might be the case\nBut it's not and the claim of conspiracies like that have been used historically by demagogues to justify\nA ugly things that have taken place\nAnd uh I think it's in a way in a more complicated but it's the same time more simple to realize that it's often chaotic out there that it's not a group of people planning anything it's just the absence of intelligence and the absence of\nEasy solutions that produce the kind of ugliness that we see a say in our political system in New York today but by the way New York isn't the only example\nOf a terrible or politics but it also is contradicted by the fact that in many states new Americans the United states states\nThere are high tone politics going on as we speak\nThe expectation and reality of debates aggressive journalist who actually cover politicians who answered questions New Yorkers in many ways more an anomaly that an example of what's going on across the country but it is the case in many\nAnd every person that called up and saying out of frustration is going to write that his own name

whoever you think is going to get the largest number of votes outside of New York city [noise]\nAh I like we're stepping wonder says like libertarian but on the other hand you're listening to strategically up to play with the Republican Party even though I may not like you're not here\nAnd every person that called up and saying that frustration is going to write that his own name or write

want to I Want to hear a little bit about\nYou know the other day\nYou know you said\nEnough is enough so we'll get on the bus or we're going\nTo have you talked about that moment and what happened like well what was it could lead to that moment\nMan made it comes to you before I left me they're not doing\nOut I didn't call anything short arm our mission or not because\nAnd I know that no\nBe in

that situation it's like a like a hydra of obstruction cut off one head you fix one problem in more gross and he says why Shea we're in the realm of unknown unknowns of obstruction because\nThat toilet paper\nWould be the fight this week well\nMs Mars knew it eight weeks ago when she ran out\nAnd we've been trying to quietly find a way to solve this problem\nThe control is simply derelict of her duty not appreciating that people have to do that just about every day so commission a gas and what do you say about the situation and you know how do you explain this to parents who are just seniors at you know\nYou're not just hiding behind your desk you're actually trying to get\nPositive results can you talk to every one about [noise] you know the the challenges you face as\nCommissioner trying to administer programs out and trying to deliver services without\nBasics like toilet paper\nFor me let me just start off by saying that it is an embarrassment\nIt is an emphatic men to me it's saddens me that we have come to this point\nUm as I always say I\nSister I'm sensitive demographic that being\nPeople from five to a hundred and five things feel actor I happen to be my passion right for that reason then\nIs my favorite was clean because I Do know that we have in fact I had to find all kind of way to go around the system to accomplish things we won't have the toilet tissue problem\nAgain because the commission I and I have found a way to not have this issue right so that's one problem foul but that does not speak to the back of the problems that are thought that needs to be a show let\nMe let me pause you've read different ones that were those that are listen you heard the commission or say\nYou know ... they found a way to work around this which is good but just think about that\nThey had to innovate away to work around obstruction that's what we've been doing them and find a way to do without\nBut which is very hard to do anything without\nSo the point is [noise]\nActor I happen to be my passion right for that reason then is my very clean because I Do know that we have in fact I had to find all kinds of ways to go around the system to accomplish things we won't have the toilet tissue problem\nAgain because the commissioner and I have found a way to not have this issue right so that's one problem foul but that does not speak to the rest of the problems that are thought that needs to be a show let\nMe let me pause you've read different which were those that are listening you heard the commissioner say\nYou know she's they found a way to work around this which is good but just think about that\nThey had to innovate our way to work around obstruction that's what we've been doing them and find a way to do without\nBut which is very hard to do anything without\nSo the point is [noise]\nWhat else can we do\nHow can we do more with less when we really don't have\nEven toilet paper like people expect us to fix the sewers in the streets which are just busted in broken\nThe bodies in the planning department we don't have the budget that we've we've asked for for a couple of years and it's not a budget saying we want to spend money and just wasted we want to\nPut it the basics now I just want to ask\nYou know if all goes out there watching and listening and\nA drive in movies this summer\nDeputy commissioner got\nHow much per movie just as a ballpark oh about two Seventy five and I'm In a moment about three hundred dollars that we use and then you have popcorn and then you had other things and\nThat was a great community events and what did you get reimbursed for any of those yet\nNot yet and actually we still owe them money\nBecause because then a memo was put out dating that we could not put anything on a credit card anymore so when we couldn't put anything on a credit card any more than that and prevent that both myself and the commissioner from continuing to support and supplement that program because while I carried this summer movies\nAnd the other activities touching that he carried this summer camp and there were twelve thousand dollars on his\nCredit card shared again 'cause I don't know if people heard about\nTwelve thousand all well well I was now did you get reimbursed for all the way\nI'm not all the way he had gotten a majority but not all of a and again that is my thing is is not something that we're just throwing allegations around all of this is verifiable information just this weekend alone you have the ... coming right and the pumpkin planes is one of the things that people look\nBut yeah the ... next week the pumpkin climbing this week\nSo that in and of itself it's happening you know why because I paid for it on my credit card then we have a bond says that the mayor put me in connection with from the Bronx will feel club and they're going to pay for the pumpkin so while it's already on my car they're going to reimburse me\nThis is an example of how we have to go around and beat the system just to make it a place where people are proud to live a place that allow children to clean the memories and realize that they are around you and we feed them\nRight it is absolutely the horrible and reprehensible and whether you live at Mount Vernon and are not I hope that you're listening so that in your own community you make sure this doesn't happen\nThat's right and this is where you know we're gonna keep demand and change and for those out there asking why ... why is always by which the in fighting about it's about power\nAbout money about respect\nAnd in right now you know I'm playing for the respect the seniors\nAnd I'm fighting for the money that his company is right so we do and find the money that the commissioners are showing out only shouldn't I mean this was Mount Vernon towards ... Democrats which is called what it is but it feels like we're in Atlanta neo Nazi conservatives that don't want anybody to have anything including toilet paper\nPlace that allow children to clean memories and realize that they are around you and we feed them right it is absolutely the horrible and reprehensible and whether you live in my running or not I hope that you are listening so that in your own community you make sure this doesn't\nHappen that's right and this is where you know we're gonna keep demand and change and for those out there asking why why is the mayor of fire why is always by which the infighting about about our\nAbout money it's about respect and in right now you know I'm waiting for the respect the seniors\nAnd I'm fighting for the money that says companies use right so we do and find the money that the commissioners are shelling out shouldn't I mean this was Mount Vernon towards ... Democrats which is called what it is but it feels like we're in Atlanta neo Nazi conservatives that don't want anybody to have anything including toilet paper\nI mean that's what his boiled down to it just doesn't make any sense and I'm just curious as to what were the seniors saying to the controller when she was behind the plate glass holding the money back there hostage with her\nHave to say anything she was just running out really well they may or we're going to say and it's not a mayor we\nLet's see here it's always about the seniors it's about the children's about our future don't change our values from the mount Vernon moving forward\nMesh here is the latest updates from Fox News radio\nNews I enjoy the thousands of migrants from Central America are on a bridge separating Mexico with Guatemala trying to cross into Mexico but President Trump says he wants their journey and there and says Democrats in Congress should work to strengthen immigration laws\nWe are about law and order and borders and jobs\nAnd they are about allowing crime to enter park country with open borders\nThe migrant say they're trying to escape human rights abuses corruption in Central America Mexico also asking the un to help the migrants apply for asylum and make a million drawing it's tonight jackpot is one billion dollars and if anyone game\nYou never know you know we have a field the mega millions ones that it was Seventy and then you pick your mega number from one to a twenty five so\nAnybody can win that you learned they go with the New York lottery this the Fox news\n\nThis is ...
