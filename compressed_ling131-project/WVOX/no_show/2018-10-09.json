then at the FDA an investigation could've been done privately laws and let's remember that Dr Ford testified under oath and penalty a felony\nThat she had no knowledge of the offer for the staff to come to an interview hiring California only did she make that claim she believed into a lawyer and leaned into her and then she found it a second time\nSo either the Democrats and or how lawyer kept that information from or she didn't watch the news or read any newspapers because that also was made at least a dozen times by sound the grass\nIt's up to the Democrats it would've been they wanted to and investigate and even though it didn't pass the smell test okay\nAs far as anonymity go being the reason that came late that's a ... story because they had six weeks before if they would have given it to the FBI then at the FDA an investigation could've been done privately and let's remember that Dr Ford testified under oath and penalty of felony\nThat she had no knowledge of the offer for the staff to come to her and interview hiring California only did she make that claim\nShe leave into a lawyer and leaned into her and then she reaffirmed it a second time so either the Democrats end or how lawyer kept that information from her or she didn't watch the news or read any newspapers because that offer was made at least a dozen times\nBy Senator Grassley publicly\nUh your your logic is a is impeccable that's far you had a third item\nYeah this is why I called the limousine yes or something I have first hand knowledge I Know\nOkay ... thanks stretches\nAre not made from the factory it comes out as a regular vehicle whether it be a Lincoln town car in this case it was a Ford Excursion and a big van\nAnd he's someone that's gonna you know take this step to provide protection too you know the city of Mount Vernon and when you look at the the charge of the inspector general is to investigate a ... show of corruption prevented detected provide ethics training as well as assist\nUm in in reviewing disability claims that we have for the city\nAnd there are so many other aspects of the role that's going to help people that have concerns and complaints\nEspecially we are vendors are vendors have been held hostage by non payment for very long time and you know we need a third party to kind of just you know reaffirmed that the process has been followed and and just the way out a very clear public report that lays out the the facts as they happen\nAnd what kinds of in other words that they have a mission to look at anything or is he going to be a large which is to say will he be looking into why checks don't reach your desk or do will he be looking into for example the dispute over a cupcake cutie you know this stuff what will be his history\nHe he he is at large and he will determine the types of claims that he will be looking to but you remember the reports to all three branches the controller accounts president and the mayor so he's going to be working at a variety of things and\nYou know what we we believe that we're going to continue to move city in the right direction and this is a step in that\nAnd you know we need a third party to kind of just you know reaffirmed that the process has been followed and and just the way out a very clear public report that lays out the the facts as they happen\nAnd what kinds of in other words the the habits mission to look at anything he going to be a large which is to say will he be looking into why checks to reach your desk or do will he be looking into for example the dispute over ... ... what will be his he he\nHe he he is at large and he will ultimately determine the types of of claims that he will be looking to but you remember that he reports to all three branches of the comptroller of the council president and the mayor so he's going to be looking at a variety of things and\nYou know look we we believe that we're going to continue to move the city in the right direction and this is a step in that direction because\nI get complaints from seniors that claim that they've been\nTaken out of their homes by unscrupulous people\nWe get concerns about um you know other types of wrongdoing and we just want to make sure that there is someone there that's available to start looking at these things because again a budget as a moral document and to have the city Council on fund the role going as far back as two thousand and eight\nGoes uh you know just demonstrate that this role was never really a priority of Mount Vernon and I've done my best to recruit people to do this role even though it it really doesn't pay but it's important that we have someone in place to to try and help the residents of Mount Vernon get a better\nGrownup forty one man one of the ... it's almost humorous to me but that's how my brain works if this person reports to you and the controller in the city council who will be fighting for the same hammer to be one another over the head with\nWell ... that's one of the things this this job is not necessarily to play gotcha this job is to just lay out the situation as clearly as possible and provide public reports\nAnd when you step back and look at you know the finger pointing to Mount Vernon it helps to have a third party to this is what happened while we do go to the court every now and again\nI'm it's not my preference to go to court but look up a bill is generated a bill ought to be paid and right now I Know the the bills are over one point three million that's do you have employees that still have not been paid we have\nEmployees whose health benefits have not been process I mean there's so many\nIssues that other communities don't you know they take for granted\nBut it's happening in Mount Vernon and this is you know form of obstruction to distract me from doing my job which is moving forward\nAs Mr nap looking at the also for example looking at the allegations against the border department\nOr he's going to be looking at anything and everything and I know that he's making his rouse talked to all the commissioners and talk to on the couch and numbers and talk to the controller but the point is this you know this is where he has to just continue to demonstrate that he's going to do his job and that's what we expect him to do\nWhat did he start he he already started um I Know that he'll be making the rounds again this week and I'm having spoken with council president last week I look forward to him having more dialogue with with the rest of the the the government\nOh that's going to be interesting I Hope you can find those checks they and what's going on in Mount Vernon there what would you like to shout out by\nYou know I'm I'm just a a bit puzzled by the the recent position and by the county and it just seems that\nThere are sincerity of a moral field is is very short sighted I I don't understand how they can slip into a a clause that says they want to take back moneys from Mount Vernon within six months of a certain process certain step in the in the process and I just\nMoney is it that they want we saw that in the paper the other day what what money do they\nWe expect him to do what did he start\nHe he already started um I Know that he'll be making the rounds again this week and I'm having spoken with Catholic president last week I look forward to him having more dialogue with with the rest of the the the government\nWow that is going to be interesting I Hope you can find those check seven for if they exist what's going on in Mount Vernon mayor what would you like to shout out by\nYou know I'm I'm just a bit puzzled by the the recent position and by the county and then it just seems that there are sincerity over moral field is is very short sighted I I don't understand how\nThey can slip into a a clause that says they want to take back money from Mount Vernon within six months of a certain process certain step in the in the process and I just\nWant money is it that they well we saw that in the paper the other day what what money do they want back\nWell obviously they want money back from Alberta taxpayers a oh about ... what\nWhat was the money who was it the money that was misspent in the early years of the agreement with the county on memorial field\nIn in that could possibly be show um it's it's not clear which is why you know I continue to say look guys the first time everybody try you know back me into a corner of memorial field you know we came out victorious innately track the D.C clean up is is happening and will continue to happen\nAnd and you know all we have to do is just talk this through now it's\nYou know his you fit over you know you you want to pick out one sentence in in a an entire six page document this one sentence is like an adjustable rate mortgage so I just don't understand why we can't have a more reasonable timeframe in a more reasonable approach to make sure that the taxpayers Mount Vernon don't get flashed in\nHow much money is involved\nWell according to the county executive of he's he's floating three point four million and and I'm just saying gee [laughter] whoa ... can we just again if you want to look at the numbers have been given a bunch of numbers\nUm be from the controller as well as I put it on line going as far back as two thousand sixteen at sea envy and why dot coms washing memorial feel\nMad Men as hold it there right there we're going to go to a break and we'll come back with you OK you gotta thank you very much mayor Richard Thomas we're discussing one sentence in the

need to be held accountable because they think some of their behavior particularly under this president is deplorable\nUh-huh did you hear about Rosen\nHigh he says his job is safe\nYeah yeah well I I kind of gets that Trump asked him if he was going to allow any information to come out ... allow Mueller to put out information before the election I think that's probably what state this job\nYou know unfair especially when it all comes out it's all going to come out sooner or later you know one of the paradoxes and I've got to get your reaction to this [noise]\nThe uh unemployment is the best in spending forty fifty Seventy years maybe even three and a half percent the economy's doing well or what the ... ... what the what the president did in a in in [noise]\nOh good grief Koreans obviously working so he's done some good things but like I said you know almost ... he made the trains run on time aren't God he's family was well provided ...\nWhat's it called ... what the what the president did in a in in [noise] oh good grief Korea is obviously working so he's done some good things but like I said you know Muslim meeting made the trains run on sidelined God he's family was well provided for or you're saying\nFrom the three point four that we sent should be sitting in a separate bank account now if it was co mingled with city funds is if it was allocated for other non memorial feel purposes and that's a bit spent that money\nI'm not looking to stick to sit in Mount Vernon but I Want to Mount Vernon to come up with what's that magic number is because that is what they're going to have to contribute\nTo the fixing the memorial field because we put it out for that sold ... not for any other purpose\nNow now that I'm not looking to hang up I'm not looking to call it back for the county [noise] that's the kind of rhetoric you\nGet that that was those were my words and that's what I what I was about to interrupt you I I may have been permitted as a [laughter] because I'm hearing you say is that if they show received a phase room for discussion here\nWell yeah I mean they have to show that they spent you know money toward the project not towards something else now it's no different than you you give me twenty bucks\nTo go out and buy you a sandwich at the grocery at the right to work together hit Georgia's twenty bucks go up I'm going to be coming back when I got no sandwich and I don't have your twenty bucks\nEven when you're going to ask me George what gives with a with my sandwich\nAnd be with my twenty bucks that if you can show me well George or you know what what is so sad which\nI got your bag of chips [laughter] dollars that change then you're explaining it to me now what what I'm telling you is a well I don't have a sandwich for you I don't have your change but don't ask me for the twenty dollars back because I Can't afford to pay you back what'd you do to twenty dollars\nIt's that simple so well not in a fight with anybody we're just trying to\nAccurately account somebody because here's the deal the money that the county gave to the city\nComes from the tax payers of Westchester County they come from the tax payers with Michele taxpayers to Scarsdale tax payers of skill and tell them and they have every right to ask me as the county executive\nHow was the money spent of course and I say we voted to Mount Vernon\nTo do a memorial quilt project for which we have an existing I'm at and it's the money has been spent on that purpose and there was an obligation now it's time frame of paying back the obligations I can get back to the county is putting it in a fun [noise] do the project a memorial field and that's where we want to see\nBut as you know and I know you've been a businessman you had a small business ... corporate America if you and I and two parties have an agreement you can't admit that agreement by yourself\nYou can't just write something on a sheet of paper inside and say okay I've met that the agreement requires old signatory to do that amendment and you don't just do it on the trail\nMoney that the county gave to the city comes from the tax payers of Westchester County they come from the taxpayers of Michelle acts crazy Scarsdale taxpayers a skill and tell them and they have every right to ask me as the county executive\nHow was the money spent of course and I say we voted to Mount Vernon\nTo do a memorial project for which we have an existing I met and it's the money has been spent on that purpose and there was an obligation now it's time frame of paying back the obligations I can get back to the county is putting it in a fun project a memorial field and that's what we want to state\nBut as you know and I know you've been a businessman you out a small business for corporate America if you and I and two parties have an agreement you can't admit that agreement by yourself\nYou can't just write something on a sheet of paper inside and say okay I've met that the agreement requires old signature ... to do that amendment and you don't just do it all the trailer lead to a press conference to sit at a press release so\nI'm not fight with anybody I just want to fix memorial feel bad as my soul interest in mission here have an emotional commitment to do it and I think we have a legal obligation to since we started the IRA\nAnd I think the cat is positions clean and it's clear if you spent the money they spent the money you could be anybody else who served before you I don't care but it's the money's been misspent you need to account for it and if you account for the public\nIf you show release forensic study is where the money went and here's why when and I have an obligation to repay that's all I care about but I'm not going to be told well this is a tax increase for the people the city of Mount Vernon no this is ms allocation of money by the by the people who run the city at Mount Vernon and misspent much that's what it was\nYou know county executive where Mount Vernon I'm making sense is not good radio which I'm just kidding oh I I don't know the answer the glory thank you [laughter] a pleasant would weaken once a week boredom [laughter] All right\nWest Chester paid sick days law passes but some people are concerned about overregulation and we had one of her David to be although uh say gee maybe we should have raised a number but it got pretty broad support to stick to it\n[noise] well let's say the past with Trump votes which means a flat out veto I'm a would be over written a show or it hasn't come to my desk officially assigning you know I don't think David is wrong by the way but this is why you have a legislature\nThe legislature debates these issues and I was so let's wait at the thirty years' and participated in this kind of debate and keep in mind one thing one of the law signed into two to affect it can always be amended\nSo the argument that I Would make that if we do signed the law and it does become and force then there's an opportunity to do is to see what the impacts are and come back and revisit and potentially make a change in and what level of business that it applies to\nA but again you know I don't try to put a I don't try to put myself on the scale you know you don't you don't see me doing what some you know people above me which\nIs trying to how to use the executive position as these super

I've never changed I was the manager when it was imposed was first proposed the prior to me but when it was imposed I was the manager and I was consistent from the beginning saying it's a direct result of the property tax happen if\nProperty tax caps continue or you will see more communities doing it you will see more fees being put in place because people are not going to lay off police and fire so for instance\nLet me tell you that the amount a sneak preview of the city's budget for two thousand and Nineteen the amount that the tax to cap can go up the revenues that will be generated is wiped out in half of it is wiped out by simply increase health insurance costs that are imposed by the state of New York\nIt's a structural imbalance you can never catch up when you're revenues are never going to be as much as your expenditures mhm that's just a fact of life and people say cut your expenditures well the problem is the expenditures are all people\nAnd they're all police fire and public works letting them the guts of what ... at least local say look the wealthy and they don't want any cuts to police that don't want any cuts the fire and at the end of the day the missile tax burden is about Eighteen percent of the tax bill a un I defy anybody\nTo do a fair analysis of municipal taxes services that are provided for the municipal taxes and tell me that their overcharged for

all the additional information that's coming out I mean leaving the country is divided is ever like the Vietnam War in some ways it's worse and I noticed um and I know a lot of other people noticed something because it points to a glaring omission\nIn our I'm\nElections here in New York then I think are going to cost the Republicans dearly and I saw I\nPleaded came right out out after the vote or late Saturday from John fast of a Congress than running for reelection in the nineteenth congressional district it's got a tough race he's a very impressive guy in my view is been a regular frequent guest on the show we hope to have more later and a week but he tweeted out on his um\nI guess it's sort of on the official a congressional a Twitter feed it may not be such a thing you just touched his name and listen himself as a candidate so it's not an official sister's personal put her feet he says can congrats\nJustice Kavanaugh explanation mark Senate was right to confirm it and given the lack of corroborating proof and the FBI investigation Republicans in New York Nineteen must vote in November ... character assassination and subversion of due process employed by the Democratic leaders will become the norm\nI think they're saying well let's take a stand up Republican and Republicans supported Kavanaugh with some rare exceptions a few Democrats did I note that dumped hiking is the only Democrat in New York the assemblyman from Brooklyn waiting but here is um John fast sellouts articulate guy a lawyer\nSaying congrats to judge this cabinet and then\nI saw people commenting and looking around for the comment from the leader\nOf the you know the\nTop of the ticket Republican in New York state\nMark bow and arrow\nRunning for governor and he's the guy

or you know his his testimony is very important and should be considered and I'm Christian for the accuser your initial accused are a very powerful and what she said her statements should be way and that's it now all across this country\nThat's where I talk about here before the conservative party is running ads for saying are basically saying look we support the conservative party supports

this country\nRepublicans have been galvanized I don't think there's any question about it galvanized over there and the effort to get Brett Kavanaugh is confirmed as a Supreme Court judge in of course Democrats have been galvanized to\nProbably unequal degree of passion to them maybe I should say a higher degree of passion at least in terms of the ugly activities they can gauge including harassing people ... people um many getting are disrupting public meetings I mean just a lot of ugly stuff from my point of view\nBut this is like as a finding moment for the Republican Party in New York certainly a defendant defining moment for the Republican Party in the nation\nAnd where are the New York Republican\n[laughter] and servers are a good question though but I I mean we're we're hearing from people a lot of people some people have written about it all ready and I'm seeing it in response was people writing to me and other comments that I see around is that many many Republicans are being estranged from being turned off by mark\nWho won't take the stand on something like Brett Kavanaugh's\nConfirmation I mean doesn't think it doesn't they think they've capitalized fit for the U.S Supreme Court I mean it's not I mean people will ask candidates for the assembly that question the last candidate for the state Senate that question\nI mean I'm even if he says well you know it's not my job I don't want to weigh in okay I mean I guess you could say that that's kind of what you said but if you're running for governor not taking a stand\nI haven't even seen in maybe I missed it but I think not I haven't even seen a Cox the state Republican chairman weigh in on this or maybe it doesn't want to weigh in for fear of embarrassing mark mowing narrow because the question then we'll be the mall an arrow where do you stand Cuomo's white and governor Andrew Cuomo with um\nJust to you I mean he's become is people in Britain me he's become Kirsten Gillibrand mini me\nI mean Sheila brands out there with her a hysterical rhetoric and then Cuomo follows up\nOr Schumer is out there Chuck Schumer was his rhetoric and Cuomo follows up it's like me too me too I'm In there and don't forget me\nBut to have more mowing arrow who wants to become the the fact of head of the Republican Party and then if you are the governor of the state any governor in New York is the de facto head if his party his or her party we have a woman governor\nSo the guy wants to be the the fact of the Republican Party in New York won't say where he stands\nOn one of the most important events arguably of a decade or a few I mean there implications of Brett Kavanaugh's confirmation to the Supreme Court is the fact that he's now a Supreme Court justice has implications for years and years to come on many fronts\nDon't forget me but to have more mowing arrow who wants to become the de facto head of the Republican Party and then if you are the governor of the state any governor in New York is the de facto head of his party his or her party we have a woman governor\nSo the guy wants to be the fact of the Republican Party in New York won't say where he stands\nOn one of the most important events arguably of a decade or a few I mean there implications of Brett Kavanaugh's confirmation to the Supreme Court the fact that he is now a Supreme Court justice has implications for years and years to come on many fronts\nTo lead a crew of journalists to try to investigate this with everything else that's going on what would you speak to do\nSure um I a boy I've been to many accidents scenes in my career as a reporter police reporter in Florida [noise] um\nRight now in New York one of the things you have is a database the sting do tea maintains a database of all accidents so obviously the intersection has a history yeah and it should be possible to somebody who knows what they're doing\nAnd therein lies the problem not too many reporters from the earlier with now advocating these Web sites you really have to dig to get this year to get people the DOT to kind of help you interpret the data download it but it's possible to do a pretty serious and critical analysis of\nUh the accident of history at this and similar interests and it was a limo and bus accidents\nOr and so forth I mean beyond just the obvious work of reporters tracking down witnesses or maintaining an open mind to the NTSB investigators those people will lead to a pretty much all the time as they learn things\nUm and it shouldn't take more than a few days to get some better sense of what went wrong here we also need the autopsy results and are you need to call the enemy a medical examiner in the counter or\nWell I Would think journalists from all around the world that especially in New York will be all over this this is a case I'm wearing if they are local newspapers uh had enough staff which you know they don't budget used to be that the Albany Times Union in particular\nHad journalist I used to be one of them who actually covered state agencies in New people that say they had contacts at with them\nAnd maybe to the Capitol bureau through the director of state operations can also get a line into what's going on there and find out some inside stuff but I don't think journal and the papers today have that kind of resource we know TV dozens is that your sense as well\nUh absolutely that's my sense I I remember a few years ago at the time\nOld soon to you need to call the enemy a medical examiner in the counter\nOr well I Would think journalists from all around the world that especially in New York will be all over this this is a case I'm wearing if they are local newspapers uh had enough staff which you know they don't budget used to be that the Albany Times Union in particular\nHad journalist I used to be one of them who actually covered state agencies in New people that say they athletes had contact with them\nAnd maybe some of the Capitol bureau through the director of state operations can also get a line into what's going on there and find out some inside stuff but I don't think generally the papers today have that kind of resource we know TV doesn't is that your sense as well\nAs absolutely that's my sense I I remember a few years ago as to the times union we did an analysis of fatalities pedestrian fatalities on a\nA in central avenue in calling me and a reporter who did that who really needed a lot of help I had to team up an intern with them to help with the computer work Tim O'Brien the former head of the union he's gone they're\nAll gone the people I work with are almost all gone and uh today's reporter is juggling a lot of balls at the same time and jumping from one story to another\nBut uh for the times union I'm guessing this was an all hands on deck kind of situation ah I'm sure they'll do their best but ah my heart goes out to\nThem and the families of victims of this crash\nNow it's a ... reverberate for generations to come something like this is just a really up there and uh the worst kind of catastrophe but let's shift gears a bit Bob ... and have you talk because I'm excited to hear about it I'm interested to hear about it we know about so many people leaving New York\n... says just because of the weather is somehow I don't think that in your case and in your wife's case no but if you would have people in the capital district to a hearing you right now do you remember you from the times union I'm sure are interested in hearing why did you and your wife make the decision to leave New York and moved to Michigan which I think a lot of New Yorkers would associate\nWith equally a coach chilly weather and equally troubling or challenging economic climate how come you left\n[noise] um we had been planning this for a long time um and we really were frustrated with the business climate in Albany for small business my wife is you know one's beauty salon and day spas\nOr she is Chinese and a very good English speaker these days\nSo she looks all around the country and she's not a shot at all about moving to Louisiana to North Carolina to Michigan She looks for places that are in somewhat of an economic boom that are on an\nUpswing of the graph of economic activity a because that's where you often can make the most money or have the least uh impediment [noise]\nUm so a couple of years ago we set up we traveled to Detroit and the Detroit area and looked around Michigan uh and it's really booming at least is not the city of Detroit for sure but the suburbs\nAnd so we uh we negotiate rental leases and set up things Michigan also has a very good schools of massage therapy in Ann Arbor\nWhich are a Chinese that's rare you do find that in New York um and so there was a source of waiver and talent so forth um ate our rent\nUpswing of the graph of economic activity a because that's where you often can make the most money or have the least uh impediment [noise]\nUm so a couple of years ago we set up we traveled to Detroit and the Detroit area and looked around Michigan uh and it's really booming at least is not the city of Detroit for sure but the suburbs\nAnd so we uh we negotiate rental leases and set up things Michigan also has a very good schools have massage therapy in Ann Arbor\nWhich are a Chinese that's rare you can find that in New York um and so there was a source of labor and talent so forth um a A R rent in we were living in flushing queens New York\nAnd I rent went up two hundred bucks a month and that was just too much Nineteen hundred dollars a month for a one bedroom apartment\nUh all the conveniences of the city but uh it's just too much money the cost of living here in Michigan is easily one half what it is it's in much of New York and for people living in upstate New York you would find the Lansing area\nPretty similar the state capital it has just as many potholes says Albany does um it has a almost a dysfunctional government although it's not so much\nUm we have a Republican controlled legislature both houses Republican governor [noise]\nUh so it's an interesting set of politics the auto bailout of uh several years ago really made a difference from Michigan and you could just see it and feel it driving around the automobile automobile parts industry and support industries for transportation or just all over the place\nUm there's actually a Ford plant south of Lansing and they still actually make cars here and you say so\nUh it's okay we like it or you as you know I Am struggling with a a battle against cancer a and I need the Veterans Administration\nTo help me with that and there are a\nA there's an excellent VA hospital in Ann Arbor Michigan not very far from me\nIf I'm curious you know New York as you well know I'm ... and if you want to say anything more about your VA treatments and feel free I didn't mean to interrupt something like that but we're going to say something else\n[noise] ah well sure I could say it's a struggle that really is a physical struggle\nA every day I'm\nI've been through chemo which was pretty devastating and that costs so much damage to my body and it couldn't continue\nBut I Am blessed by the invention several years ago a which recently won a Nobel Prize for a whole family of drugs called immunotherapy\nAnd are these drugs often end with the ... and they be\nNine volume mad and it's magical and in my case it's been very effective or uh my my cancer is actually shrinking\nAh and I have a chance to live that can still spread to parts of the body like the brain where\nThis drug is no help but ah it's keeping the live it's it has its side effects and they can be pretty physically devastating and mentally devastating you just feel really lousy all the time\nBut I Am blessed by the inventions several years ago a which recently won a Nobel Prize for a whole family of drugs called immunotherapy and are these drugs often end with the ... and they be\nNine volume mad and it's magical and in my case it's been very effective or ah my my cancer is actually shrinking\nAh and I have a chance to live it can still spread to parts of the body like the brain where\nThe strongest no help but ah it's keeping them alive it's it has its side effects and they can be pretty physically devastating and mentally devastating you just feel really lousy all the time which are alive and so here I Am\nWell and we're very happy about that of course aren't that as you something additionally about Michigan if I could you have any sense of the impact of Michigan's a legal decisions have become a right to work state\nI was happening I think it's twenty twelve but that means that the unions can really imposed themselves on workers who don't want to join union you have a choice\nAnd of course in the right to work states the unions political clout which is so enormous and a place like New York is reduced you have a have you ever heard of people talk about that at all its impact you see it at all I was just curious that I I\nI Can't claim to be that much of an expert yet on Michigan politics on it definitely is having an impact\nAnd uh it it it can only be good in my opinion the long run I'm Michigan is a lot like New York in certain ways dominated by big city Detroit at one end of the state which is itself mostly rural\nA and beautiful I must say ... lakes countryside living in the central Michigan want like living in upstate New York\nUm I ... the political campaigns are foot right now are pretty a pretty low volume affairs so far as I can tell I don't see many lawn signs I don't see a great deal of excitement I watch local TV news\nAnd uh it's pretty low grade coverage I'm a big one big story in the Detroit Free press today is observing the Columbus ohio not very far away\nWhere it is it for ... or have any money and maybe I could have an impact maybe not measure that don't even care anymore for me I worked for the reactions are many things court always done it a ... year old out much for me not a majority of New Yorkers also just quickly fragments from us\nWell there it is if a ... mile an hour I had any money and maybe I could have an impact maybe not maybe you should do this don't even care anymore\nFrom the looks at the reaction do many things Cuomo was done it doesn't look like they don't care all that much certainly not

everything is in good slate and on for the next ... to come in but it's a great day in the United states and I'm proud to have been part of the team now I don't have anything that on where I'm going to go I think that um the main thing was\nI was governor for six years and we dealt with a hurricane a thousand your blood or church shooting a school shooting there was a lot\nAnd then to come in and just a few years of Russia and Iran and North Korea it's been eight years of intense time and I'm a believer in term limits I think you have to be dealt with enough to know when you step aside and allow someone else to do the job so\nShe missed in front of\nAnd I will say that I'm for all of you that are going to ask about twenty twenty no I'm not running for joining twenty\nCan promise you

twenty twenty no I'm not running for twenty twenty\nI can finally issue what are we doing is campaigning for this one so I'll look forward to supporting the president\nActually cook good like\nUniverse is a long\nList of comprehend why would\nYou want to leave the all behind this is a really personal decision on because you get away from your family members or you know something else

administration ambassador Haley sitting in the oval office with the president to make that knew she says she has no personal reason\nBut it's just it's very important that government officials know when it's time to step aside she says that she informed the president about six months ago that she may be reaching this decision as she comes up on two years the United nations ambassador again\nUN ambassador Nikki Haley saying the ... with President Trump that she will in her tenure at the United nations at the end of the year I'm Jared helper and on Capitol Hill this is Fox News radio Fox\nNews radio is John decker with us at the White House as well and John I was anybody uh not caught off guard by this announcement\nNo er here at the White House people were caught off guard or not only the reporters but people who work in a boat the lower end up or press offices people at the United nations when I say people I mean the diplomats they're caught off guard\nBy the surprise announcement that Nikki Haley has tendered her resignation accepted by the president the president tweeted just ahead of this meeting that there would be a big announcement with my friend ambassador Nikki Haley in the oval office at ten thirty AM\nThis Jared is a big announcement I suppose notable that Nikki Haley made clear she has no ambitions for twenty twenty I assume that's a thought that crossed at least a few months this announcement\nWell you wouldn't make such a declaration or unless that was the case and you certainly wouldn't challenge a sitting president a sitting next to that sitting president ... uh but I look Nikki Haley is is young she certainly now that she has those\nForeign policy credentials furnished or she will be mentioned are in the next uh ten years as a national figure for the Republican Party or having already served two terms as the governor of South Carolina also two years the United nations certainly she has British trick credentials to run for higher office\nIt's important to note to join the closeness that the president and the ambassador have with one another considering a relationship got off to a pretty rocky start at least in the early days of the Republican primary win Nikki Haley was one of the more vocal critics of President Trump President Trump a return fire on Twitter and through other remarks and now the two of them up you're very close\nOr if you may recall this and our listening audience may recall this in the south Carolina primary\nDonald J Trump was her third choice she first indoors Jeb Bush when he dropped out she enjoys endorsed Marco Rubio a and then when the last man standing was the nominee for the Republican Party Nikki Haley came around and through her support behind President Trump and President Trump returned the favor he named her\nTo the post of un US ambassador to the United nations in November\nBritish trick credentials to run for higher office\nIt's important to note to join the closeness

ambassador to the United nations in November twenty sixteen uh and she last month coordinated the president's second trip\nTo the United nations including his first time sharing the U.N Security council so they have grown very close over the course of the past few years before\nShe came around she she made that famous speech where she warned about the siren call of angry voices so it has been a ... and again not uncommon President Trump was not fully embraced by the more establishment wing of the Republican Party in his\nRun up to the nomination and then you know people come along we saw a similar evolution which speaker of the house Paul Ryan is well the question of course becomes John who would take this position a very important role\nIn shaping us diplomacy and it doesn't sound like President Trump who was going to give any ah any ... any of those reporters in the White House no\nHe said that an announcement could come and the next few weeks but also look at your calendar also a few weeks away from the mid term elections I don't know\nIf you announce it before or after the midterms or if it's dependent upon how Republicans do in the mid term elections but\nThis will be certainly a choice that everybody will be watching very closely and and I don't know who it is or who are still the shoes of Nikki Haley now that she at the end of the year will step down as the U.S ambassador to the United nations\nOf course whoever the successor is we'll have to be confirmed by the United States Senate Nikki Haley by the way was confirmed with a big bipartisan number confirmed just a few days after inauguration day in the United States Senate\nBy a vote of Ninety six to four so she has been a member of this administration from almost day one serving nearly two years is United Nations ambassador a role she says she will resign from at the end of this year against saying there's no personal reason for her decision\nBut saying alongside President Trump it's very important for government officials to know when it's time to step aside Nikki Haley announcing her resignation at the end of the year for John decorate the White House I'm Jared Alfred on Capitol Hill this is Fox News radio [noise]\nTheir political elements universities my my sense is that Governor Cuomo has put his paw movement and Kenny operations and it it's not going well\nI Would say that any government governor has always had an outsized influence on a city they point everybody to the board or certainly um George Pataki appointed one of my colleagues Bob king\nAh who wasn't really an educator or a scientist or anything else\nAh so there's always been that the city university was a little less controlled by the governor in past years and it's got that is certainly has\nUm put people on the board including in my humble opinion it appropriately his budget director I don't think appointees by either governor mayor should be people\nUniversities my my sense is the Governor Cuomo has put his paw movement and community operations and it's not going well\nWell I Would say that any government governor has always had an outsized influence on a city they appoint everybody to the board or certainly um George Pataki appointed one of my colleagues Bob king\nAh who wasn't really an educator ordered a scientist or anything else\nAh so there's always been that the city university was a little less controlled by the governor in past years and this governor certainly has\nUm put people on the board including in my humble opinion inappropriately his budget director I don't think appointees by either a governor mayor should be people who work for them directly ah I think that a a conflict so um\nThat in some ways I think both of the systems because of rising a cost of pride that tuition have actually seen\nA major influx of students a long before there were a specialized scholarship programs but we have gotten an incredible uh chancellor at SUNY or is this\nPast year ah Christine Johnson is a um an electrical engineer with a distinguished background frankly I'm shocked that we're able to attract her\nFor the history of the book was saying oh did you have the guts to say no to Cuomo for us for something and reasonable\nI think she is smart enough to chart a course and convinced the governor a of the wisdom of that I'm OK that course\nOkay so you know the choices you put it can come down to uh you can pay\nOver sixty thousand dollars a year for NYU ... where did my PHD sixty thousand dollars a year teaching comprehensible and it's not the only one their own up there now or how much university calls the without the special programs\nFor ... I think the the I think now that the tuition is either sixty five hundred are sixty seven hundred or something in that range\nSo if you want to go to school when I went to a hundred was free of course but if you want to go to school it's a good deal\nIt's an excellent deal I'm even though it is a struggle but you know we have a great tuition assistance program for a poor and working poor students that helps dramatically a and many of those students are eligible for federal Pell Grants\nOr so and I forget exactly the percentage but it's something above fifty percent of the uh cutie students attend a without any cost of tuition\nWill never look I got a minute ... of all I have is a minute and then is you know we see our best friend the chili soon we're going to jail and we see corruption

was placed on the ballot who they have now put up for a judgeship so it's sort of a double change which they do it the pitchers in baseball\nMore will go on the west side of Manhattan a double or triple pickup\nRight so early on this became an issue locally and she said at that time\nIn the papers that she's very supportive of me and she certainly wants to see me reelected the working families party has written a letter to a local paper which they may or may not print\nAsserting their strong support for me I and you know I'm I'm leaving nothing to chance so I'll be you know doing my own

believe I have the confidence of my constituents I just think\nYou know certainly the primary electorate is a more focused\nAnd I'm In informed group of folks and pay more attention to these kinds of

come out of you let's put it this way that's just not nice\nWell look you know I've been in politics for a long time and you know you think you've seen it all but\nI think I I've always believed that one's reelection Ninety percent of it is doing your job doing it well working hard and I believe I have the confidence of my constituents I just think\nYou know certainly the primary electorate is a more focused\nAnd I'm In informed group of folks and pay more attention to these kind of machinations as the general election\nOr in a gubernatorial or presidential year is a much larger universe of people\nAnd so that's what we have to be sure we reach out to to ensure that they understand I mean when I've talked to people on the street or about this or people have asked me they're quite clear that you know they're going to be supporting me but\nUm you know the average voter is not paying attention and if they voted for instance the er once\nUh they may be inclined to do so again without understanding that this is not necessarily what her intention was so I'm doing what I have to do\nSo you know I have an observation for you assembly woman to regret it and that is when I was talking to the working families people I suppose I'm not supposed to say the name based on early conversations\nLet's ... told me that this was what they were going to do because they were under tremendous pressure from Andrew Cuomo\nAnd they wouldn't the rank and file in that party would not name Cuomo as their candidate they did that once before when the Blasio intervene for him\nThey don't like them but some of these leaders decided who have all the money to give the working families party you do it or else the guy was caught between a rock and a hard place and basically they outlined the strategy from the moment they put her on the ballot because they had to because there are people who want it or they're\nWell you know the they face in ... threat to the they're established party line they need fifty thousand votes a in a gubernatorial so they have to have somebody\nUm and Cynthia was I think clear from the beginning that she didn't win the primary she did not want to be a spoiler nor did the working families party want to be a spoiler and see any a path for Republican to become governor and I understand that\nUh you know it's great to feel like collateral damage but I'm going to ensure that the end result is that I Will be taking my seat in the assembly in January\nI get it and you know I certainly love the concept of the outcome that you've just described\nNevertheless I think it's thirty disgusting to politics and I don't think that the people in the\nIn the working families for the rank and file or happy about this the first few that I've talked to certainly indicate that they don't like it and uh I Can't imagine what it's like to be in your spot but India Nixon and seems to me it was always a long shot and she should stay right where she is just as far as I'm concerned I sit on my commentaries and\nAgain and again because it's the right thing to do and I know mark following arrow who is now being beat two to one in the polls is not going to take\nA Andrew Cuomo's governorship away from him\nI think the governor is very strong obviously there are places where um it's not all the level of his accomplishments for which\nThe outcome that you've just described\nNevertheless I think it's thirty disgusting to politics and I don't think that the people in the\nIn the working families party the rank and file or happy about this issue that I've talked to certainly indicate that they don't like it and uh I Can't imagine what it's like to be in your spot but Indian Nixon and seems to me it was always a long shot she should stay right where she is just as far as I'm concerned I sit on my commentaries and\nAgain and again because it's the right thing to do and I know more following arrow who is now being beaten two to one in the polls is not going to take\nA Andrew Cuomo's governorship away from him\nI think the governor is very strong obviously there are places where um\nIt's not all the level of his accomplishments for which uh I think he outlines very clearly but rather the way he goes about doing that you know we got George Bush because people thought they wanted to have a beer with him obviously we've learned that there is more dangerous than I ever knew um [noise]\nSo you know the likeability of somebody a becomes an issue when in fact the competence and ah their capacity for doing the job probably should be the first marker of whether one support someone or not\nI Will just say that it was interesting to me that in my district or there was Seventy six registered working families party people are five of whom showed up for the working families party primary\n[noise] so that's kind of a bitter pill a or a bit of coda to the whole story that they count on obviously Democrats and independents are not on their own registered voters\nJust so everybody understands as you just mentioned that they need to ... thousand votes to stay on the ballot basically in the next time and they have to win in the gubernatorial election\nSo certainly and Democrats who qualify for the Republicans will qualify and I think would Cynthia Nixon there that would be their best bet to qualify for those fifty thousand votes don't ...\nI Believe that a democratic voters will be smart a and there are you know obviously a I'm a self interested party in this matter\nSo obviously it would be easier in my life is the she stayed on the working families party line I don't think it would affect\nThe outcome of the old gubernatorial election uh and I think that the working families party would see that a reasonable vote that would keep them in business so to speak\nOn the other hand you know there are people who say let's leave nothing to chance and I think they could have Andrew Cuomo turn around and have the line and then said don't vote for me on the working families party line\nYou know he doesn't like them very much because he's always been an adversary using use the bully\nI think he has\nAn aggressive style that um is single minded towards his whatever he sees as the uh end result and are clearly there are times when I'm that\nComes across as I'm tough guy and I think he likes that persona you know run you know these are the muscle car guy\nAnd I have to say when there's an emergency that persona where there's a natural disaster or whatever that persona is actually a positive thing\nOr it's not necessarily as positive when there are delicate negotiations\nHave the line and then they don't vote for me on the working families party line\nYou know he doesn't like them very much because he's always been an adversary using use the bully\nI think he has\nAn aggressive style that um is single minded towards his whatever he sees as the uh end result and are clearly there are times when I'm

known person\n... will have to go out and campaign that she's never campaigned before we would hope that Cynthia Nixon will come right out and say hey I don't want to be elected the just the way the

send people who really do care about cleaning up politics apparently not\nOne of the races Allen that we haven't focused so much on is the attorney general's race and that seems to be the closest to the polls right now you've got all the tissues James which was the governor's hand picked candidate won the primary and one of the other major candidates in the race the Republican keep Wolford who's\nFrom western New York a lawyer and an African American he seems to be making some waves yeah but he's still ten\nPoints behind it it's going to be a blue wave it will be a ... if he can win there'll be a lot of people who think should win because the one thing you really do need is an attorney general who will be keeping an eye on the cover a lot of people thought that one of the reasons that uh\nThe ... fish James became so important to the governor was just because it was his person and that she wouldn't have the guts to go up against him she claimed she will time will tell or it's the old saying goes I'm from Missouri show me\nSo I think there are enough people around who is showing that they have some suspicions about this and I think that's why you know there's like ten points behind a but ten points it a lot of points in New York especially in a ... year like this\nStick with the blue your theme and two major races for Congress include both the mohawk valley down

polling places and history has not been that great\nA on the other hand an awful lot of people who are unhappy with Donald Trump particularly in New York state\nAnd one would think that that could

them\nWell you're lucky that they like it for you yeah very much so yeah I had that over the summer as well but my daughter was traveling internationally and touch her accountants link to mind but somehow I knew it was also over four hundred thousand dollars I knew she was not she can go shopping I think she could rack [laughter]\nThe thousand dollar on yeah but that yeah you have to check your statement I'm Out what you're talking about scams before on the Internet uh I don't know if you saw that scary um I\nSixty three hours among American Express optimal card\nOr the charge was the car and buy American Express before I go to church and it'll be calling them up on this radio show is over tomorrow but uh uh you got to check those accounts well written very careful I Would have voted for hundreds of three thousand dollars but it might not have motors for hours and the three cents\nWhere you're lucky that they lived there for you yeah very much so yeah I have that over the summer as well but my daughter was traveling internationally and touch her accountants link to mind but somehow I knew it was also over four hundred thousand dollars I knew she was not she can go shopping or somewhere but I think she could rack\nSixty thousand dollar on earth [laughter] yeah but ah yeah you have to check your statement I'm Out where you were talking about scams before on the Internet ah I don't know if you saw that scary um my Facebook feed over the weekend was full of that space book hoax that's tricking people into thinking their account had been hacked\nUp mine too you know what did you say\n... posting a message that they had gone for someone else on Facebook saying that there's some kind of scam going on your accounts been hooked on friendly don't respond to any messages from these words so\nYeah it turns out the whole thing was just a viral hoax uh-huh\nFarms to smoke them at all it's just having fun George and other people around\nRight but it's hard to know when something's real or not um they say if you got one of those messages there's a couple of things you can actually do\nA first you should check on your friends account and make sure it's not a clone of their real account ... and\nSo if you search their name and find to completely identical accounts it's a pretty good sign that when it's a clown and what first ... right right um and if you were message by a clone of your friends and you really should report yeah report that to Facebook because a cloned accounts violate Facebook's community standard [noise]\nUm so I mentioned\nEarlier more but something like half a million people were hacked was six\nHundred thousand Facebook accounts or hack every day while huge yeah I I read an interesting statistic that forty seven percent it's almost half of American adults have their personal information exposed by cyber criminals [noise]\nUm I I don't know if you know that's what this month's October it's national cyber security awareness month\nI was not aware of until you know for me this morning Tamara\n[laughter] well it is and department of homeland security and that um attorney general's office want people to be very aware of what they can do to protect themselves\nAccording to homeland security one in three of our homes with computers are infected with malware wow yeah\nAnd you really have to think about how\nYou access information on your computer because there there's so many ways people can infiltrate your computer\nUm there's phishing attacks\nUm you know those not only collect your personal and financial information but also affect your computer with these malware and viruses you know sometimes I don't know about you I get these emails where they just want you to click on a link or open an attachment if you don't know who that from you really have to be careful\nUm there's also these imposter scams have you seen those where people ask you to wire money\nUm to a government official or maybe a friend or family member and\nIt sort of place along the lines of one of each other scams that you might get ... uh from you know just on your phone or I'm In the mail there also needs and not just cyber but in the mail you get these you've won\nPeople can infiltrate your computer um there's phishing attacks\nUm you know those not only collect your personal and financial information but also affect your computer with these malware and viruses you know sometimes I don't know about you I get these emails where they just want you to click on a link or open an attachment if you don't know who that from you really have to be careful [noise]\nUm there's also these imposter scams have you seen those where people ask you to wire money\nUm to a government official or maybe a friend or family member and\nIt sort of place along the lines of one of each other scams that you might get ... uh from you know just on your phone or I'm In the mail there also needs and not just cyber but in the mail you get the you've won scam\nAnd uh you know if they're asking you to pay a fee or a tax for the prize or or if there's a request for your credit card or bank information I I don't think you're really going to win anything\nDo you they ... you weren't you don't pay them up for us\nRight there's also the it's a health health healthcare scams have you know [laughter] so what cyber criminals will do was request your Medicare or health insurance information or your Social Security number or financial information to help you understand what you need to do um for Medicare\nAnd because I don't know if you've seen this new Medicare cards are coming up and\nI open workers now right and people are a little unsure of what that entails if they need to contact Medicare whether Medicare will reach out to them um and the answer is no I don't have to do any\nBetter there than it for sure and I do not call it Medicare and calling them all to confirm receipt of your Medicare [laughter] right\n[laughter] right and also um I don't know if you've gotten these tech support scams I've seen them like at the pop ups like telling me something is wrong with my computer a lot I've seen a ride the bus line on that is if it ain't broke don't fix that right oh so you really shouldn't a click on any of those\nPop up a well known what shall remain nameless got prop up on her screen her computer I've been running slowly and so she responded malware was put on her computer ramps and where she couldn't walk the computer without providing a ... a credit card number and ended up with the computer was wrong she couldn't use more\n[noise] I've heard of that story before I really you just have to have a spider senses tingling anytime anything appears in your inbox that you don't know who it's coming from um because the people are\nPosing as many different aliases that they're really not ... so you just have to be very very careful\nSo the cyber security of a thing that you read that make you feel better but you're informed or make you feel worse because you realize it's hopeless them as\nIt made me feel like I Need to understand what I could do to protect myself\nAnd I'm One of the most important things I think we can do all of us can do with the naval stronger identification so sometimes when I log on to pay a bill um I'll have to have\nA special code texted to my phone that enabled me even after I put my password and enabled me to let them know that I'm really me a tour authentic ... exactly\nJust hopeless them is your first one\nIt made me feel like I Need to understand what I could do to protect myself\nAnd um I mean one of the most important things I think we can do all of us can do with the Naples stronger I got the cage and so sometimes when I log on to pay a bill um I'll have to have\nA special code texted to my phone that enables me even after I put my password and enabled me to let them know that I'm really me tear up into ... exactly\nUm they're going to have to take take precautions they're going to have to be more safe with this data um protect you know like you guys were talking about multi multi layered authentication\nUm you know stronger passwords a stronger um rules for the employees\nTo get access to deliver network [noise] ...\nIt's interesting when I read about this I came across a term that I'd never seen before called spoke bounty firms um book bounty program and apparently a lot of companies use the uh the book bounty\nFrom where supposedly white hat hackers as what they call them um those are supposed to be hackers who use their powers for good um if they try to find vulnerabilities will begin participating companies so a company like ... could go to one of these bugs bounty firms\nAnd basically they're saying find a way to hack into our system and we'll pay you because we want to know if we're vulnerable\nAnd obviously whoever hacked into ... was not one of these companies which are legal companies that these were just plain ... and how old was the hook or did you say tomorrow I read that the\nParticular hacker in this case with Twenty years old wow yeah anyway I mean if you think about the size of the settlement versus what he was asking for he was asking for a hundred thousand dollars and caffeine you said the settlement with how much\nA hundred and forty eight obviously a lot better [laughter] yeah [laughter] but it\nWas a war and older hacker with more experience [laughter]\nYou know the book down the programs they don't ask a lot of money um I mean it it makes sense to use them because um apparently the typical bug bounty program it's kept it around ten thousand dollars\nWhich if you are storing sensitive information it seems like that would be a no brainer to hire one of these white hat hackers [laughter]\nAbsolutely it it it's almost like having a scrimmage game\nYears old wow yeah and it wasn't I mean if you think about the size of the settlement versus what he was asking for he was asking for a hundred thousand dollars and caffeine you said the settlement with how much\nA hundred and forty eight obviously a lot of fat [laughter] yeah [laughter] but if\nThe war and older hacker with more experience you wouldn't want to move [laughter]\nYou know the book down the programs they don't ask a lot of money um I mean it it makes sense to use them because um apparently the typical both bounty program it's kept it around ten thousand dollars\nWhich if you are storing sensitive information it seems like that would be a no brainer to hire one of these white hat hackers [laughter]\nYeah absolutely it it's it's almost like having a scrimmage game if you're playing basketball you must be bringing a team of really good players to play against your team and and expose all your weaknesses and then you practice harder to cover ... will not cover them up but to do to improve upon them\nAnd you say that as a mother to football playing songs like huh\nThat's right the absolutely and a former basketball player myself\nTo do that about you what position that you know\nI was a very small forward [laughter] but I could jump [laughter] well that's impressive [laughter] um\nYeah so you know just it's it's so it's crazy 'cause this is this is the world we live in you know things are changing who doesn't want to use humor you know you want to be able to pull out your phone and you need a ride and you you get ... and\nYou eat the companies have to take responsibility they they have to be they have to be really careful with people's information you know just like you trust the app they have to they have to put you know they have to really put some effort into this and and make sure they can operate safely and a changing world\nRight and if you've got hackers willing to hack into your system legally I mean you can incentivize them to work with you not against you know it seems to make a lot of sense\nYeah absolutely there I mean there's nothing there's nothing worse than than exposing you know or some kind of security issue that you could have had exposed for ten thousand dollars and you could have fixed it rather than losing all these people's data and then now having to settle for all this money\nRight and um our office I think it's also proposing some legislation right to try to close gaps in ah New York status security well\nThat's right it's the it's the shield act\nOr what is that\nBy accident improve electronic data security act but she'll come on [laughter]\nI took that out from Cathy in a nutshell what what does that too\nAh basically you set up those you set up those a fail safe kind of you you work harder on your on your security work harder on\nKeeping people's information private and then if something breaches you have to report it\nEnsuring corporate integrity absolutely well that sounds like a good goal [noise] so\nI'm going to be up in your neck of the summer I'm speaking springs\nRight what time clock or for worse

preparation for Easter\nAnd tell us first of all a little bit about yourself and how you wound up where you are and doing what you're doing and then from there we are going to talk a little bit about some of this spiritual and scriptural basis for the whole topic a day\nAbsolutely and again other Christians you for having me today it's a it's an honor to be here pressure you know I've been in the business now for about ten years helping individuals or invest in the stock market and bond markets and you know I really enjoy what I Do I really have a passion for it\nUm I work primarily in this area of the retail investor makes sense of the market does you know they can be complex they can be emotional\nWho is a registered representative ages capital corporation\nAnd um we were talking before about land but and how ... is a time of preparation for Easter\nAnd tell us first of all a little bit about yourself and how you wound up where you are and doing what you're doing and then from there we are going to talk a little bit about some of this spiritual and scriptural basis for the whole topic today\nAbsolutely and again father Chris thank you for having me today it's a it's an honor to be here you know I've been in the business now for about ten years helping individuals uh invest into stock markets and bond markets and you know I really enjoy what I Do I really have a passion for it\nUm I work primarily in this area helping the retail investor\nMakes sense that these markets as you know they can be complex they can't be emotional there ever evolving and there's a lot of noise out there so uh someone like myself really helps people stay disciplined stay focused and I'm thinking about the long term investing\nI'm I have prior association with David litter association shaky Morgan Chase but I've been with ages capital now in ... for ah for ten years and really what we do is we help clients including individuals\nAnd families build manage preserve a and transfer their wealth by providing comprehensive\nWealth management and investment services so one more thing I Would say is that we're an independent foreign uh we have a lack of proprietary product\nWhich is very good because that helps us give our clients say non biased opinion and allows us to design portfolios that can meet their specific goals so were you as an individual stocks using a closed ... tax rate municipal bonds and other investment vehicles\nOkay so that's a broad spectrum then of a different investment\nUh possibilities and the portfolio and um [noise] tell us a little bit about and I know we can look through all the scriptures we can look through the gospels we can see\nDifferent places but you have a couple of references there specifically and I want you to mention them to our listeners\nAre about how a there is a a basis in our own faith uh to what we're talking about here today I mean what does the Bible say about investing and what is Jesus even say about being prepared and such a way\nAbsolutely and just before I answer that question um you talk about being prepared spiritually I Believe that there are four main components to we should add here too in this life what is growing spiritually\nTo is growing intellectually uh we should work on our physical conditions are health and lastly I think a managing your finances and take care of your a financial situation of appearing in that sense is also very important and\nAll of these are gifts from God and so our every one of them they the spiritual the temporal physical all of that all all of what we had been given our own gift from God and he wishes us to take care of them and that's what you're what you're talking\nAbout right and the other thing I Would say about our faith is our faith really makes the reference to family right Manley is very important not just with our faith but also with our society and uh I think having good financial security\nPartly helps that family structure ah which is the bedrock of of our society so property asset ownership\nOf retirement wealth generation I think those are very important and very responsible in terms of our faith in our society you asked me about the Bible what that's what it says about investing I Believe that God wants us to ...\nAnd so our every one of them they the spiritual the temporal physical all of that all all of what we had been given our own gift from God and he wishes us to take care of them and that's what you're what you're talking about\nRight and the other thing I Would say about our faith is our faith really makes the reference to family right namely is very important not just with our faith but also with our society and uh I think having good financial security\nPartly helps that family structure a which is the bedrock of of our society so property asset ownership of retirement wealth generation I think those are very important and very responsible in terms of our faith in our society you asked me about the Bible what that's what it says about investing\nI Believe that you know God wants us to prosper\nUm you know in the Old Testament there were many stories about increasing\nAnd multiplying and back then they didn't have a financial markets but they had other types of of of courage see 'em to the stories are ... that I found that we could reference or one is the Powerball or the story of\nThe talents failure with that I'm sure you would know better than me [laughter] very well as the other one is the story of the wise man who built this house in Iraq as opposed to the man who built this house\nOn the sand expert on the story of the towers as we know the master\nA there was three uh three servants than the master left one with five bags of silver\nOne with two bags of silver and one with one five and a trusted them with it and when uh the master came back the first survey multiplied the first five into an additional five\nSecond which would additional to ride but that last one [laughter] he went out and buried in the whole right attractive places master and when the master came back he was very happy with the service who went out and invested the money will multiplied the money worked hard to gain more\nAnd very upset with the servants who was stuck his money in the sand and we don't want to do that as people either in terms of investments we don't want to stick our head and this and so I don't think Jesus would have brought that up if he was it um they want us to take financial responsibility and invest\nAnd of course back risk that well and and and part of investing is taking risks but it's it's trusting that uh that that they're just going to grow and of course in that terrible the the master\nIs meant to be the person of the lord you know is is meant to be God himself three and a horse that whole that whole narrow blocks new Israeli already [noise]\nIs a microcosm of our life has all of us we believe in front of God at the end of our lives are going to have to give an accounting of what we've done with the gift that God has given to us and so God wants us as you said to prosper to take the gifts that he's given to us and use them wisely\nAnd use them well and used them not only for our own benefit for the benefit of the whole human family for our families are nuclear families for the good of our church or the good of our communities\nAnd for the good ultimately of the world and he will be well pleased with that stewardship\nBut not so well pleased if we take the gifts that he has given us and really squander of them are just to keep them to ourselves which is what the which is what the survey with one exactly did\nAnd that's the whole meaning of the the parable although you spoke so well of it but the next time that gospel comes up I'm going to have fewer bizarre [laughter] but but that's the meaning of it and um sometimes people say well what what is that all about what is it what what's the point to the point of it is\nNot so much that we're looking at the master and the servants or how much they multiplied or didn't\nWhy late and use them well and used them not only for our own benefit for the benefit of the whole human family for our families are nuclear families for the good of our church or the good of our communities and for the good ultimately of the world and he will be well pleased with that stewardship\nBut not so well pleased if we take the gifts that he's given us and really squander them or just to keep them to ourselves which is what the Bush is what the survey with the one exactly did\nAnd that's the whole meaning of the the parable although you spoke so well the next time that gospel comes up I'm going to ask your comedy but but that's the meaning of it and um sometimes people say well what what is that all about what does what what's the point the point of it is\nNot so much that we're looking at the ... the servants or how much they multiplied or didn't it is seeing ourselves in it\nUm but as much as we all like open it up or statements and she'd go up and up and up that week after week month after month that's also not reality so what you saw this past week was a a ten to twelve\nA per se correction and you know what it looks like to watch is a typical market correction now of course there's fears of potential rises in interest rates or maybe inflation coming back which could have a negative impact on us stocks\nAnd bonds with Elizabeth in listeners should understand is that markets a corrections are part of long term investing and here's an interesting statistic\nAnd the last several bull markets every time we've had a ... percent correction the market rallied roughly twenty percent over the next twelve to Fifteen months where it's not interesting so as a as a a registered rep what I Would advise from what I Would tell my clients is\nNow it's not the time to uh panic but rather be disciplined and focused huh do you want to take a longer term approach to invest in which is what we do at our uh our shop in Rockville because what happens tomorrow next week or even next month\nShouldn't lead you to a financial decision that you're going to regret later and lastly think about it as a buying opportunity there's some good companies couldn't names that right now are ten to Fifteen Percent cheaper\nThan they were a week and a half ago so if you're going to look out three five years and beyond and by the way I tell my investors if you're not willing to be invested three to five years or more don't even think about investing because you're going to get times like this where markets correct\nAnd the long term investor should use that\nAs a buying opportunity I'll tell you an interesting quote from Warren Buffett who was one of those famous value investors he said the stock market's services a relocation center where money moves from the in patient to the patient so let's not grow to myopic\nYou want to take a longer term approach to investing which is what we do at our ah our shop in Rockville because what happens tomorrow next week or even next month\nShouldn't lead you to a financial decision that you are going to regret later and lastly think about it as a buying opportunity there's some good companies couldn't names that right now are ten to Fifteen Percent cheaper\nThan they were a week and a half ago so if you're going to look out three five years and beyond and by the way I tell my investors if you're not willing to be invested three to five years or more don't even think about investing because you're going to get times like this where markets correct and the long term investor should use that\nAs a buying opportunity I'll tell you an interesting quote from Warren Buffett who was one of those same value investors\nHe said the stock market's serves as a relocation center where money most from the in patient to the patient so let's not grow to myopic in the long run he who trades less earns more fun it's interesting prospect so support and not to panic and if you work with someone like myself\nWhen we create long term plans for you we help coach you true that\nA very very interesting that that's a very good perspective and somebody who is in there let's say early thirties to mid forties\nTo put in say a thirty year investment of some sort of portfolio because it would be very wise than what they now because then by the time they're going to refer to a retired let's say at the age of sixty five Seventy Seventy five they should have a pretty good uh they should have a pretty good retirement there when you're saying\nWhich leads us to a very good point which is related to Arlington topic ... lent is about uh making sacrifices one saying some of their thirties forties and fifties should be doing\nIs sacrificing things they want now or whether it be fair to your car or a a bigger home or a new pair of shoes and putting money away the average advisor will tell you that you should save ten to Fifteen Percent of your income\nStarting in your twenties so and they do have to sacrifice if you want to bear fruit Slater yeah and in and and when you're in retirement or the average retire makes you look to rip retirees should look to replace Seventy to Ninety percent of annual pre retirement income\nA true savings and Social Security well very interesting so that's what that's what they have their sacrifice now to bury the Fritz later\nYeah very good well we have another caller so we want to go to the call and go to the phones then to welcome our next caller and where are you calling from and what is your name welcome\nHi this is Bob Castro hype autocrats\nBob nice to hear from you\nOwn a so I'm so out there I can get through to

the New York city newsman get coming in\nUm I think that it would have been well it would have been a hell of a lot slower than it is even now of gang\nAnd because it's such a huge story a national story really I think we benefitted from some of the more aggressive news gathering or a practices inability to those are\nThe TV networks and on the major newspapers in New York City but I'll tell you something Fred [laughter] it's like then involuntarily or a retired\nUh you know people ... and I'm sure it happens the Carol people constantly asking don't you miss it and I do miss it every time there's a major story I don't miss working on this story this is such a such a terrible story wiping out of a segment of a community wiping out a family\nAnd I you know it's going to be self for decades up there in Amsterdam where many of the people came from and in skull Harry obviously\nBut I don't let me let me ask colonel just the same sort of question just whether or not you're sort of journalistic blood how'd you thinking that you would have been ... you'd like to go back in the business covering this and what did you think of the coverage generally far\nUm I I agree with John MD he has sent Tom Costello who passed patiently pointer up here and I was working here I don't think overnight and he had the records from the press age um\nIs working on this story this is such a such a terrible story wiping out of a segment of a community white can have a family and uh you know it's going to be so for decades up there in Amsterdam where many of the people came from and in school Harry obviously\nWas on the Internet as Carol just the same sort of question just whether or not you're sort of journalistic blood or how'd you thinking that you would have been ... you'd like to go back in the business covering this and what did you think of the coverage generally far\nUm I I agree with John and the the has sent Tom Costello who passed petition reporter up here and working here I don't think overnight and he had the records from the press age I'm\nLosing limousine service\nWhere he showed some of the problem they had with an infection and I can't I can only think of one thing the um National Transportation Safety Board die pay that bill hadn't he probably known and and now all these reporters\nSo NBC has those breakfast before any local people yes\nUm my ... Parker says are yes I Would love to be covering that as sad as that is that I'm a fan of the ... river for nine days back in Nineteen eighty\nSeven when they were um when the state police divers ... in the river looking for survivors you know and what's that called Harry Reid\nIf we're going through a bridge collapse the bridge collapsed looking for survivors\nI mean I was going to either of you cover the Ethan Allen voting tragedy I Know two thousand and five\nNo I didn't\nKnow that that distance spread 'em you know back in the states and certainly not on the scene\nJust in terms of how one response to this you know I think John you made a very good point in Cairo backed up\nBy citing the national network for local press it's easy to get out and talk to survivors hard trying to find local law information that's related to the tragedy those involving the company involving survivors and family members obviously but how do you go about if you're a TV reporter John or you're working for the San Jean Carroll\nGetting that the government records especially\nThese days when local newspapers really don't have reporters who covers state agencies and therefore have the connections that are required you want to go first colonel\nI Am it's very difficult is it not\nWill pick two of you to a FOIL request that can answer the phone I'm On they don't answer and then they might send nine you can send your investigation no bread you know what that is the old old old way of doing things you get a hard time off\nOr stores says in ... that can from by ... I'm sure that\nThat route transportation agency guy gave those records to and the state because he knew that fact plus it was empty space going back to the fact that somebody that will help you out even if it's sent and the show on the state police\nJournalism using saying well well\nCarol Carol mailed it there I mean I'm sure that um the reporters who came out of Washington DC or New York city had some sort of relationship with someone and um and anyone you know anyone else involved here with the state government uh and and you look at\nOh old way of doing things you get a hot hot all\nOr story says in that ten from by ... I'm sure that\nThat route transportation agency guy gave those records to and the state because he knew that guy plus it was empty space going faster and faster than somebody that will help you out even if it's ... and the show on the state police\nJournalism using saying well well\nCarol Carol mailed it there I mean I'm sure that um the reporters who came out of Washington DC or New York city had some sort of relationship with someone\nAnd um and anyone you know anyone else involved here with the state government uh and and you look at some of the some of the reporters to young reporters covering the capital around here is you know you don't have any are very few relationships\nThat could get the specially holiday weekend could get them that kind of information\nI had a moment's notice\nAnd it's in aside from you know knocking on doors but how do you knock on the door when their clothes for the Columbus Day weekend you know\nNo question let's talk a little bit about some of those facts that have come out to pull them never got a very good interview on his show I'm not sure if you're both hurting um I thought it was yeah I was going to be with Lee kindling new now is making national news he was on the national ab at your radio broadcast and I suspect these and other places he pops up representing\nThe son of the owner of this fresh sees a limousine companies shabby Hussein is the owner I Believe and saying that the story we heard from Andrew Cuomo who jumped to the poor to get his face out from my point of view on a press conference at the state police should have been conducting saying that the state had um\nA denied his limousine\nProper registration to be on the road we can learn things that's not the case there were just minor violations were getting completely different stories down John what's your reaction to what's come out so far in this kind of\nConfusing situation including the fact that the owner of the first thing you learn as dean company apparently goes back a decade or more as an FBI informant in cases involving alleged Islamic terrorism\nWell first off that kind of coincidental thing I think a strictly that coincidental and the reason why I said that is because some wealth in the in the state or perhaps it was major patent or I'm a firm to key you know they mentioned during the news conference yesterday that these people the victims\nWho were having a party to celebrate as a birthday of one of the young women they had a contract or thought they contract it with another company\nAnd we're supposed to get in a small bus apparently from the other company and it was only at the ... I should say the last minute because they didn't say that but it was only after being turned down or finding out they weren't going to get this month\nThat they then went to the second company and got the uh the limo stretch SUV the excursion and it just\nIt absolutely boggles my mind that all Eighteen people in one vehicle or kill yeah I'm just I don't understand that how every one was killed\nLet me say something I said bothered by that for two days and then I'm listening to pop band and fire who's also bothered by us but something happened a late yesterday I didn't know\nThe AT T as the vital I struggle with that the N E S e official they got me a shot stop tier one\nWhile I shouldn't say the last minute because they didn't say that but it was only after being turned down or and finding out they weren't going to get this virus that they then went to the second company and got the uh the limo that stretch and she will be the excursion and it just\nIt absolutely boggles my mind that all Eighteen people in one vehicle or killed just I don't understand that how everyone was killed\nLet me say some things I I've been bothered by that for two days and then I'm listening to Paul Vandenberg who's also bothered by it but something happened a late yesterday afternoon\nThe N. T. S. B. why do I struggle with that the N E S the official they've got three shots stopped here one of them said\nHe said this is what happened he says this is what happened\nOn a vehicle going ... miles an hour\nAnd it crashed his first into that as you Nate Bennett trees that it it just it's a um a bank near the redeem\nHe's that because he's obviously seen this afternoon so hope engine block comes first he threw the sponsor of the salt\nAnd obviously that's an engine block\nPunishing them guys isn't\nThat an odd the passengers when when when it's fast final stop all the passengers who are not in the south because they don't have to be\nCome rushing to the front I even do and they and and there's the engine for half an inside there because the the ... did not act alone and it's just not break on that and they said they'll hard to believe that all a king died\nDirt on by a half a century ago and I I think you covered as well uh I covered the um the crash of the mohawk plane and uptown Albany yeah this is a plane that hit the bottom of our house\nAnd all it is the went into the basement and came up the other side the cockpit came up the other side of the highlights ran people walk I I don't know whether they walk to tell you the truth but\nPeople survived that crash I Know when you say my God you look at something like that and there's tremendous pores are they haven't said yet how fast that excursion was going down that hill\nWhen it hit the other one will be over the other vehicle I I I Can't imagine that that we're all of that energy went through or a good deal of it it's when they hit those trees I Would suspect you mentioned block\nYeah came past the driver\nBut it it really does it amazes me that if there weren't some survivors of this thing\nAnd then they sent me to\nI think everybody is saying that I mean I guess the airbag or baggage plural didn't provide any protection at all I really don't mind if they were elected the engine but it must have been going so fast\nMe that if there weren't some survivors out of this thing and then they make too\nI think everybody is saying that I mean I guess the airbag or bags plural just didn't provide any protection at all I read that might have been where the engine but it must have been going so so fast\nLook according to the state police\nAnd I don't know Andrew Cuomo actually that that I Know what he said about it's failing and ... and they want and then there are some documents that show that wasn't in ... in just a week ago and there were some problems\nI understand we said they were mine uh I don't know if my if you have a minor problem during section if that means you're allowed to go on the road and Harry ... years in your vehicle because that's where you are Marshall there so\nI don't I don't know I don't know how the confusion as I understand Elise thanks so I'm whatever minor infractions or we're not enough to disable the vehicle but I\nMean it's a real mystery there's no question about it and they wanted to\nTalk to the state police you know he's a partner isn't fair enough um\nUnless they really want to lose ... ... what did you make it a contradiction as you saw it and it is a real fundamental contradiction now that we don't have a resolution to\nIf it turns out that these are infractions or the safety and fractions had\nA war of the caliber or the dimension of not having enough fluid in your ... to reserve or um or the governor's looked like a fool and I don't think that's going to happen\nI Would not think that um someone would give that kind of flimsy information to the governor knowing they're going to lose their job if they making it looked like a jerk out there\nOr wind up in the machine a barracks\nBe as a machine a virus that [laughter] so we don't know where he's about that we won't bring up now that it's a yeah obviously it they know that the governor is going to go on TV you guys to Columbus Day parade and and he's going to talk about this\nIt it it really really stretch my imagination to think that um\nThese where a such a minor quality as a leak in when they're saying but but who knows I mean that's one that's the big question you know that's what I Want I Want to know about the structural integrity of that uh that vehicle when you take apart a car\nAnd the supply you convertibles afraid\nSomeone would give a ... that kind of cleansing information to the governor knowing they're going to lose their job if they making it looked like a jerk out there\nOr wind up in machine I haven't seen a barracks\nCould be at the machine that Barry [laughter] and we want to know about that we won't bring up now and it's a yeah obviously\nA and they know that the governor is going to go on TV is that the Columbus Day parade and and he's going to talk about this\nIt it it really really stretch my imagination to think that um\nAnd these were a such a minor quality and so we can when they're saying but but who knows I mean that's one that's the big question you know that's what I Want I Want to know about the structural integrity of that uh that vehicle when you take a part of the car\nAnd the supply you've had convertibles a Fred yeah and I've had convertible so I don't know about Carol\nNo when you take apart a car even taking the top off of it\nYou'll read does all of a sudden you reduce the title and you get that car that that'd be a cultural strengths and yes and you've gotta you've got to restore that all convertibles that's why they weigh more because they had these structures that you had these um a steel bands underneath them\nTo give them some integrity a degree of integrity and still I don't think there is safe as a as a hard time car so I I'd like to know we're that was done we're the we're we're stretched\nAnd how was it was a certification supposedly you have to get certified by the federal government if in fact the manufactured does not certify it I'd want to know about the brakes\nNow you've had cars pull a credit and I won't mention what kind of all but a lot of great power and God you've got to have a different kind of break out in a car like that well the same is true if you've got a vehicle like that excursion they've got tremendous weight\nBecause of the stretching of it by several the it's a huge vehicle and it's got to have\nSufficient breaking power to uh to stop a vehicle like that and those are the kinds of things I'd like to know uh you know what the what happened during an inspection they the last inspection the words did any of them touch upon as such vital issues is that\nTrue or do you have any concerns that the\nThe um ... which is notoriously secretive might try to hold back any information that might be in the files say of the state department of transportation warning not only about this company possibly but boarding or more specifically about that intersection which apparently in school Harriet thirty and thirty a\nHas been a notoriously dangerous\nDeveloping what nothing would amaze me at all about government curve on any level okay and and government bureaucrats I don't know whether you can keep that kind of information a secret though\nWas a mess in there it's less likely it's good that the feds are there is a check with everything yeah\nI yeah I also think this is an election year and the governor wants to find someone in the tea just travel on the bus\n[laughter] it'd be great if they said that I think at\nCarroll made a a good point in pointing out the strange connections between his limousine company and the owner who was an FBI enforcement at one time and who leaked inland father was involved in that case I Know people who initially when they heard about this I thought well maybe the horrible\nAccident wasn't an accident on Saturday maybe there was some kind of an effort to get back at the father's the owner of the limousine company to an act of terrorism\nBureaucrats I don't know if you could keep that kind of information a secret though\nI think it was a mention there is less likely it's good that the feds are there is a check with everything yeah\nI yeah I also think this is an election year and the governor wants to find someone in the old TV just travel onto the bus [laughter] it'd be critical thinking that I think at\nJohn Carroll made a a good point in pointing out the strange connections between is a limousine company and the owner who was an FBI enforcement say one time and who we can Linda's father was involved in that case I Know people who initially when they heard about this I thought well maybe the horrible\nAccident it wasn't an accident on Saturday maybe there was some kind of an effort\nTo get back at the father's the owner the limousine company to an act of terrorism to kill these people that maybe a jihadi was involved now there's no evidence of that at all at this point and it may not be the case because we do is Carol pointed out that the limousine was hired only at the last minute apparently but I'm feeling it out\nYeah that is the point that I was making the word for it\nAnd I I'm just saying that if they had planned and that's the lemon saying\nThat they had a contract with another company\nFor this bar that they might it's supposed to her thing and at the last minute or one of the last minute\nI had to withdraw up onto this company and to take this excursion instead I I Would think that that puts it beyond any any doubt that they're just said that this is nothing more than coincidence but again it depends on whether all of that information is correct\nThat will be fun you know that I'm sure it let me ask you just as a final question or line of questions on this terrible event that occurred in ... on Saturday from your own experiences over many years as journalists\nWhat this kind of a large number of deaths I mean it's not that common but you've seen it or what death in a community a small communities in upstate New York this is the people from Amsterdam New York which is a small city or the impact in say in a community like Cisco Harry which is a very small town\nHow long the impact of just like this last from my experience I Would say you can go on for a generation or more that it reverberates in reverberates in when most people have forgotten about it is still is reverberating in a community immediately affect it just has that been your experience when did you go first Carol\nI'm yes that is my very and I have covered numerous\nMissing teeth all who are still missing yes and um\nI think ... around the anniversary of when they went next a their loved ones are their friends do some things to remember them\nSo it's never got the people who work with the young people ... ... what are their twenties and thirties their coworkers I'm lucky that and that\nAre as a nurse and and the nurses stations\nAnd as well as they it it it it takes a long long time you know we lost every part of the times union and in surgery donating pardons deliver to his brother and I never stopped looking at is that\nIt's um you know you've got one there one day and the next day they're gone and and the most of my current way it was a a fairly routine not life threatening surgery but it's but it's\nPeople who work with he he's for young people read these people were what in their twenties and thirties their co workers are lucky that he that\nAre as a nurse and and the nurses stations\nAnd it will make it ... it takes it takes a long long time you know we lost every quarter Times Union and in surgery donating pirated than deliver to his brother and I never stopped looking at is that\nIt's um you you you know someone's there one day and the next day they're gone and and the taste of my current way it was a fairly routine not life threatening surgery but it but it took his life the\nBigger the whole or in the community in Amsterdam with children whose parents are no longer there instantly and sons and daughters of disappears in the eyes of their mothers and fathers et cetera John\nWhat's been your experience that way I mean this is for most people and it's understandable I think it's an abstraction but the reality for journalists who goes and talks to these people and see what happens is something you don't forget\nYou know if this happened for the New York city and I think you have a great understanding of that having grown up there [noise]\nUm the the sadness and the the grief would be no less valid would be no less a dimension but you you mentioned that as you asked this question that the differences that in smaller communities\nStays with you for a lifetime I think it goes beyond that generate [laughter] no we just saw those two young people up in um Clifton Park who were killed on the north way and that was several years ago\nAnd we we keep hearing story after story of their friends who want to remember them and then there's there's sense of loss\n... was so great and so tremendous ... that's going to go on for decades and a small community like Amsterdam or is that going Harry area they're never going to forget this\nAnd other major vessels this is one reason why car manufacturers used to chowder cars crumbles zone which directed the shock wave to the size of the vehicle and around the passenger cabin I'm sure that's true I mean it's just that I'm\nTrying to

be anywhere from eight to twelve inches of rain and the storm continues to move this way I think one of the larger things were going to the is the storm surge especially there in the Big Bend there's

X.\nGames\n[noise]\n\n\n\n[noise]\n\n[noise] [noise]\nWell come on you know not your fault\nIf your hormones with Jackie line he I mean we all love from everyone was so excited today we're going to have a very important one that the\n... in between hormones and breast cancer and it is the observation a breast cancer awareness month so we're seeing pink everywhere everywhere\nEverywhere you go ... late evening bill your movies lady [laughter] that is the message of the day don't forget to feel the booby because\nThat hurts tech early detection that's all about early detection and I'm Renee we have Dr Kelly talking about the connection between hormones and breast cancer death to kill you there\nHi I'm here good afternoon\nBut one good as well you know and\nSo yes so breast cancer awareness month very important very important if everyone's field where obviously and um I Believe that the key is early detection and prevention those are\nYeah well that's where we come in and that's where you come in really looking with in\nIn the body right where does it start where does it again I mean it's multi factorial as we all know some people\nDon't forget to feel those movies because\nThat tech early detection that's all about early detection and I'm Renee we have to kill each talking about the connection between hormones and breast cancer duck to kill you there\nHi I'm here good afternoon\nNeal and good afternoon\nSo yes so breast cancer awareness month very important very important for everyone to field where obviously and um I Believe that the key is early detection and prevention\nThose are yeah well that's where we come in and that's where you come in really looking in was\nIn the body right where does it start\nWhere does it began I mean it's multi factorial as we all know\nSome people have a genetic predisposition to breast cancer and I'm at but there's also dietary factors and lifestyle um it's a combination of you know how how at risk or you\nMhm right and what are the main um [noise] what are the main risk factors as far as life style goes\n[noise] so I Would say a few of the main ones would be for a little lifestyle of would be dietary factors um and that kind of encompasses a huge area 'cause you're looking at\n'em if we're looking at the post menopausal female or above forty for example um there is a very strong link\nA obesity and breast cancer yeah there's been plenty of studies done out there so\nIf we're talking lifestyle or talking I'm rich diets we're talking exercise keeping the um the BMI at a normal level because actually\nI'm so breast cancer I'm I'm about eighty percent of all breast cancers have a receptors estrogen and\nAs we get older being I as a matter of fact age is a risk factor but not in something we can't control but that is a risk factor for breast cancer and they get older and I'm over you stop making estrogen one of the main places ushered in his made in our bodies are through fat\nSo that make more estrogen so the more body fat we have as we're older\nThe more of this estrogen and there's different types of ocean there's there's there's good and there's bad but it it it it becomes a stimulus tore effect it has a similar effect on if there are any breast cancer cells lingering starting you know just smoldering in there and quite how to become a tumor\nIf estrogen levels are high it will be stimulus tore\nAnd and you sit there um specific pathways estrogen goes down like you wanted to go safe pathway but then you can go rogue and neck cancer causing path way and there are things that we can do to prevent that like um\n... for instance\nLike exact right because of the ... and the sulfur sulfur affect us\nUp the vegetables um so for I forget the actual chemical name of it but something happened it was so for that helps keep and then it helps keep that as I said ... so that's one of the\nUm things that women can do on a daily basis is kind of rotate those ... vegetables\nWell yes that's certainly very important that we are who there's more research that support knowing your personal risk factors why the hell three sixty five blood panel is so him\nPap way but then you can go rogue and neck cancer causing path way and and there are things that we can do to prevent that like I'm\nChristopher vegetables for instance\nLike exact right because of the ... and the sulfur sulfur sectors\nOf the vegetables um so for like I forget the actual chemical name of it but something happened it was so for that helps keep and then it helps keep that estrogen and save Pepe so that's one of the\nUm things that women can do on a daily basis is kind of rotate those ... vegetables well I guess that's\nCertainly very important but we also there's more research that support knowing your personal risk factors why the hell three sixty five blood panel is so important because testing gives us more information but in addition to that\nUnderstanding the correlation between your personal risk factor it's if you have a hereditary disposition that will increase it certainly if you smoked\nIn your user currently smoking that has to stop 'em we know as Dr Kim said obesity right ag absolutely and even birth control pills and logo on and on and on\nSo that's why it's so important to understand how all these factors together prevention like the best\nThe survey Jenike they eat\nSort of um [noise] a technique that you know anything about that\nThey're ma graffiti yeah demography okay can you yeah\nSo actually it is um it actually is an FDA approved a method for screening but it's considered I'm an adjunct to a mammogram okay this is very different way of detecting um breast cancer cells because\nBy the Taliban merit Graham usually picks up a a cancer it's already in a tumor form sewed quite a a detectable sides\nAnd their model the actually the tax through its digital infrared thermal imaging ... look fat the heat\nAnd the breast and he comes from blood flow cancer cells or need usually actually catches ... create a through something called angiogenesis mhm or blood vessels to give them more oxygen so they can start multiplying so\nThe thermal demography to tax the spy I'm showing heat and that is usually so it it shows the earlier and acted inflammation so not actually so it's a way of getting\nJunk to a mammogram okay this is very different way of detecting um breast cancer cells because\nBy the time and mayor Graham usually picks up a a cancer it's already in a tumor form so just quite a a detectable size\nAnd thermometer fee actually this tax through its digital infrared thermal imaging ... look fat the heat and the breast and he comes from blood flow\nCancer cells old need usually actually catches does create a through something called angiogenesis ... more blood vessels um to give them more oxygen so they can start multiplying so the thermal demography\nTo tax the spy I'm showing heat and that is usually so it it shows earlier and active inflammation so not actually so it's a way of getting um a few steps ahead of the humor how\nEnsures panic that shouldn't ... Manuel and it's just something that is normally covered by insurance or you out there or what\nIt's still it's still out there because insurance companies are really ... really do lean towards the mammogram it's um the the the one that's been around the longest and um\nIt depends on your insurance I Would say that a lot of places I Do not think cover that is some kind of ... and right now and um yeah it's a it's just a very different process I mean there's still so many studies out regarding thermometer graffiti but what I've what I've\nRead and what I've seen is that um there are certain ... even like inflammatory breast cancers yeah they're not picked up on mammograms um but you can see the ... active heat the red actually come to the different colors on Thurman\nWow yeah wow very interesting enough so probably the best case scenario would be self detection\n... you know you did in the shower the whole feeling you're babysitting and down and ladies you can get the instructions on line if you don't know quite how to do it and then if you can maybe getting their mammography and then ...\nRight and I've seen 'em\n... practices that have used their mammography\nWhere they have actually detected inflammation or detective\nUm the uh you know little red spots would be how it would come up and then put females are women on something they would call like a press protocol\nSomething like we would do a very basic elimination diet detoxification and you can actually see the change of the redness um inflammatory changes go away wow after\nYeah so that hasn't been I we've seen that actually happened\nSo it's it's fascinating stuff at the end and I love that it's um it's really ... it's like prevention I think it was like a prevention almost ... because if you know that there is nothing if you don't have inflamed breast inflammation is the cause of all disease\nEvery so that's where it starts it's always I always feel like\nBig fat Greek wedding when I talk about inflammation just like in the nation [laughter] for that movie with like everything was Greek everything has its route and Greek it's like everything is about information comes back to that but um well I mean I'm not saying it play at the substitution but\nHow great to have that and you don't have to get your Boop smashed will look at what act Angelina Jolie\nThat liberal years ago she had both that was pretty radical removed to\nElective Lee that was ... yeah I think that women were talking about it the discussion that we need to talk about having that information and coming out of pocket for it even if it's not approved\nBecause if you know that there is nothing if you don't have inflamed press information is the cause of all\nEvery so that's where it starts it's always I always feel like\nBig fat Greek wedding when I talk about information just like in the nation over that movie it was like everything was great everything had his route and Greek as like everything is about information comes back to that [laughter] but um well I mean I'm not saying it's a it's a substitution but\nHow great is to have that and you don't have to get your boobs smashed will look at what Angelina Jolie\nOh that liberal years ago she had both that was pretty radical removed it's\nElective Lee that was without the ... yeah I think that women\nWere talking about it the discussion that we need to talk about having that information and coming out of pocket for it even if it's not approved is I think one of the most important\nYeah is that we become her own health advocate and the great thing about the healthy sixty five is that it's covered by most insurance companies and it's valued at up to ten thousand dollars\nApproximately four and um [noise] yes it is um well we have to look more into the ... 'cause I think that sounds like a really interesting um tests for every woman that cat I think where we get it all sing it in the upcoming showers yeah you'd\nThink looking forward to it okay so basically we can talk about preventative stuff here like not drinking or eating at a plastic definitely not microwaving of elastic and using plastic wrap and um\nThere's an interesting I mean this is kind of off\nOff topic a little bit but I gave a talk a couple of years ago on um [noise]\nOn estrogen and men because men which is really interesting I've been noticing in um evaluating the um [noise]\nHealth three sixty um blood work is is that men were having higher education levels and so I did a lot of research on it and there I'm kind of connecting with plastics\n'em and all other kinds of messages but there was a study done with with with male tadpoles\nAnd they were members that when they were and it's a dream were there was this um this chemical that was I think it was the um [noise] be HG or whatever the chemical is in plastic\nAnd it was highly I'm located in the water and the debt male tadpoles over time turned into a fully functioning female oh great how weird is that there isn't that\nWell it's something that we need to address and I'm Glad you brought that up because it's an alarming fact you can't deny research and science and it goes to the point of ... in the news last week someone won the big power ball and the woman said what are you going to do different now that you want and\nThe ... the reporter thought he would say oh by a bigger house and he said I'm going to start to think I'm going to start taking better care of myself that are left and I think\nLet's just connect that to what we're talking about today about preventing breast cancer and raising awareness about this conversation you don't have to wait until you have a scare you don't have to wait you need to know your\nRisk factors right but you don't need to be tied nose before you'd say well now I'm going to eat better or now I'm going to hire jak your doctor\n... from these but the point is that you can do it today you can check those numbers you can look within you can make better choices before there is that's that's\nIn the news last week someone won the big power ball and the woman said what are you going to do different now that you've won and the ... the reporter thought he would say oh by a bigger house and he said I'm going to start to think I'm going to start taking better care of myself that are left and I think\nLet's just connect that to what we're talking about today about preventing breast cancer and raising awareness about this conversation you don't have to wait until you have a scare you don't have to wait you need to know your\nRisk factors right but you don't need to be tied known before you say well now I'm going to eat better for now I'm going to hire jak your doctor ... from these but the point is that you can do it today you can check those numbers you can look within you can make better choices before there is that's\nThat's the bad diagnosis at the best scenario yet um and so from what all that we know one thing we can do is just target inflammation\nAnd I'm really take those inflammatory foods out of our diet so sugar would be the number one home well I was just in Washington this weekend and there was a cop killings or and if you could see the women between the ages of thirty five and Seventy\nIt was like American Idol they were waiting on line around the corner I'm running for forty five minutes to an hour\nTo buy oh six dollar cupcake well what's the line at every carnival you go to the ... [laughter] I didn't know that Jackie how would you know that I take a look over there [laughter]\nIt's the it's true so so targeting information would be a good thing for everyone to do for every reason breast cancer every chronic health issue um says one thing we could at least start with\nHow long does it take to detox and how can the beat treats plus help a woman\nThat is looking to make better choices to detox and the first state getting off okay for the first days as we talked about um targets the got\nGet you off an inflammatory foods and starts to heal your guts Stefan yes definitely Wyoming clean the plumbing oh that's a good one well a step too is he talks to find the liver and that would be the electricity and stuff like that so that since you week so I Would say you know\nThat you could really get a good teacher talks in about two weeks some people might need more but um two weeks is a good amount of time for most people okay\nOkay I Will but just even coming off the toxic food it's huge costs on your body just starts to talk to the buying itself\nWe all have those capabilities but I'm a good grade a medically supervised detox is really the ultimate\nI Know of\nStress involved in the U.S fish and as well I I I was at a conference\nOne and I made a good friend there and she she was a P. A. in the ER and she worked twelve hour shifts and then she had a she had a friend she had um [noise] a a baby actually with special needs and about two months later she died of breast cancer so we're sitting there at the conference and she was like ...\nI Know why I got for us to get me to their thirties\nReally the ultimate\nI Know\nAt stress involved in our nation is well I was at a conference\nOne in ... made a good friend there and she she was the P.

Ciau who's directing the cutting a international short film festival going to be here or in a little while and that'll have about sixty Seventy and also with Bill sore dino a political indoor film festival that just\nEnded which had over I think two hundred films many of which Will Shortz will will also we ask that now you're currently\n... you wrote his you sent me a deck\nDescent I suspect it's it's a thriller right and yeah it's just us through a pitch it to the audience right now if you can for Mr well I'll do my best um tiring Rhoda\n... turned me on my the whole idea and I I'm not really that big of a Spanish or horror um lover but the whole idea behind it turned out turned me on a lot so anyway go ahead\nYeah no absolutely um I co wrote it actually which uh my wife's a Janine or Leno ah ... we started with the premise I'm probably about back in two thousand nine eight or nine when we were working on another project up in an orange New York and um\nWe pulled out onto this dark road and the fact that you just said like your garments UPS you didn't have it on your phone or whatever and it said basically just go straight eight miles and um there was no turn off there were no roads there were it was just one road and it was like two or three o'clock in the morning and it was a spooky night and all that other stuff so\nWe started having some interesting conversations as we were we were driving down that road um and you know of course you know me being a guy and uh I had a kind of said are\nOr what would you do if there was some standing on the side of the road right now like I'm a four mile mark and she's like I think you need to stop you know try to scare and then right if he's keeping up with the car you know and you know we just that's just kind of developed and developed and\nI'll tell you and I think I saw that on the twilight zone when you're like oh my event might have been a huge fan of\nTwilight zone there so I'm so we just kinda\nWould develop it and we talk about and we would but you know sometimes you start to sit down to write something and you realize I'm I don't take I I Know where I Want to go with this but I don't think I Am there yet for whatever the reason for and I had massive case a writer's block 'em and\nUh we did other projects and we work on other things but it was always there and\nWhen you live you and your wife\nAnd you know of course you know me being a guy in a I had a kind of said are or what would you do if there was someone standing on the side of the road right now like on the floor mile mark and now she's like I think you need to stop you know trying to scare me and then right if he's keeping up with the car you know and you know we just that's just kind of developed in developed an\nAll white and I think I saw that on the twilight zone when a million years out might have been might have\nBeen a huge fan of the twilight zone so I'm\nSo we just kinda would develop it and we talk about it and we would but you know sometimes you start to sit down to write something and you realize I'm I don't take I I Know where I Want to go with this but I don't think I Am there yet for whatever the reason for and I had massive case a writer's block um and\nWe did other projects and we work on other things but it was always there and\nThen when you live you and your wife yeah yeah\nAnd then she came in and she started adding some elements to it that kind of relieved that writer's block and then we sit down and we outlined it via paragraph or the whole story right um I tend to write\nA there are certain seeds I knew I definitively wanted in the story\nUm so I Would write those and those I head down without any problem but it was all the other connective tissue scandal that was kind of like All right well that's a great scene but what about everything else you know there needs to be a good story there um and I had heard this amazing interview with I think it was Roger Corman and\nAlmost got eight

I actually have to and I want to see if my guess\nAt a hundred hours was close so I Am my internal and I are Jimmy Hi my name's Fran I just want to ask you a question how won't you put into this and you said to me oh that was that was a coal read\n[laughter] you know I always I was so\nYou know what that one moment you and they'll do me\nA whole that some day I can even be even you know at fifty out where\nDo you like you're already there you are but I think we are you are you really want to address\nOn acting you know and I think a lot of people make such a big thing about acting but it could be perfectly honest and not to be flippant about it it's a lot easier than\nIt has to be you know ... yeah it it really is it's a lot easier 'cause I mean you look at your your average person acts every day as a cook except they're not doing a part of a cab or on stage or all acting at some point you know we rarely get people come out raw\nTroops pull you know we're putting out some kind of act\nSo when you let your transfer that and tap into certain emotions ballots were we were reading a temp ... um yeah as a a and actually it was it was a ... he did a couple of years ago right it's a good writer and he brought it back Ken is a great writer yeah\nI Love yeah and then I just wrote this piece about you know a guy who and that was the scene where I had to reveal that like a I think it was my kid died or my wife died I forget what you know so\nYou know certain emotional vote it doesn't take much to get there and we get there that's the problem I Wish I let yourself as a person that's yeah something like a kid dying doesn't move you\nThink I think in that case was your what your wife died and you wouldn't eating the noon you you were with your new life and you're in health care about the prior white\nSo you know we're putting out some kind of act so when you let her just you're transferred out and tap into certain emotions were we were reading ... um yeah as a a and actually it was it was a fool he did a couple of years ago right it's a good writer\nAnd he brought it back Ken is a great writer yeah love yeah and then I just\nWrote this piece about you know a guy who and that was the scene where I had to reveal that like a I think it was my kid died or my wife died I forgot but yeah so\nYou know certain emotional vote it doesn't take much to get there and we can get there that's the problem I Wish I let yourself as a person that's yeah something like a kid dying doesn't move you\nI think I think in that case was your what your wife died in you wouldn't eating the noon you you were with your new life in your\nHealth we'll get back to prior white and ah and I had to look who\nPlay my right for that reading and ... and she's a wonderful actress and a waltz was meeting with us oh sample ... plus it's yeah but it's it's ...\n... or ... one of four yellows era I was older adult to people I Know what yeah hard\nYeah really and uh and you know combat you weren't maybe on earlier but we were talking about the theme of the show that stress in crisis and stuff and just do it just seemed like that can\nBe in writing that scene that you did you hear performing at any one watch to see if they were going through some\nOr being too close when not sharing some any feelings because they were uncomfortable with it or whatever and then when he finally shared it you know you work you know when he when\nWhen you share feeling a you know and the you know being\nSo down about losing your wife and everything and then they get to salvage it between him and the the new wife you know so so uh\n... I like I tell her local Achuar say look what Billy Bob Thornton once I remember I read something he wrote an interview\nOr center interview where he goes you know a lot of actors they like to go right to the emotion and play it hard because they weren't like acrobatics how they want to show people all I can cry I can I can go there but you know both about court said very separate says don't you have to go into your hat I soon\nI I I I really hit at Rio\nWe'll great bit of advice for actors especially I have to have the chops and they can go there and they kept showing the ocean\nYou know don't don't drop it right away I took a little or something and he recently and they want like a best actor award I thought that was great I saw the film but [laughter] not to be a jerk but I was calling through the whole film\nYou know what you know what I felt I was just like our ...
