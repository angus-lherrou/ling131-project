O. export gang which may or march the coming I'm here with my charm and co host of the evening everyone we have a great show to Miami told me about this do you have to learn a lot about it we are well we have people who are part of this wonderful\nHamilton revolution that's going on right now and then later on the show we're going to have the lead from stamp of approval yes so you want to be frightened listening to that segment but right now in front of us we have two very talented people part of man I'm about to turn a society which is a story\nAnd I'm sure you're one of them in a co founders of the show name is Nicole show loading\nThe call Holly how we know that the world and we have a chapter president\nSearch Bear Stearns zero okay very good okay good shows your will get ... to contribute to this thing because\nAfter all the thousands of dollars were paying it'll be on the show that when you're when you're in your control a little bit of where we start by telling your other brother we we're big fans developed an elder\nPeople know that we have election coverage about Alexander Hamilton and tours of the reason is that works to learn a lot to do but they're called you or me or one of the founders\nYes I'll president and all the Alexander Hamilton awareness society known as a hobby for sure a lot of time on them about their handled men so we have lots of fun\nNow when did you start here uh-huh Saudi I Wish I had to Hamilton society\nThe Hudson thought he was founded in two thousand eleven and people are always curious if it was found it before the musical if it was it was okay\nSo when will Miranda learned a lot from near the well\nHe really worked a lot with Ron turnout who's the historical consulted on that and most of the musical with of course based on turnouts book but it's very impressed\nThat were mentioned earlier and you're a contributing factor a war we start by telling your ah got bubble we we are big fans of Alexander Hamilton people molds and we'd have electric serious about Alexander Hamilton and tours of the listeners and we're expecting told on them all to their butt Nicole you or me or one of the founders yes I'll read\nIt in and all ... Alexander Hamilton awareness society known as a hobby for sure a lot of ... out in the Hamilton so we have lots of fun\nNow when did you start here are hostile Saudi Alexander Hamilton society\nNow has a thought he was founded in two thousand eleven and people are always curious if it was founded before the musical so yes it was\nIt was okay to him so when I'm Around a learned a lot from that\nWell he really worked a lot with Ron turn out who the historical consultant on that and most of the musical was of course based on turnouts book but it's very impressive how much Len really delved in to research even beyond the book and so he's ... jobs\nWere forgot now how many how old is in a society now\nWe just celebrated our seventh anniversary\nSo I thought it was before the show became a rubber ... yet my use the word revolution so now okay now it's seven years later show off the charts now which\nWhich came out with people that are interested in this thing and everyone was basically just loves to show them how how how receptive has a papal bang and what you can also play the show really became popular\nOh it's been so remarkable when we first were founded we had of course the narrative that everyone now knows but\nOf course because Hamilton wasn't a part of the whole national narrative at the time you know people weren't really sure if they were ready to believe that Hamilton deserve to be what's known as one of the key founding fathers\nAnd so now that it's just really one eighty eight and we don't need to tell people really you need to learn about Hamilton use import and now everyone already notes that and we can really be there as a platform for people to learn more now that their curiosity is engaged and they truly understand how important he was to the founding of the country\nAnd so our society provides a lot of resources on our Web sites and through events and our many initiatives to help people learn even more about him\nNow what made you get interested in Hamilton before it was fashionable so it's very interesting because I actually double majored in economics and political science very Hamilton heavy subjects and I\nYou know did a pie hit three all through high school\nAnd I never learned about Hamilton and so when it first started learning about Hamilton it was just really shocking to me how she could have been celebrate from the history books throughout my education and so that really\nInspired me and ignite the passion to share that story because without understanding the whole part of what Hamilton played in the founding of the country you're really missing a key part of the narrative for us to understand how our country was founded and what it means for us today and as America\nRight now surgery on your Web of chapter president for New York say you're not going to start a oppressed by the way the multiple languages that just make a lot about four hundred by which we don't [laughter] know your strength English Spanish and Portuguese um\nGardening on the Russia and you know you're in a road I haven't been able to practice a okay are there are a little rougher now they're just I'm sure you are you getting people now who are interested in Alexander Hamilton uh awareness starting about speak a foreign language them to get involved with them at all about happened [noise]\nUh but more of the people to speak foreign languages up a very serious bringing both without having to some people who come to this country of stories and get Fox he may anybody the amount of that you can find me places like lower my happening or big ranch um\nAfter president for New York state you know your story um that were pressed by the way that I've been multiple languages that you speak about about four hundred by which is a little bit [laughter] now you're spring anguish Spanish and Portuguese um\nGardening on the Russia and you wrote I haven't been able to practice a okay are there are a little rougher now they're just on careers you are you getting people now who are interested in Alexander Hamilton uh awareness society about speak a foreign language them to get involved with them at all happened [noise]\nYes uh but more of the people that speak foreign languages that are very curious bringing both without having to some people who come to this country has stories and get fascinated by the amount of history that you come finally places like lower Manhattan or the Grinch\nUm we were very close to ... with places like a federal hauled Huntington ranch during the church and so\nWhenever we're close by fifty come into this place we always find ways to interact with people from other countries who would be for the languages quarter absolutely fascinated by by the persona of some of the comments on\nRoger rat hang out an affair with her sister in law she's from World war some ... wife when I was a large more high for years called the ... it was called ... which is a real American and Carlos from very wealthy family ... most random belt\nIn real life direction wasn't ready for children I I I think I'm Scarlett had fish tank children as accurate or\nSomething like eleven or Thirteen novel lifted maybe even Fifteen but not all lived to adult ...\nWhere we are so worried about the rumble the Hamilton at an affair with his sister in law\nWell I think one good thing to share with people that maybe you're more familiar with the musical is that\nOf course it's a fantastic scene and offend toxic song with helpless and and satisfied uh but ... already married at that time in fact living in a completely other state with her husband\nSo of course there was a great job and his aides and to sort of introduced the real life events which was that sort of flirtation correspondents or went Angelica and her husband were living over in England\nAnd so a lot of people look to that and think that perhaps there was something more there are some historians perspective of course we can never truly no one way or another but I Would just say that\nThose letters she was a ... particular she had very flirted correspondence with Thomas Jefferson route or a Hamilton also it's very ... so I think it was partly both their personality but one thing to keep in mind is that uh you know a lot\nIs that of course it's a fantastic scene and offend toxic song with helpless and and satisfied uh but ... already married at that time I was in fact living in a completely other state with her husband\nSo of course it was a great dramatization to sort of introduced the real life events which was that sort of flirtation with correspondents or when Angelica and her husband were living over in England\nAnd so a lot of people look to that and think that perhaps there was something more there are some historians perspective of course we can never truly no one way or another but I Would just say that\nThose letters she was and telecom particular she had very flirted correspondence with Thomas Jefferson running round a Hamilton also with very where do you so I think it was partly both their personality but one thing to keep in mind is that\nUh you know allies with signing these same letters that Alex was writing these flirtation comments on so if there was anything truly going on I don't think they would have\nWhen I was ... it was just a good for the Baltimore\nAnd we'll understand later on when I when I'm a parent you know he went to her and I held her hand when she was dying\nBut yeah he was very close with both Peggy and\nOne of them were your word for him yeah he he found out about ... you know one of the things when I heard about on joke on the risk town upstart men were called ... named after her yeah ... welfare\nUm ... well unless you're ... you were one of the things weren't her I'm veteran journalist service which you describe the postman transfer rich boring\nI think I've come across as well or probably more students are most of them they brushed worked ... hours it was quite dynamic this is Elizabeth or lost her do that that was really terrific are just so much food and watch them or August\nAnd I think we have the Alexander Hamilton awareness society with us and we have Nicole and surgery oh who represent the society\nUm it's to please one thing tell our listeners\nDo not get confused with the Alexander Hamilton society because if you go to the wrong website you're not going to find these wonderful information it's the Alexander Hamilton awareness society so we want to let our listeners out\nThe call I have I have a question for you might be very hard to answer okay if there was one thing you think\nHamilton did above everything else that you think it's the most important contribution they made what would you pick the thing\nTruly an impossible as I can do much and this is my non answer actually he and say\nIt's so remarkable how\n... the ... the threats of his accomplishment right because how many people do we know and I'm not talking about just that he he dabbled but that he made a lasting contribution we're a nation in economics finance government our constitution\nMilitary a few people know that he actually not only did he found the coast guard while he was secretary of treasury what today we call the coast guard\nBut he was the major general er during the ... the war and so the army and the ... it was actually re founded under his leadership the Marines as well\nOr he set so many constitutional precedence ... as a lawyer actually the first\nA blockade that went to the Supreme Court touching the constitutionality of a law Hamilton was brought in to defend right he founded a Patterson New Jersey Jersey City center that he any fact we're in now [laughter] so uh you know his his ...\nDiablo but that he made a lasting contribution to our nation in economics finance government our constitution military a few people know that he actually not only did he found the coast guard while he was secretary of treasury what today we call the coast guard\nBut he was the major general er during the ... the war and so the army and the ... it was actually re founded under his leadership the Marines as well\nOr he set so many constitutional precedence ... as a lawyer actually the first a blockade that went to the Supreme Court touching the constitutionality of a law Hamilton was brought in to defend right he founded a\nPatterson New Jersey Jersey City center that he any fact we're in now [laughter]\nSo uh you know his his influence on Wall street the creation of the button would agreement\nA you know education he actually was so instrumental in education\nForeign policy I mean I could just go on and on and I know I'm missing a lot of other things a\nLittle humid ... women women's rights human rights and I laid rounded up the first it was the Hamilton or night academy fill us on today and see a Hamilton College and it was\nA visionary concept to educate European Americans alongside with Native Americans\nAre in the same school and he also the African fruit school which was founded a under the auspices of the man you mentioned society that he was the part of New York ... yeah right who provide education to\nChildren of uh both freed enslaved African American\nOr you know which is truly remarkable when you get down into all the little details keeping in mind that all depends on what the cool on paper and commerce\nAnd in in short amount of time yeah and he died when he was forty seven bio to act like you imagine if he had lived even to his sixties which would have been kind of average or answer and they could have accomplished absolutely right\nHow do you think there's no there's a lot of stories about her molds and held in an affair with this woman Roy ... I'm I'm\nA British ... after the ... the song or a ... for ... or\nI think that the answer all you have to do is look to the fact that she spent fifty years of her widow hood devoted to her she always called him her dear Hamilton\nDevoted to his legacy uh so I you know I don't know if anyone can never truly forgive such a heart wrenching\nExperience but her love and her commitment and her loyalty and uh you know everything that she did for him I think really so I don't\nKnow what are your coach now remember [laughter] regard tours made them better than there are no I'm I'm a fan of time or whatnot but when Aaron Burr after ... after Hamilton ... a human ... refer travel time as my good friend will finish room I shot yes [laughter]\nSo worried offered more often fly lethal well okay now this is ... speculation in an okay different ... ... ... that's something\nI've thought a lot about a there was a really great\nQuote that was I recently read a book called American eaten that shared a something that he supposedly said which was a they asked him later in life if you regret it and he said uh\nHamilton crossed my path twice he brought it upon himself\nThe what they are now um I understand it tell me this is true or not but one Aaron Burr after the dorm went after Hamilton ... a human ... refer to Hamilton as my good friend of mine just Detrow\nWhom I shot yes [laughter]\nSo I always tell my husband flies lethal\nWell okay now this is purely speculation and guess okay if I Can't ... there was an accident or anything I ruined my ...\nAnd that's something I've thought a lot about a there was a really great\nQuote that was I recently read a book called American eaten that shared a something that he supposedly said which was a they asked him later in life he regretted it and he said uh\nHamilton crossed my path twice he brought it upon himself\nSo but then there's also quotes that have said that he later realized that uh the world with wide enough for both Hamilton Emmy which of course that makes it way into the musical so you know I think there's sort of arguments for both sides or whether he regretted it or not\nHamilton their sweat on his first Washington so that's an interesting question and the short condensed version is yes it was his first\nSchool where they met okay he had served ... seconds or for tools actually a very prominent to between ... and John Lauren run run or a and he had been involved in affairs of honor which was what they were referred to at the time\nUh but most affairs of honor as the case with all the other previous affairs of honor that he had before ...\nWere settled through what they have gone through letters before they ever more physical do what they what they called at the time an interview he never reached that stage so that they're required to have that yeah so that was the first interview\nWell now we have a lot of the world to us we have a lot of people from the Jewish faith ... there there are many many rumors and people just turning his back and forth back and forth to Alexander Hamilton was your worst understand and here's Miami to clarify okay mother\nI'm living in emotion Corey mhm uh marrying a man named look beyond or ... or want to know the person and they they thought he was Jewish\nBut it wasn't so festival richer was living in other areas it's I'm Sorry mark up to the ... and warm and what we've read that has ... has a mother ... mother was married to one local man not man who started\nAlmost unbearable to him was George ... converted to Judaism ... um there's that accuracy and we don't make Hamilton partially in Georgia\nSo actually Michael ... new and who is the author of Alexander Hamilton the formative years he has taken on many of those early miss it so little is actually known about Hamilton's youth especially in the Caribbean\nAnd Michael New and has really taken all of these different questions and analyze them very thoroughly\nLittle is actually known about Hamilton's used especially in the Caribbean\nAnd Michael New and has really taken all of these different questions and analyze them very thoroughly\nFor fans of the Hamilton musical the bats know him as the doctor that had deniability\nAssociate with the attending physician for the dual he was a the personal physician for both the Hamilton family and the birth family at different points so they both are approved him for being the doctor so he\nMade sure to stay hidden in the Bush so that he would actually be a witness to the south but as soon as the shots rang out he went to attend to Hamilton and ah with with him in the row boat and and attended to him and his final hours are starting to build those are to me yes he did send a bell\nA afterward or yeah that's kind of taxpayers not do as well\nYou know I'm sure there might have been many reasons for why the bill was sent and paid but what is less known is that he actually was one of those subscribers that I mentioned to that secret fined for he actually paid several hundred dollars to help allies and her family stay in the house so\nI think on the surface they still wanted to maintain a you know the propriety of paying off of what other oil deals are where some killed [laughter] no no he was a very close a friend of Hamilton and really respected him and honored him so I'm sure it was a show support\nWe only have a minute left but I ask you something about um uh there were rumors that Hamilton had an affair\nWith another man and that was one of his ruined referring stronger runs ... story going back and forth just like we have a lot of other stories relationship with them what do you think of that\nAgain is the story in the short answer is that you really can't know one way or another hundred percent uh one thing I think that gets taken out of context is the language that he uses with Lawrence\nIs very affectionate which was very common at the time period Washington also has many letter thing I Love you too close intimate friends but that's not completely out of the norm\nOr however there are certain passages in some of its letters written to John Lawrence that are completely crossed out by his family members thing I can not published it so we don't know what would that well you know there's certainly a proof for either side and I think it will remain a a great debate for people to discuss\nNicole ... search your

I'm here with my husband and co host high um and a few weeks ago we had and now the privilege of seeing a wonderful production of phantom of the opera\nNow we'll find out a little more about it is not the ... Weber version of phantom of the opera or\nIn many ways it's much nicer much more sympathetic character and we had to listen to this one just sullied to Santa Cruz face of course you never see but he's very handsome in real life I'll tell you that his name is Matthew bill men that you were you on the line\nI Am on July how are you I'm not sure how we're doing well how are you going to go to Matthew I'm just quickly tell tell us what about the this is another variation of\nFans to move the opera we all know the lung or Andrew Lloyd Webber did tell us a little bit about the difference in this one\n[laughter] yeah so this show like you said it's a bit more sympathetic you learn a lot more about the back story behind the phantom why he is the way you get a lot about his mother\nOr your co ed about some other branches of his family group of telling you that would be a plot spoiler I'm the music itself is much more operatic bleep designed it that seems somewhat ironic given the Weber is known for his rock opera\nUm but it just really is it's much more in line with classical musical theater\nShow almost an operator I'm that being said more than ... in fact that's really interesting though nowadays I think it's much more modern then you get from something like a a Camelot or a or a carousel type production um and it's really part of the kinds of great\nHow are you are where we

where most of the already has a great problems so it was a piece\nOr in the post today Martha ... yards long haul of a mess at a hospital known for exceeding expectations nurses and patients that must have fewer medical center says the real miracle\nIs that no one has tied from neglecting their overcrowded emergency rooms just assures flu season is coming they say tragedy looms for the first thing

myself a motive for your mom Tiffany already has become a model if you know like a more a a although they're succeeding a GED which is not um Sears which just not [noise]\nAnd one of the issues even when they came here to new shell to get them to really linked to the community and understand the community there and it's like trying to talk to a war [noise] and so it matters to be connected to the community it matters to list and it matters to be involved\nJust some thoughts about that and the Saudis the same people that brought to nine eleven\nThat bring you or that brought you the civilian killings in Yemen that go on now that persecute women unless you walk out of your house with a man and not only now that women get behind the wheel of a car\nThey now bring you the\nKind of like a

the ... well it happened it was just sort of kind of like an accident when the guy came in state to state and I fell\nSo uh that's unfortunate and we'll see now they're kind of saying we didn't we didn't do now the ... well it happened it was just sort of kind of like an accident when the guy came in state to state nice fell\nAn activist or less the agenda for the Democratic party [noise] they used to be a group called the in the city new democratic coalition new democratic coalition that used to harass my father because he wasn't liberal enough believe it or not [noise]\nUm most people would say uh he was a great liberal or many people would say he was too liberal but\nThere was a left to my father who complained that he was a not left\nEnough [noise] ah he would say they were professional uh liberals or professional a political people meaning that\nUh they have a valid point of view but it's a professional\nPoint of view or as opposed to a populist point of view [noise] I think that's actually exacerbated now and if I can just take another second on it you have a group of\nPolitical people who are are engaged on a daily basis for one reason or another they're running an organization with it a political reporter or blog gr\n[noise] and the communication and intensity among them is much higher that is ... Instagram and the energy they generate among themselves is much higher\nThan it has been in the past than some of them then\nBelieve that is reality uh\nIt's not reality are that's their own political reality reality is what\nAre people live day to day who aren't reading blogs because they have jobs and they're trying to make ends meet [noise] uh and uh when it came to the primary\nUh this state is the most progressive state in the United states of America\nNot because of blogger whole pines but because people know it they know that we passed the marriage\nOr ... it was a very big deal they know that I passed the gun safe the law\nThen it has been in the past than some of them then\nBelieve that is reality uh\nIt's not reality are that's their own political reality reality is what\nAre people live day to day who aren't reading blogs because they have jobs and they're trying to make ends meet [noise] uh and uh when it came to the primary\nUh this state is the most progressive state in the United states of America\nNot because of blogger whole pines but because people know it they know that we passed the marriage\nOf ... it was a very big deal they know that I passed the gun saved the law they lived that they heard that they saw the controversy [noise]\nAh they know that I raise the minimum wage to the highest in the country because to point three million people got a raise or that's how they know they see it in their paycheck\nOr they know that we have uh the best free college tuition for middle class\nFamilies in the country because they're looking at it for their child [noise] so\nUh I understand the academic attack but you're not going to tell the people in this state that I'm not a progressive because they know differently\nFor governor I Want to label you forgive me sir but are you a senator or a progressive ...\nI Am a pragmatic\nProgressive [noise] who is a definition was that bill those your father yep all of them yeah let me ask you about ... let me interrupt her first I can think about that for a second pragmatic\nProgressive now this is Mario Cuomo right the the greatest a liberal or the greatest intellectual politician pragmatic\nProgressive why an IT I hated the term by the way I used to [laughter] you know one understands without me and he was only if they're not smart enough\nTo know what it means I don't hear [laughter] pragmatic progressive\nIt almost sounded like an oxymoron but his point was you cannot be a pro grass of if you want not pragmatic there is no academic\nProgressive politics progressive ... politics happens in actuality there is no you read our goal\nProgressive politics either you made in my life better or you didn't either I have more a bread on the table or I don't\nI don't want to hear your theory and your intellectual exercise and your academic political\nAnalysis I Walk progress in my life because I needed because I'm poor because I'm a working family because I'm disabled\nBecause I'm a victim of discrimination so I Need progress so his point was\nHave to get anything done right there boil it is is about a writing a paper on it or giving a speech on it then it's easy to advocate\nFor the perfect uh but if you have to get something done as an executive or because you believe people actually need help ah and because you actually want to improve the situation that\nThen introduces the element of pragmatism so he was a pragmatic\nProgressive uh and that's what I Would call myself\nGovernor or what first of all the clock is ticking or the Democrat [noise] your party they got to pull up somebody again President Trump's first of all uh I ... for friendship\nFull of many many years is it possible to like Donald Trump President Trump and Governor Cuomo\nAnything is possible [noise] ah the can you like both a theories both philosophies ah no [noise] uh my philosophy\nMy theory of government is a diametrically opposed a this house so this president the lights in division a he thrives\nIn division it's not just that he thrives in competition or he thrives\nConfrontation he thrives in division\nUh he he looks to energize people through anger\nI Believe uh I Try to do the opposite [noise] uh I Try to appeal to people's better angels now it's much easier to appeal to fear as opposed to love\nThat I hear them knocking on doors so all the uh there were wrap this up you've given this huge ... stuff so wonderful stuff um they the book on Andrew Cuomo on governor Andrew Cuomo is that he is\nHe's ... even your credit respect a that he he's got dynamism is a he nobody knows

Boston Globe says that and I hear that day I hear it in your voice I hear it in your thoughtful comment by the held on to talk more like this\n[noise] you know bill [noise] with all due respect\nNah no with ... [noise] the it was a different time when my father gr burned they don't give you more than thirty seconds they there's no the the intelligence\nThe substance of government that theory of government the philosophy of government uh there's very little appetite for that now [noise] ah I don't want to get myself into too much trouble but\nYou know we had great reporter's back then where you could have\nA two hour conversation on an issue before they would write a story and they would think about it and research it we're in an age of blogs and tweets and frankly reporters who don't have the background\nOr or the time to develop a a really substantive piece [noise] my father was a brilliant communicator he was a brilliant intellectual\nUh uh uh but he also had that pragmatic side [noise]\nA part of it I think is a reaction to what they said about my father because they said that\nAbout my father but also remember they said ah unfairly but so much of this business is unfair but he didn't accomplish a enough right\nThe naysayers the nasty ones ah\nAnd I won't mention it all blond argument yeah so articulate right he gave a great speech but he didn't get anything done he gave a great great talker that's right he called the dumb blonde you can't say that any more but [noise]\nBut he did call it the dumb blonde singer\nLet let me ask you do you as you go for a for governor or president or whatever is in your future and for Mario Cuomo who want to be loved\nFairly but so much of this business is unfair but he didn't accomplish a enough right the naysayers the nasty ones

really it's just a single act of generosity and that is\nFresher share house it's a furniture back and it will come around and pick up gently used furniture from everybody in the county of Westchester anybody in the county west Chester\nPut it into the warehouse and then people or leafing shelters and who have been assigned housing but do not have any belong things don't have a bad habit dining room table donut shares don't have couches don't have nothing\nThey come through sort of social service agencies that are member agencies the French or share us and for Frank F. or they take home an apartments worth of furniture beds tables trainers that's lamps couches\nMake news given by the people of West Chester collected in this one location and they go around\nPeople from those social service agencies and the people need to go around with personal shoppers just like a moving to\nWhere if I went to University in the area around and a nice and they collect things that they wanted their say I'd been been delivered to them and it cost them nothing there is\nAn amazing act of charity run and operated and populated by volunteers with the exception of the truck driver and the people who do the fancy accounting that you have to do for a five oh one C. three types return required by the federal government\nSo it's all volunteer and it's great you don't pay you don't go women pay you go in with your social service agency representative and you get all this stuff\nFor free and they were going to every two years there has been a fund raiser not every year about a grainy organization it's run by volunteers\nHis ear on November second at the renaissance hotel in West ... which is right up off of the mighty land and you have read ugly or on November second there is going to be a gala image has gone up well let's see it's honoring by beautiful\nWife who learned a lot of sound dress you don't use ... founder around her and she thinks ticket that I call her help propel waiting for us now as a way to ... for some of my life anyway so I don't have a bad yeah [laughter]\nIt cleans it up anyway they're scale is honoring Kate and it's friday November second at six thirty pm it goes a couple three hours it is a fund raiser when one of the great things about perjury share hosts fundraisers as\nDesigners come to the warehouse and they pull out things that they see that might put together and they are very good will stand yes I mean not everything is good\nWriter for wired Elaine you're Brooklyn or on them for a second there is going to be a good way to go to well let's see it's annoying my youthful white\nWe hit all those sounds are is you're you don't use s anymore is founder and chief executive eye color\nOr a proponent for us know where to put words in my life and so as God [laughter]\nShe cleans up anyway they're scary is online Kate and it's friday will remember second at six thirty here goes a couple three hours at a fundraiser in one of the great things about perjury share host fundraisers\nAnd saw ... come to the warehouse and they pull out things that they see that might put together and they're going to pay and yet I mean\nNot everything is good but they may find that designer chair I bought one once or whatever you call it was auctioned\nAnd it was a very good company that in the Nineteen fifties was in ... within architectural digest and you know so they take this really good stuff and they make these little then yeah it's a little late for starting up designers and you think you're in some kind of but one of those places down there and\nHe was pretty cute actually has been yet this year but I kept telling everybody but it's not a rickety\nStuff they don't have a rickety up here to only get used to use I think that he doesn't have that well we had a flood and the mayor and they compete they were completely made it for ... when they got back to wherever they got back to everything had been flooded\nFurniture share how supplied these people with furniture if they couldn't afford it\nThen when we had the fire by the ... on Palmer avenue for the people had to move out they couldn't go back into the place but they went to other places they had nothing furniture share house gave them this is my own personal experience gave them really nice good stuff and the thing that I like about it\nIs that you go up there and you shop in this great big warehouse up by the airport so if you like such and such a lamp you have twenty five thirty fifty lamps to pick from it's not like somebody comes and says oh you poor person here some furniture and\nDrop you off it's just like you weren't shopping or if I Am assuming details as it is it's just like women feel yeah the volunteers go right back to the stuff that you're going to need to ... to ... they have to do has to man to have a couple of years ago\nAnd the furniture share host truck which they up to ... you will to get hurt and you don't pay for that the big thing here and it comes\nTo the game through the generosity of the one million people in Westchester County because Vance or people who are moving out of somebody's past on on the furniture is donated\nAnd then it is that if they were heading now they don't want this\n... stuff and at large at ... high school I don't know if it's every year they have a day like on Saturday you where you can bring your furniture and then people and donated their kids there that it'll put it in the truck to bring it back to the ...\nThe there's if people pull up with rickety moth eaten rugs and stuff that will say they won't take it altered gently used stuff and you know people like to give away chunky stuff and take tax deductions like I remember when Hillary Clinton gave away old underwear and old you sneakers and under shirts and underpants and stop until the tax deduction\nWhen she was in Arkansas we don't want that stuff so\nWe don't pick up that it's only the only two years yeah anyway there's just no fan per second quarter a team this year six thirty at the renaissance hotel we're gonna come back to this great I'm sure it's going to do a recording of a public service announcement\nWhere you can bring your furniture and then people donate at their kids there that'll put it in the truck to bring it back to the ... ... there's people pull up with rickety more eaten rugby sensed out there was that they won't take it over to gently used stuff\nAnd you know people like to give away jumped up and take tax deductions I remember when Hillary Clinton gave away old underwear and sneakers and under shirts and underpants and stop and to have a tax deduction\nActually was in Arkansas we don't want that stuff though\nWe don't we don't pick up that it's only the only two years yeah anyway this was November second according to a team this year at six thirty here at the renaissance hotel we're gonna come back to this great I'm sure it's going to do a recording of a public service announcement\nThese people showing the delusion that exists out there and these are liberals these are not even progressive ...\nYeah I can still remember the picture of all the women who worked for Clinton Madeleine Albright all these people are standing out in front of the White House or someplace saying they believe that he didn't do anything [laughter] I get I don't remember that in my mind like five or six very important people that were in the end of the same\nPeople at at the time says oh we don't care what happens in their private\nBedroom oh here it was how they govern the hypocrisy that goes with the the course of the Detroit\nTigers are finally cancelled my journal new subscription will look good\nTo live and hanging out for a while you know it was always a local news guy not that there's much of it left but they did a they did a a a recap of the Kavanaugh situation last week store and they had and they had a picture of Kavanaugh flanked on the left by Bill Cosby and on the right ... yeah\nExactly that just kinda like finished me off\nYeah well you know the the other thing that bothers me about the there's a lot of things that bugs me both girls does that does not have that dead people whose name yes they do for the postal service will actually that was\nReally eighty percent of the reason I feel\nThat there's an election for governor coming up since re weeks and you would think you would think\nThey carry some stories about it and I noticed that Iran equal notch air ... that is true Cuomo has kept a very low profile was very smart very noxious scams that aren't going to say that mowing now I Know who he is a very low profile he will get out and speak and then he ...\nHe had missed the oldest one for half an hour low Andrew with yeah we I misspelled to the special it to the contrary to miss does a Facebook page which was very interesting but he had a love fest when I'm basically because he was a good friends with this\nOf he was honest with you but I I I don't think it's highly candidate and it can be should the newspapers should be carrying ...\nEighty percent of the reason I feel\nThat there's going to listen for governor coming up in three weeks and you would think you would think\nThey carry some stories about it and I noticed that Iran equal notch ... over that Andrew Cuomo has kept a very low profile wasn't a very smart noxious Hampton aren't going to say that mowing now I Know who he is a very low profile he will get out and speak and then he loves\nThe had witnessed the oldest one for half an hour [noise] low Andrew with yeah we I misspelled it especially to the contrary to miss does a Facebook page which was very interesting but he had a love fest when I'm basically because he was a good friends with this\nLaw that wasn't your resume he's there with us but I I I don't think of him\nHighly as the candidate and it can be should the newspapers should be carrying stories about the

Y. S. U. T. dot org\nThe capital connection Hi I'm Alan ... joining us this week is New York state's Republican attorney general candidate came through for\nCurrently on leave of absence from a law firm road kind of gray in New York City\nHe's referred to as the coal managing partner of the firm's green Hungarian lawyer\nNew York office focusing on bankruptcy in creditors right\nGlad you're joining robes and gray keen Reagan was a senior figure in Beijing analyst ... structured finance group at Moody's Corporation welcome can't rule for both they lost it's great to hear from why would anybody in the world give up when you're giving up in order to run\nUp it's really important for the state where it a point where we really have to look at sharing some of our own problems internally and you know but the fact of the matter is you're not going to get that done if you have an insider trying to cure all because what we have is corruption\nBut staying driven by career politicians and you you have someone from the outside to come in and try to clean that up and look I I Do I get really because in this life I've I've had a very very lucky lucky sequence of events happened to me in this state\nAnd I really want to give something back I I grew up in Buffalo working class on the east side of child which is not a particularly nice part of buffalo and my dad worked at the plant to shut it collapse and he worked very hard we were working class just trying to get ahead as a family and\nAs a result of my parents' hard work and doing little things to it like taking me to the library on weekends and during the week we had a great public library downtown I was able to get a great education and so was my brother and I was able to go to Harvard all scholarship\nAnd that I was able to go to Harvard law school and come out and become a big tomboy in New York City and I was up all the ... my dream because of the environment I had in my parents' hard work\nAs in this life I've I've had a very very lucky lucky sequence of events happened to me in this state\nAnd I really want to give something back I I grew up in Buffalo working class on the east side of town which is not a particularly nice part of buffalo and you know my dad worked at the plant to shut it collapsed and he worked very hard we were working class just trying to get ahead as a family and\nAs a result of my parents' hard work and doing little things to it like taking me to the library on weekends and during the week we had a great public library downtown I was able to get a great education and so was my brother and I was able to go to Harvard on scholarship\nAnd that I was able to go to Harvard law school and come out and become a big tomboy or New York city and I was up all the ... my dreams because of the environment I had in my parents' hard work\nAnd some hard work on my own but that's changed a lot and working class people have difficulties in and reaching those same aspirations and so having had that benefit in New York state where\nYou know we had a private sector that created jobs back in the seventies and eighties and you had a public sector that was not perfect but was much more modest than it is today you know I see those things having disappeared and I want to try to put it back the right way and\nSo that's why I'm rather than the other thing is you you also need someone who you know doesn't need the job you know part of the problem is why you know people in politics who are looking at running for another office\nAfter they get along with the people around them have to make compromises and that's not consistent\nAt all with what the people only which they need someone to get to the bottom of what's going on with their money and get to the bottom of what's going on with this corruption because the cost of that is killing us and so look you know I I'm doing it because you know I'm someone who can do it in a way that it isn't compromised by needed to get along with the politicians\nOr whether they could not you know when you talk about the everyday steaks and the cost of this to people you know that out ways for most voters and certainly most people I've talked to\nThese issues coming out of Washington or the other thing though is that with respect to the president or anything else you know I'm an independent person and you know I\n... I contributed to block Obama\nWhen he first ran I've been trying to do other Democrats the past politically ah so you know I look at the person that I looked at the situation and I've always been\nYou know an outsider and extremely independent and you know the voters know not only that there are important state issues and critical state issues we have to deal with but they're also going to look at the person and not just say you know oh this is just that there's some political consultant says the word mini me you know they're not going to be fooled by that they\nSeem to parade a horrible we had some pretty general's office to the last three you know probably should have been\nDogs and certainly most people I've talked to these issues coming out of Washington or the other thing though is that with respect to the president or anything else you know have an independent person and you know I\nConnect I contributed to block Obama\nWhen he first ran I've been to the other Democrats the past politically ah so you know I look at the person that I looked at the situation and I've always been you\nKnow an outsider and extremely independent and you know the voters know not only that there are important state issues in critical state issues we have to deal with but they're also going to look at the person and not just say you know oh this is just that there's some political consultant says the words mini me you know they're not going to be fooled by that they've\nSeen the parade a horrible we had listened pretty general's office to over the last three you know probably should've been convicted of crimes but so the voters that enough of that\nAnd that kind of transcending partisanship ages had enough and they know the important from the states for the state and so that's what I'm hearing all over the state made you know it's not a Democrat or Republican to not want your government to steal from it is not Democrat or Republican\nTo one public service has to be delivered honestly effectively and so not withstanding you know some of the other things that are potentially going on out there what\nWe're hearing around the state is that we're going to be in a position to win because we're the only viable alternative provides what the voters shaped\nOkay so you got Michael second in running in the Green Party candidate you confront Garvey running as a libertarian but you're running as a Republican so I got to ask you this and I apologize in advance you're going to vote for Trump and Clinton dream\nYou know I don't know what I'm going to do it in ... we'll see we'll see what the record looks like you\nKnow we've had this phenomena out in many many presidential terms whether it was Obama whether even was Reagan where presidents and their first term do things and stored narrowly unpopular times during his first term and then when the voters get to look back and\nSee the full entirety of the record you know they they take a step back and and they decide what they really want to do and in many cases you\nKnow that's a reelection and medication when it's not you know and Bush one's case it was not to look back just like all the other voters in the ... the head and make a decision when we see the complete record\nNow what about the current attorney general's investigation interim President Trump and the Trump family would you could unions\nSo let's let's talk about this\nTax thing that came out I mean I I Know this is not a politician thing to do to actually ask you a question directly but I'm going to do it I\nJust actually came out from the New York times last week you know the magnitude of it is huge um\nYou know it goes back a lot of years um goes back I think they said the one that the president was three long before I was born and\nYeah I don't know what if there's anything these accuse you doing man but obviously it goes on for decades as a massive number of dollars that are implicated by it including state tax dollars and so you know look I I don't know whether it's true or false you know the New York times did their beginning but but it obviously marriage the full investigation\nAnd I would continue to investigate that are in fact I don't know if it's started yet I I hear work rumors state tax department they may be looking at things but\nThat's something of a magnitude that yeah you have to investigate it made\nYou know my my view of all this stuff is that the office was not supposed to be part of some you're supposed to apply the law\nAnd you're supposed to apply to everyone equally and so and you you know that that's something that I can pledge to do frankly that that my opponent jak credibly say\nYou know I really need to we need to follow the facts whether it leads to Donald Trump or Governor Cuomo Republicans Democrats you know corporate local politicians what happened\nAnd so you know look I I don't know whether it's true or false you know the New York times did they were digging but but it obviously marriage the full investigation and I would continue to investigate that are in fact I I don't know if it's started yet I I Do work rumors state tax department they may be looking at things but\nThat is something of a magnitude that yeah you have to investigate it made you know my my view of all this stuff is that\n... the office was not supposed to be part of some you're supposed to apply the law\nAnd you're supposed to apply to everyone equally so early and you you know that that's something that I can pledge to do frankly that that my opponent jak credibly say\nYou know I really\nNeed to we need to follow the facts whether it leads to Donald Trump or\nGovernor Cuomo Republicans Democrats you know the local politicians what have you\nUm that's what you have to deal with the office was we have to restore the credibility of the state government and we have to restore the credibility of his office and we you know the way you do it is you stopped running this thing is a is a partisan vendetta machine um and you run into something that works for the people in non biased way\nOkay let me ask you are of course African American and a greater chance of gun credible work and your life you're going to argue done all of these things for those people who pay that Donald Trump you know given the nose of racism constituency how would you pour scratch for\nPull look you know my feeling is that as an African American you develop particularly if you you try to achieve success and have some some success at achieving success that you've got to develop a pretty thick skin\nAnd so you know I I'm not a person who has a hair trigger and responding to real or perceived slight because if you if you let that stuff's distract you you're not going to get very far in life because there's always stuff that's going to be distractions and there's always going to be stuff\nThat you can attribute to racism um sometimes it is racism many times it's not and so you you you've got a\nWay the importance of what people are saying and what the actual impact of it on you and what you're trying to accomplish\nVersus you know that and sort of the the psychological slight which made the very real but but it's not important to in fact it's counterproductive to you try to get things done I mean I live I talked to charge I I sort of my kids look\nThere and I know our daughter was fortunate in the sun was eleven and then here about a lot of this in the schools right about racism and identity politics and stuff I mean it's all over the schools and I said oh look\nYou've got to focus on what you gotta do to accomplish the goals and not on what other people are thinking or saying or doing and if someone's got some view that as counterproductive\n'cause that's not enough to stay on your way if you do the right place and so that's the way I've always lived my life that's the way my parents\nTold me to approach life and you know that's the way I look at you know a lot of the things that are that are said you know either privately and publicly that but I may or may not have an issue with I just look at you know down the road one of the things you have to do to move forward and I don't get distracted by you know a lot of the rhetoric\nBut cooking environment and obviously you're going to run for attorney general of New York obviously New York like every other state in the country and has to face problems of a troubled environment where do you think\nI think we got to focus on our water at our water supply but there are a lot of issues that you know fly under the flag of environmental issues or their water ...\nProductive that's not enough to stay on your way if you do the right place and so that's the way I've always lived my life that's the way my parents told me to close allies and you know that's the way I look at you know a lot of the things that are that are said\nYou know either privately and publicly that but I may or may not have an issue with I just look at you know down the road one of the things you have to do to move forward and I don't get distracted by you know a lot of the rhetoric\nAnd the cooking environment and\nObviously you're going to run for attorney general of New York obviously in New York like every other state in the country has to face problems of the trouble of environment where do you think\nI think we got to focus on our water at our water supply but there are a lot of issues that\nYou know fly under the flag of environmental issues a fair water\nThe endangered species endangered in sex you know I'm you know development issues wetlands issues will climate change issues it it you know literally is almost everything on earth to fall under the rubric of the environment\nWhat I Want to prioritize as attorney general because I I Do think it's something that's immediate and critical\nIs we've got to prioritize dealing with our water supply typically our drinking water supply or we have a great natural resource on our northern border of the great lakes which is twenty percent of the world's fresh water supply or at least that's not caught up in polar ice caps\nAre and we have\nVery very fragile ... for his water supply downstate in Long Island I mean we have a history of\nBoth bad luck and and pollution and it's a little bit deliberate sort of an accidental everywhere in between and so as attorney general one of the things I Would focus on is trying to deal with our water supply issues because obviously the the long term and short term public health damage that will be colossal\nMarijuana when you think about that\nWell I I think that medical marijuana has been\nShown at least initially to be something that's very beneficial you know under the supervision of doctors you know you you that instances where it's been a real palliative\nAnd helped to cancer patients for undergoing incredible suffering and so you know medical marijuana should be and should continue to be legal or and and we should\nI think nationally naturally institutionalized that uh because that that avenue needs to be available to cancer patients and doctors are with with tight supervision what about recreational\nWhat they're supposed to make like racial marijuana I I'm not there yet because there are\nObviously a bunch of people who are pushing to try to legalize them to the extent that we're trying to deal with enforcement issues around too many just color I think we need to deal with those enforcement issues\nAnd make sure we're not ruining people's lives over low level offenses and putting them on a path to prison and criminality and lord knows what last opportunity but what the legalization of recreational marijuana there is a whole Pandora's box of problems that\nHaven't been discussed yet and we need to discuss those problems and deal with them before we make a decision on it\nWouldn't matter example your trip please hold on where we we have DWI\nDriving while you know high we only get hotter detected a we have the long term health care issues of\nMarijuana used we don't really know what they are\nEven though we have a Medicaid system that covers a huge percentage of New York's population so to the extent we legalize recreational marijuana and there's a long term health impact\nNot only is there going to be that human impact which has negative also going to have to pay for that you know we also have to talk about drug testing we have a multibillion dollar\nAnd last opportunity but for the legalization of recreational marijuana there is a whole ... box of problems that haven't been discussed yet and we need to discuss those problems and deal with them before we make a decision on it\nWouldn't matter example you have to please hold on where we we have DWI\nDriving while you know high we only get auto detected a we have the long term health care issues of\nMarijuana used we don't really know what they are\nYou know we

driving all high but operating cranes heavy equipment\nOr less the agenda for the Democratic party [noise] they used to be a group called the end the sea new democratic coalition new democratic coalition that used to harass my father because he wasn't liberal enough believe it or not [noise]\nUm most people would say uh he was a great liberal or many people would say he was too liberal but\nThere was a left to my father who complained that he was a not left enough [noise] ah he would say they were professional uh liberals or professional\nA political people meaning that ah they have a valid point of view but it's a professional point of view or as opposed to a populist point of view\nI think that's actually exacerbated now and if I could just take another second on it you have\nA group of political people who are are engaged on a daily basis for one reason or another they're running an organization with it\nA political reporter or blog ... and the communication and intensity among them is much higher\nThat is ... Instagram and the energy they generate among themselves is much higher than it has been in the past than some of them then believe that\nIs reality\nTo a populist point of view I think that's actually exacerbated now and if I could just take another seconds on it you have\nA group of political people who are are engaged on a daily basis for one reason or another they're running an organization with it\nA political reporter or blogger and the communication and intensity among them is much higher\nThat is ...

reality reality\nIs what are people live day to day who aren't reading blogs because they have jobs and they're trying to make ends meet [noise]\nUh and uh when it came to the primary uh this state is the most progressive\nState in the United states of America\nNot because of blogger whole pines but because people know it they know that we passed the marriage or ... it was a very big deal they know that I passed the gun saved the law they lived that they heard that they saw the controversy [noise]\nAh they know bed I raise the minimum wage to the highest in the country because to point three million people got a raise or that's how they know they see it in their paycheck\nOr they know that we have uh the best free college tuition for middle class families in the country because they're looking at it for their child [noise] so uh I understand the academic attack but\nYou're not going to tell the people in this state that I'm not a progressive\nBecause they know differently what governor I Want to label\nYou forgive me or that are you a centrist or a progressive ...\nI Am a pragmatic\nProgressive [noise] whose definition was that bill those your father yep of yeah let me ask you but let let me interrupt her first I can\nThink about that for a second pragmatic progressive now this is Mario Cuomo right the the greatest a liberal or the greatest intellectual politician\nProgressive why and I I hated the term by the way I used to [laughter] you know everyone understands without me and he would say as only if they're not smart enough\nTo know where to meetings I don't care [laughter] pragmatic progressive\nIt almost sounded like an oxymoron but his point was\nYou cannot be a pro grass of if you want to not pragmatic there is no academic progressive politics\nProgressive ... politics happens in\nAnd pragmatic progressive why an IT I hated the term by the way I used to [laughter] you know one understands without me and he would say as only if they're not smart enough\nTo know where to lose I don't hear [laughter] pragmatic progressive\nIt almost sounded like an oxymoron but his point was\nYou cannot be a pro aggressive if you want not pragmatic there is no academic progressive politics\nProgressive ... politics happens\nIn actuality there is no your radical progressive politics either you made in my life better or you didn't either I have more\nA bread on the table or I don't I don't want to hear your theory and your intellectual exercise and your academic\nPolitical\nAnalysis I Want progress in my life because I needed because I'm poor because I'm a working family because I'm disabled because I'm a victim of discrimination so I Need progress so his point was\nProgressive needs a model fire\nAnd the model fire is the word pragmatic\nNot because [noise] it is a an oxymoron or inconsistent but days as a model fire it is the practical\nProgress it is the actuality and the concrete accomplishment of the a progressive a theory that was his point and when you are an executive\nAh you realized very quickly as opposed to a legislative branch or a an academic a there is to make actual will change\nThat is much harder that it often involves compromise or it didn't ... it involves nuance it involves fashioning\nA specific solution a to a problem and it's not as easy as just old pining or pontificate ing about absolute ideal is some of the pragmatic\nTakes you to a different place we now have to get it done that means I Need to get a piece of legislation passed that means I have to talk to Republicans that means I have to talk to conservative Democrats that means\nWe're going to have to shift a little bit from the ideal because we live in the Rio and that's the pragmatic part\nA and he would voice this or in the on growing debate he had at that time with the people who were to his left\nAnd he would say look it's very easy to be a purist ideologically if you don't have to get anything done right there boil it is is about a writing a paper on it or giving a speech\nPlace we now have to get it done that means I Need to get a piece of legislation passed that means I have to talk to Republicans that means I have to talk to conservative Democrats that means\nWe're going to have to shift a little bit from the ideal because we live in the Rio and that's the pragmatic part\nA and he would voice this or in the on growing debate he had at that time with the people who were to his left\nAnd he would say look it's very easy to be a purist ideologically if you don't have to get anything done right there boil it is is about a writing a paper on it or giving a speech on it\nThen it's easy to advocate for the perfect uh but if you have to get something done as an executive or because you believe people actually need help ah and because you actually want to improve the situation that\nThen introduces the element of pragmatism so he was a pragmatic\nProgressive uh and that's what I Would call myself\nGovernor or what first of all the clock is ticking or the Democrat [noise] your party\nThey got to pull out somebody again President Trump's first of all uh I ... risk our friendship full of many many years or is it possible like Donald Trump President Trump and Governor Cuomo\nAnything is possible [noise] ah the can you like both a theories both philosophies ah no\nUh my philosophy\nMy theory of government is a diametrically opposed a this house so this president the lights in division\nOr he thrives in division it's not just that he thrives in competition or he thrives in confrontation he thrives in division\nUh he he looks to energize people through anger I Believe\nUh I Try to do the opposite [noise] uh I Try to appeal to people's better angels now it's much easier to appeal to fear\nEasier to appeal to fear as opposed to love a hate\nThat I hear them knocking on doors so all the uh there were some wrap this up you've given his youthful stuff so wonderful stuff\nAre they the book on Andrew Cuomo I'm governor Andrew Cuomo is that he's he's respected even your credit respect or that he he's got dynamism he's a he's nobody knows the levers of government\nLike Governor Cuomo he's the door a he's in the Catholic\nOr you will the son of a man called the great philosopher states one of the American ... Boston Globe and I hear that day I hear it in your voice I hear it in your thoughtful kind of why the hell do to talk more like this\n[noise] you know bill [noise] with all due respect nah now with ... [noise] the\nIt was a different time when my father gr burned they don't give you more than thirty seconds they there's no the the intelligence\nThe substance of government that theory of government the philosophy of government\nUh there's very little appetite for that now [noise] ah I don't want to get myself into too much trouble but you know we had great reporter's back then where you could have\nA two hour conversation on an issue before they\nWould write a story and they would think about it and research it we're in an age of blogs and tweets and frankly reporters who don't have the background or or the time to develop\nA a really substantive piece [noise] my father\nWas a brilliant communicator he was a brilliant intellectual\nUh uh uh but he also had that pragmatic side [noise] a part of it I think\nIs a reaction to what they said about my father because they said that about my father but also remember they said ah unfairly but so much of this business is unfair\nBut he didn't accomplish a enough\n... reporters who don't have the background or or the time to develop a a really substantive piece [noise] my father\nWas a brilliant communicator he was a brilliant

he gave a great speech but he didn't get anything done he gave a great great talker\nThat's what he calls the dumb blonde you can't say that any more but was it [noise] but he did call it the dumb blonde singer\n... let let me ask you as you go for a for governor or president or whatever is in your future and Mario Cuomo who want to be loved or they want to be respect\nBecause as I hear you today on this rainy brought some day uh you know really showing this inner ... wonderful stuff\nWhat do you want to be loved to respect\nI wanted to I Want to be loved by the people I

based on the eligible on Roman in the schools\nThat was a double game so double A. now they start their playoffs this week some of the others are starting next week so it's a hodgepodge so where I'm going to be going forward I'm not sure it depends on whether I have had that team in the past weeks of this year a timing day the week all those kinds of things so uh\nBut everything you do with all the ... now the playoff\nYeah it's a really most of the teams in our in the playoffs jockeying for position a really a big part of it is just like in the pros home field advantage or the finals are going to be a matter of fact high schools were pretty much all the time they have in there that's the first weekend in November right before election day there so\nI Do want to point out each other and do you live up in ... right a proud resident of ... but I Want to point out that number one and number two on the high school football rankings at low hard are from the great idiot their worship I see that number one is\nI own a five and our number two is never shown the great city and there are cells going one two and football\nYeah yeah well I thought I own a prep was in white plains or a

know\nYes yes yes and uh they're playing well I mean really there are ... and you know they get up to ... take care of business you know what they have they've gotten their breaks this year which you know that's a good thing to you gain momentum and then as you ... you know you get a bounty or a pick here an interception ear\nPick up a fumble all those things added up over the course of the season what's important issue they're building momentum the early games they're tough games and every week it's a tough game\nThey've won those games looked like the end of the year they had the confidence to win the next bigger game\nFor credit if you're going to do that on the street you have to put both the prices out there so I you don't have to put any price has had at the street but if you're going to put one out and you have the two tier pricing system you gotta put both out there\nAre so we followed up on a couple of planes like that so a lotta lotta as sort of a smorgasbord today we're doing some testing I guess only in quality or most people don't know that we actually checked\nIn gasoline is check you know we check it out retail we take a sample sent it to a lab is it the correct octane is the correct ethanol\nIs a flashpoint correct or how much you know all the different breakdowns are and then it's also tested at the terminal a state test it from one to before it gets on the delivery trucks so we have a pretty good handle on the quality of the gasoline and occasionally will find a failure but it's the exception to the real\nBusy busy waiting for the consumer protection the ...\nYeah not enough hours in a day job\nNow we have we have a perspective during the fields ... when John I discuss what they're doing that means we have a bunch of inspectors in the field all day long\nAre they doing the gasoline back in there today working with public works or lots of times in the grocery stores or or uh you know checking home heating oil trucks are inspectors are are basically working all day long doing inspections and make it safe for consumers\nSo be careful maybe the beach view that's a little tricky so be careful you might want to go on Google Maps and check if that hotel is really on the water\nAnd what else they wouldn't go to a hotel to be careful of\nA lot of times they have water bottles of water in the hotel and\nYou think it's very often it's not and it could be really expensive without bottled water your thought was raised four or five dollars\nAre they going to charge you for that bottled water so make sure if you're drinking the bottles of water in your hotel room that they really are free okay I'd be very careful with that so that was a few of the scams leave the hotel um\nWhen you're traveling in this day and age with all the scams of organized crime being involved in a different scams just be careful think before you act think about are the different ways people can take advantage of this whole\nHell scam I'm going around speaking

think before you act I think about are the different ways people can take advantage of this whole\nHell scam I'm going around speaking senior citizens\nAre part of my job is uh to uh publicize the office\nFirst of all what we do academic protection but number two are scams that people should be worried about particularly senior citizen I was speaking engagement day and I'm a they're very interested in gauge the audiences I enjoy talking to the senior or we have a lot of fun with it\nA lot of good question are so many of the seniors are dealing with these robocall scams all day long these calls come in all day I Know that come into my phone all day\nWe really need the leadership in Washington where we need the phone companies to kind of it or improve their own technology to block these robocalls no one's really doing anything right now to protect consumers they said and it's disappointing\nSo um\nI I I tend to frustration in Phoenix I warned the seniors when I talk to them when I go route you know have the phone most of these calls when people are calling you are scams\nOr if you don't know who's calling you and they're trying to tell you something or they're trying to take advantage of some scam just hang up don't engage them don't talk to them people get nervous about it sometimes and here's what I tell them\nIf they're posing a chase Manhattan bank holy order scam\nHang up the phone and you call it Manhattan bank and you can talk directly to them and find out um or if there really is a problem to kill\nThe IRS when they say they're calling from the IRS they're not from the IRS IRS never cause people that you pay us ten thousand dollars were they send a police officer first of all the police don't work for the IRS the police never uh worked for the Ira so so much that\nPhone scam is our ally just hang up the phone\nWhen they call up and they say oh there's a problem with your credit card hang up the phone and call your credit card\nThey call their family members stock\nWho needs money hanging off the phone and call you every member I mean this is the way we live now we have to be careful of scams all the time\nAnd the most important thing is don't engage these idiots they're calling you who are part of these scams just trying to get your credit card number your Social Security number some information as a way to hurt you and take your money so we tell the seniors I tell you on the show every week\nWhen you get robo calls with people trying to tell you something unsolicited hang up the phone I have the phone that's my advice to all of you are when you get these emails to commit that looking to sell you something elite name\nWhen the mail comes in and some someone as the sweepstakes mail where they say you've won Seventy five thousand dollars here's your first check for thirty five hundred\nA police contacted about getting the rest of your award scam it's always a scam you didn't win thirty five thousand dollars out of the blue nobody died\nSo did you get that a mailing throwing the garbage ripping up until the garbage we had someone come into office early this year they had that exact situation they had a check for about ten thousand dollars\nA said they won some big prize in a sweepstake a and he asked us if it was real that we research that of course it wasn't it was a scam and Africa demand\nAnd by well you are when you get these emails to commit they're looking at something elite the\nWhen the mail comes to someone as the sweepstakes mail where they say you've won Seventy five thousand dollars here's your first check for thirty five hundred a police contacted about getting the rest of your work\nIt's a scam it's always just get you didn't win thirty five dollars out of the blue nobody got\nSo did you get that a mailing throwing the garbage rip it up throwing the garbage we had someone come to August early this year they had that exact situation they had a check for about ten thousand dollars\nA day one big prize in a sweepstake a and he asked us if it was real so we research that of course it wasn't it was a scam and Africa demand that we could well can I just get the ten thousand dollars we said no scam\nWhat we've learned about that one in particular what are you ... you get the check station one can tell when you go to deposit it bounces and then when you boil them to stay I got this checking the mail you get I Won the sweepstakes I tried to deposited jak they say\nYou didn't read the fine print you have to give us your credit card number if you want to get all the money all this money and of course now they just stole your credit card number or sometimes they ask for Social Security there are other information it's all a scam that give you a check to get your attention to get you to give them information\nThat they can skip okay take your money alright folks added this music in the background or remember by right up the phone or an unsolicited phone calls

Olympics in Munich what ...\nWhat I did when I asked this one ... those Michael referring to the people who were burning Nike shoes are idiots one called the movie\nDid I say it or to do that it was probably me you would never say that it um [noise] because I think it's a really foolish form of protest you've already purchased the sneakers Nike doesn't care what you do with them you've already made the commercial transaction on social media and it was paying so well\nRight and I I you know and I I I was actually in my book we use the word idiot says affectionate so uh I Apologize if that came off of ... of the ... the troops\nLife and I actually can I just finished reading I'm yeah I'm a mid thought so I think that you know there was there was you need to interrogate what the consequences of a protest or are\nAnd the consequences of a protest of burning merchandise that's been purchased a surfer falls in the face because Nike within ten days time the market value had gone up six billion dollars\nA true right and then you know then there's a lot of controversy over what happens to that so I think that you know the form of protest it and I and I would bring this back\nSocial media and it was saying so what we'll do what I you know and I I I Will\nActually in my book we use the word idiot says affectionate so uh I Apologize if that came off of structure of the ... the troops\nTo Iraq when I finished actually just finished when I saw him on yeah I'm a mid thought so I think that you know there was there was you need to interrogate what the consequences of a protest or are\nThe consequences of a protest of burning merchandise that's been purchased a surfer falls in the face because Nike within ten days time the market value had gone up six billion dollars\nA true right and then you know then there's a lot of controversy over what happens to that so I think that you know the form of protest it and I and I would bring this back to John and sixty eight and a lot of people said\nDon't boycott boycott will silence you go there and do something go there and and take up the space and make a stand and so I think that wing the consequences of what the actual meaning um\nI've been out to protest is really needs to be carefully considered but it it shouldn't be a knee jerk thing\nWhere I grew I agree with that all over you know referring to someone who is exercising the light of free speech for destroying their own property is at work\nOr they're not that strong somebody else's ... what do you like ... ah with some of these protests are you know I just think it's on ... to ... those people in a blanket over arching comment does it it kind of shut down Congress search\nWell obviously 'cause you called yeah and fire dangerous any way or the other\nDo burn any just like I I you know what I'm gonna let me say that the blood worms are also you know quite dangerous recovered scenario when you're swinging around they say that I Know we're we're like oh darn ... are getting killed over there you go on a one spark yeah one right\nYeah so but one of the things that we thank you so much for calling me [laughter] that since the spark here um I just I Want to offer more [laughter] what is it so it looks let's go through some of your other book okay hum the in the Nineteen sixty eight when I Love that you know the history stuff\nUm the whole history about it is and but it's also I think I linked to make one guy I think that these are books particularly kids who don't know about what's happening historically ... fruit sport I really feel like that's a turn on well Nick either rationed\nYou know one of the things that we talk about it and this is true um you know I teach a popular culture clash and well\nIs that I think that students and and I talked to students about this a lot they work really really hard when there's a hook that they care a whole lot about\n'em and so I think that you know I think that the gateway of of creating historical context takes them out of the familiar first of All right so my popular culture clash doesn't start with now\nIt starts with the minstrel stage the first mass form of culture in the United states that are going I don't know but at least they're foundation and then it takes them a million and then by the time they get up to the familiar perhaps the hip hop artist that they listen to or what have you [noise]\n... first of All right so by popular culture clash doesn't start with now it starts with the minstrel stage the first math form of culture in the United states that aren't we all know but at least they're foundation and then it take them out of the million and then by the time they get up to a male heir perhaps the hip hop artist that they listen to or what have you [noise]\nArchive old book white fluffy enter the pay and things falling apart you sure you got no history necessarily is\nAnd that's that's that's what's so great that you put history through sports the ... the lens of sports yeah your first book in the game\nNo that's not the time but the struggles my first book um the the book about sixty eight Olympic em is my second book\nOkay so I I don't have my history correctly that no I ... into the sports in the twentieth century that's a big one\nWell that the ... of an ongoing volume one exactly [laughter] um that's the group of essays by some of my favorite writers um that I brought together and had the pleasure of working within and creating that that rarely read Tom [laughter]\nIt's not you'd send you a ... I Do not treat that book I don't even know if I have a copy of that book [noise] um\n[noise] but ... yeah I'm about him remains sandwich at the name of another book yeah\nIt's not about sports it's about WKBD boys um you know the architect of the N. double ACP of the modern civil rights movement um and it's about I I grew up about ten miles away from where he grew up and so it's about sort of those those parallel historical moments [noise]\nAnd and but that that's that's one that you probably recommend to your students because they are\nYeah I think it's a really personal book um I don't ever pot it but um [noise] what about you know more about him but but it's it's a it's a it's a lovely book it was\nThe book that I sort of got to that point of my career where I could you know kind of tell the publisher what I was going to write about rather than ask if I can read and I um I Love that I really love that book and I think that that book\nTeaches us a lot about fringe politics and the the the power of the fringe on the mainstream and I think that's something that we're living enormously right now and I I think that that book is really instructive about it\nAnd I also think and I I don't you can teach me that you think social media he puts on the fringe a bit I mean if you haven't if you were writing a blog daily weird that we're there room for your next book because you're writing is coming out\nThere yeah what does your blog turn into your next book now I mean I work out a lot of things in my blog you broke out I Know that but but [laughter] I got a lot of a gym rat

you add up all the various numbers the supervisors and so forth\nAnd I did a we're looking better than thirty thousand people who somehow some way are killed by gun violence\nMoms demand action that's the organization that ah Robin you're\nA part of an actually taking the land and roll a in a why don't you tell us about moms demand action or an incredible name I'm very powerful words um I Would suspect it's a very powerful organization\n[noise] yes it is Ralph and I am so honored actually and uh to be a part of this organization and I'd like to tell you a little bit about the history um\nIt is moms demand action for gun sense in America that it's a full name of the organization and it was started the day after the Sandy Hook elementary school tragedy which occurred in December of two thousand twelve\nShannon what a mother of five started a Facebook group with the message that all Americans can act to reduce gun violence and save lives\nIt is a nonpartisan grassroots organization with well over four million supporters in all fifty states\nAnd to me is incredible just to think that almost six years ago this organization was started by this woman on Facebook and now it reach it every single state in our country\nOne becomes money than this kind of money millions\nYet and I want to also emphasize that this is not an organization that its shots for mothers\nWe have men women we have young students\nOf all are involved in moms to a man or and moms demand action in fact we have a student group which is called students demand action and this group just started basically after the Parkland tragedy\nSo we have mother's we have father's we have a student ... we had individual who are all fighting for gun sense legislation\nWhere do you think about the the student is becoming so active obviously those the Parkland became active almost immediately or and what happened in Washington I'm just a few weeks later was\nIncredible and um you're saying that the now students demand action is a part of your overall organization um that can be nothing but positive right\nOh absolutely um it it's so encouraging and inspiring that we have these young voices out there\nBecause they all tell us they don't have the right to vote but they certainly have the right to speak out and encourage those who do have the right to vote to get out there and make a difference and vote for those candidates who are in favor of gun sense legislation\nI Am so inspired by these young people they are fantastic and we work with them in mom's demand action\nAnd we're just read\nI'm just a few weeks later was\nAbsolutely incredible and um you're saying that the now students demand action is a part of your overall organization um that can be nothing but positive right\nOh absolutely um it it's so encouraging and inspiring that we have these young voices out there\nBecause they all tell us they don't have the right to vote but they certainly have the right to speak out and encourage those who do have the right to vote to get out there and make a difference and vote for those candidates who are in favor of gun sense legislation\nI so inspired by these young people they are fantastic and we work with them in mom's demand action\nAnd we're just read the one book by one of those young people at Parkland or and I know a certain book has come out from someone else a than as a part of that whole movement and\nUh it's incredible um they're not going to be deterred by so many of the things that we as adults are often deterred by um\nIf they don't that first succeed and I keep trying and that's very very important I think moms to amend action would be the same way\nYes and also you know for them which is so tragic is that they experienced this firsthand\nAnd these young people realize the value of human life and how human life is so precious and for them to witness it happening in their own community that young lived with so much promise were put to stop\nSo they're a passion is totally understandable and that is part of the reason why I Am involved at this organization because to me life is very precious and I want to preserve it as much as I can\nNow with moms to minute action is organized\nA bite town by county by state I'm obviously you've told us the snow and a nationwide movement but um it sounds like you're involved at the Westchester county local\nUm is that the way it is organized to to make sure that you have all the local protest pressure\nIs organized on the county level in New York um it is also organized on the state level and also a mom's demand action does participate in I'm supporting federal legislation as well but each state\nHas their own organization and in fact if people are interested in finding out more about the organization and what chapters are closest to them all they need to do is go on mom's demand action dot org\nPut in your address put in your ZIP Code and the website will tell you where the quotes that chapter is to your home\nWell that's great then uh I Would suspect uh your mate often and you talk strategy and you talk actually\nThey should and what chapters are close to them all they need to do is go on mom's demand action dot org putting your address put in your ZIP Code and the Web site will tell you where the closest chapter is to your home\nWell that's great then uh I Would suspect that you made often and uh you talk strategy and then you talk actually\nWill bring about a greater degree of guns since uh wow what you just listed as the goals for the organization\nI'm my grief it's good for knowing it was a that are involved because uh uh it was to take a several hours a day ... to do all of that although they're all in a related\nTo go ahead well yes I mean that's the bottom line is that the goal is to preserve life that's the goal and I really think that you know everyone is in favor of that a license very precious so we're doing everything we can uh to\nUh get gun sense legislation enacted and protect people\nKnow you talk about loopholes and I think when for quite a bit about that you gave a couple of good examples and said right at the outset that you want to make sure the guns jumping into the hands of the wrong people tell us what you mean by Ron people\nWhat I mean by that are selling a people who have been convicted of gun violence\nI'm also I'm danger and I emphasize the word dangerous dangerous mentally ill people um those are the people that we need to protect others from domestic violence abusers\nI'm so those are the people that I'm speaking about\nA factor for really clarify that out because it's so important especially to acknowledge that are so many of us from time to time have\nA mental health challenges but when you talk about dangerous people people that have acted out where they're ... years of just made it abundantly clear that they should not have good those are the folks that you're talking about\nAbsolutely Ralph absolutely and thank you for further emphasizing that point I well you\nKnow it really is um interesting because sometimes um there is a tendency for us to say well\nProtect others from domestic violence abusers I'm so those are the people that I'm speaking about\nOh thank you for really clarifying that because it's so important especially to acknowledge that are so many of us from time to time have\nSome mental health challenges but when you talk about dangerous people people that have acted out where their behaviors of just made it abundantly clear or that they should not have guts those are the folks that you're talking about\nAbsolutely Ralph absolutely and thank you for further emphasizing that point I well you\nKnow and it really is um interesting because sometimes um there is a tendency for us to say well you know if one has a mental health challenge somehow the you know we need to sort of the strip them of all their rights and\nUm we need to recognize that the um there are peaks and valleys in most of our lives but uh you're talking about those that really are truly dangerous um you know you talk a lot about suicide as well and that seems to\nClearly the be an important goal and modest demand action I think that\nThe parents should feel very very strongly because so many young people who think maybe that is um the easy way out I'm a is um I think you mentioned something earlier but\nI'm suicides are they are are they growing especially among young people\nI don't have the facts and figures about that Ralph but it is of major concern I read in your reading the newspaper all the time about a depression in young people whether it's at the high school level at the college level\nAnd as I mentioned in the early part of the show that having access to a gun makes it so much easier\nFor a individuals to uh to kill themselves and so by just removing access to guns or they would be so much less a suicide in our country [noise] I\nCouldn't agree more and I think most of our listeners would would feel the same way and um I think what you're really highlighted is the fact that so many suicides are by gun\nA and there could be other ways that that happens but the guns seems the gun seemed to be um the choice in too many cases\nWell um I think I mentioned earlier that when a\nWhen you're are suicide by other means it's much easier to save those lives um and in fact today are in most cases saved but when a gun is used a for suicide there's not much chance\nRather I think have said something that women and I just think about um that um it's just another reason why a gun sense needs to be a front and center or in our own thinking and\nUm we're really grateful for the fact that uh there is such an organization is moms demand action and that you have such an active part of it\nAnd as we take a break a one who are just to let our listeners know that when we come back we'll be asking Robin\nIt is much easier to save those lives um and in fact they are in most cases saved but when a gun is used a for suicide there's not much chance\nRuler I think you've said something or the women and I just think about the um you know the reason why the guns since needs to be a front sooner or in our own thinking and\nUm we're really grateful for the fact that the ... is such an organization is moms demand action in the U.S such an active part of it\nAnd it was when we take a break one who are just the litter of listeners know that when we come back we'll be asking Robin price who is the Westchester county election and

we were just talking about\nThe type of exam that one would be administered if one went to her to another audiologist to check their hearing and do we have the good news to know that uh it doesn't

population it's going to be just the sensory loss of hearing\nAs we age unfortunately our sensory starts to go our eyes go in our ears going for that it would be amplification which would be carrying a answer for those more significantly impaired cochlear implants\nI'm hearing aids are designed to amplify sound that needs to be heard and reduce those sounds that are overwhelmingly loud [noise] um and obviously they need to be tuned to an individual's particular hearing test results or else they're not going to be very effective at all\n[noise] and sometimes people have a buildup of wax in the years\nWhat is good to alleviate that now I was told when I was younger to always when you get out of the shower in the morning to always take cue tips and always declaring your ears out my always have done that has always been a practice of mine\nThat I heard people say well that's not a good idea or you shouldn't put them in quite to tape you don't want to hurt the eardrum mhm what about that\nWell I have you ever heard the phrase don't stick anything in your ear smaller than your elbow\nNo but I promised I won't do it [laughter]\nAh that's that's what I normally go by so cue tips are helpful if you're just kind of cleaning water and and just the oily wax that gets around the ram but if you happen to already have a buildup of wax in your ear and you're sticking a Q tip in there it's just pushing the wax further back making it harder to get to\nAnd if it stays in there long enough and get back far enough and actually can get impacted against the eardrum and cause pain comfort ringing in the ears balance issues and of course hearing loss\nSo really the way I counsel my patients to manage that is of course if they're already seeing an audiologist I look in their ears when they come in\n'em and if I see wax in there I take it out um physicians typically will look in your ears and many of them will remove wax but if you think you have a buildup it takes two seconds to look in the air and figure that out and often in the physicians will also remove the wax\nWhere I have seen a do it yourself kits in a drugstore\nOr of wax removal in other words you can take a an instrument and and put water I suppose in a ... year that would then remove the ... good to do on your own or better to see a doctor for that\nIt depends on the kind of whack they usually recommend seeing a doctor how ever I often will recommend to my patients if I Know they kind of routinely get built up some there's an over the counter product\nUm one's called ... but there are several others and basically you're putting oil in the ear and it doesn't take the wax out in another itself but what it does is it will soften the wax that then they're so that it can come out on its own and sometimes they'll give a little suction bowl that you can use to kind of coax the wax out at the ear\nYeah very very interesting um when I was younger when I was a kid I had a believe it or not I had in the middle of the night a little spider go in my ear now how is it that happened I don't know but it went in there I happened to be staying with my grandparents at the time it was during the summer\nAnd I was here in New York and I was staying with them for a ...\nRona better to see a doctor for that\nIt depends on the kind of whack they usually recommend seeing a doctor how ever I often will recommend to my patients if I Know they kind of routinely get built up some there's been over the counter product\nUm one's called Deb rocks but there are several others and basically you're putting oil in the ear and it doesn't take the wax out in of itself but what it does is it will soften the wax that then they're so that it can come out on its own and sometimes they'll give a little suction bowl that you can use to kind of coax the wax out of the year\nYou know very very interesting um when I was younger when I was a kid I had a believe it or not I had in the middle of the night a little spider go in my ear now how is it that happened I don't know but it went in there I happened to be staying with my grandparents of the time it was during the summer\nAnd I was here in New York and I was staying with them for a couple of weeks and uh\nAll of a sudden I felt something going around in my ... year old boy and I said I Wonder what that is well I went in and I knocked on my grandparents and my grandmother came out to be in the bathroom pulled my ear back then the little spider came walking out now what happens if something like that happens to have you ever heard of something like that for example\nI actually have pulled out a lot of interesting things out of ear canal um bugs tend to be one of those things I'm it's not so common but I've definitely seen it before I'm\nOne gentleman I saw I was looking in his ears this is many years ago and\nI couldn't tell what I was looking at there was something vaguely pink but it was embedded in some wax and there were like three little they looked like balls in there\nAt the time I was a student so I called my supervisor over and she said well I don't know what that is but let's get it out of their um it turns out this gentleman like doing the crossword puzzle and when he was thinking about an answer he would stick the pencil in his ear\n... and she had three little racers that broke off of the pencils stuck in his ear and that's probably my favorite thing I've ever pulled out of an era before your race or so in general you want to keep things away from the ear canal don't stick anything in there and you can't help it if a bug obviously crowds in there but you would definitely feel that it's not very comfortable\nThere not at all no and I I was a little bit worried about it but thank goodness as soon as she pulled back a poll here low down the uh\nThe spider presence of mind enough to come on out\nHe probably didn't enjoy it in there so much I\nWell I don't blame them because uh I wouldn't want to be stuck in my ear either but anyway uh we have another caller so we want to go to the phone lines now once again and welcome our next caller and ah where are you calling from and what is your

I Know you're saying well that's great\nNot the way my life is what I heard every other word\nSomeone would ask ask that question and I give a different answer you know I thought I heard something else so please don't be afraid to do this and I'm so glad to talk a little bit about when he went on that because you know I came in starting a new job and I think that you had to they were very interesting about getting to know your patients\nGuys [laughter] I'm not calling for it out [laughter] we're waiting for somebody to but we're glad you do\n[laughter] a doctor ... I just want to ask you one thing that I've been using a I'm On a Monday Ninety eight I think you think a cotton swab the apple re ... as they're very likely into my ear mhm it set a date or by the show concern\nYou know if you are just going very lightly into the ear I'd say probably just fine especially if your ears are already clear um you don't want to go in deep because that can cause problems but if you're just kind of going around the room to get the water out after you bathe or something like that I think you're okay what what what did you say [laughter]\nWhat was so [laughter]

interesting call there and of course the ... the question about care to come up a couple of times and uh\nAnd I'm Glad you're able to give some answers on that because people don't know sometimes we'll\nIf they should put something in their ear to claim it out or not there is a very sensitive areas it is it is especially the inner part of the year and so you don't want to do anything would harm it or they would do anything like that so uh\nUh it's it's a wonderful wonderful thing to be aware of it I think what Cindy said too I I'm coming back to that because uh\nThe fact that you want to have good hearing for the safety mhm for your own safety and the safety of those around you that's something I never think about\n[noise] it's not something that tends to be on people's radar is but it's hugely important and actually\nI'm the national Council on aging or did a survey of older adults with hearing loss and as well as their family members\nAnd asked what are some of the side effects of untreated hearing loss in one of those lifted side effects that came up most often was a fear and paranoia and a lot of the kind of reasons why we are because they were afraid that if there was an intruder in their home or if an alarm went off or if they've gotten important phone call they'd miss it like that's huge\nUm there are people who are still hearing impaired that when they don't wear their hearing aids they really cannot functionally here\nAnd for those individuals in in terms of home safety that has huge implications so they actually have devices that will like alarms that you can put under your pillow that will vibrate and if something happened the same thing with door belt that you can connect to and and things like that that help for those individuals who are significantly are severely hearing impaired yet\nIn a few years ago I went to an audiologist and I told him I said I've got a ringing in my ear what do I do and he said don't answer it [laughter] but now what what do you do for example if you have ... years a lot of people had Rand years and they don't know what to do it's very annoying to them and they don't know what it is\nYeah ringing in the IRS is it something that we call tinnitus or tonight is um it's pronounced either way we said tended is because I just implies did they use and it's not really a disease but basically it's it's towns that are not coming from an external source than\nMost often described as ringing but it can also be described as cricket roaring a static kind of noise I had one gentleman tell me he heard the star Spangled Banner and as the um and and essentially it's just sound that's not coming from anything external and it can be very alarming it can be annoying\nI'm often it's associated with high frequency hearing loss but not always there are other things that can cause that\nAh the treatment can vary depending on how much\nBringing him ... years a lot of people have ... years and they don't know what to do it's very annoying to them and they don't know what it is yeah\nRinging in the IRS is it something that we call tinnitus or tonight is um it's pronounced either way we said tended is because I just implies disease and it's not really a disease but basically it's a town that are not coming from an external stores than\nMost often described as ringing but it can also be described as cricket

could that be an indication of hearing issues in the future I Wonder\n[noise] not necessarily um usually that happens I'm because children especially daycare age are exposed to a lot of germs all at once I'm at school age children as well and and what those tubes do when you have fluid built up behind that eardrum it essentially keeps the eardrum from moving\nHelpfully and keep sound from getting into the inner ear um they actually don't put the tubes in to release the fluid although that does happen it's really to equalize the pressure on either side of the drums that fluid doesn't build up

Party candidate for governor in New York we've got a five candidates out there\nRunning and of course I Andrew Cuomo and mark on our of the major ones\nUh let me ask you this in terms of the anecdote I open the show is I've heard from more than one person that I was talking about one in particular about Republicans who are disaffected with more bone marrow going to you that they're looking for a safe harbor and alternative are you hearing that at all you hearing from Republicans that they are unhappy with more narrow\nAll over the place is look there are to walk away movements that the Democrat what we're looking for people who don't like Cuomo and initially they all ran to the next it which makes sense because they just didn't want to crumble but they feel like the Democrats and they want to follow their party they rush off an exit\nBut now when Nixon was on I'm seeing a bunch of them blow to both me and how we ...\nThat flow into both those people who are much more stronger left tend to go to ... how we all could who tends to be far more or less than I Am and\nThen the miners any hang on those as well I Would note\nSome yes but she's also very localized because she used to be the mayor of a series of hers is much more localized I'm Talking statewide\nRather localized global correct a lot more locally it meaning searches but when you go across the state not as much more people know myself and how we hope and her so state wide you find that and the other thing you find as Republicans to coming to me like Republicans don't\n... all over the place is a good look there are to walk away movements as a Democrat what we're looking for people who don't like well and initially they all ran to the next it which makes sense because they just didn't want to call but they feel like the Democrats and they want to follow their party and a rash of the nation\nBut now when Nixon was on I'm seeing a bunch of them float above me and how we ...\nTheir flow in both those people who are much more stronger left tend to go to ... how we can to tends to be far more or less than I Am\nAnd then the miners any of those as well I Would note\nSome yes but she's also very localized because she used to be the mayor of a search and hers was much more localized I'm Talking statewide rather localized global you're correct a lot more to her locally in meeting searches but when you go across the state not as much more people know myself and how healthy than her so statewide you find that\nAnd the other thing you find as Republicans to coming to me by Republicans don't have anyone else they realize the conservative party sold them down the river by taking him and then Republicans body had anything and sixteen years I said is all the time the Democratic party has run to stay for sixteen years the Republicans have not won a statewide election period governor governor anything senator nothing\nIn sixteen years for the Democrats are going to fix the state they would have the Republicans have watched this happened where's their plan\nWhere's their movement zero they got nothing I've been doing it for one year at a one year I have plans if you don't like my plans awesome helped me fix them I'm open but at least I have plants I'm ... the right direction the opposite the the other option besides my clients\nIs nothing is that is a constant state of the K they were in with over a hundred thousand New Yorkers leading every single year that show option that all my plans to have the best part I'm OK being well I'm In you know what I put your name on a quote what\nIf you got the right plan a put your name on it will fix it I Am about making change\nI don't have a clear to protect I don't have pro needs to pay back I just want to make it better than you are I don't want to move my state is dying around me and I don't want to move and I will fix it I Will go out of money to do it it's what I've been doing a business\nThat's who I Am so yes people who are unhappy with the Republican establishment the actual Republicans are going why wouldn't I go this guy and he's about local as Asian\nAbout letting me do what I feel is appropriate he's about not letting one city run the entire state he respects the counties are counties and reaches a region at West of New York is not Long Island and instead of ... is not New York city in southern tier is knocked off country I get that I've covered this state I get it but not just that I go round the state\nTalking to people ... one of one I just have a conversation\nI don't have just town halls I have I'm sitting in a diner let's talk\nThat's how I figured out how to fix these problems I didn't know about corrections officers so they told me I didn't know about teachers told me I didn't know about family coffee and so broken until they told me I didn't know about these things that people walked up and said why we come up with a plan to fix it and I said yes\nAnd now I have plans to fix all these things and now the boys will be hurt his most important ... park right\nIf you're white and I can't win but said you're white and I kept went okay great I got it what if what if the Republican comes in second nothing changes that's what's been happening for sixteen years but imagine if I come and just sat out of it when I come in second you're going to want me on your show every other week saying wow how'd you do it live or where you are right\nEvery where you have a shot since shock waves throughout the state or something like that could happen to question about it was hilarious or

it's probably the most high rep governments in modern times in New York guy even amongst his own fellow Democrats is known as a bully and a liar yet he enjoys it appears not\nOnly a lecturer will support but the support of many institutions business\nIf you're white and I can't win but said you're right and I care what okay great I got it what if what if the Republican comes in second nothing changes that's what's been happening for sixteen years but imagine if I can just set out of it when I come in second you're going to want me on your show every other week saying wow how'd you do it live anywhere you are right\nEvery way they have a shot it doesn't shock waves throughout the state or something like that could happen to question about it is or running at a time let me ask you about a conundrum for a great many people out there why do you think Andrew Cuomo appears to be as popular\nAs he is I mean his record is shameful and many many ways it's probably the most high rep governments in modern times in New York guy even amongst his own fellow Democrats is known as a bully and a liar yet he enjoys it appears not\nOnly a lecturer will support but the support of many institutions business groups newspaper editorial pages they stay with them even though all these problems are well known what do you make of that\nYes you're correct everything he said it till they're ... air to issues Rwanda is the only one is you have to think it's fair one day fear him personally he has been dictating everyone I Know I met tons of ... across the state one thing's come and they all feel him someone once said to me he's like what the heck even become the boss\nSomeone told me is this is the actual politician who by the way it was a Democrat who told me that [noise] so yes they all the in the Republican or Democrat but the second thing is the average Democrat\n[laughter] he was Republicans there and fight the average Republican feeders Democrats and the and the state is two and a half to one Democrat to Republican so they all the or the other this is why I have a shot I'm not the other\nI'm not the other I'm oh what's this guy and people are like well if you're a Democrat or Republican if you're a Republican you don't want to vote for Democrats we've been killing each other for Thirty years or not the other one I so evil\nWhile I'm neither of those two things so guess what you might take me that's why I protected victory another of the other which in this case and the Democratic state if the Republicans and that's why he talked about putting Trump all the time he throws up here look sixty Seventy percent of New Yorkers don't even vote you've just given up\nWhere we don't really have any chance that all all his majesty wants to do is make sure his based shows up if his based shows up he wins that's why not debating its wider to answer the questions that's why I didn't have the events\nIf his based shows up with the jet fuel to fire with fear he wins the problem is the Republican at the same thing he even with the fire with the or you didn't have an answer is not positive about fixing things and he thinks he's going to win you care when you're out gotten two and a half to one even Republican base shows up he loses\nIt doesn't matter we got around Larry Shockley appreciate your joining us this morning appreciate your being willing to participate

let's return to focus on the state capital\nI was just looking outline of some of the continuing fallout Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts DNA\nTest results released yesterday talk about a disaster is a public relations fiasco it sure was that and that certainly isn't helping or just see a representative of the Cherokee Indian nations saying that the war and should apologize\nNot exactly what she wants to just quickly is a good editorial in the New York post today here's one thing Governor Cuomo and mayor de Blasio having conned for their fat cat donors and they'll keep insisting it's all just a big coincidence says the latest case concerns again\nCrystal run health care already under federal investigation over four hundred thousand dollars and possibly illegal donations to Cuomo's campaign and whether they're linked to a pay to play scheme\nBut uh during my father's time there was always a an activist or less the agenda for the Democratic party [noise] they used to be a group called the end the sea new democratic coalition\nNew democratic coalition that used to harass my father because he wasn't liberal enough believe it or not [noise] um most people would say uh he was a great liberal or many people would say he was too liberal but\nThere was a left to my father who complained that he was a\nNot left enough [noise] ah he would say they were professional uh liberals or professional a political people meaning that ah\nThey have a valid point of view but it's a professional point of view or as opposed to a populist point of view I think that's actually exacerbated now and if I could just take another second on it you have\nA group of political people who\nAre are engaged on a daily basis for one reason or another they're running an organization with it\nA political reporter or blogger and the communication and intensity among them is much higher\nThat is ... Instagram and the energy they generate among themselves is much higher than it has been in the past than some of them then believe that\nIs reality or it's not reality are that's their own political reality reality\nIs what are people live day to day who aren't reading blogs\nBecause they have jobs and they're trying to make ends meet [noise]\nUh and uh when it came to the primary uh this state is the most progressive state in the United states of America not because of blogger whole pines but because people know it they know that we passed marriage or ...\nThe Graham and the energy they generate among themselves is much higher than it has been in the past than some of them then believe that\nIs reality uh it's not reality are that's their own political reality reality\nIs what are people live day to day who aren't reading blogs because they have jobs and they're trying to make ends meet [noise] uh and uh when it came to the primary\nUh this state is the most progressive\nState in the United states of America not because of blogger whole pines but because people know it they know that we passed the marriage or ... it was a very big deal\nThey know that I passed the gun safe the law they lived that they heard it they saw the controversy [noise]\nAh they know that I raise the minimum wage to the highest in the country because to point three million people got a raise or that's how they know they see it in their paycheck\nOr they know that we have uh the best to free college tuition for middle class families in the country because they're looking at it for their child [noise] so uh I understand the academic attack but\nYou're not going to tell the people in this state that I'm not a progressive because they know differently\nWhat governor I Want to label you forgive me ... that are you a centrist or of progress ...\nAm a pragmatic\nProgressive [noise] whose definition was that bill those your father yep of yeah let me ask you but let's let me interrupt her first I can\nThink about that for a second pragmatic progressive now this is Mario Cuomo right the the greatest a liberal or the greatest intellectual politician pragmatic\nProgressive why an IT I hated the term by the way I used to [laughter] you know one understands without me and he would say as only if they're not smart enough to know where it means\nI don't care [laughter] pragmatic progressive\nIt almost sounded like an oxymoron but his point was\nYou cannot be a pro aggressive if you want not pragmatic there is no academic progressive politics\nProgressive ... politics happens\nIn actuality there is no theoretical progressive politics either you made in my life better or you didn't\nEither I have more a bread on the table or I don't I don't want to hear your theory and your intellectual exercise and your academic\nPolitical analysis I Want progress in my life because I Need it because I'm poor because I'm a working family because I'm disabled because I'm a victim\nIf you want not pragmatic there is no academic progressive politics\nProgressive ... politics happens\nIn actuality there is no theoretical progressive politics either you made in my life better or you didn't\nEither I have more a bread on the table or I don't I don't want to hear your theory and your intellectual exercise and your academic\nPolitical\nAnalysis I Want progress in my life because I Need it because I'm poor because I'm a working family because I'm disabled because I'm a victim of discrimination so I Need progress so his point was\nProgressive needs a model fire\nAnd the model fire is the word pragmatic\nNot because [noise] it is a an oxymoron or inconsistent but did as a model fire it is the practical\nProgress it is the actuality and the concrete accomplishment of the progress of a theory\nThat was his point and when you are an executive\nAh you realized very quickly as opposed to a legislative branch or\nA an academic a there is to make actual will change\nThat is much harder bad it often involves compromise or it didn't it involves nuance it involves fashioning a specific solution or to a problem\nAnd it's not as easy as just old pining or pontificate ing about absolute ideal of some of the pragmatic\nTakes you to a different place we now have to get it done that means I Need to get a piece of legislation passed that means I have to talk to Republicans that means I have to talk to conservative Democrats that means we're going to have to shift a little bit from the ideal\nBecause we live in the Rio and that's the pragmatic part\nA and he would voice this uh in the on growing debate he had at that time with the people who were to his left and he would say look it's very easy to be a\nPurist ideologically if you don't have to get anything done right there boil it is is about a writing a paper on it or giving a speech on it then it's easy to advocate\nFor the perfect uh but if you have to get something done as an executive or because you believe people actually need help ah and because you actually want to improve the situation that\nThen introduces the element of pragmatism so he was a pragmatic\nProgressive uh and that's what I Would call myself\nGovernor or what first of all uh\nVery uh easy to be a purist ideologically if you don't have to get anything done right there boil it is is about a writing a paper on it or giving a speech on it then it's easy to advocate\nFor the perfect uh but if you have to get something done as an executive or because you believe people actually need help ah and because you actually want to improve the situation that\nThen introduces the element of pragmatism so he was a pragmatic\nProgressive uh and that's what I Would call myself\nGovernor or what first of all the clock is ticking\nOr the Democrat [noise] your party\nThey got a hold of somebody again President Trump's first of all uh I ... risk our friendship of many many years uh is it possible like Donald Trump President Trump and Governor Cuomo\nIs possible [noise] ah the can you like both a theories both philosophies ah no uh\nMy philosophy my theory of government is a diametrically opposed a this house so this president the lights in division a he thrives\nIn division it's not just that he thrives in competition or he thrives\nIn confrontation he thrives in division uh he he looks to energize people through anger I Believe\nUh I Try to do the opposite [noise] uh I Try to appeal to people's better angels now it's much easier to appeal to fear as opposed to love\nThat I hear them knocking on doors so all the a very brief and wrap this up you've given his youthful stuff so wonderful stuff\nUm they the book on Andrew Cuomo on governor Andrew Cuomo is that he is he's respected even your credit respect uh\nThat I hear the knocking on doors so all the a very religious and wrap this up you've given his youthful buff so wonderful stuff um they the book on Andrew Cuomo I'm governor Andrew Cuomo is that he is\nHe's respected even your credit respect or that he he's got dynamism is a he nobody knows the levers of government\nLike Governor Cuomo he's the door a he's in the Catholic\nOr you will the son of a man they called the great philosopher states because of the American ... Boston Globe says that and I hear that day I hear your voice I hear it in your thoughtful\nCome as why the hell do to talk more like this [noise] you know bill [noise] with all due stuff man now with ... [noise] the\nIt was a different time when my father gr burned they don't give you more than thirty seconds they there's no the the intelligence\nThe substance of government that theory of government the philosophy of government\nUh there's very little appetite for that now [noise] ah I don't want to get myself into too much trouble but you know we had great reporter's back then where you could have\nA two hour conversation on an issue before they would write a story and they would think about it and research it we're in an age of blogs and tweets and\nFrankly reporters who don't have the background or or the time to develop a a really substantive piece [noise] my father\nWas a brilliant communicator he was a brilliant intellectual\nUh uh uh but he also had that pragmatic side [noise]\nA part of it I think is a reaction to what they said about my father because they said that about my father but also remember they said uh unfairly but so much of this business is unfair\nBut he didn't accomplish a enough right\nThe naysayers the nasty ones\nUh and I won't mention it all blond argument yeah so articulate right he gave a great speech but\nHe didn't get anything done he gave a great great talker that's right he called the dumb blonde you can't say that any more but [noise] but he did call it the dumb blonde singer ...\nLet let me ask you do you as you go for a for governor or president\nSaid that about my father but also remember they said uh on ... but so much of this business is unfair but he didn't accomplish a enough right\nThe naysayers the the nasty ones\nUh and I\nWon't ... yeah so a lot to do it right he gave a great speech but you didn't get anything done you gave a great great talker\nThat's what he called the the dumb blonde you can't say that it'd be before but it was it [noise] but he did call it the dumb blonde singer ... let me ask you you as you go for\nA for governor or president\nOr whatever's in your future and do more global want to be loved or they want to be ... because his oh I hear you today on this rainy drugs so that was a huge huge huge enough really showing\nThis is a real wonderful stuff would you want to be loved to respect\nOr wanting to go I Want to be loved by the people I respect\n[noise]\nSome really give you the final word so we're very grateful to\nYou or your father's song you're good to talk to my brother bill thank you [laughter]\nThe most powerful fire\nIn Rio extreme one woman only local four teams are we we are [laughter] nobody re R B stream or a road show\nMeans they believe\n[noise]\n[laughter]\n[noise]\n\n\n[noise]\nI'm\nSure hormone happy days yes I'm here with Lisa ... you know taking your questions and also talking about our\nHealth three sixty five which is our amazing chemistry we have Dr John Kerry here on the line just going to tell us all about the main thing blood work high Siobhan how are you happy his day\nHappy Tuesday Hi Jackie Hi Lisa\nHi how are you\nI'm doing really well very looking excited looking forward to talking about this blood panel which we've um recently started at at um our balance strange plus center [laughter] so um yeah I guess but\nCan you know one diver I did worry revolutionary isn't it\nIt really is because it is they customize comprehensive blood test and if we're talking about menopause here yeah we're talking about hormones obviously a hormone imbalances\nWe need to really dig deep to isolate what is going on with each individual person and it's not just your run of the mill ABC or the listeners out there don't know what that means\nHappy Tuesday Hi Jackie Hi Lisa Hi how are you I'm doing really well very looking excited looking forward to\nTalking about this blood panel which we've um recently started at a um our balance reach plus center [laughter] so um yeah I guess what\nCan you know one diver I didn't really revolutionary isn't it\nIt really is because it is they customize comprehensive blood test and if we're talking about mental pause here you know we're talking about hormones obviously a hormone imbalances\nWe need to really dig deep to\nIsolate what is going on with each individual person and it's not just your run of the mill CBC or the listeners out there don't know what that means you know comprehensive I'm a complete blood count or your kidney function liver function we're going really um\nDeep here and looking at lots of hormone levels different hormones that that a lot of a doctor's conventionally don't test for\nAs well as even going you know to to genetic mutations and looking at why this individual is not losing the weight or or they're having the symptoms that really brought them to the door at our center\nWhen I think it's so important today is that\nYears ago you would just have a very general approach to health and today it's more important that we become our own health advocate so if you ask questions you get answers us better questions you get better answer when I think it's so remarkable it's almost like we have to finally realized we are\nThe future we're living in the future right now when you look at Star Trek\nAnd really looking within in many ways we have this very specific information with the help we sixty five so as you said it measures in analyzing the broad panel bio\nUm chemicals as well as the DNA cheddar genetic marker so with this information how ... how does that help the individual or what adjustments can you\nAssess based on that information\nRight okay well I I guess I could start with the white hormones are we testing not just the just throwing the ones that our listeners out there know about or a history Gen and for gesture own so we're also looking at a hormone such as cortisol stress hormone cortisol which makes you hold on to fat\nThere is a left and leptin is a a a buzz word right now I don't know if a lot of people have heard about it but it is another hormone out that is created I'm from your fat cells\nAnd it tells you and your full um it supposed to tell your brain actually you know to stop eating I have enough fat cells in my body\nBut we're finding that some women are left in resistant yeah kind of like diabetes in a way you know so much sugar and insulin as major body resistant to 'em and filling in itself so leptin resistance is something that we're finding a lot and and women that are in the uh\nUnable to lose weight so we find that third levels would be really high\nUp so that's that's an example and um [noise] you know of a growing is another one it's a hunger hormones so you you know ... years of yo yo dieting starvation stressing yourself out can make that ghrelin really really growl I guess\nYou'd say [laughter] I'm like are great I mean the only one that was like rambling [laughter] and then they look like round the ground and\nI think it's a great name for a the hunger hormone if\nIt really is [noise] yeah so so you know it'll\nThe the you know real yo dieting um makes a makes it even harder so that's why we\nSugar and insulin as major body resistant to 'em and filling in itself so leptin resistance is something that we're finding a lot and and women that are in the uh unable to lose weight so we'd find a third levels would be really high\nAh so that's that's an example and um [noise] you know growing is another one it's a hunger hormones so you you know ... years of yo yo dieting starvation stressing yourself out can make that ghrelin really really growl I guess\nYou'd say [laughter] I'm like are great I mean in Greenland rattling and they look like we're on the ground and\nI think it's a great name for a the hunger hormone if it really is [noise]\nYeah so so you know it'll it the big you know real yo dieting um makes a makes it even harder so that's why we say you know it it's not about dieting here you know it's and it's not your fault it's the hormone third they're out of whack from years of\nDoing the wrong thing we can really find out what what what have you been doing wrong and how can we fix that vow\nWell that's a great point and it's not just yo yo dieting but even yoyo exercising from the perspective of fitness which is my background many women are on again off again and that can also affect lung capacity the Mac\nUm circulation energy flexibility very often we are super excited and go gung ho and and we want immediate results so we start to quickly with and are too aggressive and that's not good to similar to\n[laughter]\n\n\n\n\n[laughter]\nJak I'm here with the\nFab Leno back to serve on illegal and we're talking about [noise] our\nHealth reasons he by [laughter]\nOkay so Lisa\nIf there's something I'm yeah I'm just really excited that I'm part of this incredible team because it's always been a dream to really address the body from the outside in in the inside out and I'm anchored in the fitness side of it but believe it or not when a client comes to me and she has her\nOut three sixty five and she has her blood panel she has more information and I can literally see a trajectory of the energy what we use and fitness as we call it the her perceived exertion so it's not happenstance that her perceived exertion changes [noise]\nI'm here with police have Leno to shove on daily and we're talking about [noise] our\nHealth reasons he by [laughter]\nOkay so Lisa\nIf there's something I'm yeah I'm just really excited that I'm part of this incredible team because it's always been a dream to really address the body from the outside in in the inside out and I'm anchored in the fitness side of it but believe it or not when a client comes to me and she has her\nOut three sixty five and she has her blood panel she has more information and I can literally see a trajectory of the energy what we use and fitness as we call it the her perceived exertion so it's not happenstance that her perceived exertion changes\nMeaning she's less fatigue even if the workout is progressing things change training and as we know just a perfect example how important it is for Perry menopausal and menopausal women to use light weights and begin to use heavier weights\nFor bones and very of course bone density but at the same time we're making a qualified risk or adjustment in her exercise prescription so factoring this information it's important of course in her entire program but I'm using it to from myself okay\nYou know it was exciting yeah I don't know of any fitness place any fitness trainer any shame any anything\nThat actually factors some of the blood work and for their work that well it is rare\nThe very small pretended and I don't want to brag but I'm so fortunate I Know you and\nTo bond Dr Kelly but it uh it's coming down the pipeline medical fitness it's undeniable so it's unfortunate I'm not going to name any generic weight loss programs and diets that are out there but calories in calories out and counting points and very old millennium so it's silly that here we are with\nEquipment like a cell phone we can talk to are rich like Star Trek but yet here we have this\nBan on this information so it's time to use the technology and apply it to this entire wellness ... right and that is this integrated approach illness Leah yes well the way that companies [laughter] I'm In\nGenetic like there is even genes out there correct we saw um that that will pinpoint um what kind of exercise works for one type of person I was a part for another I think that's dominated\nUp all the I think some people do really well with high intensity interval training and some people do need to have the more more slow relax type of exercise and also there are there's ... genes out there that tell you I'm about dietary um recommendations for you know\nI mean it's endless and we're really hitting new age when it comes to this uh to to weight loss to health it's amazing\nAid to the hormone [laughter] okay I'm Sorry I just sometimes I can control my okay but we have really great questions and this question is for you Jackie O. O. um when I have my blood panel done and complete how long does it take to get balance\nOh which balance if we were ... ...\nYeah that's a rough question because it just depends where you're at everyone's different right Dr Kelly you can't really say that with any\nCertain shape but I Would say about three months to see some change at six\nWeeks to three months because it affects the cycle ever read was outright somewhere around there you're not going to see major changes in a couple of weeks right like what I learned about weight loss it's about that feeling of they mean and balancing right out one of my bouncing when it takes a little while\nEach of the hormone [laughter] okay I'm Sorry I just sometimes I Can't control my [laughter] okay but we have really great questions and this question is for you Jackie O. um when I have my blood panel ton and complete how long does it take to get balance\nOh which balance of we referring you yeah that's a rough question because it just depends where you're at everyone's different right Dr Kelly you can't really say that with any\nCertainty but I Would say about three months to see some changes six weeks to three months because it affects the cycle of a red blood cell right somewhere around there you're not going to see major changes in a couple of weeks right like\nI learned about weight loss it's about that feeling of balancing right up one of my bouncing but it takes a little while but but that's not to say you are not\nGetting positive changes all the way through like you're feeling better constantly like every day you're feeling a little bit better but it takes a while for for all of that balance out and that's been my experience so anywhere from six to\nEight to twelve weeks three months would probably be the ... when you say for that generally speaking\nA stream of three months you're right and the the the cycle of the the red blood cell um that's that's a good ... [laughter]\nYeah so so yeah I Know you buy but again people are going to be feeling benefits especially if you are um you know really take them to the plan as far as what you're eating you're going to be having positive benefits all the way through oh\nYeah and I mean just just the elimination of alcohol and people are sleeping better their their skin feel better and it's bad I think is almost immediate\nImmediate wait yeah that's definitely within the first week like I had people come back and say okay so this week I felt less floated more energy enough snoring at night and I'm sleeping patterns that's all in one week come on wow that's amazing signed me up [laughter]\nAnd affect everything you know when you're sleeping better at your more you know you work out better you know it just everything every immediately um and that but I think that immediate to benefit just helps patients go on the ... the right to stay on the right track\nOh you know once you start seeing results then it's like if they're smuggled a ball rolling happy right\nI had because it's an interesting story I had um apply it and I was so happy that I had an intern sitting in with me the first appointment because the second appointment neither of us recognized her oh it was so incredible how um she like her whole face this puppy when she first came\nAnd then the second ... which was\nI think it was two weeks later actually might have only been a week later she walked all that puff in her face she was I didn't even know it was her when I went in the waiting room that's how that's how remarkable it can be\nAnd then so of course felt better more energy happier and all of that but it's it's it's it's really it's it's it's quite a game changer\nWhole plan he's the one thing I have to say just addressing women because there is a target which was so important is that we generally have a very high threshold\nFor pain oh you're in the range so that it is that neglect along the way that very often these stress hormones or the stress symptoms we just sort of repress them handle more take on more would ourselves lie\nThan all the that's the typical scenario it's changing because we're starting the conversation that's why that show was so important\nThat the oxygen mask scenario if we're all need a job\nHe's he's she was I didn't even know it was her when I went in the waiting room that's how that's how remarkable it can be\nAnd then so of course felt better more energy happier and all of that but it's it's it's it's really it's quite a game changer\nThe whole plant ... thing I have to say just addressing women because there is a target and which is so important is that we generally have a very high threshold\nFor pain oh you're in the range so that it is that neglect along the way that very often these stress hormones good stress symptoms we just sort of repress them handle more take on more with ourselves last\nNight and all that the typical scenario it's changing because we're starting the conversation that's why it's so important\nThat the oxygen mask scenario if we're all need to have any\nTop guys are taking care of yeah I Know flight attendant [laughter] putting their oxygen tank on yourself before your loved one but our natural instinct is to help everybody ... yeah yeah and I guess the moral of the story is if your hormones are unbalanced nevermind Ansari balance your hormones it's been put\nMy big fat Greek wedding where everything comes from the root cause it's been interesting comes I'm ... that was very good job of laughter is the best [laughter] oh I Love 'em and\nSay that about women as yeah with the ... when you were asking for about a typical panel you know the is the court is all is well like you'll find that they'll be at the end of the spectrum where the cortisol is now and failure like in the in the\n... actually I shouldn't I guess we we live in this stress like super mom age and so we um [noise] you know the\nUm adrenal fatigue comes after the point where we see sky high court is always\nThere which is a different um a presentation so you see a lot of women that have gone through the whole phase of the quarter is all being extra elevated in our and adrenal failure regional fatigue I'd say sorry failure sounds like you need to be I mean I Do [laughter]\nFriends out in\nThe adrenal fatigue and um it's yeah we we wait until the last minute you know it's like we're expected to feel this way yeah I'm being super model working doing it all\nGoing at all but that's all going to change we are I got it is that what we hear this about a heart attacks were how these how women also it's the silent killer yeah women are often surprised when they hear that\nA heart attack more women die of that than cancer one of the number one killer so for the same reason that we say oh I have a headache or they ignore\nNumbness are paying the same concept or that's applied to the symptoms for a heart attack we tend to ignore some of these underlying sin yeah them of an imbalance hormones and let me just add that that can affect yeah they've hard work will actually have your life yeah because it does pinpoint\nBig big cardiac risk\nLike come on a stain yep Mm and some of the like oh that that is the same I remember ... but also some of the inflammatory markers and some of the life of proteins\nThat um are very um big cardiac risk factors so you know it's it's not just the hormones it's everything else it's a really great screening test oh is\nThe way they do your life yeah because it does pinpoint big big cardiac risk\nLike come on in Dane yup and some of the way that that is the same and the ... but also some of the inflammatory markers and some of the life of proteins\nThat um are very um bake cardiac risk factors so you know it it's not just the hormones it's everything else it's a really great screening tests\nWhich can block you from reaching your true potential and keep you backwards while the rest of the world continues to move forward\nHere say bail when I was young I remember that raised a story with my father\nI think I was in grade six or seven yeah this is a long time ago I did not remember exactly which grade but I was younger and I came from school and I had at ... yeah and I was happy okay because before I\nSee ours is the study and I had ... and I was happy and I came I was so happy and I rushed\nTo my dad and I told him that I got beat you know what happened what happened to my dad or look at me he smiling and he did not it did not release this word I was expecting this word ... ... ...\nIt did not say congratulations and that was way to do war day that he would leave this word to me ... it did not\nKnow what happened what happened to
