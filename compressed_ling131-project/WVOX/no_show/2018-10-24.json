the seventies when Saudi Arabia knows where it's kind of cut us off\nSo if we wish to be a strong power able to stand up in the face of brutality like occurred with this guy Chris ...\nAnd and make a statement to the world of vicious who we are we better be able to back it up unless of course we want for a dollar a gallon gas again five dollar a gallon and losing your license plates to get gas like it used to\nBe you remember that meant a lot of people listening you know you and I are older critters a lot of people don't remember how horrible that was\nYou know I I remember you know almost getting into a fist fight with a guy who tried to steal gas out of my parked cars on the way I also like I've been on you know I'm not I'm not that kind of a\n... so I'm just glad the guy but you know these are the kind of the things we're strolling sure to to to flex its muscle which we were late to do\nThe consequences of course the policy of a deal with Saudi Arabia and that region of the world is a different matter\nBut I just felt I bring that up because we're about to close Indian point\nWe're going to for this but when you hear that rather ridiculous ed from Con Ed where it starts with consultation with state\nOh yeah you know I'm just trying to figure out\nWhat the debate with all these crawl which state 'cause he's the one that knew about the deal\nSeems odd doesn't it yeah I remember that\nYou know so I just hope I get to choose game but we better be careful as to what we do because it showed Libya's says okay guys or turn off the ... the west\nThey have a heart attack ads up\nYeah if you like and then ... and another problem that that creates and this is why people need to be you know the president ham handed you need to give the president slack here because we don't do it in Europe dependent on oil they're going to look to the east and play into the hands of the rush right now\nThat's that's a very good point and of course\nOne of the difficulties are so many European countries uh businesses are so tied into that part of the war for oil\nBut it makes it difficult for them to really stay on the river us if we do something no I haven't heard much and we'll be maybe I missed it but I haven't heard much coming from some of these European countries as to what they proposed to do about the murder of his journal egos of an American citizen\nKnow who he

lowering of working journalists like this especially in a car ...\nAnd then Neal nation you know let me get Jimmy ... response\nYou know what I Want to do you react as one of the things that troubles me about when I said it to a on acquaintance with Americans today that\nIf you're going to do black ops if you're going to do these horrible things get away with it when they because they created problems\nRight but he did live here now in Virginia he was in fact I think Virginia you'll forgive me if I'm wrong on that uh but he was in fact a a he was fleeing he was protecting himself he was a

you know let me get Jimmy ... response Christmas but\nYou know what I wanted to react or what is one of the things that troubles me about this and what I said it to a an acquaintance yesterday is that\nIf you're going to do black ops if you're going to do these horrible things please get away with it was that day she because they created problems for their outline they created a huge problem

give a press conference brothers and stuff so very interesting stuff [noise]\nAnd that kind of generic testing and also the kinds of genetic testing that\nColleges are doing it leading to all kinds of

a lot\nAnd we don't do a lot of these any more we can listen to them but this is the kind of think that this affect a lot of people but I my girlfriend at the gift of the um ancestor dot com branch history dot com I guess it is today and yes I did find a plus or relatives reached out to me\nThat I did not know what we're talking you first car and brothers and stuff so very interesting stuff [laughter]\nAnd that kind of generic testing and also the kinds of genetic testing that\nThe colleges are doing he's leading to all kinds of things what do you do if you find out you have a genetic disposition towards breast cancer or genetic disposition to some old losing perhaps you can also reach us is Dr Gail Vance she's a member of the College of American pathologist and go we've got some questions for Dr good morning [noise]\nHey how are you pretty good doctor what are the downsides to doing this when I was very careful with the information that I got because I wouldn't want to go break up families but they found me and what about if I found out that maybe I have a predisposition to our drivers should or should we go for traveling to the\nDoctor you there yeah I'm here you hear me yes one of the possible downsides to this\nWell what you should do everything on the side to do this direct to consumer testing is understand what the test will and will tell you because as you said you did ancestry dot com there are other companies that do more than ancestry\nThey'll talk to you about your hair color your eye color your body weight but they're also also companies that talks about how far is that just you just mentioned uh your previous position to cancer\nOr Parkinson's disease et cetera\nIt's important again to know what you want to know what you don't want to know if you don't want to know about Parkinson's disease then don't take the test they do want to know about your relatives well then that's okay\nNo go ahead I'm Sorry\nYeah I was just all the other thing that's really really important is that you understand that the test is being done in a laboratory that it's clear certified or CAP College of American pathologist accredited\nThen you can be assured that test that's being done accurately and fall of the requirements that by law\nBut I'm Glad you brought that up because one of the issues in this day and age is privacy how how do I know my results aren't being shown to wrap to drug company or someone else\nWell that's a great concern of the ... again it's really important to know what company is and what are the standards that that company follows so the government has set standards for what these companies the information that companies are released\nBut you need it thoroughly over search the Web site for which you're spending your sample for DNA Analysis to understand what they will and they won't release to either insurance companies or for research\nWow this is really important to how do we ensure that\nI you know what she's saying they're sampling here at the mercy of the ... so you want to make sure beforehand that you understand what's going to happen with your test result you can call the company and talk to her representative of the company alternatively you can call me\nI'm I'm a pathologist in a geneticist than I can talk to you about what the stats what the risk for these tests are as well as the benefits\nAnd he follows so the government had set standards for what these companies the information that companies are released but you need this thoroughly research the website for which you're spending your sample for DNA Analysis to understand what they will and they won't release to either insurance companies\nOr for research\nWow this is really important to how do we ensure that\nWell I you know once you send your sample in here at the mercy of the ... so you want to make sure beforehand that you understand what's going to happen with your test result you can call the company and talked to a representative of the company alternatively you could call me\nI'm I'm a pathologist and the geneticists than I can talk to about what the stats what the risk for these tests are as well as the benefits and the other thing that I can do for you because I couldn't chirping this test results in the context of your own family history on your own medical history\nYou know I wanted to add to that Dr Gail Vance is professor of cancer genetics in Indiana University school of medicine and professor of their doctor there are people and this is going to the moon medical uses it now we find out they have the cancer gene and perhaps go for a double mastectomy and knows what he said\nAnd I was not being tongue in cheek when I started my own daughter I'm going to have Alzheimer's and maybe I should in my life earlier and make my plans earlier is creating huge ethical issues is not\nThat it really is it puts the patient\nAh really takes them off guard because again I don't think they fully understand what they're getting into by sending their DNA\nBut the most important thing is if you get a test result that's related to health such as what you're talking about with Alzheimer's\nOr with cancer they you need to come and see me you need to come and see a professional and again I understand that test result fully that test result for Alzheimer's disease maybe only one predispositions to all high risk to remember that you also have a lifestyle\nAnd you also have environmental factors so you have to put the test results\nIn the context of you\nKnow dark during the year at a meeting of the caller just American pathologist what are they saying about\nWell the the College of America pathologist is an advocate for patients says for patients testing and they're also saying again that you should have that test results done\nIn a laboratory that you know that that test result is going to be accurate because there have been reports that some of the test results that come out of these laboratories are not accurate\nThe other important aspect is to have this interpreted properly so no doubt a positive test as a positive test and a negative test is negative test and what that means for you\nKnow you know the way we are the American Medical Association and very very colleges are decisions that the a P your organization trying to get some sort of an approval process we're company will be able to say that we were approved by the CAP would you like to see that happen\nAssociation and very various colleges of physicians is the the a P your organization trying to get some sort of an approval process where a company will be able to say that were approved by the CAP would you like to see that happen\nUm and you wrote a piece of the other day that we saw about the committee set up to investigate this season even doing a very good job isn't\n... the U.S postal service is overseeing our board of governors and there's nine members of the board of governors and thus far vacancies on the board and\nThree of the poor people who are current members are paid management which I think is ridiculous because there's no oversight of the postal service so I've written to our senators and members of Congress urged them to\nHold congressional hearings I'm conducting investigation because I Do think this is\nTotally absurd and this is not the first time male has been thrown in the garbage or something would you know I was Google and get a cut up and go all over the country\nIt it does happen all over the country but uh as you know all politics is local and you've made it a a cause here it's very disappointing and you know I\nI I think I mentioned to you and I mentioned to another caller earlier I did a little test then I sent a piece of mail to a veteran\nOf this out in Queens but the point is it's a veteran home for disabled veterans and their buddies very also nursery home as well [noise]\nIt took three weeks to get from news show\nI walked in there\nAnd you were lucky because they got it\nWell yes but he did these people are telling us that I spoke to someone the other veterans yeah they don't get their mail frequently and and they rely sometimes they get money from home they can get some home they get food from home all the unacceptable but please keep it up what else is going on in I'm In the\nLast week after I spoke to you have a really great news so I'm the town I'm One of the lawsuit relating to the drawing the corporation yes the television or the state Supreme Court ruled that petition or that was filed was invalid did not comply with the statutes of\nNew York so the people who are supporting the corporation now how to a\nQuarter or pale or or or start over but I was really pleased because a lot of people have criticized me for um\nYou know my decision in ... and I told people that you know I look at myself as a judge and you know I was basing my decision not on my personal opinion of incorporation\nAll the unacceptable but please keep it up what else is going on in um enroll\nTheir next week after I spoke to you and we had really great news on the town I'm One of the lawsuit

... historic lows with unemployment and and\nAnd so these are are you are you a historic I I mean\nWe have seven and a half million jobs mostly in agriculture in trapping that I'm feeling\nSo you're

the burden of actually running\nA Sunni village and having to come together with people to get the job done I'm trying to come together and solve problems so are the same party which is the serve

choice\nYou throw your about your vote away if you vote for the same party because at least you have some options because last night you had two guys in a slug fest between Andrew Cuomo and milk more narrow now as you said the governor was a bully and I thought he came off as a bully\nUh kinda condescending and combative with mark ball now and I think that was his strategy I think his strategy was the way not debate and be tanked chicken when I'm trying to run for president or\nBring out more narrow and take my shots at at his party and Donald Trump set myself up for down the line or running

Trump\nPotentially leading to violence of course taking as to what the actual real violence that we've seen some real people from the left\nBut let's see how this plays out but I like her friends out there who have an open mind to stay well wait a minute or is there a possibility this year or a nice little charade so everybody can harassed the Trump people\nAnd and make Trump look more ridiculous I'm watching CNN and then they're running with the ball of course we don't know who has done this yet and we may never know but I just offer that as a thought [noise]\nAll right thank you and I you know I I mean we're talking about feeling I chatted about us off the air you know let's think back to a march of last year there were a number of uh uh synagogues and a Jewish community centers um which are received threats of violence bomb threats\nAnd India and uh and and there is a lot of concern that there were was a rise in anti Semitism that we were seeing\nSort of come come you know be manifest and and and in fact that ended up coming from a young Jewish man in Israel so\nI'm dismissed direction please certainly exists at this point we don't know clearly the common denominator here amongst these lawmakers is their party affiliation and their prominence in that party\nUm CNN is obviously been targeted the president a at every turn\nSo um you know it it's just you can't draw any conclusions so you know who where they're coming from that's what I understood and and I will say that Hillary Clinton was careful to only sang to Secret Service in their opening statements are in the press a briefing that that took place a twelve forty five in New York City\nBoth a governor and the mayor or in their opening statements were careful to um to talk only about law enforcement and the fact that\nI'm In general we can't let the um and and that's that is in the air Bruce Lee or to to affect us they didn't assigned blame and I think that that's everybody's being cognizant of the fact that we just don't know where these well that's\nTrue except it was interesting that Cuomo use certain pronouns and and describing this uh these incidents where he did refer you refer to them and day\nBeen a target of the president a at every turn\nSo um you know there it it just you can't draw any conclusions until you know who where they're coming from that writers and and I will say that Hillary Clinton was careful to only thanks to Secret Service in their opening statements are in the press a briefing that that took place a twelve forty five in New York City\nBoth a governor and the mayor or in their opening statements were careful to um to talk only about law enforcement and the fact that\nI'm In general we can't let the um animal that is in the air broccoli or to to affect us they didn't assigned blame and I think that that's everybody's being cognizant of the fact we just don't know where these\nWell that's true except that it was interesting that Cuomo use certain pronouns and and and writing this uh these incidents where he did refer you refer to\nThem and they and the ease\nAs if there is a plural or you know a a a a a\nPlural group of people out there that did this he doesn't know that you know I mean he was careful you're right he was careful not to describe any political leaning or you know who was or whatever\nBut he did put in a kind of they the right eye because he can't help it that he has to he has to you know\nPart of the bad pun blow it up into something bigger than just one lone craves the Unabomber type character yeah you know who might just be a living you know it might be just that guy living in the Trump basement right [laughter] I I\nI unlike thanks I Am confident that they're going to get to the bottom of this uh it's it's ... so it seems like you know the the same\nBut they don't want to they don't want to say something that's going to come back and haunt them white or similar to what you said and what is that right is it is to [laughter] to say oh these are right\nWing or using their trouble he put right right so anyway we'll we'll see I I Do think they'll get to the bottom of it I think that it was probably more than one person just because of the number of them that have been received since starting with Soros yesterday\nThat the most of them are in New York and ... wasn't was one in a hotel Panthers were in DC okay um and um we've got Kamala Harris now yeah and so I doubt Wasserman Schultz in Florida Florida maybe okay so I\nI it seems to me like this might be coordinated but I'm the fact that a half a dozen or more of these devices have now been are sent through the mail and not one of them has gone off\nYeah indicates to me that it was either not seriously intended to hurt somebody or it was done by somebody that is so amateur or that you know they couldn't even you know get generally close to achieving a the horrible a goal that they had in mind so it doesn't mean\nIt is a strange at certain though you know the target the targets in this case Debbie Wasserman Schultz and and they have in the head of the party more\nAnd another one of the devices that was sent to someone else was made to look like it was sent from Debbie Wasserman Schultz so in the you know who knows it it's going to be interesting how this all plays out but you know fill you did a whole show on this last week right I'm On the notion of you know\nWhat I refer to as kind of the digital a battle ground a of a social media that the nastiness threats that exists there are indeed a veiled um threats of violence that or\nEven the head of the party anymore right and another one of the devices that was sent to someone else\nWas made to look like it was from Debbie Wasserman Schultz so you know who knows it it's going to be interesting how this all plays out but you know do you do the whole show on this last week right I'm On the notion of you know\nWhat I refer to as kind of the digital a battle ground a of a social media that the nastiness rats that exist their right to be a very old I'm a ... foot violence that or are encouraging people to\nA river consolation prize [laughter] I Love to go out it's a it's a only three hundred million I'm not going to do Powerball yeah [laughter] it\nWouldn't bother to pick up a dime off the off the ground\nWell it it it is fun it's a cultural sort of a something that brings to the community together you know I stopped in my local to get a a cheeseburger and uh of course the guys were talking about it and uh everyone does the same thing\nThey pull their ticket out of their pocket or don't bother got one I got a winning one I I used to have one myself but uh yeah it it is a good time in in my opinion it does get people talking about a\nSort of a shared experience that is not a politics and the negative\nBut it's really true thought the onslaught you know if you if you you know start going if you run down the street saying I Want to one\nThat you can pretty much count on never having a piece of the night of sleep again right and so they advise people to immediately get a trust in a state lawyer [laughter] whomever one who's still with millionaires in the past\nYou know if you don't want to go to you know you don't want to go to a you know what I was ... Willie right down the street he chases ambulances you got to get a real lawyer\nAnd what they do is they set up like a a an almost like an L. L. C. so that when\nAnd you get out of town and they set this up right right and then what they do is they handle all the ... all the um you know all the costs they handle all the demands for money right so you don't have to read\nAnd it becomes sort of like they become sort of like your spokes person yeah it's interesting that'd be fun job [laughter] easy money take a little slice of that yeah I Know [laughter] this thing 'cause nothing comes free now way man I kind of expertise forget it yeah yeah uh\nA dollar and a dream a uh um well so I I\nWould like to return to the news of the day we don't have the volume up but um we're seeing you know uh the crawl or as they call it the info bars some time or third\nOr whatever you want to call it in t._v. parlance which has the information at the bottom to screen John Brennan the former CIA director uh also received a package now they're showing a picture of it and it looks like a flashlight with a garage door opener in some duct tape\nIt looks like a W field ... microphone ... [laughter]\nBack away from the microphone guy\nI've done more damage on WB elects microphone\n[laughter] easy money take a little slice of that yeah I Know [laughter] this thing 'cause nothing comes free now way man I kind of expertise forget it yeah yeah uh well big dollar and a dream a uh um well so I I\nWould like to return to the news of the day we don't have the volume up but um we're seeing you know uh the crawl or as they call it the info bars sometime or lower third\nOr whatever you want to call it in TB parlance which is the information at the bottom to screen John Brennan the former CIA director uh also received a package\nNow they're showing a picture of it and it looks like a flashlight with a garage door opener and some duct tape it looks like a W the election microphone ... [laughter] back away from the microphone guy well I've done more damage on WB elects microphone then this entire collection of ISIS has but\nIt it really to me it it it it looks very uh like it was meant to piss scarier and there's probably some gunpowder and then I'm sure but um\nWell they senator Brennan because he's a um he's a commentator contributor to CNN [noise] right right so\nThere's a Trump and the whole goal vocal critic of Donald Trump right right and um and then it was fair of CNN of course he's not there anymore but um so it was one centering clay on that is well he rented brand I thought he was still or maybe as yeah okay I don't know if you look at her I don't know\nBut but we'll find out I'm sure during the day I'm you know but felt you know like we said that um is this something that\nYou know when you have energy when you have forced behind something a momentum behind something like what we see in ... you know behind the hate speech and the veiled threats to the passive aggressive or you know a sort of famous towards um violence that we've been seeing now\nFrom a lot of uh you know a high level people from the president to Hillary Clinton to to Michael Steele I'm ... I'm Sorry to Eric Holder or not Michael Steele Eric Holder and so you know we we see\nYou know the momentum behind this yeah you know how do you slow it down and stop it you know because I think they were you know that this is this is something that was completely predictable in fact you pretty much predicted that a week or two ago yeah\nWell I mean first of all I'm I have to agree with the Blasio the mayor who said this too shall pass these things come and go in American history we had a history\nOf this kind of political violence um Cuomo's said today that uh you know we New York or you know was was uh he uh he implied that the first of these kinds of terroristic acts which for Nineteen Ninety three first attempt on the world Trade Center\nBut in truth this goes back you know I mean it goes back a lot further than that I mean it was a a real long period of time and the turn of the century or the anarchist movement in the country\nWhere radical leftists where I'm planting bombs at homes and I'm In the ... and then in the mail but they were bombing\nSuffer mostly bankers and rich sort of Wall Street fat cats and this was on the first gilded age you know when uh the rich guys were being targeted but they went after other people too and it was amazing to kill a lot of people too I mean there was a lot of people that were that were murdered by this ah\nCrazy bombs stuff that went on back then the famous one was in New York City where they blew up a big chunk of Wall Street and I I don't know what you're Nineteen Nineteen somebody out there might now that the Google News but uh if you take a a a a if you go down to Wall Street\nA real long period of time at the turn of the century or the anarchist movement in the country where radical left us we're I'm planting bombs at homes and I'm In the ... not in the mail but they were bombing\n... mostly bankers and rich or Wall Street fat cats and this was the first gilded age you know when uh the rich guys were being targeted but they went after other people too and it was amazing to kill a lot of people too I mean there was a lot of people that were that were murdered by this\nCrazy bomb stuff that went on back then the famous one was the New York city where they blew up a big chunk of Wall Street ...

place yesterday afternoon that WCBS and New York city were too\nHow should I put it client so called moderators and I'm a a nasty and this that I think for a lot of people to watch it and not that many people watch that may have come as a surprise it's long been known in Albany\nThat Andrew Cuomo styles to try to kill an opponent and it was certainly on full display yesterday last night at this one debate apparently it's going to be the only debate regrettably me to see if I can play an excerpt from another\nPart of it which gives people which will give people a sense of the tone which was an ugly tone that's for sure\nTo get its going here\nAnd I've worked with Democrats and Republicans for seven years I paid seven budget sometime in a row that hasn't happened since governor Nelson\nRight All right that's that's the law is not past seven budgets in a row that have been on time but I think the last one was what ten days later but let's keep going\nTyler I have no problem working with Democrats and Republicans I Do have a problem with what my opponent represents and it's happening in Washington these extreme conservative the victim of people\nThe way I I just the climbers been using this thing not just the last couple of years but if you go back to twenty eleven and twenty twelve\nOn my radio show and other places Cuomo started calling people extreme conservatives and you would call Republicans who agreed with him but just to say the Senate Republicans moderate so if you agreed with him you were a mom\nAnd if I worked for Democrats or Republicans for seven years I spent seven function sometime in a row that hasn't happened since governor Nelson\nRight All right that that's the law is not past seven budgets in a row that have been on time but I think the last one was what ten days later but let's keep going\nFeller I have no problem working with Democrats and Republicans I Do have a problem with my opponent represents and is happening in Washington these extreme conservative to Vince of people\nBy the way I anti just the climbers been using this thing not just the last couple of years but if you go back to twenty eleven and twenty twelve\nOn my radio show and in other places Cuomo started calling people extreme conservatives\nAnd he would call Republicans who agreed with him but just to say the Senate Republicans moderate so if you agreed with him you were a moderate if you were critical of and you are a conservative to the point where as we know several years ago he declared that conservatives had no place in New York\nIs a little bit more time New York and it's just not true to say I support half of the soul bill but not the increase on the New York times I didn't know she was the second most important fat\nAnd that was a crime I was serving as moderator overall like Marcia Kramer the long time she goes back to the seventies I think what it seventies WCBS and before that newspaper reporter Marshall Kramer\nWho looked like she was almost um well not quite in love but a enamored by Andrew Cuomo who she kept referring to as governor\nBut I'm more narrow had no chance to respond and Cuomo completely deflected the main point of Marshall Kramer's question um which is the taxes really are out of control um I ... a narrow one or two engage on the issue of ethics\nAnd this institution Jay ...\nI was there in Albany when the governor negotiated this ridiculous\nComplicated compromise with Shelley silver a and set up the system where there really is no ethics review of the legislature in New York almost should've stood his ground back then\nAnd uh it it but none of these issues Scott aired out there ... there were no winners in this debate and the biggest loser was the electorate of New York state there there really needs to be a system of gubernatorial debates in New York\nIt could it shouldn't be enshrined in law somehow it's that can be done and uh I I Hope the newspapers in upstate New York will just pound on a Andrew Cuomo to show up\nI was there in Albany when the governor negotiated this ridiculous\nComplicated compromise with Sheldon Silver or and set up the system where there really is no ethics review of the legislature in New York almost should have stood his ground back then\nAnd uh it it but none of these issues got aired out there ... there were no winners in this debate and the biggest loser was the electorate of New York state there there really needs to be a system of gubernatorial debates in New York\nIt it could it shouldn't be enshrined in law some how it can be done and uh I I Hope the newspapers in upstate New York will just pound on a Andrew Cuomo to show up for the league of women voters debate this coming in Albany um\nWhat next week and a demand that you show up\nHow'd you like it was a friday and slip about liking to duck ... acted ducked questions and to avoid questions I mean nobody really calls the modern mile an hour on the list that you should have come right by right back with it and said thank you for your candor governor\n[noise] he should've um\nI don't know what's gonna happen in your election but I'm at the average ... I guess is going to win and uh if I were back there in New York I think I Would be casting my vote for mark now mole and narrow reluctantly because there's really not much no other choice see how the candidates\nAre not going to perform and um uh it's amazing looking at the polling numbers your governors somewhere around fifty percent and uh uh Cynthia Nixon is actually still alive\nUgly to command maybe ten percent of the votes but she's also now it's going to be a watered down mess\nNixon is not on the ballot any longer for the working families party she got off it\nI didn't know that\nVery good so so that's kind of health Cuomo that's why I was working families party did it because I'm sure they've gotten something in exchange for Stephanie minor is still there and there are two other candidates as well for libertarian and the Green Party\nWho gardeners some votes where did you think a coma presenting himself and mowing arrow talked about being\nRaised as a kid in a household that receive food stamps Cuomo presented himself as just an average guy from queens I mean this is a guy who was born he said he wasn't born on third day she was born with a silver spoon out that's how he was born he's always had advantages because of who is father Mario Cuomo was\nNo absolutely he's living off his father's name [noise]\nUm I I Hope I don't understand why so many people in the Democratic party in New York tolerate it it's his personal style and if anyone want anyone watching that debate got a taste of what it's like for any journalist\nTo add or work on this story that might challenge the governor or something is administration is doing I mean I'm sure you've gotten the phone calls I got them when I was in Albany and there was a screaming Andrew Cuomo\nF bombing on the other end of the phone line you you just don't want someone in that position who behave that way who treats people that way on a personal level\nThe answer to that I was going to say about a hundred percent right I also remember of phone calls six o'clock in the morning or this is a trooper as you can you hold for Mario Cuomo screaming for forty five minutes not liking that particular story and being nasty and insulting yet he had the image was so\nTo be gone to taste of what it's like for any journalist\nTo add or work on the stories that my challenge to the governor or something is administration is doing I mean I'm sure you've gotten a phone calls I got them when I was in Albany and there was a screaming Andrew Cuomo\nF bombing on the other end of the phone line ... you just don't want someone in that position who behaving that way you treat people that way on a personal level\nAnd a lot of younger than I was going to say about a hundred percent right I also remember of phone calls six o'clock in the morning\nA this is a trooper than you know can you hold for Mario Cuomo screaming for forty five minutes not liking a particular story and being nasty and insulting yet he had the image with so many in the media has a great liberals humanitarian\nYeah many old journalist snow a of that and uh this is a very different Cuomo that isn't that governor's mansion when he even is there\nA so I don't have a great deal more to offer except that I was just amazed at what occurred here and uh it was noticed by a lot of people around the country more ...\nAnd I mean this wasn't a debate governor I guess has it has to check the box oh I had a debate one thirty in the afternoon\nOn a New York city a channel that's it and not watching right\n... um\nYou know by the way I I think that question about the Buffalo Bills stadium was probably a stop to like WCBS New York's buffalo affiliate that they weren't that is the second biggest city in the state they wanted to give them something for the ask about the Buffalo Bills but not the buffalo vision\nFor the million ... who fled upstate New York I mean the whole thing I think was organized a with Cuomo's cooperation no opening statement no closing statement and the way the so called moderators were deferential to the governor was nothing short of embarrassing\nRight it was I mean obviously a Cuomo knows he has some friends there at CBS\nChannel to New York and\nHe's going to get what he wants to form that was all wrong and it just didn't allow enough time\nFor statements and enough time for for for the third needs to be a debate upstate the over in times union tomorrow should write an editorial demanding Governor Cuomo show of because of the day that the College of saint rose says the league of women voters or organize it\nAnd I would say no paper in upstate New York should endorse him again they always endorse him five buildings council but should never and do something again unless he agrees to that\nHow would you think just as a final points off of the business council here we have New York where the worst of all as climate in the United states and his business council is supposed to represent businesses out of the other side of New York city endorses him for a third time\nI saw that I'm On\nHand I couldn't believe it on the other hand a fish parts of the corps business councils seems to have lost its sense of mission um they should have endorsed mark mall on our own I suppose maybe Stephanie minor\nLike they just stand up for something or the the the utility costs I\nMean there's some some ... in New York are upstate New York out of control and it is a major a problem for business and you can leave addict feeding the governor um\nCouncil here we have New York where the wars the climate in the United states and his business council is supposed to represent businesses out side of New York city endorses him for a third time\nI saw that I'm On\nOne hand I couldn't believe it on the other hand um parts of the corps business councils seems to have lost its its conditions um they should have endorsed more more narrow I suppose maybe step in the minor\nLike they just stand up for something or the the ... the costs\nAnd you're talking to them in New York are upstate New York out of control and it is a major a problem for business and you can leave that to feed the governor um so yeah there are a very few people who are willing to take this man on\nA mutt I Hope there are more\nThought we appreciate you learn how to live on a regular\n... what's that I'm Glad I'm Out in ... I'm Glad I Am out of New York\nI'm at no doubts about port for joining us this morning thanks again Bob appreciate your insight says a long time really lifelong journalists to former Albany Times union investigative editor here a few other emails or here's some emails that I received about the debate lots of people weighing in\nBut someone from up in Saratoga I won't mention his name or in a good observer says Cuomo loud mouth interrupting bully mowing arrow sounds sounded sincere got some good jabs questionnaires Italian sausage more important than fracking\nHere's another one time I ... I guess the same I watched the debate you call a mile an hour on I was I don't really disgusted by the conduct of the governor he showed no respect for either the moderators or mowing arrow\nHis whole approach to the debate was to portray mowing arrows a disciple of Trump\nAnd to continue is agenda continuing to attack the president based on this performance I Do not believe the governor deserves reelection However I'm not in the naive enough to think he won't win as far back as three years ago the Republican Party new Cuomo would run again and should have started to develop some viable candidate to oppose him\nAnd then do fundraisers to support the candidate apparently they never learn anything\nFrom the twenty fourteen election when Rob asked Reno is grossly undecided in the same situation as happened in ... I Hope this election cycle\nMr Cox said the GOP chairman is replaced the state's Sherman someone else can take his place and make the party viable begin overall I saw it on our hands on himself well despite the constant false statements by Cuomo it sounded to me like the ... governors campaign wrote most of the questions that were asked\nThere was nothing significant raised about upstate issues\nWho's on a little bit more I'll tell you the the um fallacy though in the premise from this so well\nIntended note is that there is a Republican Party that new Cuomo would run again that could have developed viable candidates and could have raise money there is no Republican Party or groups of people who have control of the apparatus the apparatus has mainly\nHollowed out the very few people involved no one else really of any stature\nWanted the state chairman job besides at Cox who was able to bring to the party several hundreds of thousands of dollars annually in Manhattan money that he had access to whether through his family has connections he was able to raise some money for the party if you have someone from Erie County\nIt is a Republican Party that new Cuomo would run again that could have developed viable candidates and could have raised money there is no Republican Party or groups of people who have control of the apparatus the apparatus has mainly\nHollowed out the very few people involved no one else really of any stature\nWanted the state chairman job besides Cox who was able to bring to the party several hundreds of thousands of dollars annually in Manhattan money that he had access to where the through his family's connections he was able to raise some money for the party if\nIn kind of grim detail the tremendous gaps between various regions of upstate New York in terms of economic conform performance and not only New York city but the whole nation as a nation as a whole\nWell I mean the the the the main spur for this in terms of timing it happened to be the day that they was were ten years after the what we all remember as really being the start of the recession yeah the great recession actually technically started at the very end about seven but I think we all became aware\nThat there was a serious problem going on in the fall of two thousand eight I think we all of us who does the time remember that\nAnd the epicenter of the financial crisis was New York New York city when Lehman Brothers went bankrupt so it's a good ten years later is a good time to sort of take stock of what's going on\nNow\nOr something I quote in the piece of we did on line that empires Senate dot ORG is the governor also talk about this and that the recovery period from the recession overlaps almost exactly with his tenure as governor so the two things coincide\nBetter since ... ten and twenty ten I'm basically there's been a ... a pretty sharp and growing divide between upstate and downstate um that upstate New York has performed much more clearly than downstate New York if you look at private sector job growth a or GDP\nOr the unemployment rate is down by the same amount upstate downstate put downstate the unemployment rate is lower because more people are working out of a larger\nUpstate the unemployment rate is down because just simply fewer people available work\nUm so that's a very different than we show\nThat in shorts in court we put on line so upstate New York not only with relatively weak if you look at upstate New York upstate New York's job getting in the recession that is during the recovery period with pen a west coast is twenty pen\nA private sector job they screwed by six twenty three percent rat actually lower than\nState and downstate um that upstate New York has performed much more clearly than downstate New York if you look at private sector job growth [noise] uh we're GDP\nOr the unemployment rate is down by the same amount upstate in downstate put downstate the unemployment rate is lower because more people are working out of a large [noise]\nUpstate the unemployment rate is down because simply fewer people available work\nUm so that's a very different than we show that in shorts or in the report we put on line so upstate New York not only with relatively weak if you look at it upstate New York upstate New York's job getting since the recession that is during the recovery period with a west coast is twenty pen\nA private sector job they screw by six point three percent that actually is lower than any state except three states West Virginia Wyoming Alaska which have resource report tiny resource dependent economies but ... and because of changes in oil and coal crisis\nI'm ... that's pretty bad and and in the region of upstate New York are among the lowest performing regions and the whole country if you look at metropolitan area so it's not just poor than downstate it it's actually pretty bad even by the standards of the lower performing interior and small county\nBecause you could you talk about some of those regional figures and before you do let me just ask you this did CBS reporter is Marcia Kramer Richland did they call the empire center as far as you note I may be asked for suggestion questions are insights into question well no\nNo but I Know but the thing is written to be self explanatory I yeah I mean we try to be very clear I don't think you need to call me to figure out what the question would be based on this but now it is that I think\nYou know it's often comedy though I used to do it when you are listening or part of a debate and I was part of any debates for the New York post that you call up different experts in various areas on different sides of the political spectrum just to get a quick suggestion questions are inside from them as to what might be asked so that's why I asked you know\nKnow the answer to the answer is absolutely there's a flat no\nAbout some of those incredible regional figures that put New York in the worst case really in the corner of the whole nation when it comes to an economic decline\nWell just about the whole nation in and it's largely its decline in some ways it said that stack and or or very low growth I'm\nSick as part of the upstate New York is the southern tier and all of the day to show from Binghamton out across Elmira Jamestown um that is a very sick region that employment there is lower now than it was\nUm when the recession ended in fact that's one of the reasons were employed where there's fewer jobs now than there were before the recession began so there's been no recovery\nSo the the the actual decline flat out capital declined is ... is very much in the southern tier in particular um [noise] the\nDo you think those reporters in New York City you know where the southern city or even is a I don't know that's a rhetorical question I'm Sorry my marshes I don't think a lot of those on the audience martial may now but the audience in New York City where this was primarily focused we'd have no clue and ... Ninety percent of ...\nWell again I don't expect him to focus on on on this necessarily it's just that they seem to think the only place up state is buffalo I'm ...\nAnd speaking of buffalo I mean the strongest performing metro area upstate less the private sector jobs is the capital region Albany Schenectady Troy now\nCustom eerily state capitals tend to be economically resilient because they're a seat of government and so the base of employment in of all the consumer purchasing contracting in the area is the government so unsurprising will\nLook in the capital region has had about twelve percent\n[noise] the do you think those reporters in New York City you know where the southern city or even his uh I don't know that's a real question I'm Sorry my marshes I don't think a lot of those are the audience martial may now but the audience in New York City where this was primarily focused we'd have no clue and ... Ninety percent of all\nWhile again I don't expect them to focus on on on this necessarily it's just that they seem to think the only place upstate is buffalo I'm ...\nAnd speaking of buffalo I mean the strongest performing metro area upstate let's look at private sector jobs is the capital region Albany Schenectady Detroit now\nCustom eerily state capitals tend to be economically resilient because they're a seat of government and so the base of employment in of all the consumer purchasing contracting in the area is the government saw unsurprisingly\nLook in the capital region we've had about twelve percent employment close\nUh since ... ten now the nationwide average is Eighteen percent so it was two thirds the nationwide average down skate average is Twenty one percent\nHold on where you also say that the capital district number is affected by the global foundries and nano got under employment reason that's private sector employment in that manner center of course in ...\nThere has been the state starting in the late nineties and accelerating you know and protect his last term and into the Spitzer Patterson air into Cuomo the\nState has dumped and invested literally billions of dollars basically ... of dollars has been collected from the rest of the state and invested in the Albany area in projects like global foundries and also and Sunni Holly and all the options\nAnd the ... separate that\nSo there's been a ... that is true and that's actually looked up the private sector in the capital region that government doesn't do a lot of things right but if you spend the night if you spend billions of dollars in the way that status fan and here you are going to get some results and in part that's a result of that yeah I'm a second\nClass is growing major metro and upstate New York is buffalo Niagara Falls and that rounding up inside job growth of eight percent\nIn eight percent is as barely isn't is not quite half of the national grocery or it's less than half the downstate growth rate\nSo again it's better than buffalo was doing actual will be in the nineties in particular although much of what the growth has been in Buffalo is not attributable to project started under Governor Cuomo it's attributable to\nUm projects that were set in motion actually earlier than that especially extension of the um [noise] a a private nonprofit medical centers and the county facilities and the state university and then there's the so called buffalo billionaires almost incidental that\nAnd then a lot of that job creation and in fact they just they have to do with construction jobs rather than permanent job isn't that the greatest construction\nJobs or not and there has been growth dogs I like there has been a buffalo has benefited from a gross in for instance in ... to a certain extent of professional in business services that is related to some extent the fact that it is a major it'll although there's been a change and who the players are it is a major regional\nBanking centers and the tea is their crimes um but again in the national so the governor will talk about buffalo is if it's just is booming place basically in a

I actually had the opportunity to intervene\nA camera set up we were filming most of the panels and they're usually a two of us just watching the camera and make sure they are all the audio is working and then all the other half of those were in the green room so to speak that was had another camera set up and waiting just to conduct interviews after some of the panelist would come out\nAnd um so yeah it was it was orchestrated as to you know who is doing interviews so if you were say interviewing one person you would listen to that panel\nAnd then as they could get the sense that they were wrapping up you would head out into the green room or to prepare for the interview\nWhich panel would that you attended would you say was the most influential and why I\nThink personally just as as a big sports fan or there was a woman and sports panel that featured mean a kind of Victoria Arlen and\n... I actually had the opportunity to interview and all three of them are worked for ESPN in various roles that a game like is actually a works for ESPN as an analyst and it's also in the WNBA ah so I think that was really cool to see sort of\nTheir perspective in in you know arguably I'm a business that\nHas traditionally been dominated by men to your sort of their perspective would very cool what was their perspective it was just you know they talked a lot about how\nThey perhaps that the work a little bit harder than than other people they felt a meta ... you're talking about how you know she uh it's on shows like around the horn she writes for the ESPN the magazine as well she just started her own her own NFL pod cast\nBut she talked about how she felt as if she had to prepare more and more and more than a say her fellow coal co hosts who were males um just because you feel like she had to be you know add appear as smart as than I'm so she talked a lot about\nHow she you know she felt she needed to prepare a lot more and more\nUm there was just sort of that and and also with Victoria Arlen who ... actually ah had the opportunity to interview her stories incredible she was the ... Olympic gold medalist\nUm so it talked about all they talked a lot about 'em they're prep work and and how they um just basically want to be viewed as as equal in their industry AJC\nThe lotto sophomore political science major mass combine er here at I own a college joined W.

years for the jets and the\nEarly nineties Ninety to Ninety four so you saw a lot what went on and that locker room of course a couple of coaches Bruce costs split and of course Pete Carroll ah Rob welcome to the sports at them\nAs your job you know\nSo a lot going on in the giants locker room or a surprise at Eli Apple former number one pick and snacks Harrison moved in the last couple of days\nUm yeah it's actually pretty surprising um ... it seems like the the\nWhole fires they're all going on right now um and you would have thought that if they were going to do that they would have done it properly before the drought um [laughter] before they paid a ... you know a lot of money for top notch wherever she within ticket top notch back\nUm without taking a quarterback and you know seven weeks into the season I live in a fire sale or blow the whole team of seems like she was like that's the originally going in this country on a flip the whole team around but I already paid a lot of money for a few guys so little weird comment for this whole thing\nWhich you your your view of Eli Manning is done or did you have anything left in the tank should should the giants just pull the plug on him right now\nUm me personally I think they should have drafted a quarterback because I think he lives pretty much done you know it seems like [noise] um last couple of years you know it's just been worse and worse and the giants record actually show that so um and granted\nLast year for the most part will do the her for a while but uh you know things weren't so much better you know to give her for so I'm just seems like the ... been on the ... for a few years now and I think every once in a come except for the giants management and just just seems that way\nRobbed now you mentioned oh dealt back them junior they the giants you recently paid in a boat load of money it realistic that this team it leaves even contemplating or thinking about moving the star wide receiver\n[noise] I don't think so um [noise] it would be kinda hard right now especially with all that money and it just gave them I don't think anybody not ultimately would um you know take on that contract so I'm

Carol and you still just which\nDo we see that happening you know what the giants at like ... they get to start cutting players losing come and go in a completely different direction right now\nUm [noise] I I think what the coaches changes they've made already um I think now they are going to a different direction I mean you know a trade deadline coming up there but what he started\nUm it's just kind of weird to me that they actually have a ... they didn't get as much for for the players for Apple ad for for snacks are some\nThat you would think they would've gotten snack is one of one of the best ... in the league I entered the loving and for them and only get a fifth round two after his mom was a little weird to me and I think that\nOpened up a lot of people's eyes that they just basically just trying to unload house and and you know get whatever they can get right now and and starting to hold another direction but I'm not ... we'll see you next week or by by the time to treat deadline is over\nGoing to completely different direction right now\n[noise] um [noise] I I think what the coach of changes they've made already um I think now they are going to a different direction I mean you know a trade deadline coming up there about what he started\nUm it's just kind of weird to me that they actually have a ... they didn't get as much for for the players for Apple ad for for snacks are some\nThat you would think they would have gotten snacks is one of the one of the best Eli we did in the league or inter do you live in [noise] and for them to get a fifth round draft hurts farmers a little weird to me and I think that\nOpened up a lot of people's eyes that they just basically just trying to unload the house and and you know get whatever they can get right now and and starting to hold another direction but I'm not ... we'll see you next week or by by the time the tree deadline is over\nA how much they're actually trying to to rebuild um you know by the end of the season to you know if the she's a good thing is the way it is\nUm Sherman's is going to have a lot a lot of unhappy players on his and by the time season's over and um it really doesn't get much better because actually the guys can actually see the writing what a wall when you go into to all the you know if there's not a major change at the quarterback position now they pretty much know is going to be basically the same we're coming into the coming into the fall when the ...\nAnd my concern here is is you know referencing you with the jets yeah you had a ... you had ...\nAnd then you went to Carol and then they just want to coach tied in in Nineteen Ninety five is patch Sherman in jeopardy of love completely losing the scene and eventually possibly putting it in his job in jeopardy the way the jets cut ties and Pete Carroll after one year\nUm [noise] I\nI don't think so a baby because you know that's not his job that cut ties with the players that they couldn't let 'em you know he can only work well yet and unfortunately\nYou know what he has is just not getting the job done you can't you know force you to be a better player [laughter] you know what I mean so\nUm you know you just going to try and get the bows out of what he has and I don't think I don't think the giants likes to make that change if they haven't been known to be a a team to do that management to do that a so quickly um I think you'll have\nBig hits anymore and you gave me can't hit the quarterback like like Jim ... and let her Marshall knocked Joe Montana out of the uh the the the playoff games back in the Nineteen eighties those cuts would not be allowed to eighty five bears who relish the fact that they used to beat\nThe bejesus out of the players they they their goal was not only when the game they wants to knock the quarter back out of the game while at about wraps things up here on me I own a college radio hour want to thank dean to female AJ the lotto and everybody else Kate pierce Joe Louis yo jar Chino I might just\nThe bejesus out of the players they made their goal was not only when the game they wanted to knock the quarter back out of the game\nWell at about wrap things up here on me I own a college radio hour want to thank dean to you know age a lotto\nAnd everybody else take peers Joe Lewis show George you know I might emerges\nCollege radio our production of oil we call the little\n[noise]\n\n\n\nOr\nDon't demand history [noise] W.

be in the in political science I taught at John Jay to love it\nBut I'm not exactly sure what a libertarian is so maybe you can tell\nThey're prepared as someone who believes that you should be as conservative or as liberal as you want to be as long as you are not trying to force yourself or others we understand that law is a very serious thing\nThat at the end of almost every laws that guy or gal with a done who's going to put you in a cage if you don't want to go in that cage\nThat person is going to shoot you and that means you should be using all all what it really matters things like loss of life or freedom law property or help a threat to any of those things but we shouldn't be using law for things like I don't like what you're doing or how you're acting or things of that sort\nOf the ... goes to examples of that of a you know forcing yourself on somebody with specific examples of what we're doing wrong in this society\nSo many of them may be one that affects New York

it does what they used to come back to the states do cool things of that crash grows and and had great hemp plastic and ... closet ... rope not just that it hurts the average the Yorker who asked chronic pain who now is getting stuck with added opioid or not even that\nAnd now they have to either a case in there and they get to or\nHave their family and friends go off and try to buy it made me go to jail why in the world but we let someone use of cannabis product and have a better life we should do that for those people who have chronic pain but not just that those people who are addicted there are people who are addicted to hard horrible drugs\nThat could use a cannabis product to get them off of those drugs that can be done so that's a good example that affects the workers right now\nTerrible that we say that it's completely wrong and we should be supporting schools like like the ... programs and they don't uh trades would eat we desperately needs trade we need tradesmen in this state the average trays of New York state is over fifty\nThat's bad I let my fifth year old I'm fifty but we need more people to be in the trades and eat the average to be thirty thirty five now with a rock and roll it we should change that\nI Would change that wants to get at sixteen he or she takes the test they pass the test to get a high school diploma than they have five options option number one you think colleges right interview awesome go to a prep school go\nTo prep schools that are you ready for that college with a history or biology or liberal arts or whatever it is go off do that\nWhen you didn't have to that college you are ready to rock and roll maybe graduate in three years take advantage of ... to take advantage of internships\nYou get a good college experience a fast

smart kids don't be bored go do it awesome do you mean scientists anyway good luck [noise]\nLet's see do any of those things but worries instead go to a trade school two year trade school\nNow we're rock and roll it should change that I Would change that once they get their sixteen he or she takes the test they pass a test to get high school diploma than at five options option number one you think colleges right interview awesome go to a prep school\nTo prep schools that are you ready for that college without history or biology or liberal arts or whatever it is go off do that\nWhen you

a plumber a technician eight track guy mechanic whatever you want to do all good\nTwo years of that depending upon what you do need to have a license to Eighteen or you're ready for the partnership whatever the case may be go off and do that to be happy you don't like that great go get a job\nGo work go get a job go work if the work ethic learned that when your boss or show up at eight you show up at eight not at nine thirty minutes and it actually means seven forty five get that work ethic\nI don't know how many people tell me all the time Larry I Would hire anybody with a work ethic why start a business they might say wait a minute there's sixteen are you kidding me no I'm dead serious we have a whole situation right now where if you ask twenty year olds if they feel like adults over half will tell you know\nThat's bad I Can't change parenting but I can change the environment I Want us to be making those mistakes at sixteen not twenty six now a lot of twenty six year olds coming back home to mom and dad making mistakes that make those mistakes at sixteen learn lessons get better by the time what twenty six we can rock and roll the next question I get it how do you pay for their worries\nI was ... when I got a wrinkle I got the GI Bill GI Bill gave me a certain amount of money and there's so many years to spend it with the same thing with a six year old\nThey get twenty thousand dollars they can use it and we'll we'll set it off to school they want they have seven years to use twenty thousand dollars seven years when that happens here is why I promise you never want there'll be a bunch of prep schools that will pop up and get so much that calls for two years twenty thousand dollars there'll be a bunch of a trade school for the pop up\nAnd they'll cost twenty thousand dollars how do I know that because it's guaranteed money from the government and banks love that\nThey will give loans this will pop up this will happen everywhere Chanel what am I saying I'm saying for those tenth eleventh grade as now is it a paying twenty two thousand dollars per year were paying ten thousand dollars per year\nWe're saving twelve thousand dollars per kid but not just that\nThere's about four hundred thousand eleven twelfth graders do the math that's over four billion dollars which means we said we we make up\nThat federal funds right away still have no strings attached a lot of teachers that teach get rid of a bunch of administrators have better results for kids happier kids happier parrots happier teachers\nKnowing any more and they were holding as you look like they're those people that are educational still after all the ... ah you know the black kids get less than they can do what do you do got that yep\nAbsolutely ... percent the first thing is if you notice my whole plan and the ... the twelfth grade\nYou can go to school you want to go to so kids will pick schools\nSo you'll find that kids will begin to integrate naturally that will tend to happen if you can pick the school you want to go to now will that be perfect but of course not we're not gonna have to be fifty that's not stop it but we'll integrate better yes you will have better integration if the parents can pick any school the kids can pick any school and it's based upon dollars that everybody\nGets so you will have naturally more integration ... eleventh and twelfth grade that part is built in now before the twelfth grade yeah this is a big deal most of this goes to how we reward schools now because of charter schools there that sort\nDo you collect saliva dropped their those people who think that our educational system is still after all the genes segregated a you know the black kids get less than they can do what do you do got that yep\nAbsolutely hundred percent the first thing is if you notice my whole plan and they are letting the twelfth grade\nYou can go to school you want to go to so kids will pick schools\nSo you'll find that kids will begin to integrate naturally that will tend to happen if you can pick the school you want to go to now will that be perfect but of course not we're not gonna have to be fifty just that's not fat but we'll integrate better yes you will have better integration if the parents can pick any school the kids can pick any school that is based upon dollars that\nEverybody gets so you will have naturally more integration ... eleventh and twelfth grade that part is built in now before this was great\nYeah this is a big deal most of this goes to how we reward schools now because of charter schools there that sort I Want to change how we actually even pay for the schools\nFirst things first right now they said we're paying about twenty two thousand dollars per kid I like to pay a whole lot less I think we can go to the idea is I talked about I Would like to state ... state has to pay by a constitution\nFor grades one through trial that's required and I get that will do that but I don't want to be paid at all by local communities I don't want\nAny school tax at the local level now that sounds crazy I Know but if we start to do that everything's comes in the state\nThe state will play pay a flat fee to all school districts a flat fee to all school districts you have X amount of kids\nMultiply that by a number I'm not sure what that number is exactly yet my gut tells me about Fifteen K but I'm not sure yet here's your back good luck no more grant writing no more begging money from the state no more baking money from the federal government here is your money could lock the number of kill ya that you\nGot it but what if the administrators in my district or you know from one of a better word or you know jerks and decide on the on the one group we favor when we don't favor on them and say Ruth and you say well it's been in any way you want\nAbsolutely here the issue the only thing I requires transparency that is my only issue you must be transparent any bad behavior\nWhether that is racial or gender or sexual orientation or religious any of that whatever that might happen I Will shine a light on I Will get everyone know what is happening okay you're you're not like they have no idea\nBut what have you got like curious Joelle and you know you got a group of people who get themselves elected and they want the religious kids can be treated in different ways and didn't want to hold them the same standard that's okay\nI didn't say it was okay what I literally said was any bad behavior I Will shine a light okay\nSo there is a lightning so there is like being shined on those guys I read about it all the time but it hasn't changed their bad behavior\nYou know there there isn't a shine for there isn't a shine a light shining or from the government from the governor that's number one and that that's the first thing and they still are able to do whatever they want because the average person doesn't know the local people now but the local people aren't enough the whole state you know someone's going to shine a light on that behavior\nSo it was going to come on TV like I Will and say look at what's happening in this community you start shining a light on that and you will see action being taken\nYeah but he was like one player but with Larry and they want to what they want the votes agricultural wants to vote so you don't hear too much from Andrew Cuomo about it a living\nAt home and I don't care about those votes guess you're correct he does that's not me I actually have balls and ethics I care about that that's I'm not him okay so I Will turn on and I'm telling you right now on the radio I'm telling you I Will shine a light on all of\nThe gang okay Larry we've got three minutes left I got to ask you a real quickly in the real lightning round healthcare\nWe health care and health insurance or not the same thing this is our biggest problem we've confused them and we worry about fixing health care\nThe local people now but the local people aren't enough the whole state you know someone's going to shine a light on their behavior so it was going to come on TV like I Will and say look at what's happening in this community you start shining a light on that and you will see action being taken\nOne Clinton but with Larry they want to what they want the boats agriculture wants to go so you don't have too much from Andrew Cuomo about it a living at home and I don't\nCare about those votes guess you're correct he does that's not me I actually have balls and ethics I care about that that's I'm not him okay so I Wish and on and I'm telling you right now on the radio I'm telling you I Will shine a light on all of\nThe ... okay Larry we've got three minutes left I got to ask you real quickly in the ... around health care\nThe health care and health insurance or not the same thing\nThis is our biggest problem we've confused them and we worry about fixing healthcare insurance when we should be wary about fixing health care we have to fix health care first\nThe biggest piece is transparency is making it no longer a cartel system make it no longer so hard to put people in the actual feel itself we fix health care first then we can fix health care shorts OK the MTA\nMTA's an absolute disaster the barest Mitt sixteen billion dollars of that about six billion come straight from New York\nState goes right to them because they're bad how to fix it three ways to sway number one we have to start using on infrastructure raising money through that through marketing at least got made me write stay writes the bridges and tunnels that were raised billions of dollars to help support\nThe actor empty a second we have to use it that the lines right now at night that aren't being used the rail lines in another city at the front lines to use those freight lines to raise money for marketing purposes and for bringing Frank to the city\nLess wear and tear on the city less square in charge of infrastructure more money coming in next the empty as a board has to completely change because no one is accountable the board has to go away with people and put people on it who are accountable to the local people in addition we have to copy all of the good ways that people are doing this in other large cities\nIn the world those bases like Berlin and London and copy the ideas that are working because the MTA someone efficient\nTo fix one mile of track they are four times more expensive than other cities in this world that both have unions and have safety copy that global save money and raise money ways other than more taxes will make it more efficient\nOkay tax reform biggest thing a tax reform as getting rid of unfunded mandate unfunded mandate to the county level crushing will cook county's those you can talk about that if you start getting rave unfunded mandate you will find county is a lot less desire to raise property taxes\nAre ever thought the taxes we have a problem with that you property taxes right now we're not voted on by the actual people in the town that voted on by the legislators which we can go behind closed doors and raise property taxes\nOkay hold on hold on because we're running out of time to really seriously um what examples can you imagine a tax reform yes\nI'm Sorry\nOkay and set up would you examples can give us unpleasant band aids you would do it with\nI Would wear but none of them I Would I Do it I Would I Do away with him what I Would say is they're not required let the county's decide what they want to deal with I Would let county start their budget at zero that's what I Would do I don't have to know all these things that's the point my entire campaign is about decentralization here's what I Know from business from family from life\nIf you are personal freedom plots accountability plus transparency you will have innovation right now our state is it a death spiral with over a hundred thousand people every year and a rise of suicide struck all different parts of our state so that has to change which leads me innovation I'm going to foster innovation that's what I'm trying to achieve\nLeonard band aids you would do away with\nI Would do it but none of them I Would I Do it I Would I Do away with them what I Would say is they're not required let the county decide what they want to do what I Would let county start their budget at zero that's what I Would do I don't have to know all these things that's the point my entire campaign is about decentralization here's what I Know from business from family for life\nIf you ask personal freedom plots accountability plus transparency you will have innovation right now are saying is it a death spiral over a hundred thousand people every year and a rise up suicide struck all different parts of our state so that has to change which have video of Asian I'm going to foster innovation that's what I'm trying to achieve\nWhich can block you from reaching your true potential and keep you backwards while the rest of the world continues to move forward\nSay bail when I was young I remember that raised a story with my father\nI think I was in grade six or seven yeah this is a long time

to here and understand now\nEven gentlemen if you are listening to me right now I I Want you to picture something in your mind I Want you to picture the world without ambition\nI Want you to picture is a world without incentives because I'm willing to bet that a lot of you are listening to me today and ... and thinking you know bill I don't really get what you're saying because\nMy only drive is

know God Forbid your car your kids and whatever it is that you think is going to keep you satisfied and that's going to be enough for you but now I'm asking you to picture wants the world would be like\nWithout ambition without without a drive for more\nNow I'm willing to bet that there would be no America that the world would be in a very primitive state because rather than keep moving forward rather than pushing toward something better or rather than wanting to be better than we are\nWe would have decided that where we are is the most that humanity can every evolve we would have decided that right where we are is where we should be and things would be dire today\nBut something something as deep and and passionate as the American dream is built on the foundation that one day people came from everywhere from all across the world to this homeland of promise\nA land flowing with milk and honey and decided that they wanted more just\nThe life just want you stopped me on the top of watch say absolutely that came from France they can find they came from across Europe\nAt that time you know upwards they'd be able to replace it is today yes but I was just a big field plantations oh

can do to move forward to move further to keep evolving ... ourselves yes because\nWe're living now in an era in an era is crucial team because we are the product of people who decided that they were going to keep pushing forward\nBecause imagine that people never decided to keep pushing for me probably we wouldn't even be born today so we owe it to ourselves we owe it to the human race we owed to America to keep pushing forward and to NATO to never give up and then never\nEver think of ourselves as being satisfied because that is when we stopped moving forward and when you start to go

weigh is no longer in existence but it goes to the over two thousand foot summit and from the top you have spectacular views of Vermont green mountains and the Adirondack [noise]\nOf how the Internet came into my life into your life and all all of our lives every minute of every day seemingly now\nUm and so the book or how the Internet happened is essentially you could almost say it's about how the Internet happened to us and and to get your your question originally if you remember even as late as the eighties and early nineties computers were very very difficult\nAnd I think the statistic is his latest Nineteen Ninety five only about twenty percent of us houses have computers now we all have computers in our pockets [noise]\nUm and so the I think it's the Internet that really brought computing into all of our lives and and our our economic system got taken over by our social system got taken over by our media system got taken over by it so that's what the books about\nIt yeah I remember the beginnings of it and I was totally confused how something like this ... thing and it seems like in a relatively short amount of time\nAnd so the book or how the Internet happens is essentially you could almost say it's about how the Internet happened to us and to get your your question originally if you remember even as late as the eighties and early nineties computers were very very difficult\nAnd I think the statistic is as late as Nineteen Ninety five only about twenty percent of us houses have computers now we all have computers in our pockets [noise]\nUm and so the I think it's the Internet that really brought computing into all of our lives and and our our economic system got taken over by at our social system got taken over by our media system got taken over by it so that's what the books about\nIt yeah I remember the beginnings of it and I was totally confused how something like this ... they have teams like in a relatively short amount of time with this rapidly\nSure but you know it is a a you know the the I start to book in Nineteen Ninety three so that's twenty whatever many years ago twenty five or something\nIt is to the point where it is history now um I don't know it's a we're used to things going viral that's the term now yeah um and I think that the the Internet was really the first thing that went viral because if you think about the Internet is just ... connecting all the computers in the world together\nBut really what it really became with connecting all the people in the world together once everyone got online um so the reason to grew so fast is once you are just you know one click one swipe one tap away\nFrom any other human being on the planet it's easy for ideas and concepts and businesses and websites and whatever to to grow up overnight like you said\nWhen you first started Walter Mitchell\nFor I was one that gets back to your original question it was one hundred percent for academia um for military for government ... when I say at early in the book that it was not designed for you and me and it was designed for ah for the ivory tower essentially\nUm and they never thought about us and making it easy and simple for us so again another theme in this book is that\nThings like Amazon things like Google um there were certain that research or early on in the Internet but it wasn't easy you had to have you know terms that you knew and bully an searches and things like that\nSo um the the the whole history of of how the Internet happened to us is about ah companies and people an entrepreneur that made them simple and made it a like you know swipe left so I swipe price like we do today\nSo the initial topic of the Jeannette was totally different than really how it used to say that\nWell in a way but it wasn't because it was sharing ideas okay it was sharing thoughts and means and things like that but it was assumed that I Would only be among sophisticated users like people in in colleges and universities and research centers and and and in in the military and things like that\nAnd so sort of the accident of history is that all of us decided that we should be a part of that too and the and the last twenty five years has been a process of a century letting the riffraff in a few well\nI guess we're all the riffraff\n[laughter] exactly but it's so interesting how for many of us really use the Internet in many ways it's as though it's something that we just do all the time it's not even something that we think about\nIt in terms of the future where do you see it going and what you're going to happen next\nI Do wonder um it it seems like a it's it it it's going so fast like it is a slowdown necessary in the sense that it seems like every single day there's ... there\nResearch centers and and and in in the military and things like that and so sort of the accident of history is that all of us decided that we should be a part of that too and the and the last twenty five years has been a process of a century letting the riffraff then if you will\nI guess we're all the riffraff\n[laughter] exactly but it's so interesting how for many of us we use the Internet and it's many resorts as as so it's something that we just do all the time it's not even something that we think about [noise]\nSo in terms of the future where do you see it going and what's gonna happen next\nI Do wonder um it it seems like a it's it it it's going so fast like it is a slowdown necessary in the sense that\nIt seems like every single day there's ... there's what's this new thing should I be on this app should I be ... should I be participating in this um I Wonder if we're at a stage where there's some sort of a critical mass not where people will quit\nBut where people will say okay I have enough things on my phone is beeping me enough in my pocket I don't need any more and and either you you stop at where you're at ... or the companies themselves will get better at at a calming things down for us and and and making things more manageable\nThat's a very interesting concept I think the other thing that I wanted I just quickly without Atlantis which you tell it the title of your book again and had to go about getting it\nSure it's called how the Internet happened um you can buy it or wherever find books are sold in actual a dead tree copies but also if you want to be a part of the Internet you can get an e book a there is an audio book as well on all of the platform you could buy it on your phone if you want [laughter] anywhere folks are so\nWell we're so delighted that she

education and you know it's funny because we always thought the colleges which they educate students academia\nAnd it seems that most students seems to be have a love for sports and love for our son and other uh\n\nInterests we have with us someone who has a great deal of interest the knowledge on education sector Timothy McVeigh ... he's now joining us that's our co host when we're going to be a triumphant now you say it\nIn any a bit we'll focus on education with Dr Timothy McVeigh this is the superintendent of schools if the archdiocese of New York welcome Dr ...\nAlways a pleasure to be with you thank you for having me on\nWe look forward to having you join us um tonight's topic is something that greatly concerning all of us um [noise]\nAnd I'm living in the world in which we live being a parent myself being involved in education through so many years I'm really concerned than it is a primary concern for so many of school safety\nIn all schools today and\nIt involves so many aspects of school life\nCan you help me out by telling us a little bit about\nHow the school's approach school safety and everything that's involved with the children in terms of their safety their understanding of what's going on and how this can be implemented\nOh I'm so appreciative you're using this is the topic tonight we just got state tests course back to school for so much\nLiving in the world in which we ran being a parent might well being involved in the education system in the years I'm we're hearing so then it is a primary concern for from any of that school safety there all day and\nIt involves so many aspects school life\nCan you help me out by telling us a little bit about\nHow schools approach school safety and everything that's involved with the children in that age they're understanding of what's going on and how can be implemented\nWell I'm so appreciative you're using this as the topic tonight um we just got state tests course back to all schools are so much focused on what that that is telling us rightfully so\nAnd we're working hard in the classroom but today we have to be so mindful of school safety to your point and I approach it to your question I I approach it\nAs a two part conversation there's an external part of a conversation\nAnd then an internal part to this dialogue and what I mean by that is on the external part I'll share with our schools are doing I Know all schools are doing all of this or most of it I'm\nNever thought I Would have to have police come in work with faculty so that we have active shooter training so God Forbid something happens of that caliber our faculty know exactly what to do how quickly to do it to protect children because as the research says\nIf you have a shooter in the building and you can secure kids for forty five minutes the chances of them coming out of that unharmed at least specifically opt increases ex potentially so that's important to be able to put guidance and we call these these emergency flipped charts in every classroom\nAnd give teachers training so that if something does happen\nThey quickly flip to the chart\nAnd it's four or five bullets that remind them exactly what they do at that point in time\nUp the state is pretty good to all schools they have in their annual budget\nSafety security funds\nAnd it ranges in terms of dollars dependent on location and the number of students but this gives us schools the opportunity in our schools particularly to make sure the envelope of the building as secure the proper law locks on all the exterior doors an intercom system a camera system\nUm New York city has even gone so much and and wrapped the Catholic schools in this I'm so appreciative of this\nIf you're you're a student body is a certain size they put a security guard hop on your premise during the times that you're operational all through the year so these are important things that we're doing and an ice again I say that that's all the external part of the conversation\nBut if he would allow me what I think is just as important is what's the security that's going on internally and I'll use a phrase that we have had in schools since Adam and Eve were around which is um bullying\nAnd you know that's still a characteristic among all schools\nAnd how you addressing [laughter] 'cause to me that's as much a school safety issue as an active shooter issue would be and I can tell you know this is a little bit antiquated a day that I should say but I think the premise still holds true and I found this fascinating [laughter]\nThe secret service years ago did a study they wanted to know could you identified an individual\nAnd an ice again I say that that's all the external part of the conversation\nBut if he would allow me what I think is just as important is what's the security that's going on internally and I'll use the phrase that we have had in schools since Adam and Eve were around which is bullying\nAnd you know that's still a characteristic among all schools\nAnd how you addressing [laughter] 'cause to me that's as much a school safety issue as an active shooter issue would be and I can tell you know this is a little bit antiquated a day that I should say but I think the premise still holds true and I found this fascinating [laughter]\nThe secret service years ago did a study they wanted to know could you identified an individual who would turn around and her to school by shooting or whatnot\nAnd they said you could not in through the ... thirty seven studies that they did you couldn't profile that way but there were two commonalities every one of those studies one\nWhoever was the perpetrator was significantly bullied and that perpetrator told somebody ahead of time what they're going to do but people wouldn't listen\nSo part of school security is to one you have to address bully at all phases\nAnd you have to inform and educate your school community if somebody says something you have to say something [laughter] so to stop that that's a big piece of it right there and you know what I really worry about as a country and and this is what we have to address the schools were losing civility\nAnd if it's not in the in the context of bullying it's just how we engage people how we interact now we know what's the discourse um and it was lost it I Believe that the political level we've lost in so many other levels we cannot let our children start to adopt that behavior\nAnd we've got to bring that back I think that's a very significant piece when it comes to schools palm safety I could ramble on I and I maybe I should wait to have if you have questions but those are some things that come to my mind\nI totally agree with you I see it on the younger level where I work on the old rapper ... and I can't [noise] sadly among people my age and I think it's that important to address\nHow I I understand in terms of opening talking how can you help children\nYeah ... ... talk within a gallon to remind me so much for that they can start expressing some feeling they have about the way in which people acting towards them\nI you know I ... I'm going to revert back if I could to accommodate mate who for five months ago with two off because it comes right to my point the way you have a good school because you get the right adults in the building and so to answer your question\nGet the right teachers which schools have to make sure you train them how to respond to children when they come to you need\nA second collection of adults believe it or not nurses very very important people you'll find children are more prone to open up to nurses beyond just the element that they have at the time and to make sure that that adult is positioned trained to be able to help out\nAnd then the third adult in the building is the traditional that we would all think of school counselors and how do we get them to help children with issues such a stress management\nOh four or five months ago with two [laughter] because it comes right to my point the way you have a good school because you get the right adults in the building and so to answer your question\nGet the right teachers which schools half make sure you train them how do you respond to children when they come to you need\nA second collection of adults believe it or not nurses very very important people you'll find children are more prone to open up to nurses beyond just the element that they have at the time and to make sure that that adult disposition to train to be able to help out\nAnd then the third adult in the building is the traditional that we would all fit golf school counselors and how do we get them to help children with issues such a stress management and grief counseling or whatever the issue is that they have it's it's it's teaching the adults how to engage\nIn children when they're in that predicament that you just described ... well\nI think you need on their head [noise] but let's fill that that [noise] you over the uh one of the largest [noise] a\nReligious oriented school system rapidly in in the country that in the world\nThis ugly how does a faith based school community like you are dealing with the issue that school security in school safety when it comes to morals and I know that you teach morals\nOr ... years to go to the public schools about teaching it and I believe that it's something that's very a traditional and it's still with the school communities like yours\nAnd the way I think we're quite intentional indirect in that regard because we will not mince words we want to make sure every one of the sixty seven thousand children here the following a message on the ... got to\nThat's a God that loves you and has expectations of you and as a result of that to point three life is really a spiritual journey\nAnd you cannot deny it you can't walk away from it it's part of the DNA\nAnd so we'd like we love the opportunity to talk of the children so what does that journey made for you when you start to engage in that conversation\nThen you start talking about self esteem you start talking about civility how you engage with other people that gives us the platform to address all of these topics that we're talking about tonight [noise]\nWe have run out of time and we think and never having enough time [laughter] kind of thing and I'd like to spend an invitation to talk with us further about coming on the air more often with us and I've already discussed it with the radio station\nShow me\nDid when we may I\n\n\nDead yet\nMost power I paid ...\nMarriages\nWere your parents don't warm and only ...\nThe id each do you do show\nSuspicious behavior I leave till the Fox news the highest priority for the FBI that's with director Christopher Wray is saying about the series of homemade bombs\nThat went to high profile Democrats including former Presidents Clinton and Obama and the congresswoman Maxine Waters of California and then your golf as his um CNN packages being sent to the FBI lab at Monaco right now is\nThat his team in late today FBI Director re provided more details about the packages each one male and a manila envelope with interior bubble wrap\nSix wherever the chance to the same returning trust and computer printed address labels for federal investigators tell Fox News at such printers can embed identification code that the actual print that can be used by investigators to link the packages\nFox's Catherine hemorrhage in Washington New York governor Andrew Cuomo was also targeted\nA device husband's done to model cars\nHot and that the guy who is also being handled\nAlmost doubled security at all the bridges tunnels and airports as well as mass transit systems calling up additional members of the national guard to eight and security\nThe package scares to ...
