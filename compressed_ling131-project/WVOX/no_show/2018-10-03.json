don't show good morning Mitchell you're on WB ... what's on your mind hey\nBobby how are you there are a couple of things I actually agree with one of your early ... totally right a Fifteen year old who drink breaking the law the person who actually bought that alcohol for like Fifteen year old though is breaking the law even work\nAnd I agree with that caller there is no my mind that she drank more than one there there's no doubt in my mind that you were drunk they can get my mind that we've taken advantage of because you would you like to believe we don't usually a great but today we'd do a great\nA list of a couple of other things uh I I I finally have a a such respect for for for Donald Trump it you know I I mean like you knew it all along but finally been confirmed Donald made his money the old fashioned way he inherited an excel\nYeah but we know what we do know that he sold anything you know what ever happened to the presumption of innocence\nExactly a as [laughter] as as for where are the superintendent here's my take on it\nGo by we I should play music for good he's\nA nice guy yeah but but hey here's my take on it uh\nI think he was hoping that he would be be high it stayed around to see if he would be a he realized that it wasn't going to happen so they go shaded by out a I'm sure he got paid the ... the remaining part of it as a salary\nAnd that will ... will move forward\nNow you know maybe they should have tried some are stored of discipline and giving them a second shot have had a shot at the killing any good to have things like that whenever you look in the White House and you say why is he they're thinking of things like to restore and when that does an ...\nAnd if if I may say you know I I'm a I Do agree totally with combat you know a a Donald Trump needs to divide he you know he's a great divider\nAnd she'll be underestimated he that's what he does he broke it well it's unfortunate because it's not it's not the best interest of the of the country but why he did what he did yesterday uh uh\nBecause you you know how people all when they will not help the rallying and carried away like well OK\nBut this gets the base up and it's got the boat up so you know I Know what are you feeling I don't think it's in the best interest of the country but I understand what he's doing and the and he is who he is and he's\nAlone without question what's that ... where's the late ... who is the most recent elected official on that level who's been doing anything in the best interests of the country actually interestingly the president was a new NAFTA deal but who is actually doing stuff in the interest of the country\nNeed to divide you know he's a great provider and three and he should be underestimated he that's what he does it well it's unfortunate because it's not it's not the best interests of the of the country but why he did what he did yesterday uh uh\nBecause you you know how people all when they don't think we're rallying and carried away I can be All right well okay\nBut this gets the base up and discuss the boat up so you know I Know what are your girl and I don't think it's in the best interest of the country but I understand what he's doing and uh and he is who he is and he's\nA longer that question what's that ... where's the lead the who is the most recent elected official on that level who's been doing anything and the best interests of the country actually interestingly the president when it was a new NAFTA deal but who is actually doing stuff in the interest of the country they're not\nYou know up maybe not but I think most of them try to read the key attempts to drink when you're drinking oh I'd like the I like my dear\nOh my goodness All right thank you very much I Want to get this on the color and I think he wants to reach towards something and we try and be fair and provide time good morning Anthony you ever turn\nHere first it's interesting how are people\nWant to allege ... things that I've said and it's not what I said okay that was the guy never said\nHe wouldn't let ... that deal if he was running for reelection\nAnd that is I think what it ...\nOther people from making that deal and so\nI don't think that people don't want to get to the truth or don't want to you know keep you know all Republicans on the minds regardless of what he's done I don't believe that but we live in a structure where you're running for reelection you simply can't operate in the way Jeff late at the that it needed to get on the fact that you're tired\nWell yes that's true but but but how standards that professor [noise] I mean it only because he's worried about his job but we're going to get to choose from him\n... absolutely and and it it it is sad but it's not about the individual I mean I don't you out to the effect but it does anybody care that anybody want the truth\nYet there are people who feel that they're operating in the structure in which they want to keep their jobs but aren't they are constrained and so it's not about and then it's about the structure gr operating\nYoung yet for that but then maybe they chose the wrong profession I mean shouldn't we start holding our elected officials to a higher standard I mean I get behind this Mike everyday when I hear the same nonsense every day I mean really you want to be a politician\nWe need to do given the fact is you're tired\nWell yes that's true but but how sad is a professor I mean it only because he's worried about his job and we're going to get to choose from him\nAbsolutely and and it it it is sad but it's not about the individual I mean you out to the effect that it does anybody care does anybody want the truth\nYet there are people who feel that they are operating in the structure in which they want to keep their jobs but are they are constrained and so it's not about them about the structure gr operating\nYoung yet prevent that from them maybe they chose the wrong profession I mean shouldn't we start holding our elected officials to a higher standard I mean I could find this Mike everyday when I hear the same nonsense every day\nI mean really you want to be a politician I suspect the drug doesn't want to take a call and six o'clock and elect Saudi gets toasted or Kabul since I get off of five and a breakdown adored are good to be out of the house ... should while you're on the word [laughter]\nI you know I think that's the same criticism I care of my friends in the media and I'm not including you in the spot but you don't mind my friends in the media\nAre criticized constantly for focusing on the ... be exciting and knock the real important and and people say well they chose that profession they should just get the hell out of it or not\nThat we will take you know we didn't take an obese people take an oath to defend to protect the close to send the don't let me\nAsk let me ask you this so you would rather\nThat people not run for office than try to run for office\nWork within the system to maybe change it a little bit any you know you're saying why not put all of the least well okay but then who is going to run the country we do need people to run the country and my point is regardless of how wonderful the people are you get in there they're all working in St structure\nAnd human nature being what it is people want to keep their job because they hope to get in and it needs to make some changes now I'm not paying to your person they're all wonderful incredibly you know getting people I'm just\nPushing back a little bit on the idea that nobody wants to truth and nobody cares and nobody wants within the best interest of the country\nI think there are people like that\nBut of course the more important thing and the thing you and I can effect change on is the fact that our electoral system as an example operate the way it does so that if you do want to compromise you can't run for reelection and that will just like to point and I'm not as much as he he's absolutely right so let's focus on changing that\nAnd not telling everybody to see you know to to quit their jobs\nProfessor how how interesting is that the only two on his people in the last year one was dying and the other one's not running for office and everyone else is just trying to calm those with their with their with their professionals and their media people when they're ...\nOr ... people who to tell them what the words now do you think that one Kavanaugh was up there to mention the Clintons which so will destroy his credibility forever even if it were true though do you think he really thought about it you think that there were two ... I was too so we know these ... words will make the boomers in Texas all upset\nAnd it'll be good for you\nWhere do you think happened\nKnow I don't know I my guess is that he was being coached and I think he did the Fox news interview with mark and the cow him where he was\nA guy in the description of many people in the White House and others that she bought it at the wrong message to calm or so and not not defensive enough and I think he coached when he wins backing there on Thursday last week\nTo go fiery and defense and fell and I think it was an unnatural position for him to be in I don't think it is\nNow do you think that one Kavanaugh was up there to mention the Clintons which so will destroy his credibility forever even if it were true there do you think he really thought about it you would think that they were to where I was too so we know these buzz words will make the ... in Texas all upset\nAnd it'll be good for you\nWhat do you think happened\nYou know I don't know my guess is that he was being coached and I think he did the Fox news interview with mark on the cow him where he was\nA by the description of many people in the White House and other that she bought it for a long ... to calm or pulling up not defensive enough and I think he coached when he went back in there and Thursday last week\nTo go fiery and defending bell and I think it was an unnatural position for him to be and I felt that it used to that kind of thing and I think he tried and I agree with you I mean I think it backfired terribly I don't think it was the right approach\nAnd now you've got real questions that that we should take seriously about his ability to a third of eating is confirmed\nBecause the issue of judicial temperament and figuring it I'm ... Democrats as women and others I mean before the Supreme Court so it got an insult in a pickle that point I I Do think that\nHe is um he was coach any people don't go through these things alone or I should say and he was in the middle of the fire store but I think he was ill served by the coaching he got\nCouldn't and frankly he shouldn't have her to be in that position which is the larger question you know with with the president and they'll just keep saying and I get it\nTo use what about due diligence what about the presumption of innocence well I saw this on a platform didn't those rules to apply and we have to make up our minds do we whether or not those kinds of rules apply because we're in a gray zone here we're flying without a map\nYeah I mean here it's not a trial it's not a criminal trial and it's not eat and you and I walk to the bottom line is constitutionally that senator to have to decide if it's somebody who is that the therapy or life on the Supreme Court and on and and and and I disagree with that bottled\nWater I Want you to hold that thought because now I'm going to infuriate you by going to break when we come back and make your point about that and then tell us how it affects the mid term professor tuck you so much you stay right there and right after that Frank skin though were on fire today\nAnd we like that a lot of cars\nDon't change the the women only fourteen sixty WVU actually back between Israel right after this\nBreak from Fox\n\nNews radio I'm Leon moon walk on and on President\nTrump blasting accusations against his Supreme Court nominee and Christine Blasey Ford's recollection of the alleged sex insult at a rally in Mississippi last night bloody Ford's attorney accusing the president of the gauging in an attack on his client\nBoxers was learned the FBI couldn't deliver its report on judge cattle\nTo the White House as early as this afternoon but Dr Ford legal team is complaining that they still have not been contacted by the bureau saying in a letter to the agency inconceivable to the FBI to conduct a thorough investigation of darker for delegation without interviewing her judge Kavanaugh poor the witnesses we've identified as ...\nAnd the UN's highest court ordering the U.S to lift sanctions on Iran that affect the importance of humanitarian goods or things linked to the\nYou decide\nAnd more\n\nTo be less than a bloody Ford's attorney accusing the president I think gauging in an attack on his client\nFactors is learned the FBI could deliver its report on judge cattle to the White House as early as this afternoon but Dr Ford legal team is complaining that they still have not been contacted by the bureau staying in a letter to the agency created inconceivable that the FBI could conduct a thorough investigation of Dr Ford delegation without interviewing her judge Kavanaugh\nWere the witnesses we've identified box\nGary penny and the un highest court ordering the U.S to lift sanctions on Iran that affect imports of humanitarian good or things linked to the\nYou decide\nTo become more\nNation coming soon to be the personal\nFox Nation don't gum now Fox News rundown weekly morning on the dive deep into the major and controversial during the day hosted by the anchors the box drive now but you knew you won't find anywhere a plane to go on walks me but I just got a job\nAnd they're going to watch the news they want someone to try ... job is to come through the talking points Martha ... we're going to ask the question because there's a lot of conventional wisdom out there needs to be challenged and bringing\nWhen I'm making sure that whatever developed through the day people are fully informed\nFrom county to county were twenty four seven news\nBe here let's we're going to be fair weather for am a midnight or they're just you know real news real honest opinion\nTraffic\nIsn't a bind ... the New England three way it's going in the north bound and getting a port\nAnd tell him bay to stop what Athens backing up the drive all the way from the cross Bronx expressway and it's still going to be quoted on the Bronx river parkway there is an accident still clearing just after gun hill well laser blocking traffic backed up from ... county I'm Karen Johnson into traffic Center for fourteen sixty that will you be\nThat would be a leader of today for cash Steve probably varies I on whether on fourteenth victory W.

they resolved it I don't know if they paid them out yet you know we'll we'll know certainly will know at some point will know because it has to come out in the budget\nWell there's always there's always some sort of a settlement of that type doing you know the woman who took over\nI don't know Dr party at all really um I didn't know she she was actually considered for the job of superintendent and she was test over four in favor of Dr Osborne um I don't know I don't know her at all\nSo we'll see how much is a nice thing isn't it\nYeah I'm I'm I'm Glad that you know quite frankly I'm Glad that he's gone he it was interesting listening to some of the school board members um talk about him and I'm glowing tones quite frankly there were I Will give credit to the to to some of the members that\nAre actually chose to not make any comments publicly I give them kudos for doing so um [noise]\nKnow Dr ... um I I was interested to hear that he actually had accomplished something he and and they were and he had he had already um I'm In the in the education of the students across the district in leveling out the the curriculum across the district\nUm which of course it was a district for the children which is which is which is a good achievement query how did he accomplished that because I I worry that he did it by leveling down rather than up but you know that's still to be determined and I'm going to investigate that further\nUm but having said that I'm I'm Glad that that it was a cheap because it's something I always wanted to investigate and I want that to happen one of the things that was on the general inside and it's a really a controversial topic\nIs language hum and it is something that actually was conductor parties up to ... um ... roadhouse actually it was she was assigned to do when she first came on board actually\nUm what to determine how to how to equalize the way languages are handled across the district there apparently handled a couple of different ways amongst the various elementary schools and um there was a very interesting presentation about it and the board wants to make it the same across the district there were three options presented\nUm there are they're they're pretty controversial um one is really to just perhaps status ... only as lonely language or another would be to continue in a in a variety of different ways\nThat that it was a cheap because it's something I always wanted to investigate them and I want that to happen one of the thing that was on the journalist signed it and it's clearly a controversial topic is language um and it is something that actually was on one doctor parties attractive he's um roadhouse actually it was and I know she was assigned to do when she first came on board actually\nUm went to determine how to how to equalize the way languages are handled across the district because they're apparently handled a couple of different ways amongst the various elementary schools and um there was a she did have a very interesting presentation about it and the board wants to make it the same across the district there were three options presented\nUm there are they're they're pretty controversial\nUm one is really to just perhaps Spanish only is the only language\nA another would be to continue in a in a variety of different ways\nUm which would allow Mandarin and Italian I'm at the elementary level even starting his youngest kindergarten which is what we have now and in various ways and people feel program and the floods program\nAnd then there's another option and it's an interesting it's an interesting controversial topic because it costs a lot of money and it just even changing is going to cost a lot of money\nUm and I am in favor of of achieving charity and end up on the other hand on the same on the same in the same breath I also do not want to level down\nOf course not and and you know and and I want to make sure that we're not labeling down\nUm because that is something that we have to be careful that we're not doing 'em and you know in one of the arguments that was made was you know well so so much of our population is Hispanic and that's not the point it just becomes a big portion of our population first of all that the city is not\nYou look at the ... the city because of the city's not heavily Hispanic ... yes but this was a school is published in the city\nSo you can't just cater to what's in the desert to look at the publisher the city and and that's not what's not in the highest demand in in the district for\nSeveral years to ask the Italian ... and so we have to look it will be All right we could achieve yeah it's interesting actually wow I didn't know that yeah so you have to you know on the other hand\nNot necessarily so we have to look at but on the other hand you know a lot of people argue with Spanish they'd be more useful but so it's a complicated topic it's a very complicated topic\nBut I like we like I should say new on top of my twenty I Want to give you a chance to the French so we had a caller earlier said that you advocated but these are my words because they don't remember exactly the coals words but violent civil war\nI Do not advocate violence or why is that people need to be alert for violent civil war okay so I'm not exactly who said it I think I wasn't listening but I suspect I Know who\nHe did oh okay okay so you're treating with respect\nBut but I said people need to be looked for it because I think that there's there's a level of violence and disrespect it's that's occurring in this country that is reaching an astronomical level and for example look what happened to Senator Cruz last week look what happened to ... Sanders in the restaurant last a couple\nOf months I just listen to be here before they think really showing one side we have this woman came forward a weather wouldn't believe it or not separate issue a she talked to move out of our house\nLook what happened to Senator Cruz last week look what happened to them is Sandra vendor Sanders Sanders and the restaurant list a couple\nOf months I was also a little outrageous will be here before they think we're only showing one side or I'm we have this woman came forward or whether one believes or not is a separate issue uh she got to move out of our house\nSo it's not laughable to say that now what about square and how do you know he was born in a and I don't know how you can tell the boy from a girl that I Want to know um how do you how did you couldn't get here\nWill scored waxing and squirt we will not know what sport is I'm a sea turtles you know they live like to be eighty sixty eighty years and they don't ... really reveal their gender until they're in their teens and so we don't know we we have to use the print on it for\nFor for ... because we don't really know if it's a boy or girl he and his and we know how because of the uh the program has is a ... that brought squirt here as a as a loan program based at the north Carolina or North Carolina aquarium in Pinedale shores and they monitor ness they know where the turtle nests are and when there's a hatch\nThey they inspect enough to make sure that everyone got\nOut okay and that they all went the right way into the sea that some of them weren't drawn by lights into like a hotel parking lot\nAnd so they rescue these little stranded hatchlings and this loan program allows them to sort of um [noise] send them out to different institutions and and we were fortunate enough to get one this year and that allows us to um display a young very young turtle and also\nI'm at that lets us ... you know raise that ... that are stationed with our guests about sea turtle conservation\nWell now let's go back to square in a little bit now how big was it when you guys court\nSquirt was adorable score it was only about three or four inches across or just you know ... ... in the palm of your hand small and uh and the year since so we've had scored here for almost exactly a year squirt is is about you know\nKind of a big dinner platter ... dinner plate size so and then kind of exciting part of that is not you know they the pine needles shores aquarium in North Carolina could have just picked scored up and put it in the ocean\nBut um you know when they're that small they're very vulnerable to predators are and so the so now a year later with squirt as big as it is\nAnd has a much better chance of survival when we put it into the ocean in two weeks how big will they get\nA ... a ... a score it as a loggerheads sea turtles and it can get up to about you know to between two hundred and fifty three hundred pounds they can they can can grow pretty big\nSet and and and in his teens is one he she find out whether or not they will you know\nOr you know a boy or girl\nBut I'm Sorry say that again not when he reaches when it reaches its teams then we know it's a boy or girl right\nEr but at the dinner plate size so and then kind of exciting\nPart of that is not you know they the pine needles shores aquarium in North Carolina could have just picked scored up and put it in the ocean but um you know whether that small they're very vulnerable to predators are and so the so now a year later with squirt as big as it is and has a much better chance\nOf survival when we put it into the ocean in two weeks how big will they get\nA ... a ... a score it as a loggerheads sea turtles and it can get up to about you know to between two hundred and fifty three hundred pounds they can they can can grow pretty big\n... and and and in his teens is one he she find out whether or not they will you know\nOr you know a boy or girl\nI'm Sorry say that again not when\nHe reaches when we did the teams that we know it's a boy or girl\nRight and um yeah I Will never you know ... ... well but we will never quite know 'em and let it come back and I'm sure the square knows right now but uh it's hard to tell a just by visually looking at a at a baby sea turtles or whether it's male or female\nI feel bad for them it is eight forty two what else you're going to be talking about that's fascinating stuff how do we avoid a sea turtle a B what else would you be talking about today and of course we're talking about the show a ten o'clock in the ... the birth he's with us right now but you buy the maritime aquarium in Norwalk, Connecticut what else will you be talking about today\nWell the other thing that's very interesting that's been going on in the ... helped sort of in a wind up were you at some of our staff went up to testify in Hartford, Connecticut to the state legislature to get a bill passed to lead off start picking up abandoned lobster pots there um I you know the numbers are in the thousands of abandoned and lost\nUh I think they're called ghost lobster pots all across Long Island sound\nThat are still sort of functioning to trap animals or even though there is no one there to you know to\nPull up to boil it up and so uh when we've gotten permission 'em to start trying to retrieve some of these ghost lobster pots that are causing issues out in the water but not that whole left them there\nYou know that's a good I think that's my first question to him I guess I think that either a they were some somehow you know sometimes I think they just get lost like they get disconnected but I think also in the mid Nineteen nineties when the lobster industry collapsed in Long Island sound\nI suspect that some of them were just intentionally ... you know cut the you know they cut from the boys and just sort of left there so\nI mean that's my first question is how you know why are they are so many of them out there are but I yeah I think those are probably the two causes accidental end intentional\nEight forty three you know while we've had you on over these last many months we've talked about everything from backyard bugs hurdles and be and and\nWhat's your big thing is we enter into winter I mean I'm curious as we get into the fall of them went to what will change in terms of what you do or what would you be focusing\nIn the aquarium well actually that's a big question and we actually have a an issue where there's a ... if you've been to the aquarium there's a railroad bridge is actually the metro north line the Amtrak Northeast Corridor lined that sort of divides are building the aquarium itself from our IMAX theater building and that bridge\nIs a swing bridge to let boats sail boats and other things go through and it keeps getting stuck open if anyone has a commuter they may have been stuck on a friday afternoon because this bridge has has begun stuck open so they're going to replace it and it's such a huge project\nThat actually will require the loss of our IMAX theatre in twenty Nineteen and so and also we need to worry about some of the animals are that will be impacted by the sound or um you know potentially things falling off cranes so this fall we're actually starting um you know to to\nIn the aquarium well actually um but that's a big question and we actually have a an issue where there's a ... have you been to the aquarium there's a railroad bridge is actually the metro north lined the Amtrak Northeast Corridor lined that sort of divides are building they Graham itself from our IMAX

now to have you know they're going to reach out to me now it goes back let's talk about why his or her out you know what his options are to that loved one you know\nWhen they're coming out of rehabilitation and looking for some sort of assisted living or independent living or they're trying to figure it out\nIn the classic situation\nI have a love me it's an in law baby's uncle that she's responsible work I don't know the rest of the colleges called back must be eliciting I uh ... you know and again who ... who is on the line\n[laughter]\nFunny that it's all done I think I Believe you can put them on your part of an Hi John you there\nHello Hi John said that ah anybody who's listening that John Kerry he it'd be administrator of none of us is living up what burned I'm blocking John glad to join us this morning I'm Glad to be here\nSo we want it sounds like John on because there are ... are not argue assisted living for those that are looking for a little extra help it to maintain their independent and less secure stimulating environment are assisted living facility also has a memory care\nWhich is our strength free environment where those living with dementia or Alzheimer's um can get that that's all I Can't that's required for those living with my grandparents um and and also has the assisted living peace as I say John why don't you tell us a little about that on you\nAnd I'm also about the million dollar innovations which has is\nSure a submitted view is a one hundred and three unit or assisted living residence licensed by the New York State Department of health\nUh to provide assisted living services so um what is assisted living a is not your typical institutional nursing home type of setting it's more of a home like setting where um people who may need some assistance with their activities of daily living\nLike for example grooming showering dressing preparing food\nUh but aren't in need of intensive medical services uh can live in a home like setting where they can get assistance with all of the above so [noise] uh your typical assisted living resident excluding the memory care for a moment is a someone who needed help with those kind of things but\nUh designate the the more intensive medical services we can\nUh build in services are up to it including\nA nursing care but uh typically someone's coming in where they need help with\nOther activities of daily living and we're providing that they're also getting three meals a day there's a recreational program we have lots of activities and trips out in the community and the city uh so it's a it's a it's a more rounded in stimulating environment than for someone to be at home with me at for example\nAnd I think we also provide do housekeeping trip to the supermarket you didn't see the ads and those kind of everyday things that they may need that aren't able to drive\nDo we do there's a twenty four hour concierge service so uh if someone needs anything at any time of day or night they can hold out to protest but we also do have um a laundry at housekeeping services to our trips out ah for fun things or recreational activities but\nAs a up to it including\nA nursing care but uh typically someone's coming in where they need help with\nTheir activities of daily living and we're providing that they're also getting three meals a day there's a recreational program we have lots of activities in trips out in the community and the city [noise] ah so it's a it's a it's a more rounded in stimulating environment than for someone to be at home with me for example\nAnd I think we also provide do we do housekeeping and trip to the supermarket you didn't see the ads and those kind of everyday things that they may need that aren't able to drive\nWhere do we do there's a twenty four hour concierge service so uh if someone needs anything at any time of day or night they can hold out at the protest but we also do have um\nA laundry and housekeeping services to our trips out ah for fun things recreational activities but also a supermarket drug store that kinda thing so we we've got the whole package\nAnd it's and and it's a beautiful facility I have to say if you haven't been yeah and and are interested in any part of our kids you know care particularly a tour of now the way they vacancies you can visit our website at W. W. W. dot warts burn it back to W. A. R. T. B. S. and boy you are ... dot org\nOr you can call nine zero eight hundred and ask for John or John what is your direct\nMy extension is to five to\nThat would be nine months for five months three to five to correct [laughter]\nA much better to kind of lay the groundwork even whether you think you need it or not they can maybe approaching it uh you know come in and take a tour do an application put your name on the waitlist it's a you know you'll be you'll be glad you did with the times got\nJohn because there is Phoebe everything in there and you know private pay as well as you know not moving Medicaid or Medicare benefits 'em in jail can speak to this as well because he doesn't actually planning but so we hope with that as well somebody has those kinds of questions\nSure absolutely um you know we we have more than just matter of you here on the campus so sometimes people come in whether it's a financial issue or a critical issue they may be looking for assisted living in this is not the right program for them we have\nA plethora of other services here that we can refer to so uh what do you come in looking for a nursing home or an assisted living with the daycare program right they if if it's not the right fit for you it can certainly point you made the right direction\nBut let me interject something we spend more time at home\nWhat people have to realize as you say if I don't like which was a crisis situation right so what I always tell science and you have to craft and that's something we always look for whatever we do whether it be all home life for business life or anything else but they are best practice\nBut that is well if somebody has those kinds of questions\nSure absolutely um you know we we have more that just made up your hair the capital sometimes\nPeople come in whether it's a financial issue or a clinical issue they may be looking for assisted living in this is not the right program for that we have a plethora of other services here that we can refer to so uh what do you come in looking for a nursing\nHome or an assisted living on a day care program right they if if it's not the right fit for you it can certainly point you made the right direction\nBut let me interject something we spend more time in\nOn what people have to realize as you said it's it's not a light switch unless it's a crisis situation right so what I always tell science and ... and just as a best practice and that's something we always look for whatever we do whatever your home life for business life or anything else about\nTheir best practice so one of the best practices is always just start to establish checklist I what am I looking for what why and I was there a big fan of check out a very type I I I like the headlines so I have two types of people but\nI Try to press best to uh\nYou know clients whether it be you know I'm you know early on whether it be children you know they have to address issues for parents because they have concerns they have concerns you know Ken rom continue to be home she's owned by yourself five days a week whatever else it maybe maybe there's a better alternative she started cooking in Russia\nAnd its goals objectives ah sometimes called the amount of critical facts and assumptions 'cause I assume this but you know what\nMy assumption could be a rock and a lot of people's sanctions about you know metal you or assisted living facilities in what they are very\nUntil they go to visit I so you got to put together you know some follow checklists of of of what's available and in that checklist when you go to matter of you and you sit down on the checklist and they can be a list of assets and income\nBy it but it's a basic situation when you start to say OK here is what we have and here's how much money we taken every month\nAnd that money could be for pension that might be from Social Security could be from\nIt may be coming from rental properties which which people or whatever it is this a flow of income and then\nAsset so what ends up happening is you know a person like myself or the or the advisors a matter of you to start to project out All right you can come out you know you could live here\nWith his projected expenses for the rest of your life or you can live here you know four five six seven years whatever it may be but it it's it's a it's a financial planner\nAnd it's a financial planner in incorporate air by adding a because one thing that does you know that I always tell people is not always going to get better certain issues you get better about another condition you know\nDegenerative and actually you don't need a little bit for care and then you need a little bit for care and ask for things that you know the facility offers a the facility that I was working with last week and I as I can sell to their level one level to level three and then there are whole menu of\nOptions it's got to be a very similar situation at metal ... you know of course was going to go in and they pretty much level one but we expect him to be able to within a year right\nAnd and all our care and John ... says well in his personal life you know when you work with the family as well as the residents to provide the level of care that they individual what they need that plant it's on the correction\nPeople is not always going to get better certain issues you get better about another conditions you know\nDegenerative and actually you don't need a little bit more care and then you need a little bit for care desperate things that you know the facility offers a the facility that I was working with last week and I as I can sell to their level one level to level three and then there are whole menu of\nOptions it's got to be a very similar situation at metal you ... you know of course was going to go in and they pretty much level one but we expect him to be leveled within a year right\nAnd and all our care and John ... says well in his personal life you know when you work with the family as well as non resident to provide the level of care that they individually or they will at that plant it's on the correction\nYes exactly we have like you're describing we have three levels of care which incorporate medication assistance and activities of daily living but then we also have\nA a what's called an enhanced or assisted living license so in in the old days and assisted living when someone reached the point where they were\nA confined to a wheelchair or they were depending on medical equipment like oxygen recap it or something like that uh there were no lawyer dirt or they were deemed by the department of health no longer\nAppropriate for assisted living so I had to leave that to go to a nursing facility so I'm about seven or eight years ago the department of health a lab facilities to apply for something called an enhanced assisted living residence license which we do have\nAnd it allows people age at play so if somebody gets to the point where they're dependent on a piece of medical equipment or they're in a wheelchair or something like that they don't necessarily have to leave and that's an important piece because\nUh people used to be worried that always if this or that happens to me I can no longer saying is that the loving residents but that's changed and you can now uh we can accommodate a you know people who are more medically compromise that me cut in the past\nOkay now I'm going to come in from a slang [laughter] All right [noise] ah you run into you know there was even talk about\nNecessitate it there's a thing called your Ira physicians for\nAll the way she basically tells you what made you what this person actually needs and the and the match the they're not as a second piece perhaps planners perspective\nA board bird and all these you know and especially the nursing home there's a medic aid so this is something that you know accept Medicaid ... ah\nThis is something that's very important right when I talk to individuals talk about the trend you know deep stages of air so theoretically we have to you know if a person's and down their assets on a you know in ...\nAssisted living facility and now become eligible for Medicaid there is a great he's not going to a room and board act in assisted living facility but it does pay room and\nAt the nursing home so even though you may be radically changed rooms from you know ... a room date but if you need is no care\nFor their care you don't have to look at it I feel your life is not being disrupt so whenever I consult and I talked to the plate especially when you are and read at least a matrix of the Medicaid Medicaid for the long term care facilities\nThat's that's one of the beauty as a sport I really think that's what sets us apart is that you know her family in the house right at the financial today and then add a painting and mental and fulfill the loved one editor resident Frank\nNow become eligible for Medicaid there is a threat is not going to a room and board act in assisted living facility but it does pay room and\nAt the nursing home so even though you may be radically changed rooms from you know ... aid room date but if you need that additional care\nFor their care you don't have to look good I feel your life is not being disruptive or whatever I consult and I talked to people a recession you lose your eye and read at least a matrix of the medical Medicaid for the long term care so\nThat's that's one of the beauty of Fort Bragg I really think that's what sets us apart is that you\nKnow her family has a house right at the financial piece of it and then they're in pain and mental fulfilled a loved one editor resident Frank I'm that can be your perfect weather so hold on to 'em\nYou know at at work or you you have the ability to segue from one level of care to another without is correct and having to find another place and move your loved one and you know and that becomes a very um that\nThat engenders a lot of faith and family members when they have to move their loved ones slender facility and they don't have to do that for her and they can they can segue try continuum of care and I know John you have like two seconds between the states when eating right\nAh that's okay yeah I I've been I've been at war for Thirteen Years and I've seen people\nUh do exactly what we're talking about a few people start you know even in the independent living and the looming villages or independent\nOr area that we have here progress through metal view they may make use of a home care services are subject to rehab at some point in a transition to the nursing facility uh ultimately so I've seen\nIt in my time there are many people kind of go right through the continuum now you may not start at one extreme and they wind up at the other but um I've seen people\nDo this kind of a thing come in at one point and then moved to another uh and and be able to say on the campus\nRight once again and ... of the war [laughter] now I wanted to interject something because of what you were talking about the findings of\nIndividuals the unfortunately sometimes a and there are for profit facilities that over ... abilities yes and they ... they look like you're moving into a old how sometimes the care weapons uh\nYou know they do their own PR uh I you know and this is an important

fake coughing phones to convince me was sick right for the next few days of the nation might not be there don't overnight on our holiday thinking anyway huh [laughter]\nBut yeah if I can I ask what happened with the I'm a ...\nA co-op legislation is pending um uh we uh have people trickle in um most meetings to speak on at one or two people um but uh it I'm not sure I have to check the agenda and they'll get back to you Michel I Know what this what the anticipated action on that is\nThat you guys getting out of the co-op electorate than sending out letters western rec\nYeah what do they say\nWhich at the end of the day I think and the ... you know as as I said I'm I'm I told you guys I'm I'm totally for the I actually think it's done in ... that's with two\nYeah no real estate people definitely for it and\nWhat can I tell you know I don't want to be longer qualified with the ball field\nI live in a co-op yeah I Do I live in a coup [laughter] you know\nWhen you go to show that a lot and you have a legitimate fire\nAnd you'll you'll boils down to the ... and the ... and after four months have gotten into it as to why can't you know why that\nWould turning him down why you don't have to tell you get to try to keep paying the maintenance and even though you know learn to live in do you know I think if you have an owner and several get straight down ... who had a fight because they aren't we didn't get credit\nYou're going to want to know why why do you know if you want to read and you pay the ... that ... and ... and and I'll be fine with waiting I got that for much you know that it ah\nI think I say I think the only the only people benefit by that is not going to\n... to have that kind of have to work a little harder right [laughter]\nYeah well see I I'll let you know what happens with that one\n... act guys you advocate\nUm I guess it depends how you word it on the job application yeah\nBut what is he a law that says no law you can't actually about criminal history at all\nOh showed otherwise it makes it that way whether it's a show on after ... after the criminal background\nRight there are certain exceptions uh you know like um I Believe a law enforcement you know as one you know municipalities are accepted from it you know jobs that require it you know a clearance or of any kind\nOf what they consider a limited to a felony in a way you don't have to report it much but I don't know that I I just wondering about\nThat I haven't I find a quiet I have more questions and I think that the walk my ex even explain I for example if somebody comes and says that you don't want a job and stuff and you know you can't ask them were there but maybe he's on parole you mean by that time I\nSaw somebody that search for a long period of time [noise] you know\nIf it's somebody is not my role there might be a circumstances in which they actually have to meet with their parole officer during a you know business ... I don't know yeah you know so\nIt's a complicated issue it really is\nIt is and look I'm the type of guy I'm I'm all for giving people a second chance I've had second chances in life so I I think if I operated business\nYou know it probably wouldn't be like a targeted class of people that I look to employ but I I don't think it would exclude me from hiring someone I've I've worked with people in politics [laughter] you know big convicted of crimes you know so um you know it happens in jail [laughter]\nAnyway thanks for the call they get so anyway that's kind of a rundown of what's been going on here in Westchester County and you've taken collectively I think that that these these things signal and intent by the county board of legislators to really take an historical deep dive into the\nBusiness of of small business which is really the the driver of jobs at small business is not the big corporations that really employee most people and um you know so uh well I figured that\nPoint that it really is and and the and the ones that that's such a thin margin in profits but now they're given more paperwork more regulations\nAnd were restraints and race directions on how they do their job that you know and it's just a county you know Matt just interrupt you instead of you know that has a district attorney's office of never goes after white collar crimes ... it's always blue collar or\nOr or you know or the poor you know like they're going after any and they have a ... you know that's\nOn here in Westchester County and you've taken collectively I think that that these these things signal and intent by the county board of legislators to really take an historical deep dive into the business of of small business which is really\nThe the driver of jobs to small business is not the big corporations that really employee most people and um you know so uh well I Am pretty good at point\nYeah it really is and and the and the ones who are that's such a thin margin in profits but now they're given more paperwork more regulations\nAnd more restraints strictures on how they do their job or any other you know and it's just a county you know Matt just interrupt to instead of them you know that has a district attorney's office it never goes after white collar crimes print it's always blue collar or\nYou know or or you know or the poor you know like they're going after the ... and they have a ... you know that so many departments over there that are just name plates with empty officers you know consumer affairs what the heck did they do\nThey're actually very much a engaged now and ramping up that's where Jim ... now the director of consumer affairs\nOkay well let's wait that's all about it and then indeed yeah human rights but another another over bloated bureaucracy that one had been a while if you don't mind the way we're all for human rights aren't we now but they say that commission has kind of halfway\nBogus well all I mean if

wave has where that came through Westchester counties that these things to be addressed yeah you get what you vote for and we're kind of seen now what this looks like an action um my one concern is that\nYou know look we have a new Tappan Zee bridge it's going to be much easier to get in and out of Rockland County uh Connecticut and the way that is\nOne bad has ugly [laughter]\nI mean it's just ugly I you know it's an ugly bridge I'm not has not stood appeal at all\nYeah I'm I'm a I'm a real functional reform when it comes to like our ranchers\nRamp I guess yeah I you know All right I I Do notice that I I certainly noticed it especially when it was pretty much done and the Tappan Zee was right next to it I noticed how quaint that happened it looked like a little railroad no but I'm

Britain she actually my other daughter being a lawyer at the end I\nSuffer the same you know all the bad thing to do with lawyers and my daughter Nicole social worker she pays for\nThe Kony who've done it before and they were long time and she knows the way around the courtroom he was saying briefly that rather than to be that the most women who say that the old new allegations are a hundred percent true\nThey by and large the vast majority of sexual allegations the actual cases\nA good degree of integrity honestly you know more about that you have a lot of\nFriends you know I I have to say that I disagree that too much of a blanket statement and you have to every case within the context of this on situation just this week I resolved I came with no arrest because they cooperated with the investigating police officers\nAnd my daughter Nicole social worker she pays for our sins\nOf the corny who've done it before I'm Stacey who were long time but she does a way around the corner he was saying briefly the route of the center most women who say that the all these allegations are a hundred percent true\nThey by and large the vast majority of sexual allegations of sexual cases\nSignificant degree of well integrity honestly you know more about that you as a lot of friends\nYou know I I have to say that I I agree that too much of a blanket statement you know you have to said every case within the context of its own situation just this week\nI resolved a case with no arrest because the cooperated with the investigating police officers and investigating district attorney's office and young lady had made an allegation against five young men and uh it was actually fall\nThey went in they were openly interviewed by everybody would just something ... typically against our grain and when they went into her background as well she had made a false allegations you cover her but because she didn't want to meet her boyfriend at a particular place and so she\nMade up this accusation to cover where she was she she almost ruined the young men watch what was really frightening\nWe've had that before in case there are exceptions to the rule\nAnd you know you you know you've had a very interesting case that you know that a with a rapper that was accused of rape years ago and it was actually mistaken identity another man had looked like him told the woman at a bar that he with the rapper\nAnd she had sex with him and then she came from a rape and the guy wasn't even in the country\nAnd we did have to establish that yeah but those are the exceptions to the rules by and large\nAnd I don't want to create a situation where we did the me too movement is based upon horrible experiences have been a woman and uh\nIt's not a simple easy just to give it a blanket approach toward\nMe to shouldn't be a blanket approach I agree with that either you know and I think that we need to be quite careful I mean we leave their case by case basis everything is a case by case basis and sometimes people are literally in the same situation and can perceive things totally differently and\nAnd then you don't know that you don't know really\nWho's position you're supposed to take one person feels wrong and that person needs to be addressed but isn't necessarily criminal I I think we have a caller Len from Tribeca lend you're on the air\nHello hello hello you're on the air Oh hi good afternoon how are you happy birthday thank you thank you\nI I question um you know obviously there are you guys were just talking about how each case by case by case basis\nAnd you've been in the ... you know you've been around criminal cases for for a long time very long as you know so you know these these allegations ... and not say whether the writer they're wrong I'm interested in your experience over a long period of time\nAre there are a lot of cases where [noise] it's I guess it's about thirty or thirty five thirty five years later where ... ... no one has mentioned anything about it at all and then you know these things\nI'm pop up I understand from what I've written the papers that you know her turtles or her diaries or you know and at her therapist records are are considered um you know to be good evidence and in these kinds of cases but you know in general is a sort of thing that that has happened and is it is it free nurses extremely rare what'd\nYou do if you're asking a criminal attorney whether this has happened it's really not fear because if it was thirty\nAnd you've been in the ... you you know you've been around criminal cases for for a long time very long as you know so you know these these allegations ... and not say whether they're writer they're wrong I'm interested in your experience over a long period of time\nAre there are a lot of cases where [noise] it's I guess it's about thirty or thirty five thirty five years later where you know no one has mentioned anything about it at all and then you have these things\nI'm pop up I I understand from what I've written the papers that you know her journals or her diaries or you know and and her therapist records are are considered um you know to be good evidence and in these kinds of cases but you know in general is this the sort of thing that that has happened and is it is it ... is extremely rare but\nYou know if you're asking a criminal attorney whether this has happened it's really not fair because if it was thirty five years ago we could not prosecutor defended because the case would never be brought was the statute of limitations especially here in New York\nSo it couldn't be thirty five years old if you're talking within the statutory period old cases to surface they could we surfacing up to five years on a certain date or in some instances the surface if it's a young person involved a five years after\nTheir arrival at the age of consent of or Twenty one years of age at which episode ...\nAnd it comes from all kinds of circumstance that thirty five years would not be the basis of criminal charges and in those circumstances\nSo you're saying all these guys with their you know in the year book the references to I mean you know whether it's you know a a quaint lewd and all the things that they were talking about none of these guys have any any actual criminal ... criminal\n... of it all done absolutely none all they can do is say whether they happened or not and it's not you know the interesting thing about the inquiry that the FBI is making its not a criminal inquiry\nAs a result there's no if whatever they say may not necessarily be charged under the thousand to one ties late teens statute which says ... federal agencies to climb\nThis is an inquiry and that's all it is they can talk or choose not to talk to the FBI and by the way you can always choose not to talk to the investigative agency you do not\nHave to talk to the FBI there's no mandate about\nAnd the usual response as well as they do if I don't talk to the FBI\nThey'll think I have something to hide well when it comes to talk to you they already know what the answers are in the criminal case in this case when they're making inquiry\nThere just fooling around with it though I think they're going to get anything on this case I doubt very much simply because everybody is becoming very defensive and everything is that the president and the Senate a\nPreconceived views they're going ahead and they don't care what the result is and that's quite clear they ask you I have not finished her investigation and these guys are

of lower in America and the full who disagrees with me can disagree all he wants and be part of all he wants the nothing more than a fool if he does not\nThe FBI have not finished her investigation and these guys are talking about passed the law and get him on the on the bench as soon as possible\nAnd I find out atrocious I find the president's conduct atrocious in this case is destroyed the rule of lower in America and the bull who disagrees with me can disagree all he wants and be part of all he wants the nothing more than a full if he does that\nHuge drop off of drunk driving accident but out in suburban communities where people are used to their aspect of independence it really remain the problem I mean there was no reason for this young man to to be killed for these five boys to be entered in the one to live this life that it's really\nTragic and what really awful and now the gentleman who was driving he made himself the fine person but this one choice has had an impact from which there is no repair\nSo that is really the purpose of our drunk driving laws not so much to the abusive but to make sure that that doesn't happen the whole point is to send a message to the community that drunk driving will be dealt with differently so that others don't meet the fate of these young boys you\nKnow our society has a dichotomy how it handles\nYears ago we had the prohibition we saw that did not work\nEven not to drive drunk is a method of prohibition to some extent but it's a message that has some validity to be applied\nThat you can't even get behind the wheel if you've had even one or two drinks well you know the ... and little dog and now\nThere's another issue now that we're coming into phase of legalization of marijuana and you know that you have the evolution that you can take blood tests um after there was some sort of accident or something but what alterations it's not going to have it may not even be even be as evident as the telltale signs of alcohol\nSo that's a concern as well because it's illegal drug use people driving on Fox he caught and I mean this is not just an alcohol question this is a drug question\nWith alcohol drugs more about the glove and you want to call somebody else a sauce [noise]\nThe concepts of prohibition is is well it's optical years ago I pick up the position in favor of legalization of all drugs I still feel that way but of the opinion that if we take legalization of drugs we must suspend all life is a person is used\nWell I Know I I think that the restrictions that you lose your licence people complain to us that they all I Can't believe I'm suspended I'm like well to Dr all intoxicated it is a privilege is not a right to drive period\nThat's lord of the state of New York\nTo have it may not even be even be as evident as the telltale signs of alcohol so that the concern as well because it's illegal drug use people driving on Fox he caught and I mean this is not just an alcohol question this is a drug question\nWell alcohol the drug definitely more nothing less than you want to call somebody else a stock\nThe concepts of prohibition is is well it's optical years ago I've taken a position in favor of legalization of all drugs I still feel that way but of the opinion that if we take legalization of drugs we must spend all life is a person is used\nWell I Know I I think that the restrictions that you lose your life people complain to us that they well I Can't believe them spend it in like well to Dr all intoxicated it is a privilege it is not a right to drive period\nThat's lord of the state of New York it's a privilege to be allowed the individual or citizens of the state do you use the roads\nTo cut their car no matter if they have a job or not\nAnd you have to wonder sometime people really thinking I'm not trying to\nThink the problem is that alcohol or drugs what have you there all the guy like that you think you're fine if they could just fine I'm sure that when he got into the car you didn't think he was he thought he was okay to handle it\nBut it clearly he was not but\nWhat happened ... years ago they were talking about um there's obviously alcoholics very that's about all kinds of the day people get behind the wheel weren't they talking about possibly you know doing a a breathalyzer test and certainly I cars that you can\nPut there was

terms of the damage done but the fact that the entire drunk driving science as we know it and that's prosecuting the court to the fall science so would I think people are trying to do the best they can with it but the issue really should be whether or not you know just call the damn kept calling Hoover\nOn that you have to have that judgment right you can't you have to talk about alcohol take

so the concept here is if you have a nice\nThe Westchester legend Herman guy [noise]\nAll right so you're still there\nYes I Am Herman okay talk about what are your favorite ...\nWell I was starting to talk about a bill called the uh affectionately known as the top tier Protection Act um you know modern Tex ... technology or\nSometimes works sometimes doesn't then sometimes it works for some people and not for others were trying to figure out who the ... totally system is working for a governor has promoted it as a way to where you know speed traffic a cut down on air pollution 'cause you don't have cars stopping it tolls\nBut also saves money because you don't have told takers out there who have to get paid and who ended up getting pensions and things like that [noise]\nUm and um so the concept here is if you have an easy pass you drive through at or whatever the speed limit is you know you might be driving through with thirty five miles an hour oh fifty miles an hour or whatever it is\nAnd if you don't then there is a camera they don't take a picture of your license plate and that license plate picture will be fed into a computer compared to the state records then you'll get a bill in the mail\nAnd it all sounds great it just hasn't been happening that way\nAnd I'm the Tappan Zee bridge I'm now the crossing called Mario Cuomo bridge um it was the first to to try this and my comment has been when we had toll taker is on the Tappan Zee\nUh everything was working well now that we have a a casual is on the Cuomo we have chaos um at least for some people um and and that's what a senator um\nUm [noise] uh yeah right [laughter] from uh from Rockland County um yeah I mean he's either to us his name just wouldn't totally ride of my head right oh let me know feedback loop I'm looking\n... thank you [noise] um I work closely with him on several bills and we work closely on this one [noise] um and so what we were trying to do is address some of the problems what we found was that there were a lot of people especially early on who claimed to have not gotten the toll bill in the mail\nAnd claimed to have not gotten the second told bill in the mail\nAnd or even the third one and then they finally got one that was looking for six hundred dollars for crossing the bridge a first told you know it was five dollars if you don't pay within a certain period of time it jumps to ten dollars then it jumps to a hundred then it jumps to six hundred so strangely they got the ones that were for six hundred but they never got any of the others they claim\nSo you know but there were so many of them and it was all over the Internet and there was that you know you you after a while you start to believe that this isn't just a few people who were trying to game the system\nAnd this is a real problem um and there was so we met with the department of a you know the thruway authority people and and whatever and we had lots of conversation we just weren't getting anywhere so we passed a bill\nThat said you know that said laid out a process as to what they're what they're supposed to do how they're going to you know the smell Liza notices out and also prohibiting them\nFrom the ultimate step that they were permitted to do which is to have the department of motor vehicles suspend somebody's registration and they were these horrendous stories about people crossing bridges down in New York City the state police having you know having the computerized the capability to\nLook at license plates quickly and and then see that oh that one's suspended that registration suspended they pull people over\nPeople's St suspended for what they said well you didn't pay you're told what told we didn't get any notices well yes you did get out of the car registration suspended you can't drive the car they told the car away\nLots of conversation we just weren't getting anywhere so we passed a bill that said you know that said laid out a process as to what they're what they're supposed to do how they're going to you know the smell Liza notices out and also prohibiting them\nFrom the ultimate step that they were permitted to do which is to have the department of motor vehicles suspend somebody's registration and they were these horrendous stories about people crossing bridges down in New York City the state police having you know having the computerized the capability to\nLook at license plates quickly and and then see that oh that was suspended that registration suspended they pull people over\nPeople Hussein suspended for what they said well you didn't pay your tolls what told so we didn't get any notices well yes you did get out of the car registration suspended you can't drive the car they told the car away leave the people on the side of the road or on the bridge or wherever\nAnd so we thought that was not the way they should be handled you shouldn't lose your registration on your car I haven't suspended because you can pay your tolls or you know if you're if you're shown to be an intentional Scott floor maybe that's a little different situation\nBut by and large people you know in the situation most New Yorkers will pay their bills pay their told but they're not given the opportunity to pay it in cash and so they have to get caught in this whole system of getting something in the mail and having to get out a check or go to the you know get a money order and and whatever\nUm and so we pass this legislation that would that would change the system and and prohibit the suspension of of registrations just because somebody didn't pay their their ... pay their tolls and it would also set up a system from fairness you know so there'd be a way to appeal\nAnd for people to to have somebody to ... to negotiate with and say wait a minute you know I didn't get this stuff what are you talking about\nSo we tried to make the system fair and it's still sitting there waiting to go to the governor and we're hopeful that the governor's gonna gonna sign this legislation especially now that cash was totally new spreading\nYou know they're they're already using it down in New York City on some of the some of the tolls down there and they're now and they just put it into effect in some places on the thruway so the plan is to go state wide with this cash was polling\nAnd um the ... the company that is doing this is called can't do it\nAnd they are one of the few there's only a handful of these companies that do this they're one of the few that goes nationwide\nBut there have been reports all across the country of problems with the system\nI'm now look I don't know if it's a company I don't know if it's the software I don't know if this is a you know maybe this is just a very difficult task but it should not be such that people are being penalized or if it's through no fault of their own they don't get the bills so um [laughter] we're trying to get this thing pass\nA my my solution to this also is put back one toll booth and if people want to sit in line to paying cash they should have the right to paying cash\nYou know there are a lot of poor people out there who just don't have the money I Know it's hard to believe for most middle class people but there are a lot of you know working class people who go from paycheck to paycheck who may have the five dollars in their pocket when they cross the bridge\nBut at the end of the month if they get a forty dollar bill or a fifty dollar bill\nDon't have the money set aside and uh you know they don't have checking accounts they don't have a way to or they don't have credit cards so [laughter] very concerned about the policy behind all of this and that's why we pass the bill and we're hoping the governor's gonna sign the bill and help correct some of the problems here when are you going to get to the government\nI don't know I've been pressing the speaker to send it to him I Would like to see it happen um but I guess they have a list of bills that the going first\nAnd they're working their way through it um just hopefully do it soon I'm you know I've had bills that were sent to the governor I I often will carry young so controversial\nJust don't have the money I Know it's hard to believe for most middle class people but there are a lot of you know working class people who go from paycheck to paycheck who may have the five dollars in their pocket when they cross the bridge\nBut at the end of the month if they get a forty dollar bill or a fifty dollar bill don't have the money set aside and uh you know they don't have checking accounts they don't have a way to or they don't have credit cards so very concerned about the policy behind all of this and that's why we pass the bill and we're hoping to govern who's going to sign the bill and help correct some of the problems here\nWhen are you going to get to the governor\n[noise] I don't know I've been pressing the speaker to send it to him I Would like to see it happen um but I guess they have a list the bills that the going first\nAnd they're working their way through it um just hopefully do it soon\nUm so you could be on the roads will Ashford avenue largely road and

you know and so it's\nIt it it's not an efficient way to do this\nOr they should be a municipal agreement and it's a missile agreement from all of those municipalities saying okay one of them is going to take care of the whole thing from one end of the other and everybody's going to jump into the costs\nAre but we haven't gotten to that point that would be sharing of responsibility um and I think that's the way to go hunting never going to get people to trade roads and say okay I'm not going to have this one any more hints yours you're responsible um\nWe get to how do we get to the ideal solution\n[noise] ah well look you and I have talked about this a long long time right I mean you know out out in other parts of the country they have only one government which is county government\nHas been a there's been a lot of noise about getting rid of county government in Westchester uh which has never happened and never will happen because there are some big things that costs too much for local governments to do\nYou remember the days when New Rochelle random sewage treatment plant in Yonkers ran the sewage treatment plant and we found well they're servicing the entire county\nHow is it that they're going to be paying for that so we went to the county\nAnd I think county government's been doing a pretty good job on those things are it's a big cost in a big job I don't know how we get to that I don't know I don't people don't want to give up their own local governments in fact I've got to edge hearing and Greenberg ... section wants to form its own ... its own village\nNow there hasn't been a village and green in in Westchester formed and many many years I guess the last one was what right Brooke right yup yeah um but that was you know that was a special circumstance\nI'm here edge one wants to us wants to break away I'm In and become the seventh village and Greenberg right then that would kinda diminished Greenberg side\nHis New Rochelle random sewage treatment plant in Yonkers ran the sewage treatment plant and we found well they're servicing the entire county\nHow is it that they're going to be paying for that so we went to the county\nAnd I think county government's been doing a pretty good job on those things are it's a big cost and a big job I don't know how we get to that I don't know I don't people don't want to give up their own local governments in fact I've got an edge on hearing and Greenberg judgment section wants to form its own ... its own village\nNow there hasn't been a village and green in in Westchester formed and many many years I guess the last one was what ... yeah\nYeah um but that was you know that was a special circumstance\nI'm here ... wants to us wants to break away\nUm and then become the seventh village and Greenberg right then that would kinda diminished Greenberg a size and inability to provide services in its unincorporated area but there's a debate going on on that right now it's in court actually\nBut in general how do you know what's the what's the right size of government I don't think anybody in their right mind would design today would design the system that we have\nBut trying to change it nobody wants to ... nobody wants to tackle that you know I've ... I've seen situations where two villages get together and say let's share republic worst commissioner and then the people rise up and say no no no we want we want our own public works commissioner well how about if we share a football team\nAnd two ... two high schools get together for a few years share a football team and lo and behold that gets rejected the next time around\nA so everybody talks about sharing a but nobody wants to do it\nSo I'm not sure how to do it Herman I just don't know how to do it um I I think we can make it a little bit more difficult I have a piece of legislation that's pending hasn't moved even through my house yet\nTo change to reform the way we formed villages in the state uh 'cause it's too easy\nUm the legislature did pass a new laws to make it easier to disband\nA government so that the government could be you know the areas can be absorbed by the larger government um which is a more efficient way to do things but we we I Can't yet get through legislation that would make it more difficult\nTo set up more governments um and look school districts people just don't want the they moved to an area because they like a particular school district that you know in Westchester County communities are defined by what school district you live in\nAnd then people don't want to combine them they don't want to disband them they don't want to do anything to them they they like and then they complain about the taxes why am I taxes so high\nI remember I remember Tom and Nineteen Seventy I thought it might be a good idea to have a county police force and so I helped a public meeting I go to the meeting there are two hundred and the women at the meeting men\nAnd women were saying shut up permanent do not know thing Herman I think I've told this story before they didn't want to have\nTheir children if they got in trouble go please commission and some place in ... so they voted that down and I think the thing thing happen today they would vote it down again today\nOh yes there's a difference in the way different communities treat their their uh you know accused\nAnd um and the ... very definitely there are some communities that treat their their hometown kids very differently than people who come in from the outside and some of this is racial or but it's not always just racial I mean I was a local prosecutor\nAnd I saw rubs me years ago and I saw that uh you know the the local people would be favored and um you know the others\nNot to Herman I think I've told this story before they didn't want to have their children if they got in trouble go to a police commissioner or some place in power so they voted that down and I think the thing thing happen today they would vote it down again today\nOh yes there's a difference in the way different communities treat their their uh you know accused\nAnd um and the ... very definitely there are some communities that treat their their hometown kids very differently that people come in from the outside and some of this is racial or but it's not always just racial I mean I was a local prosecutor\nAnd I saw rubs me years ago and I saw that uh you know to the local people would be favored\nAnd um you know the others would wouldn't you know they would get lesser tickets or you know if you knew the police officer maybe you wouldn't even get a ticket\nSo ah yeah it's all that that there's no question about that but I think the world is changed here a little bit which we're not we're not a you know the ... well not the Nineteen seventies Westchester anymore\nIt's now a much more crowded place it's much more expensive\nAnd I think we have to look at different ways of doing things but I don't I don't pretend to have the answer um you know I'm dealing with this one piece of legislation which I think would make things that would improve things but it's it's it's got to prevent more villages from happening it's not going to do anything about consolidating the\nPresident

high drama high impact\nWere asked to choose between two victims uh we had one very credible very powerful ah that testimony has also helped to raise awareness of of the plight of sexual assault victims has encouraged women to come forward with a accusations of sexual assault\nAnd then the other side and we had a witness who says he's a victim because of its slander campaign which there were parts of his testimony they were very credible there are others that he wasn't as [noise]\nFrom with his answers and even when you don't like the question and you go after the questioner he did that twice says two senators about the drinking habits\nSo meanwhile we have this investigation but the White House is saying a robotic lying on the White House counsel has told the FBI you can't talk to this person to that person that wait a minute hands off\nIf you're going to have an investigation let the FBI do the job and talk to where they have to the president said dad but in reality his White House counsel put restrictions on who the White House who the\nFBI could talk to now by the time that it could have been resolved but if you go with the FBI do an investigation let hands off let them do it impartial\nAnd talk about the uh the confrontation that Senator Flake had in the elevator with the victims and that really turned the tide of emotion for him you could you could see the look on its face and finally a politician with some soul\nMade a decision here [noise] in my work at Fox and MSNBC I met a lot of crime victims at NBC was the public system emotional outcasts movie Adam\nAbout John Walsh and his wife and their son Adam being kidnapped murdered\nAnd then with America's most wanted that was something very passionately involved because every week I was meeting victims of crime victims want justice and in this case you know there's a Dr Ford is wanting to put her life on public display in order to say that\nSenator Flake said if he was running for reelection he would never reached across the aisle here that's kind of a sad state of our politics for ... for senator admit that\nYeah and in particularly I was just man it was Senator Grassley said when he was a great was going to be a graphic or he was accusing the Democrats of trying to sabotage the nomination so they could wait for a Democratic president what what did they do\nWhen a President Obama was in the last month of his term nominating Merrick Garland [noise] hey wouldn't even talk to him they wouldn't have any ... and then waited and as they liked they got a Republican president and jump incomes their incomes their guy\nSo meanwhile they even worse of what they did grossly unconstitutional posters says with the advice and consent of the tendons you're supposed to talk to him but they did they just waited for a Republican president and nominate somebody off for prove the nomination\nCabin all the family is with him he he doesn't have a sense of humanity doesn't come across in his testimony he was very defensive with any like like I guess most people would be but you have to come across as believable and a lot of ways\nI think in his defense he crossed that line into are being attacked and when you start\nWhen a President Obama was in the last month of his term nominating Merrick Garland [noise] hey wouldn't even talk to him they wouldn't even him and then waited and as they lied they got a Republican president and incomes and comes their guy\nSo meanwhile they even worse of what they are grossly unconstitutional customers says moved here so it's not just supposed to talk to him but that it they just waited for a Republican president nominate somebody off work for the nomination\nCabin all the family is with him he doesn't have a sense of humanity doesn't come across in his testimony he was very defensive with any like like I guess most people would be but it has to come across as believable\nAnd a lot of ways I think in his defense crossed that line into are being attacked and when you start going to buy the Clintons\nThose kind of going too far and the reaction from people is can this person be part of non partisan Supreme Court justice even know what is the primary Carmen for a Supreme Court justice you have to be a judicial philosophy of the nominating process\nAs rates start to rise I mean when you're off of zero and we are clearly in the U. S. World War two percent on the on the short term overnight fed rate and we're also getting the ten year treasury popped up over three percent last week and it's staying there [noise]\nSo for the first time since about two thousand nine we've had a sustained period where you could actually get three percent risk free investing in in in the treasury so as those rates come up\nIt makes it more attractive to not take risk because prior to that if you want it any kind of return you had to take risk and and there is a you know healthy risk return equation but when people start to try to substitute\nWhat had been a solid risk free rate\nBy going out and actually taking risk by in it by borrowing longer I'm Sorry yeah borrowing that lending longer\nOr taking risk and things like how you'll bonds that creates risk inside the system and we're talking with professor Matt cherry teaches international business here and I on a college or let's talk Paris a Trump you know taking hard stance shocker a with China and Europe let's talk about the effects he's had with China and you're [noise]\nWell I think you've got to step back and just look at tariffs from um ah academic standpoint first and in one of the things when you use you impede free trade in free trade being basically the government has no role and being involved in trying to divert trade or to protect\n'em when you start to get involved as a government they're usually winners and losers and you've got to add up the winners and losers in a simple way to do it is to say well who suffer are the two games when you when you put a tariff on and clearly\nThe government wins because that's revenue that wasn't there before that they are going to take on on um imports um\nAnd we're talking with professor Matt cherry teaches international business here and I on a college or let's talk Paris a Trump you know taking hard stance shocker a with China and Europe let's talk about the effects he's had with China in your\n[noise] well I think you've got to step back and just look at tariffs from um ah academic standpoint first in in one of the things when you use you impede free trade in free trade being basically the government has no role and being involved in trying to divert trade or to protect\n'em when you start to get involved as a government they're usually winners and losers and you've got to add up the winners and losers in a simple way to do it has to say well who suffer are the two games when you when you put a tariff on\nAnd clearly the government wins because that's revenue that wasn't there before that they are going to take on on um imports um the domestic producers in the industry that are being protected gain um because they get protection from foreign competition and it allows them to\nBe propped up to compete in a way but in just about all cases the consumer actually loses\nShocking [laughter] I mean here's Trump you know he's for the the hard working blue collar guy and it's the blue collar guy the Getty getting getting the business here\nYes and you know if you're the other big question is with tariffs is you know there's a lot of research that's been done um [noise] in in trade theory over the years and you were\nWhen you talk about things like comparative advantage or absolute advantage that you talk about Adam Smith ... theory [noise] um and things like that you're always talking about trade not being a zero sum game zero sum game where there's only one winter in one loser and all the trade theory in the past is shown that I'm\nTrade can actually become more efficient and allow people to consume more and when you start to impede that\nIt becomes a real problem for the consumer and actually creates less efficiency in the markets you have less efficient producers who are encouraged to keep producing when actually things could be done in a more efficient manner elsewhere and you could deploy the resources here\nIn a different way so and so I was trying to affected by this now so well a lot of this stems from the fact that\nChina has been sort of a a sneaky competitor and China has done a lot of things that we don't like and haven't been able to control in the in the trade manipulating its currency\nIn particular a lot of people will complain about intellectual property theft\nAnd so does this sort of looks like it's more of a punitive sort of target on China to sort of send a message to them to clean up their practices but when we want more of an open dialogue with them or open trading with them 'cause they have a billion people and and we have products to sell and that's one of the one of the problems is that\nPeople tend to look at things on one side of it we're looking at the production side and we're looking at jobs\nBut we're we're not seeing or we're sort of choosing to put the blinders on about is that China's\nA one point two billion people market that the effectively you know we would like to tap into\n'em and sell our products and services into and when you start to do that you create this situation we're in now which seems to be a tit for tat retaliation\nEverytime we slapped a tariff on they come back and terrified and they've been very um politically aware will say the first tariffs that that Trump placed on on China and Europe [noise] um\nThe response was okay first off we are going to go put a tax on bourbon well where's bourbon made bourbon is made in Kentucky who's from Kentucky Mitch McConnell the leader of the sun it we're going to put a tariff on Harley Davidson's where Harley Davidson ... Wisconsin\nAnd we're looking at jobs but we're we're not seeing or we're sort of choosing to put the blinders on about is that China's a one point two billion people market that the effectively you know we would like to tap into\n'em and sell our products and services into and when you start to do that you create this situation we're in now which seems to be a tit for tat retaliation\nEvery time we slapped a tariff on they come back and terrified and they've been very um politically aware will say the first tariffs that that Trump placed on on China and Europe [noise] um\nThe response was okay first off we are going to go put a tax on bourbon well where's bourbon made bourbon is made in Kentucky who's from Kentucky Mitch McConnell the leader of the sun it we're going to put a tariff on Harley Davidson's where Harley Davidson's made Wisconsin that's Paul Ryan's home turf the head of the house\nSo that the the the implication is clear we understand your politics and we're going to make some of those people that are\nThat are important a constituency suffer and that's one of the things they worry about in the latest round\nWhere they said we're considering big tariffs on agriculture so again you're going into really the heart of Trump's base port portions of the mid west in the south with that that really survive on agricultural exports and they're going to have some issues as themselves are huge sports fan I Am and what your favorite team a Boston Red Sox\n[laughter] so you might allow dislike that here well actually I spoke to friday when the other day I thought about that later off the show but I Am sure you have Boston Red Sox here\nAt home the red Sox sweatshirt when you look at the label where's it made a well many of them are made in China okay so if that was my point if that was made in the U.S that twenty dollar shirt how much would that\nCost was made in the U.S [noise] that would probably be a thirty to forty dollars so if not more so would that shirt T shirt sell so easily at forty dollars because forty dollars you'd really want\nSomething of the you know you could buy jacket for forty dollars let's be honest here sure and and you know it's interesting I in my international business class I show a film called outsourced\nAnd it's from two thousand six or something but it's about um I'm a\nOf call center outsourcing India but one of the the great scenes in that movie is a guy called to complain he wants to buy an eagle statue and here's the woman's voice realizes she's in India and he complains about outsourcing and he lost his job has brother lost his job\nAnd she says okay well we've located products that are made in America I'm for people like you don't want to buy a product that's made somewhere else and in China or India and um will will locate that in ... and have you should have that shipped to you and he says oh great well how much is it\nThen she says that will be a hundred and eighty seven dollars you know the other product was like under a hundred and he pauses nieces just send me the first one\nThey will they guy we're talking with Matt Gary professor mcgary he teaches international business here at I own a college up let's talk a little about Europe and in particular uh Germany Andrew ... Angela Merkel Trump's had some issues with them or obviously with immigration in the past with them\nAmericans like nice cars they like German cars they like BMW lately they like Mercedes and we like to sell our cars overseas in the European Union so what this whole scuffle or how has that effect our our outsourcing well one of the issues\nIs that we tend to look at this as simply an import export issue and it's really not and and um many of the Mercedes and BMWs are made right here in America in South Carolina a lot of the BMWs are made and I have a son who goes to University of Alabama and right by the inter sailed downloads a Mercedes Benz plant in Tuscaloosa\nWhere the SUVs are made so those companies are actually producing product in the U.S [noise] um\nHe teaches international business here at I own a college up let's talk a little about Europe and in particular uh Germany Andrew ... Angela Merkel Trump's had some issues with them or obviously with immigration and the towers with them\nAmericans like nice cars they like German cars I like BMW lately they like Mercedes and we like to sell our cars overseas and the European Union so what this whole scuffle or how how does that affect our our outsourcing well one of the issues\nIs that we tend to look at this as simply an import export issue and it's really not and and um many of the Mercedes and BMWs are made right here in America in South Carolina a lot of the BMWs are made and I have a son goes to University of Alabama and right by the inter sailed downloads a Mercedes Benz plant in Tuscaloosa\nWhere the SUVs are made so those companies are actually producing product in the U.S [noise]\nUm and when you start to put tariffs on them you you fail to to think about okay well\nYou know what could be the consequences here in terms of retaliation do they shut down some of these plants do they fire American workers and then it it defeats the whole purpose of the tariffs in the beginning which is you know a sensibly to save jobs because you've you've taken a a a foreign company that's producing happily in the U.S\nAnd they start to pull out um some of their operations here and that's one of the dangers and this um you know in the in the Harley Davidson situation was interesting because hardly came right back and said\nOkay because of these terrorists that they're slapping on us we're going to move some of our production overseas which is exactly\nThe same as moving BMW Mercedes here because the ones that are produced in those countries are largely not going to have terrorists except you know to a certain extent a lot of that supply chain that the components come from various parts of the world you okay so you're the expert\nHere what the answer what was the common sense anti or for for common sense of America\nWell it's it's a tough one on the jobs front in certain areas of the U.S that have been really devastated because one of the\nByproducts of globalization is that yes the pies gotten bigger but the slices of being rearranged and shareholders and companies in global companies have by and large one they've made more money\nUh companies are able to produce and sell more and grow their profits but it's the worker and the labor peace in the U.S that had\nUm issues and you know you see these the you know when NAFTA came into effect you saw manufacturing operations moved to Mexico because frankly the labor situation is so attractive there and in China that um it just makes sense for them from a profit standpoint to do that\nAnd the idea though I think in the in the last Twenty years was well we're sorry your job one way but just go get an education and you can become a tech worker or something which is a tough proposition for\nYou know fifty year old guys worked all his life or a woman who's worked all her life in a textile factory and you're saying go out and get a job or get education get trained get something different you know get on board with the with the century in and become a tech worker [noise]\nTough one um unless you're really\nIt gets something different you know get on board with the with the century in and become a tech worker tough one um unless you're really\nGun in her life but um she has a lot of history what these men and the way she goes about her a manipulation um answer on doing it it it's a tragedy um so\nIt kind of backfires on her you know she has intentions to really make significant changes in these people's lives but it\nIt turns out to be I'm\nA real tragic situation I'm not going to spoil it down\nSpoiled I had to boil a already know a tragedy me in the world that you can only assume\nYes there there's there's there's things that happened at the end that in the Eighteen eighties when the play was written was shocking to this audience or to their audience and I think it'll be equally shocking to to our audience today because it's um [noise] the climax is extremely powerful again I won't say my\nFavorite part of any production as the climate here yet they don't have a hard hitting climax I feel like you're going to me yes at the end if there's there is not something that happened that traumatic and it's like oh my how she gonna recover soccer is going to happen\nYeah yeah yeah like in the last five men and strong to after yeah ... minutes has to be that the audience has to stay\nThroughout the whole thing because the the combination of what happens in the end the climax the stunning climax really happens in the last\nTen to five minutes to play\nAnd it's already shot and excited so well quickly before we had outta here about the comedy show I Love comedy tell me a little bit about that and how that's going to go in and what are your restrictions for comedy do you have any like free [noise] baseball and\nKnow that's a great great question um ever since I've gotten here I I started

responsibility and the uh the productions that I Do are [noise]\nYou know we want to say mission consistent but you know I I definitely pushing the envelope with my productions that they're not um [noise] you know the the run of the mill or the um you know just the middle of the road productions that they're very um controversial you know in in in one aspect or another but I've never been censored\nThey like free [noise] baseball and you know that's a great great question um ever since I've gotten here I I started here in two thousand five\nGotten any pushback by administration by any um other people professors saying you know you shouldn't do this or you maybe not want to go in that area never I mean I take responsibility and the uh the productions that I Do are [noise]\nYou know

of the road productions that they are very um controversial you know in in in one aspect or another but I've never been censored\nWhich is great which is wonderful travel artistic freedom\nSo in on that note in the spring the play deals with a controversial subject um this older man has taken in this um child or this child was um\nA abandoned didn't have a mother didn't have a father [noise] so this older gentleman took in this\nGirl and as she got older he began to have feelings for her and he sort of had taken it upon himself to groom her for his wife\nYeah yeah that that's really different yeah and especially is a time when he's not this took\nPlace in the uh the seventeenth century [laughter] so yeah this this is an old old school but still I mean my guys are standards and out of\nYou know he's kind of I'm not a great guy you're bringing this person and then he becomes have feelings for any grooms her to be his wife but he groom certain are really like heart not not that's horrible enough but he grooms or in a way that he keeps are\nIlliterate he keeps her locked in her how locked in his house I'm and basically she is being groomed to be a ... as he puts it a duty for wife\nSo the company comes in where she doesn't know anything about the world and then she sees this handsome young I'm Frenchmen come around the house which is a friend of the um\nUh older gentleman and she because our feelings for him [noise] uh\nAnd the younger gentleman has feelings for her so she wants to escape her\nHer I guess I'm her slavery from from her would be husband yeah and then um you know the comedy ensues where the the older man wants to get rid of the younger man wants to keep the um young woman trapped in his house and the woman wants to escape and\nA lot of hijackings happen eventually\nYou know it all it is it's more that I think I feel like the way that the liver and I know there are ... definitely it's it's the back not funny no play and fun I\nYou know ... funniest play writes in in human history why bar so you know these are he deals with serious subjects like his play that I did like seven or eight years ago called her to\nDo with this religious hypocrite he came into this household and he pretended to be a very pies and religious man but at the end he took over the house and kicked out the family sounds tragic but at the end he gets to come up and and it's all like\nPoking fun at this\nIt's more that I think I feel like the way you guys deliver it and I know there are ... definitely it's it's the back story not funny Moe play and fun and I you\nKnow ... I Want to ... play writes in in human history why bar\nSo you know these are he deals with serious subjects like his play that I did like seven or eight years ago culture to\nDo with this religious hypocrite he came into this household and he pretended to be a very pies and religious man but at the end she took over the house and kicked out the family sounds tragic but at the end he gets to come up and and it's all like\nPoking fun at this\nInsane individual so this is sort of the same thing it's poking fun at these really serious issues I'm and I'm just you know everybody lives happily ever\nAfter like a comedy comedy today that's comedy comedy yeah thank you so much professor Donna my lovely having you here today it was lovely to be here on several hall and you're like from the w._b.

show\nThanks so much for having me\nSo I Know because we know each other a little bit and first few years that you always wanted to be a divorce lawyer is that right\nThat is right and that ever since I was basically in junior high school I was actually something that I wanted to do why\nWell my parents are both therapist for the big family joke with that I too aggressive debate there that\nWill kind of thing like the next best thing something that you know I find incredibly interesting I get a law school and college on my focus primarily actually almost exclusively on that one and a lot but on that one desk and I believe with that\nYou know it's so funny because our backgrounds are really very similar in that way I come from a family therapist is both my parents and my grandmother were there and I uh the the word was blocked they not across [laughter] and I was always also interested in family law\nAnd the way in which the law meets the family you know and and the interaction there people are just so unaware of it and so I think it is it really interesting area but somehow or other we divorced\nWell my parents have both a therapist for the big family joke was that I was too aggressive to be a therapist\nKind of thing like the next best thing is something that you know I find incredibly interesting I did it and law school and college on my focus primarily actually almost exclusively on national one at a loss I put on that one desk and I believe with that\n[noise] you know it's so funny because our backgrounds are really very similar in that way I come from a family therapist is both my parents and my grandmother worked there and I uh the the word was boxing not across [laughter] and I was always also interested in family law\nAnd the ways in which the law meets a family you know and and the interaction there people are just so unaware of it and so I think it is a really interesting area but somehow or other we divorce lawyers have a bad reputation [noise]\nUnfortunately\nWith lots of divorce lawyer jokes\nA lot of them even more than just regular lawyer jokes so uh you you start out your your career being a divorce lawyer are interested in people I guess and uh and and uh what did you learn when you early in your career did you think that\nWhat you were expecting was in fact true about the about the work [noise]\nNo I think that you know everybody has an image of what they see divorce lawyers to be everyone has an image of what they think lawyers today they watch the day and they think it's this big courtroom drama and you know everything gets resolved before the commercial break and uh obviously that's not true and so I think it was really you know on some levels\nThere are aspects of it that you just would never learn in law school that how people interact um about what can really happen you know even no matter how many cases you need when you're actually in the courtroom it's just not the same things that you know surprise me definitely along the way um but I have but absolutely love it\nBut what were some of those big surprises [noise]\nSo I think that you know when you're in law school you know you need all these cases and you just ask you and you think that those are the things that are going to win back you know apply and I remember when I was litigating um I was in court once and I was arguing in front of the judge and I remember I stayed at the CPR which is you know the rules upon which\nYou I'm basically follow the law and the structure of it\nAnd I remember the you know that's that's the statute that that you learn to law school and I remember the judge thanked me don't argue to seek bailout and me and I've ever seen that the judge well that's all I've got the ... of what really happens in the courtroom I think it's just so much different than what you actually learn and what you watch on TV\nAnd that was very surprising to me I didn't realize\nHow incredibly different it would be on and I think that most people don't realize is that they have these images you know you always find the ... and ... images that they're going to get their justice\nAnd that just doesn't exist in that way and judges aren't going to get upset by you know the fact that so and so I was having an affair or whatever it is that's going on and I think when I saw that in practice was just very very surprising\nOn and something that now that I Know it it definitely influence as the way that I practice\nIt's really interesting what you're saying because like on the one hand yes judges don't really care about the psychology of the marriage and the psychology of the divorce they don't really care about\nWhat feels morally right morally wrong to the people in a in the in the marriage in the in the family and and and people don't really care about the things that children right they don't really care about\nThe structure of the way the process works or what the law says about this or that they care about what they care about you know and and\nThe and the truth of the matter is that statistically speaking most divorces end up settling before judge you know where he's a ...\nIf that's going on and I think when I saw that in practice which is very very surprising\nOn and something that now that I Know it it definitely influence as the way that I practice\nIt's really interesting what you're saying because like on the one hand yes judges don't really care about the psychology of the marriage and the psychology of the divorce they don't really care about\nWhat feels morally right morally wrong to the people in a in the in the marriage in the in the family and\nAnd and people don't really care about the things that children right they don't really care about the structure of the way the process works or what the laws about this or that they care about what they care about you know and\nAnd the and the truth of the matter is that statistically speaking most divorces end up settling before judge you know where he's a professor you go to a trial and before a judge gets to make that decision\nSo it's a kind of a disconnect because you have a ton of the psychology of the negotiation where you're trying to travel and the one hand right where the\nYou know what's right and what's wrong and who had an affair and who didn't do you know and all that matters to people and then you have it coming up right up against the court room setting where that really doesn't matter and it's really like completely different a completely different setting a completely different scene\nYou know that that they they've gone too far to the plate of anger and resentment you know fear or whatever it is\nA ... and and so do you think that the people that come in and and our religious information gathering I too have had people come and I've had people come in once a year for ... years on that and I and then hire the from you know I Do think that there really is\nIs it too late for them by the time they're going to see a lawyer or is there real hope there\nI think there's hope I mean there are probably pretty far down the path\nOf but not always I mean again there are people that are very ... you know basically do look at marriage on some level the businesses and so there are people that can separate the emotion they get there are people that can basically look at it and say like how much is this going to cost me and maybe you know maybe my wife's jokes are a little funnier than I thought you know it's not\nIt's not always for black and white and one of the things that like always bothers me about you know the outsiders to divorce like you know the friends and the parents and the other lawyers and all the other people that basically infiltrate clients years is that everybody thinks relationships are so simple\nYou know and and people do not get the credit how many layers there are two relationship and how incredibly complex there are and how you know everyone has a judgment you know someone has an if they are on this in the marriage is automatically over\nI just don't see it that way I think that there's just so much that goes on marriage and I think there are so many levels to it and it really\nI mean again there are people that are very ... you know basically you look at marriage on some level that this isn't so there are people that can separate the emotion they get there are people that can basically look at it and say like how much is this going to cost me and maybe you know\nMaybe my wife's jokes are little funnier than I thought you know it's not it's not always for black and white and one of the things that like\nAlways bothers me about you know the outsiders to their divorce like you know the friends and the parents and the\nOther lawyers and all the other people that basically infiltrate a client years is that you know everybody thinks relationships are so simple you know and and people do not get the credit how many layers there are two relationship and how incredibly complex there are and how you know everyone has a judgment you know someone has an if they are on this end the marriage is automatically over\nI just don't see it that way I think that there is just so much that goes on to a marriage and I think there are so many levels to it any relationship for that matter that\nYou know hopefully when people come in for a competition and we talk about these things they're they're being met with someone who's not going to be not judging though I basically have heard you know it takes a lot to shock me at this point in my life and so they're going to tell me whatever they're going to tell me and I'm going to be able to kind of objectively look at it for them and kind of give them more of that business\nThey really want to hear but emotionally might not be ready to hear but they have to hear yeah\nI think there's a lot to be said for that nonjudgmental time like this isn't about right or wrong it's not\nI agree you know some of the stuff you just couldn't make it up and if you'd wrote a story about it people will tell you are overdoing it right you know people's lives are incredible\nAnd the stories they tell you and the things they've been through unbelievable and it's a privilege I think to be able to sit with someone and listen to it and not judge them about it and it's a huge relief for them and they get that opportunity to do that I think that's a huge piece [noise]\nNo I absolutely agree and I also feel incredibly honored to help people get to a better place in that line\nDialogue on divorce I'm Catherine Miller were here on W. V. O. X. fourteen sixty eight am every other ones they from five to five thirty of them are also available on a podcast that WWW dot divorced dialogues dot com\nAnd I'm Talking today with Jacqueline Jacqueline for our listeners would you be burned to give us a contact information your Web site where people work place where people can find more information about you about your book about your farm [noise]\nSure affirmed website is book bought me E R K B. O. T. dot com and my personal website is ... dot com [noise]\nAnd it all book information\nOkay we're over there so you know in the last third of the show I was thinking that it might be a really good idea to talk a little bit about what it's like to manage a law firm you know because I think that\nAs we said earlier that you know at the beginning of the show that people have a really bad ideas about lawyers and certainly rarely even worse ideas about divorce lawyers you know what the worst of the worst I\nAnd I think that's not really true I think that the idea of the public eye that lawyers are out to gouge them and the this costs so much money because you know we're sort of laughing all the way to the bank is a for all of a sudden I'm Wondering what you think about that and um and and what it feels like to manage your farm [noise]\nSo I mean look I can understand why people say what they say and they're archery is out there I'm sure in every field maybe divorces all they may be a little bit worse that there are people that are doing that there are people that are you know laughing their way to the bank because if you think about the way that divorce is structured\nOn some level attorneys make money all all but it's also you know the more the clients are fighting the more money the attorneys can ultimately me but I think they're all a lot of attorneys that are out there that are really good\nDon't want to do that and I think it's very important when you're eating it\nAnd I think that's not really true I think that the idea of the public eye that lawyers around to gouge them and the and this caused so much money because you know we're sort of laughing all the way to the bank is because of ... and I'm Wondering what you think about that and um and and what a fair price to manage your from [noise]\nSo I mean look I can understand why people say what they say and there are attorneys out there I'm sure in every field maybe divorces probably maybe a little bit worse that there are people that are doing that there are people that are you know laughing their way to the bank because if you think about the way that the forces structured\nOn some level attorneys make money all over the health law you know the more the clients are fighting the more money the attorneys can ultimately but I think they're all a lot of attorneys that are out there that are really good\nDon't want to do that and I think it's very important when you're meeting attorneys to kind of try to try to read that if you can as to the attorneys are truly care about having or and not necessarily about the bottom line and so you know one of the things that I've been very fortunate about with my problem is that\nYou know we happen to be in a position that well obviously obviously everybody you know wants to make money at the end of the dead we have not had the sacrifice um you know our feelings about it like there are clients that are not right for for how we feel comfortable saying that that isn't a good fit their clients that\nWe um are able to you know financially cut deals with that that makes sense I mean to be honest one of the things that we do every year I don't even know cast and you know this is that we do something when I called the karma client where the associates than their partners we all said at the end of the year and we pick a client\nYou know we think we really appreciate us being able to wipe out any outstanding bill the kind of at the end and I called the karma class like everybody you know and and making that phone call I mean I personally made at one I've had to associate that have been able to make it to their clients to call and basically say you know\nHappy holidays are wiping out the rest of your bill and you know I think it's just really a nice thing to do and I always feel like that's that's a good feeling to be able to do something like all\nThat is that there's a great feeling I think that well let me ask you this question what what you said we talk a little bit about what the surprise was for you know when you became a divorce for hundreds of a surprise for your when you started to manage the firm\nI mean I really enjoy managing the phone so you know I've been doing this for about Twenty years and you get to a point when you're doing the same thing for\nYears and you want to have a little diversity and so\nAgain I was fortunate position with the people that I was working with that I was allowed to are permitted to basically take over the business for the for him as well and that is open you know a lot of doors for me to the degree of using different parts of the ... and like I happened to like numbers a lot and do a lot of things on ...\nI've been able to really manage um you know obviously I'm Out of our finances I Do I marketing a you know I Do a lot of what we defined as the HR thing and it just you know you just different parts of your brain and I actually even think it helps me and my work because again one of the things that I liked about matrimonial lost so much is that\nEach client you get to learn so much about everybody's practices like I say it's never boring and I can join any cocktail conversation for at least a few sentences because I've learned so much\nAbout all different types of industry is by working with different clients and I think running a business has really helped me with a lot of my entrepreneur clients um a lot you know we do a lot of business divorces are\nCases that involve businesses and it's just given such an inner\nInsight into how important working capital is for somebody and how you ultimately when your books and you know even when I'm looking at the books for less than representing the non money spouse or the non titles house I'm In a position where I can look at a you know and it as part of ... and I really understand it in a way that I wouldn't have otherwise but um\nYou know you just different parts of your brain and I actually even think it helps me and my work because again one of the things that I liked about matrimonial lost so much is that\nEach client you get to learn so much about everybody's practices like I always say it's never boring and I can join any cocktail conversation for at least a few sentences because I've learned so much\nAbout all different types of industry is working with different clients and I think running a business has really helped me with a lot of my entrepreneur clients um a lot you know we do a lot of business divorces are cases that involve businesses and it's just given such an inner insight into how important working capital is for somebody and how you ultimately won your books and you\nKnow even when I'm looking at the books\nFor less than representing the non money spouse or the non titles house I'm In a position where I can look at a you know and it as part of ... and I really understand it in a way that I wouldn't have otherwise but um I suppose surprises I mean you know it's often nerve wracking and I think it was more nerve wracking than I thought because every year\nYou know we're a transactional business we don't generally have receipt clients so every year you know you start fresh so that's always a little nerve wracking but I find it really challenging and very rewarding and I enjoyed a lot\nI resonate with a lot of what you said I Know exactly what you mean about learning what the business end of it and how that can really translate into the\nWork that but we do with our clients and also in that\nOver the years and you get exposed to all different kinds of industries and all kinds of businesses and it's\nFascinating actually to see what it to learn that enough to be conversant in it in order to get through the caves anyway and and then how that translates from one industry to another and into your own business it's really it's really an interesting thing so\nLet me ask you this in our last minute it's like Bush made a really good client like if someone was like well how am I going to be in the running for the cardinal word [laughter] you know maybe they won't get the carnival war but you know I'm going to have a really good relationship with my farm\nAnd what do you think it takes to be a really good going and what what are the attributes you would describe\nYou know it's an excellent question um I mean I can think of like a few of my very favorite clients one specifically walked in and\nHe happens to be the money's bath and he walked in and said I don't want to screw my wife that was the first thing he says may barely even your name or anything else that was the first thing I thought you know and we've been working together for a while and you know his case is finally coming clues and and he really has you know maintain to that\nThat theory throughout I mean there are times that things got a little rocky and I won't say it was the worst is but he really always felt like he just had to do what he felt that given right\nWhat was right and ultimately you know well she may have had differing views at times but overall ultimately he wanted to do that but they ask you a question as a general thing I think that it's very important to be very communicative\nUm you know for me he organizes importance and being able to kind of recognize your own wrong you know when you have a client that always things that are right no matter what happens and their spouses always wrong it's like it's very hard to kind of break in and\nYou know do an artful negotiation because one of the art I think of negotiation as being able to truly understand where the other person it and if you were still blocked by anger and not able to even step a little bit in someone else's shoes it's going to be very hard to negotiate because I Can't\nYou know I don't know your spouse away you know yourself you need to be able to to kind of access that so I think that people that are just going to be open to that communicative um you know I personally like people that organized if you're not will help you get organized\nRight no matter what happened and their spouses always wrong it's like it's very hard to break in and\nYou know do an artful negotiation because one of the art I think of negotiation as being able to truly understand where the other person at and if you were still blocked by anger and not able to even step a little bit in someone else's shoes can be very hard to negotiate because I Can't\nYou know I don't know your style the way you know your staff you need to be able to to kind of accept that though I think that people that are just going to be open to that you don't get as um you know I personally like people that are organized if you're not will help you get organized and you know and just generally not trying to go for the scorched earth I personally I think a client\nWhich can block you from reaching your true potential and keep you backwards while the rest of the world continues to move forward\nHis bail when I was young I remember that raised a story with my father I think I was in grade six or seven yeah this is a long time ago I did not remember I sat there which grade but I was younger and I came from school and I had\nA beam minus yeah and that was happy okay because before I see ours is the study and I had ... and I was happy and I came I was so happy and I rushed\nTo my dad and I told him that I got beat you know what happened what happened to my dad or look at me he smiled and he did not it did not release this word I was expecting this word ... ... ...\nIt did not say congratulations and I was waiting do war day that he would leave this word to me ... it did not\nKnow what happened what happened to me I felt like maybe I did not do what what was expected from me by my that they know what happened what happened I decided to war harder and I'm telling you I stopped work\nAnd work and work I studied at night and what happened next semester I got a minus when I got a mind that's my dies this time when you look at me he said San atone ... glued shop\nAnd he told me song if I didn't not I'm not too

level when not fight your goal I excuse\nMe profit assignment yes now and thank you for your story\nAnd I'm telling you I stopped work\nAnd work and work I studied at night and what happened next semester I got a minus when I got a mind that's my dies this time when you look at me he said San atone ... glued shot\nAnd he told me song if I had not I'm not too late to the last time it because I did not along she'll be satisfied wave that be because the ones who are satisfied way that the it was not try to get aid\nBecause eh man we're satisfied with this shutdown ... when not fight your goal I\nUse me profit assignment yes now and thank you for your story because I think that is something people really an absolutely all of our listeners need to hear and understand now\nIsn't gentlemen if you are listening to me right now I I Want you to picture something in your mind I Want you to picture the world without ambition\nI Want you to picture of the world without incentives because I'm willing to bet that a lot of you are listening to me to the end and thinking you know bill I don't really get what you're saying because\nMy only drive is to be happy to be right where I wanted to be to have everything that I ever wanted and that then and only then I'm going to be happy just being right where I've always wanted to be I have my I don't know God Forbid your your car\nAnd your kids and whatever it is that you think is going to keep you satisfied and that's going to be enough for you\nBut now I'm asking you to picture on the world would be like\nWithout ambition without without a drive for more now I'm willing to bet that there would be no America\nThe world would be in a very primitive state\nBecause rather than keep moving forward rather than pushing toward something better or rather than wanting to be better than we are now we would have decided that where we are is the most that humanity can every evolve we would have decided that right where we are is where we should be\nAnd things would be dire today\nBut something something as deep at and passionate\nAs the American dream is built on the foundation that one day people came from everywhere from all across the world to this land of promise a land flowing with milk and honey and decided that they wanted more just\nBe like just watch something on the top of watch your say absolutely they came from France they
