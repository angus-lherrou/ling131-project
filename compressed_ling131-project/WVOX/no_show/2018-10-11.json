U.S Postal service manager allegedly told pick two hundred and thirty thousand dollars in damage from Louisiana post office when you say it's not just here in Westchester and for those of you who may just be tuning in\nThe postal service one another five sons first damp another five that's probably the only speculating a they want another five or ... cents per stamp they're probably going to get it in January because the post office loses a lotta money\nBut when we have a right to demand is better service people will pay for better service male gets stolen male doesn't get deliver mail get thrown in the garbage mail get torn positively on your porridge they're hiring part time people and I don't know where they're getting them from\nAnother five or ... cents per stamp they're probably going to get it in January because the post office loses a lot of money\nBut what we have a right to demand is better service people will pay for better service male gets stolen male doesn't get delivered male gets thrown in the garbage male gets torn positively on your porridge they're hiring part time people and I don't know where they're getting them from\nBut you know regardless of how much or whether or not people like Trump and how much money Hillary spent Trump he's a guy have account you know he's there he's speaking he's out there he let you know what he's feeling which resonates with people I just didn't see than the other right\nWhy moving forward if we may\nUm what was your reaction 'cause we were so many spoke to this wheel of the confirmation of Mr\nCabin or the beer pong kid um what was your reaction to that and why do you think it was so little concern about the fact that he clearly lied in that chair in front of the Senate\nOr are you there was a lot of concern about the fact that he clearly lied they just didn't have the votes on on you you know you got to take the Republicans are staying together and they had this mission and here's one thing that you know be it it was more important than what happened to get a conservative on the on the bench\nI I also think the Democrats overplayed the hell yeah that\nThat's different you know what I mean I I I I think that he should not have been ... after he showed that kind of temperament and there's a\nA defense there ah after that I don't think they should have they should have approached him but uh you know the ... the conservatives have been for decades trying to get a conservative bench and I finally got one and they they saw it in in a in the scope and they they voted him in\nIsn't all that isn't that a symptom of what's wrong with our society because Democrats would have done the same thing if they could at least we average folks feel that way\nWe're in a library but we're in a society where it's all about winning screw with the school principals and the only two people that showed any principal ... dying a and the other one was going to run again what has become of principles\nHave no idea how can I answer that it it's it's it's dog eat dog you know that the thing the thing the thing is if you take it if you are in politics now\nAnd you take a reasonable side you know you know and you can you run your government quietly and you get do good things and you you know get out there you're in danger you're in danger if you don't if you don't beat back\nBecause you know you got someone beating up on you and you're not answering you know the Democrats are in a bind\nAverage folks feel that way [noise] we're in a way we were in a society where it's all about winning screw athletes screw principles and the only two people that showed any principal ... dying and the other one wasn't going to run again what has become of principles\nI have no idea how can I answer that I Know it it's it's it's dog eat dog you know that the thing the thing the thing is if you take if you're on politics now\nAnd you take a reasonable side you know you know and you can you run your government quietly and you get do good things and you get out there you're in danger [laughter] you're in danger if you don't if you don't beat back\nBecause you know you got someone beating up on you and you're not answering yeah\nDemocrats are in a bind in that situation and the Republicans are in a bind because there's you know you get all these polls you hear all this this stuff's going on in terms of evaluation and there's a whole silent group out there that you're not hearing a coup the group that\nUh would vote for Trump but they ain't saying that because they're embarrassed to say it and the other group who's going to kill and they're not going to vote for Trump and they don't want to say it either other people you've got to worry\nPaid forty two and and for those of us who live in all these different worlds you take the story we did before about the horizon\nThere are so many people I Know see that story and they vote for Trump if he was a mass murderer because that kind of thing strikes them is disingenuous and and and and ill thought out eight forty to let's go to the midterms\nAre in this environment in anyone's gas were women come out will be changed or the vote drastically will the conservatives come out because they felt that the Democrats tried to sing third guy\nUh you know I don't I don't know I I you know you can get will scenarios on both sides um my gut feeling on this um it's going to be close that's got it's got to be close in terms of take over\nIt and it really is well the well I many people feel that the the Senate that the or the Democrats screwed up their chance or in the hearings to take the Senate but what about ... to Congress what about the\nI think they got a much better chance in the house of representatives much better chance of of of capturing that and that that would be good for the country because of the country because ... you got which have given taken that everyone doesn't have Supreme Power\nUh you you might be able to where you have a chance to work it out\nYou you may not get the logjam you're at right now\nI think that a guy like Trump as as much as I dislike it as pragmatic oh yeah like the wind and winning means getting ideas of course they wouldn't NAFTA ... he got rid of now they got is us Sam see out there and basically it's almost the same\nYeah he's been able to characterize it\nAs a big issue now

I'm ... culture Institute which was to make a commitment to expose all young children the young minds of our children on the pre school elementary school level to Africa\nAfrican consciousness uh we were cultural Institute and uh we were using what most people using text books and other educational materials to expose black children to Africa and a positive way at a very young age but I was not satisfied with that\nJust superficial relationship and wanted to actually take a trip to Africa and see what it was like for myself\nUm and in Nineteen eighty seven I made that first journey not only myself but sixteen others um all residents of Mount Vernon\nAnd when we went there we were very touch with that experience and I knew then that our mission had not been complete\nYou know we had some very early luminaries who um dreamed about relocating um read ... reaching out and touching outcome of Africa most of us know the honorable markets most higher ... we you know many of us don't know that even book with the Washington proceeded Marcus Garvey\nAnd making contact with Africa you know promoting the support I'm\nSupporting the idea of African people showing up together and I'll struggle for equality and respect as human beings on the world stage and the global stage um having studied that history and being inspired by that history I Want it to venture out myself and so on eighty seven we took this trip\nUm I really felt that it was a new spiritual um\nRenewal that I had kind of being born again as Christians would say I\nWas not someone who was alien from African culture as I said already started to Institute very well read I'm very well integrated into a lot of the community that were propagating African culture but touching that soil\nAh was much different for me I really came to know than that I part of my destiny was to try to help build that bridge between the African experience in Africa and the dies for\nOur educational systems do not fully equipped to understanding each other\nAfter the four hundred years separation that we've had Africans have been missed educated about us Africans on the ... in the United states the Caribbean south and Central America and we and the diet score on have been missed educated about Africa an African\nAnd so I felt that I can help build that bridge where people can get to know more first hand level who we are outside of the propaganda and I said I could also use my experience to find out how our family in Africa are um direct without the middleman is interpretation\nAnd through that experience helped to share it with many of my brothers and sisters and a network that I built up throughout the years while living in America\nSo that was part of the process and the mindset that helped me work this through and let me say which played no small part my spiritual orientation you know I'm also as you know I'm a Hebrew and it's been\nWe attach ourselves to the prophecy the scripture and I always believe that one day that we would um have to revisit the land of our origin and weird is that we come from so I also felt there was a part of filling prophetic less than they are having that experience\nNow you're saying I have sixteen people on those sixteen\nAmerica so that was part of the process than the mindset that helped me work this through and let me say which played no small part my spiritual orientation you know I'm also as you know I'm a Hebrew and it's been\nWe attach themselves to the property the scripted and I always believed that one day that we would um have to re revisit the land of our origin and weird is that we come from so I also felt that the part of building prophetic Bethany I'm having that experience\nNow you have sixteen people on those sixteen\n... those of us who are inspired to try to find our way to Africa because Africa is so large as a continent people often mistaken speak of it in terms of it'd be after being a country that they get is a large continent with fifty four nations' about a thousand dialects and languages as equally as the number of ethnic groups\nAnd um different you know cultures and traditions so but ... stood out as the place to finish the dream because the foundation had been laid by so many other African Americans got independence day\nI'm sort of the likes of Martin Luther king president Adam Clayton Powell a pillow Randolph route bunch all of this crew was at Donald independence day when gone to raise that black and brought down the union jak\nSo there was um celebrated climbing whom are established specially the African Americans come and help them build this young nation\nWith a whole electricity blueprint in grade for a product the capital city was done by a team of African American um electrical engineers\nNew city of Temer and its port was laid out by climbing at the invitation of\nAfrican American engineers and technicians um we find a state insurance company that I see which celebrates sixty years of existence was started by an African American an idea of an African American they suggested the Colombian chrome or\nI'm surely the boys the wife of it that the w._b. the boys who is rarely thought a button genius in our own right she helped to set up the garner broadcasting company which is still in existence today\nThe main catalyst for gun or radio and TV so we have DNA

yes\nThey do they regret I mean is there any\nSerious rings ten of\nWhat is trying to do and politicians are followed him\nIn the economy of that is that you find\nRight she helped set up a gun or

and ... or was taken Africa faster than it was able to so absolutely and uh he was toppled yes\nDo do they regret I mean is there any\nSerious rings ten of\nWhat is trying to downtown and politicians that followed him\nHow they do that to me of that is that you find all do these very strong um a constituency of increments as they would be called in Guyana\nI'm beers the equal is still um a lot of people who are do they know the ideas were brilliant stand and political opposition increments ideas than strong throughout the African continent I find that the AAU the African Union has taken up a lot revisited in Columbus principles of ideals and his vision\nSo you find even larger momentum of an chrome or is that men in Columbus vision for the United states of Africa I'm outside I'm gonna\nUm but that does not say that in ... does not have many people who are revisiting his ideas and his vision and I talk about the re alignment with his original vision for granted that that that constituency in that movement is still very much alive even though people are there still feels that he was too ambitious\nAnd that gone to the independents came too soon we should not have let the white man go away as quick as we had so you still have those sentiment in that it's still very much alive and active on the ground there and I think it came to the forefront\nMainly when they was an attempt to make income was birthday a national holiday and it was made a national holiday but it was changed from an ... day two founders they meaning that in chrome or did not found Donna alone which nobody ever claims but that there were others who made contributions to rather than give credit to him\nAs the found that like people in the United states they joined walked into the founder of the

Thirteen Years old okay and I'll just tell you this there are many people like me who are Republican because\nI just cannot tolerate some of the tactics of the Democratic party\nTurning the city around\nSo they say um I I understand that and then\nYou weren't going to vote you weren't going to lose the beginning when you're a democratic anyway Ben you're hard core Republican\nI'd be on the Republican because I Can't be a Democrat\nI'd like to be a Democrat in many ways I'm a child of the sixties I Believe in the civil rights things matter of fact as a young kid my mom took me down to Washington in August twenty Nineteen sixty three for the more for men Martin Luther king's march on Washington\nTime when I was a bad Darnell Thirteen Years old and I'll just tell you this there are many people like me who are Republican because\nI just cannot tolerate some of the tactics of the Democratic party lo these many years has highlighted in the cabin not hearing most recently but I have discovered that unfortunately\nMany many of the Democratic party platform positions are on certain issues or a ... to what I regard as basic common sense\nBut I just see Democrats is just much more up opportunistic and ruthless than Republicans not that the Republicans are saying ... by any means\nBut he's my point Vince we we bring up probably the most moderate democratic hopeful for president in ... ... ... ... you know and your ears\nNow modeling where you say he's a moderate\nIn the Democratic field of candidates theory\nOr in the Democratic field perhaps you're right because you know I unfortunately it seems that each Democrat is tripping over each other trying to become more absolutely ridiculous than the other to achieve the goals of this so called\nProgressive wing of the party right I I I it's comical but tragic and the same breath\nHillary Clinton most famously recently I was trying to get become relevant again and led to where we cannot have civility as long as the Republicans over power\nThey're Republican Party in Westchester anymore even\nWell I don't see it being very active and I agree with what you say you know I ran against Mr Latham refer assembly many many years ago in in the race that I knew was losing race\nWho is that number will with those totals\nOh I think I've got something like thirty one thirty two percent of the very wealthy\nResident bad that's not bad\nSince I had no money and I will Republicans who ran and lost and had money got about the same right the whole point was they were say even even living real action where it appears you lose you must present an opposing view point\nAbsolutely and unfortunately they're not doing that the parties not doing that any more\nThan that and unfortunately I Do believe the Republican Party has succumbed to the drumbeat of progressive is him to the point where\nMaybe some issues of taxation and business climate I really don't see any difference between a Republican politicians in democratic politicians on social issues on issues that affect your quality of life\nI I don't really see it that much I mean I said I liked it I I Am very attractive to some of the concept of democratic liberalism but it it just has gotten so ridiculous in some ways that I Wonder if\nViewpoint absolutely and I'm sure\nThey're not doing that in the party is not doing that anymore\nUnfortunately I Do believe the Republican Party has to be drumbeat of progress to the point\nOver what may be some issues of taxation business climate difference between a Republican politicians I'm democratic pictures on social issues on issues that affect your quality of life\nI I don't really get that much I mean I\nShowed I'd like to attract some of the concept of democratic liberal but [noise] it it just has gotten so ridiculous in some ways I remember when the credit for him even understand what actually is\nChris [noise] Chris what are you there that how are you hey listen it's getting it's still hot enough for cool a you know yeah yeah I Know I'm On now it's been now [laughter]\nBut anyway uh can you hear me yes go ahead\nAll right yeah are you talking about a potential Bloomberg Trump rage yes [noise] well let's talk about some basic basic comparison between the two\nAre you in are you interested in Bloomberg for president would you vote for him or would you consider it\nOh I Would consider it yeah okay good I Would consider a billion ... uh although I have my reservations are backing but let's talk about him and Trump they both\nA self made billionaire is but there is a question about Trump being ... a self made billionaire you know just as loud as money\nWill leave that to another another show right but but the the basic difference that I Would um I used to compare foolish with Trump Bloomberg grace okay\nIs that um honesty and humility okay nice those are those are two characteristics that I Believe Bloomberg has\nHow I'm going to use that Chris if I write about that thank you say that again\nHonesty and your ability yes\nI Believe that he you know despite him being a multi ... it's not easy to do when you're a multibillion yet but I think like the Bloomberg has preserved that yes\nWhere we are as strong as far as honestly as well as far as you know what he did not even I odor of humility or know Trump's personality and his honesty is definitely a a question [noise]\nSo that's the basic comparison is that I Would make hypothetically if there was a race between Bloomberg and the Trump\nDo you like if if I could give me one name anybody Republican\nHonesty and humility okay nice those are those are two characteristics that I Believe Bloomberg has\nI'm going to use or I'm going to use that Chris if I'm right about that thank you say that again\nHonesty and your ability yeah\nI Believe that he you know despite him being a multi it's not easy to do when you're a multibillion there but I think I think Bloomberg has preserved that yes\nWhere whereas Trump or as far as hot as the as well as far as you know what he did not even I order of humility uh know Trump's personality and his honesty is definitely a a question [noise]\nSo that's the basic comparison is that I Would make hypothetically if there was a race between Bloomberg and I'm Trump's\nWho do you like if they if I could give me one name anybody Republican Democrat independent case anybody\nAh what case it was my choice in the last election yeah me too yeah I Would uh you know someone that's a good somehow you know we still good faith\nIn our government you know that's really been up that's the basic component that we you know and it's a it's a bit today you know when you talk about good faith what it means is that we wish I could walk with multi generations that we had said that the government would act in our interest\nOkay or it's not a perfect system\nOr a you know like disagree but a lot of things that were you know or in my life but in in this in this circumstance that we have now I think good faith has been seriously damaged\nThose Bloomberg making the Democratic primary though critics\nWell you know it's it's it's really it's a little bit far down the road ah I you know it's hard to predict that I mean well you know I mean again he has some appeal you know I guess there were some you know to Democrats you know they\nThey lost their mind Republicans lost their soul so maybe if they could get back their mind again somehow or try to you know try to appeal to the core of a American values that they once represented than than you know maybe a he would have a chain of school ...\nDo you think Trump rooms again\n[noise] uh well I tell you the truth I I think is if it's health holds up okay I think his ego would would uh compiled him to run against\nPets you know that's a a guy you know I don't think he would walk away from uh having that a stage\nChris thank you for co hosting this morning\nOkay All right they had picked\nUp by

revenue and then clothes that'd be what did you say toys the Russians open again\nThe main stop the bankruptcy and then the bankruptcy auction and though\nThey are up where I live um 'cause there's a K mart in Yorktown and fears and Kmart of the same company so if they go bankrupt and close the Kmart and Yorktown\nHold on the Yorktown Kmart would close and then the Sears and the Jefferson valley mall would close here's had two floors in the ... mall they scaled it back to one for but I don't even know if they're going to make it I mean the the the assumption my my you know\nNo knowledge

[noise] uh in ... during the I think response from Pataki at one point but that's kind of ancient history has been retired for several years as many people now the feds have broad very serious criminal charges against him he was convicted on the first trial reverse\nFor cost of a decision by the Supreme Court tried again and I'm Troy I was over our excuse me Albany in federal court and Albany I went to that trial and covered it for the show is um a horrified me how weak\nThe evidence was against Bruno and arguably I Would argue that there was no evidence of all at all of any criminal conduct and uh it didn't take the jury long it was a stunning moment that I'll always real core a recall in the courtroom when the jury came and it looked like the judges draw dropped at the time and they said\nA verdict of not guilty and I'm juveniles has gone on from there is a corporate executive I think it's fair to say enjoying a he's retired semi retirement down in Florida at times he also still lives in uh Brunswick in ... county where I when I met him many many many many years ago\nHe was the high energy rents are county a Republican share\nAnd he would eventually of course become a senator but he was once a leading figure in the Republican Party before he had gotten into a elective office and they did a good job over there and he and bill powers are also came from ...

know I'm On the phone and it's critically important and um\nHe kept the marsh in your own excelled as a senator representative of the district and she supports a Daphne and dance and he worked very closely with her and work with her for a number of years\nAnd death needs the mother of two boys so why she ... she had a couple of small businesses earlier in her life\nAnd uh all well rounded and very learned in knows how to function in government and in the society\nAnd in business so she would be a great addition to the Republicans and to the Republican majority but friends I really\nNeed to dwell on check and balance the governor is an executive and there's three branches government the executive legislative judicial\nAnd the executive is Democrat and for what it's worth Pataki was Republican but\nWe have Democrats great deal of the time and that's all fine but the legislature is split and has been Republican in the sense that is why they definitely are critical edition and the forty third district and I don't take anything away from her opponent because I Know him\nBut I Know he works in the governor's office now I Believe\nAnd um [noise] but that's not representative to me a check and balance because he would be primarily voting than have to almost with the state Democrats [noise] so that's why I'm here now in ... find is critically important\nAh that that may get the support of the majority of the people in the forties ... district at the Jordan because she will be truly representative and a welcome addition to the majority of the New York state Senate\nSaturday you make of Roy McDonald supported as Democrats that he's the guy who was I don't know if he's a lifelong Republican but he was a long time Republican official what are your truck it up to where do

a boy\nI helped him get elected his first time I get one of the largest contributions ever I think by an individual up from my campaign like how to ... to help them get elected helped him get the nomination and so I'm absolutely amazed and surprised\nA that he would be doing this but again in a democracy is a free country people have a right to express themselves\nAnd so I'm not good not good with it but he does or how does it because\nShe's a ... pen in citizen and\nWas I don't know if he's a lifelong Republican but he was a long time Republican official what are your truck it up to where do you have you had a chance to speak to him about it\nI have not spoken to really when I talked with him many many months ago\nHe was very cordial very friendly and very pleasant I always got along well with a boy\nI helped him get elected his first time I gave one of the largest contributions ever I think by an individual up from my campaign like how to ... to help them get elected helped him get the nomination and so I'm absolutely amazed and surprised\nA that he would be doing this but again in a democracy is a free country people have a right to express themselves\nAnd so I'm not good not good with a bunch of ... or how does it because she's a ... pen in citizen and has a right to do whatever\nBut I just think it's the wrong way to go and Daphne Jordan has the right choice poor checks and balances and the un representative of upstate New York in the capital region\nAnd again if I wasn't in the majority when I was in the Senate all of the good things that we're able to do with all the support as I got from great friends and people like Daphne\nWould not have happened in the capital region in upstate New York we offered to balance to the rest of the state and I'm proud that we were able to do what we did which Puerto so many people including you for it\n[laughter] well I I wouldn't I Would just describing what was going on as a journalist and to the extent that you saw that as supportive I saw it as being objective and honest about the reality is out there you know anything about Aaron glad the Democratic candidates\nI've never heard of them I've covered the area you're old district for many many years I've never heard of him doing anything related to the area have you are you familiar with them at all\nDo I really I don't know I don't believe I've ever met him and I'm actually I didn't know who was running until just a while ago but I Do know that he has a mass ... a lot of money\nYou know it's Cuomo money a lot of the first time caller I'm always you know the governor is thrown themselves into this because he's got to keep the or left wing Democrats who've been so critical of him off his back so he's made a major play this year for the first time\n[noise] well and I think you'll hear from her opponent because he does have a lot of money and he will be spending the last couple of weeks and that's just kind of smart politics because that's when people are totally focused\nAnd book yeah they'll they'll vote but again it's a free country for each day and the people have a right to do whatever\nYou know what I Am talking up checked differently about what's best for upstate New York especially the capital region especially and that's that checks and balance a balance will come from a senator like death may Jordan and the majority in the Republican Senate\nCenter I Know you're not directly involved you may not even the following it that closely but I'm sure you're following national politics to some degree and a tremendous polarization and the country over President Trump it looks like\nHere in New York the Democrat to a considerable degree or trying to nationalize the local elections in may President Trump a local issue makeup Brett Kavanaugh wine is domination or to the Supreme Court a local issue\nWe even have a situation now where the candidate for governor of your party mark mowing arrow is ultimately saying he didn't vote for President Trump penny refused to say whether we like Britain cabinet should be confirmed for the Senate or not you think that's going to be a smart tactic in New York or do you think\nEspecially and then she checks and balance a balance will come from a senator like death may Jordan and the majority in the Republican Senate\nCenter I Know you're not directly involved you may not even the following it that closely but I'm sure you're following national politics to some degree and a tremendous polarization and the country over President Trump it looks like\nHere in New York the Democrat to a considerable degree or trying to nationalize the local elections and make President Trump a local issue makeup Brett Kavanaugh wine is domination or to the Supreme Court a local issue\nWe even have a situation now where the candidate for governor of your party ... mile an arrow is ultimately saying he didn't vote for President Trump and he refused to say whether we select Britain Kavanaugh's should be\nConfirmed for the Senate or not you think that's going to be a smart tactic in New York or do you think this is your party risk alienating many Republican voters or maybe some voters who may not be Republicans but like some of what Trump is doing\nBy saying away from the president and the way they are\n[noise] well I I Know politically predators you know as a pro I bet you have to be pretty objective and pick your spots in right now in New York state polls show Trump is very unpopular\nSo you don't want to be crappy and his coat tails wouldn't have sat unpopular but I can tell you this whether we like President Trump or not\nA lot of what he has done with the lowest unemployment rate and and the I think ever in the United states three point seven percent\nOr the economic growth which is breaking records stock market was somewhat reflexive all big positive what he's been doing some of the foreign affairs like with North Korea is an Brickell\nAnd so you have to give him credit worthy of like him or not now he talks too much in my mind he creates a lot of the negativity he should he talks when he should be listening and I know him extremely well\nAnd I'm always you know had a great report it'd be a way they talk with him after he was elected president\nAnd a big could genial very friendly and very personable but you know people have to make their own choices but objectively if you take a look\nAt what's going on in the country I think he has to come down on the side of the positive\nWrap it around you in New York state politically doesn't help because his numbers are off at New York state ... people know that Democrats and Republicans know that\nThere and just quickly or as you are well now you're a conference someone you are close to one time a politically lost one of its members a long time Senator Frank paddle van I passed away yesterday just took any quick source of out of the Senate or we have about a minute and a half left\nI'm just so sad and they hear about that Frank was a great friend a real patriots you probably know he was in the service I active duty for Twenty years\nThe ... year was here in the army I sometimes I feel okay\nHe was in the service yeah and he was Thirty years in the reserves and I'm sure with great distinction became an officer and then when he came into the sand and I think two thirty\nSeven years in one of the most democratic districts and all of New York state in Queens ten to one Democrat enrollment he was left to it for thirty seven years\nAnd you want to talk about a patron\nIt just took any quick source of hours of the Senate or we have about a minute and a half left\nI'm just so sad and they hear about that Frank was a great friend a real patriots you probably know he was in the service like active duty for Twenty years\nLater I was here in the army I saw it on fire over ... okay\nHe was in the service yeah and he was Thirty years in the reserves and I'm sure with great distinction became an officer and then when he came into the sand and I think two thirty\nSeven years in one of the most democratic districts and all of New York state in Queens ten to one Democrat enrollment he was elected for thirty seven years\nAnd you want to talk about a patriot and a and a true spirit of a democracy that was Frank better than he was a great friend and when I was leaving he does everything he could to keep the there I'm Talking personally and and the conference\nAnd he's fine and he's had so far and he's chosen to follow which increases your number of followers over three thousand or individuals I think I followed thirty six and that increases the number of followers that you have by doing that so a statewide candidate\nFor governor has probably fewer real followers and I even have it I'm not trying to hold myself up as an example of anything other than a radio talk show host and former longtime journalists that their state capital but my God a candidate for governor or to have a hundred thousand followers here to have\nHuge numbers get out there and be doing things he wouldn't well we know he wouldn't support the president\nOf his party didn't vote for him and he wouldn't support and said he thought Brett Kavanaugh deserve to be\nConfirmed for a seat on the United States Supreme court I'm not advocating for cabinet I'm just saying as a Republican and this was a defining issue for many Republicans including many New York Republicans across the nation by doing what he's done or not doing what he's done not doing what he has not done\nHe's alienating his own party so if you want to talk about that I'd be curious to know that I Know we have a lot of Republican listeners out there in others as well what they think about this mall an arrow campaign\nBecause it doesn't isn't going anywhere it's not it doesn't seem to it hasn't gone anywhere hasn't raised any money because I made some money for the people who are involved with the presumably they're getting paid\nThe other statewide Republican candidates going nowhere I challenge most people even name them they don't even know\nDidn't vote for him and he wouldn't support and say he thought Brett Kavanaugh's deserves to be\nConfirmed for a seat on the United States Supreme court I'm not advocating for Kavanaugh I'm just saying as a Republican and this was a defining issue for many Republicans including many in New York Republicans across the nation by doing when he has done or not doing what he's done not doing what he has not done\nHe's alienating his own party so if you want to talk about that I'd be curious to know that I Know we have a lot of Republican listeners out there than others as well what they think about this mall an arrow campaign\nBecause it doesn't isn't going anywhere it's not it doesn't seem to it hasn't gone anywhere hasn't raised any money because I made some money for the people who are involved with the presumably they're getting paid\nThe other statewide Republican candidates are going nowhere I challenge most people even name them they don't even know their name there's a lot of people think from the start that this was George Pataki\nAnd in fact Chris gifted in a former congressman from the capitals this very it was seen is behind not certainly not even that much behind the scenes he was seen as part of a group\nThat wants to put an arrow in there and there are people out there I think they did it within eyes or four years from now maybe running Chris Gibson for governor or someone else they'll get behind\nMeanwhile a guy who would have taken the governor on and if you have a great many people Senator John de Francisco which pushed out and he has more money in the bank\nOr from his campaign war chest as a senator then Mahler narrow apparently has raised from the beginning we had at least one caller on the line who want to give us the most talked about this issue\nLove to hear from me for seven six Thirteen hundred five one eight for seven six Thirteen hundred let's go I think we have them if he's still with us either on the line our results regular calling through a lot of radio talk shows good morning Ira what's on your mind where do you think\nGood morning from first of all the Republicans are actually a cardboard cutout this time around that's what they amount to the cat okay\nWell I got I heard Roy McDonald snake mentioned which always makes my ears perk up in two thousand and two I was up at the sunset in North Troy a political event like before election\nAnd Roy myself for someone else for on stage and Roy always kind of guy ... how patriotic is he drank out the picture of him and his Marine Corps uniform you know at the VFW cake and all that they handed him to Mike and ask them to do the pledge of allegiance\nHe froze up and that to make and ran off the stage\nWhere did you make of that what does that say it's a win back that's the short answer is a win back\nRight Ira thank you would get some other callers out there I Want to go to Saratoga Springs where a longtime public officials who I knew in my year early years as a journalist and I still do today I think is on the line and he's a longtime public works commissioner up in Saratoga Springs comic saga morning John nice to hear from him\nTo morning Freda ah I really enjoyed the talk your head with a former senator Bruno you know working for the legislature for the number of years that I work I certainly understand the leadership\nAnd we'll never see that kind of power come to this uh this is true and the leadership he brought here to this district and he was very good to our community\nThat is a Democrat right you're a Democrat or Republican question no question about\nI was concerned and interested in doing things for my community and senator Bruno was very very supportive\nMany things that we did here in terms of the spring and matter of fact he gave us the lead money to put up a terror cell in Congress park beautiful you know a hundred and twenty five thousand dollars that were allowed us to put that ... billion up in Congress park\nGood morning Fred uh I really enjoyed the talk your head with a former senator Bruno you know working for the legislature for the number of years that I work I certainly understand the leadership\nAnd we'll never see that kind of power come to this uh this is true again the leadership he brought here to this district and he was very good to our community\nThat is a Democrat right you're a Democrat or Republican question no question about it I was\nConcerned and interested in doing things for my community and senator Bruno was very very supportive\nOf many things that we did here in terms of spring ... matter of fact he gave us\nThe lead money to put up a terror cell in Congress park beautiful kind of a hundred and twenty five thousand dollars that would've allowed us to put that ... billion up in Congress park he also gave us money to do improvements on union avenue\nYou also made a donation or towards the improvement is fitness fat when was vandalized in the park\nI knew how important it was working at the legislature over the years\nBut I Know what upset many of my democratic friends here in the city that I Would even consider working with senator Bruno but I was concerned for the improvements for the community there are nine that never mind the politics of it all he was a great guy yeah and what they did to him was was\nWas unbelievable I Believe that I couldn't believe the money that the federal government spent and the people that they hadn't investigating him over the years was in the millions and millions of dollars and a pretty much tried to break them\nSome good to hear for your thanks for listening ... long time a fictional in Saratoga Springs that go to Steve in Albany wants to comment on the narrow go right ahead if\nIt's\nI'm trying to figure out who I'm going to vote for for governor because uh I certainly don't want to vote for the current governor\nAnd ... seems to only know about down state and then we you know talks about corruption some everybody talks about corruption even Cuomo sure\nSo I'm trying to figure out who I Wish John Francisco had been the Republican nominee right and I and I don't know why the county chairman chairs and the committee people decided on\n... I Wish I knew that and I was thinking about voting for a\nA Stephanie minor\nYou know the former mayor in Syracuse who at least knows what the problems of upstate New York orange seems to be pretty candid about a lot of the problem didn't look at how honesty is about Andrew Cuomo now she was Cuomo's topic to ah help lead the Democratic party and now she's very very critical\nWhat do you think about that it seems to me that whatever you whatever we whoever we vote for uh the current governor is going to get back in and then the question is how ... how to send a message to the Republican Party\nAgree I mean in looking for a protest road I think Stephanie Klein is a good place to go she's not going to win\nA neither is the libertarian candidate with the Green Party candidate so if you don't like Boeing air on I Know a lot of people are disappointed is not fallen Errol personally it's the forces behind him and his failure to run a real campaign and you shouldn't have been in that position if it wasn't going to be able to do so and they shouldn't have put them in that position\nWithout the guarantees of money which he is not gotten so we just have to find\nThe right protest to know that I think Stephanie minors probably a good one getting says we've got to take a break right now is if you want to talk about the sad state and it's coming down to the wire now it's less than thirty days to go to the election the sad state of the two party system in New York and mark mowing arrow is a Kennedy in particular were at five twenty four\nHow does how to send a message to the Republican Party\nI mean looking for a protest road I think Stephanie ... is a good place to go she's not going to win\nA neither is the libertarian candidate or the Green Party candidate so if you don't like about arrow in I Know a lot of people are disappointed or something all an arrow personally if the forces behind him and his failure to run a real campaign and you shouldn't have been in that position if it wasn't going to be able to do so and they shouldn't have put them in that position\nWithout the guarantees of money which is not gotten so we just have to find\nThe right protested I think stuff in your mind is probably a good one ... says we've got to take a break right out here there's nobody want to talk about the sad state and it's coming down to the wire now is less than thirty days to go to the election the sad state of the two party system in New York and mark mowing arrows a candidate in particular or if I wanted for seven six\nThirteen hundred we'll be right back after the break\nBe sure to listen to W.

when I was on vacation right I had a television and it only had like five channels but the thing thing was at the NBC but it had a BBC World news but at Fox and CNN and MSNBC on it okay and uh you know I've said this on the program but why do I went on Fox\nAnd MSNBC and what was the third one find some hand\nAt CNN a dead BBC you had the the axis of evil right there well I you know I've said this on the program it numerous times and I just have to give you disclosure here till you're well aware of that but I don't watch the cable news shows at\nAll to say that I don't watch them at all it's an understatement I I'm a newsman there were so bad I literally in the business\nYeah um I Do not watch cable news I frankly I don't watch a lot of broadcast news generally speaking but ah I Do not watch these cable news commentary shows at all I mean zero if I if I ever catch them it's because somebody else has it on and I happen to be in their\nHouse or something like that now or what happened yeah like right now for example it's on the on the screen share about it you know and then you know you're just kind of a right here in Studio we have we have ... the last thing out of here yet but my point is ah so I didn't have any alternative I had nothing else and by the way I had a\nA clock ticking with my wife I couldn't even check the news on my phone so I Would turn the stations on to watch the news here you know porn stars are well known in car they had some other things on about like you know I'd want to like see what's going on in the news and obviously I didn't have a\nA a access on my phone right so then I Would I Would pop you sound I say well let's see what's going on and this was last week you have to remember why in the heat of the Kavanaugh stuff I just said I said ... ... ... is right this is it I get I understand everything there is\nThere is nothing resembling news on any of the stations now and you know I'm for somebody like ah do what I Do which I'm trying to to offer news not commentary ... and I think that that line is totally gone\nThere is nothing resembling news on any of those stations writes all commentary it's all emotion and it's all the mole yeah I mean even the not ideas it's called the ah the the the the the let's go with the the bill the ticker that come yet\nDon bought like you know I'd want to like see what's going on in the news and obviously I didn't have a\nA a access on my phone right so then I Would I Would say well let's see what's going on and this was last week you have to remember why in the heat of the Kavanaugh stuff I just said I said this is right this is it did I get I understand everything there's\nThere is nothing resembling news on any of the stations now and you know I'm for somebody like ah do what I Do which I'm trying to to offer news not commentary ... and I think that that line is totally gone\nThere is nothing resembling news on any of those stations writes all commentary its own motion and it's all the mole yeah I mean even the not ideas it's called the ah the the the the the ... the the bill the ticker that\nCome yeah yeah yeah even that inflammatory right right and that sort of tactics Markey a sort of the day there's this sort of leads them to what I I we can have a further discussion today which is that a these are there are real serious issues out there and uh do we have\nA you know the the the proper discourse either it through the media I mean we're in the political world I use the leadership to actually saw what a really big problems you know I mean really big problem now\nAnd yeah and they're not getting it you know are not junk that's on the news but I've just concluded we're going to take a call one second I just want to ... you know read the conclusion of Christopher column he goes and I ... I think this is you know of it goes\nAnd I quote climate change may be the most important issue we faced reshaping our children's world at some point those calling hoax will fade away and we'll reach a new consensus about the perils\nA but by then it might be too late you know I mean there you go okay we're going to take a call Hi you're on the air\n[laughter] come on guys how you doing good uh on the global warming you know ... on that you were talking about I think the fundamental question is it is human intelligence and a\nTechnology going to be able to overcome or cope with the natural phenomena natural phenomena stuff going on [noise]\nYou know in the world are I think children now we are humanity has managed to do that [laughter] but uh actually it it is a big question I have to think at that human intelligence will a deal with it in some way but like I mean it seems to be\nCommitted to it yeah it can I get to frankly ... there's not a new\nKind of metallic committed you have to have a political consensus that's right towards that Israeli leadership anything at least in this country worst winging your way in the opposite direction he got a guy pulled out of the Paris accords come pulled out of the ...\nSticking cold again my point does that mean intellectually why not even if it doesn't it isn't a factor of global or you know let's say it's a natural farms got nothing to do with the ah the energy there aren't burn or everything why not uh have clean air and ... and fish and she anyway\nRight yes I agree yeah because\nYeah I mean uh I mean God Knows you look down on this end of the of a you know in this region here the air is horrible\nYou know the the there's it's not an accident that the Bronx you know has the highest rate of asthma and the whole country\nKnow the interest to you know you you bring up a good question isn't it interesting that that you know that that's often not even talked about right so you know yeah you're talking about a wall okay uh you know pumping all of these like you know uh whatever into the atmosphere and he's in effect\nWhy not even if she doesn't it isn't a factor of global or you know let's say it's a natural farms got nothing to do with the with the energy there aren't burn or everything why not uh have clean air and ... and efficiency anyway\nRight yes I agree\nYeah because yeah I mean uh I mean God Knows you look down on this end of the uh uh you know in this region here the air is horrible\nYou know the the there's it's not an accident that the Bronx you know has the highest rate of asthma and the whole country\nYou know the interest to you know you you bring up a good question it's an interesting that that\nYou know that that's often not even talked about right so you know yeah you're talking about a wall okay uh you know pumping all of these like you know uh whatever into the atmosphere\nAnd then not affecting climate well yeah what about the health side of it what about just ... you know do you want to breathe the stuff in\nYou know right yeah I there's too many cars and there's too many people and you know fortunately [laughter] you know but that that's what it said that it Chris you got anything more\nOr less the point the motion with dealing with a high level of emotion over at collect you know in general you know and and that's controlling a politics are social uh yeah that dynamics are and that's something that we're going to you know we would have to come to terms with you know in\nIn calming down and a\nMan using our intellect to solve problems\nThere you go okay and I recall Chris yeah going on I think you're going to the opposite direction with that as well we keep talking about how although ... everybody has to be able to get along but nobody really wants to get along anymore and now you know fill a pitcher's thing uh we've we've had a conversation off wind or\nFor sure but you know that this isn't a matter of there's something happened\nAnd you know maybe it was so ... maybe it was a you know a a particular person elected some some pivotal moment in the economy or something like that what has happened is\nWe have applied our team sports mentality\nTo politics and politics is now taking like issue with climate change right there is no political component to it which there was nothing that will budge\nThat's right the other side on any more because there is a sports thing it's the same thing with that we saw with the last presidential election that and this I'm Talking about Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump when I say that we realize\nThat no matter what fifty percent of people that are born in roughly speaking are going to vote for whoever is on one of those party lines and you may not have agreed with them you made us totally hated them well when push comes to shove most people that were voting data participating in the process are gonna wind up with their team play the same way that you would do with the gay closer to\nThe Democrats are trying you know we can talk more about this but I just want to say one more thing about the warming and and you know and some of what Chris just said our caller\nThat you know that we have the intellect we have the ability to solve our problems um the problem with the global warming is I might be too late now I mean 'cause we it's it's if if you believe and you have to believe or not\nAre warming and and you know and some of what Chris just that our caller that you know that we have the intellect we have the ability to solve our problems um the problem with global warming is I might be too late now I mean 'cause we it's it's if if you believe and you have to believe or not\nAnd then there's fears of you know nuclear terrorism you know or other countries want to get nuclear weapons that are processing plutonium and things like that um\nYou know so there we are mhm and we are now and let's take a call Hi you're on the air\nIs high or good afternoon gentleman Hi I just thought I'd I I thought I had a put a little bit of a science and history together okay to help with some of the issue of climate change\nDo you believe the hoax then\nOh of course not OK climate change is real yeah it's always been re I was a matter of fact where you're sitting in today yes it would be underwater ... students yeah no no no no little history sometimes helpful to put things in perspective okay where are you where you're sitting today\nAbout Fifteen or twenty thousand years ago was ... was under a mile thick sheet of ice yeah Fifteen thousand manners\nThat that's because of what will the ice age right or the climbing has always been changing right but for those folks who wish to use climate change as a political\nOr a hammer they fail to put into the phraseology man made climate change because when you look at the statistics of man made\nContribution to climate change\nIt is very small very very hard to measure\nSo don't tell has been closest I I just want to get back on track so do you suggest that nothing should or needs to be done about a a climate change\nIs that and do you watch each other of course of course not I would never suggest that most conservatives which to conserve our planet as with our rights and everything else right\nAh but I just suggest that just as what the Kavanaugh hearings go left always takes things to unseat a portable extremes [laughter] why ... ... and drives away rational people your\nSalad so you don't think any of the science on this is rational\nHold on to science some of the science is reading from a scientific buddy you don't believe\nThat what let me just establish were coming from you don't believe the carbon emissions is causing this climate change do you think it's a natural progress like the ice age or something like that right is that what you're saying\nNo no I I I can actually I I actually know what I'm saying\nWe'll see how that went away\nOf course of\nCourse not I would never suggest that most conservatives which to conserve our planet as with our rights and everything else right\nAh but I just suggest that just as with the Kavanaugh hearing the left always takes things to an sa portable extremes [laughter] why ... ... and drives away rational people [noise] your\nSalad so you don't think any of the science on this is rational\nHold on to science some of the science is\nReading from a scientific but when you don't believe about ...\nWhat what let me just establish were coming from you don't believe the carbon emissions is causing this climate change do you think it's a natural progress like the ice age or something like that right is that what you're saying\nWell no I I I can actually I I actually know what I'm saying\nWe'll see you know what I write for\nComing out of my mouth and that's what I Am I what I what I'm trying to say is that yes man does contribute and affect the the the biosphere and our planet earth but as you see what some people\nThey take this to incredible ... [laughter] I don't know how to homes\nIs really a good place to coal poll scientific\nIt was just a list of fourteen cities Miami or Miami is is is you know and ... and by the way those cities that I listen to ...\nOver the place where fears and trepidation about yeah being flooded and buried it so that was that was like\nI get it I mean climate change is\nReal good reasons I think [laughter]\nGo ahead and made it or I'm\nSorry climate change is real but it's always couch in the point though if you're ... if you do not understand that the climate is changing you must be an idiot and therefore you must be a Trump supporter and therefore you must vote Democrat\nI don't think we ... we used to like well how I that's why when you were saying oh you know but I\nSorry I just when it goes back on I don't want I don't know why this issue even has to be a political yeah it's a it's an issue if you agree that there is that there is a threat there and that is that it's happening I just I don't get I mean what are the argument about other people are all the yard campaigning Obama doing something about it\nThan it they they think this is I I think you know by by I think there is a a a feeling out there that if you talk about climate change that it's the tree huggers and the environmentalist and ... and ... you're a club and all the left me and all that kind of stuff and I'm not I'm not I'm not coming from them but I\nI I'm not from that point of view and as I say I think that most rational people would say yes the climate is changing it always had\nRight so what we don't do that then you tell me what the solution might be\nThere's sort of one of the solution man should try try has leveled bashed\nDid not contribute as much as it's reasonably possible right to the continuation and the expansion of climate change okay that's a rational point of view I think so but I just suggest to my friends out there like considering voting democratic\nRight or just the last little thought you were cleared vinegar got to take a break you know stuck wondering try Jerry ... chart All right\nGreg thanks a lot then we're going to take a break and we'll shine activated [laughter]\nWe don't do that well then you're told me what the solution might be this or what\nThe solution ... man should try try his level bash\nCould not contribute as much as ... possible right to the continuation andme expansion all climate ... okay that's a rational point of view I think so but but I just suggest to my friends out there were considering voting democratic\nRight or just the last little thought we were cleared really got to take a break you were in charge of the jury and learn All right John thanks very close to a break and we'll start showing up to the\n[noise]\n... national news here is the

election will be from the cabinet all debacle\nWell as I said it before the break I think the Republican read by the base for always be energized no matter what you know that the given no matter what uh for the Democrats I think it may\nHave let a little bit of a fire until there's any because you know let's face it the most important\nAct of President Trump's presidency is the Supreme Court appointments and if Democrats don't like it they can get out there about November\nSix three six zero one one zero and I'm On my co host Nancy can unless you were just talking about what we thought the impacts on the general election will be from the Kavanaugh debacle\nWell it said it before the break I think the Republican red side the base will always be energized no matter what you know that's a given no matter what uh for the Democrats I think this may\nHave a ... a little bit of a fire until they're Fannie because you know let's face it the most important\nActs of President Trump's presidency is the Supreme Court appointments and if Democrats don't like it they can get out there about November\nWhat I'm seeing on the ground is more and more people actually registering to vote\nI think they're starting to finally wake up you know on both sides for probably one of the Democratic side that your vote really does count and it does manner yeah and you know you should exercise that right\nI I think that the it'll end up being a wash you know essentially at the end of the day\nUm I think people are gonna be excited anyway uh hopefully I'm turn out and I hope that uh you know I think the interesting thing I Want to know it is is Katie young people voted a higher rate because of the Parkland or students and their their involvement\nOr you know something that kids have been really hot ... most of them are now freshman in college and they've suspended from of their march for for America but\nThey are still on the week on doing massive voter registration and in local college yeah that they're all ... and so I can you really need to go and get those kids registered to vote the young people registered to vote and energized fan and I think the millennials\nOh you know what kind of lost they fear for awhile are are starting to really understand the significance on the importance of their vote or they're traveling a student that\nAnd you know obviously our generation has left the planet of hot enough for them yeah and I'm I'm cool but you know we pull to thirty two year old's\nStarting to offer talk a lot about voting and having a voice in their future\nYeah yeah uh I\nI agree and that's why I'll be interested to see if there's an increased turnout I'm among the younger voters to see if if you know\nIn the last week I've gone to horrible decline that forms\nAnd walking and believe it or not fifty five in the ... community\nWhich I find interesting because again many of them are ...\nSo they do when they update their\nTheir voter registration to the state they're currently resigning in and another thing I have to say is what I'm finding it even some of these older folks are updating the ... church you know your signature changes as you age and I'm\nThere just seems to be a little bit more heightened interest in voting\nNo I I agree and I hope that that I Hope that we have a very strong turnout this year that would be really I think a good thing you know I think that then that's important\nI think that's really important to\nAll the candidates forums and walking and believe it or not fifty five in the ... community\nWhich I find interesting because it again many of them are ...\nAre so big that when they update their their voter registration to the state they're currently resigning and another thing I have to say is what I'm finding it even some of these older folks are updating the ... church\nYou know your signature changes as you age yeah yeah and I'm\nThere just seems to be a little bit more heightened interest in voting\nNo I'm actually I agree and I hope that that that I Hope that we have a very strong turnout this year that would be really I think a good thing\nYou know I took that then yeah that that's important I think that's really important\nToo and if Donald Trump can excite people meaning people were angry or people who support him then I don't know what kind of good he is such a lightning rod because of his ...\nAnd you know sometimes when you look at home and I'm kind of watching the ... in the oval office all Kanye West is jumping around like a Mexican jumping all you know Donald Trump all love the entertainment value of all\nThat's all that it is [noise] I think\nI I I'm just not sure you know what really goes to bed I used to be honest with you I focus and vice or have you given up trying to ram woman because there's just not wearing the sky and\nNo I don't I don't think there is I don't think he could be ready to do so I think that he is what it is and you know I I look you know there's a lot a ... to to think about I I'm Still you know wondering\nYou know the biggest news obviously out of the administration this week with Nikki Haley resigning and I'm Still trying to figure out something happen there I don't know what I'm ... I'm not sure I'm clear but there's something to the story that Nikki Haley resigned\nSomething a little\nFishy about that resignation as well um you know after the U.N General assembly you can almost see that she was just full of herself from what\nYou know it's not like we were saying that you know they have the stuff that earlier in the summer I found out his performance at the un with so poor just like I'm Out of here she's also been\nTalked about as passively somebody who is going to primary ... you know she couldn't be an outlier\nI find that hard to believe but you never know and I also but I also think the one thing on Nikki Haley was that she was the one person in the administration\n[noise] that I felt the moderates base\nOf both the Republican Party and in some ways of the nation was comfortable with they felt that she wasn't the heart of the the radical the divisiveness that that Donald Trump represents\nYeah she let's not and I think she lived I think it matters because she left\n... even when you if you go back and you look at her record when she was forgotten that are\nUm she was very measured in her ... she was not off the ball see thoughtful careful or even keel I'm really quite frankly Bryant although she did colonel they come over to me the other day when she said Jared Kushner was a genius\nThe moderates base\nOf both Republican Party and in some ways of the nation was comfortable with they felt that she was at the heart of the the radical the divisiveness that that Donald Trump represents\nYeah she lives and I think she would I think I'd matters because she left\n... even if you come back and you look at her record I'm sure it's gotten that are\nUm she was never a measure of her governing ... with not off the ball ball ball or even keel and really I felt like Brian although she didn't colonel colonel ... or the other day when she said Jared 'cause I wasn't sure\nI think the biggest country is is that Michael Bloomberg you know despite is a\nSuccession as well has managed to preserve a uh honesty um you know with a degree but anyway it's not easy for someone there that shows that that amount of success in white but uh\nI think he's been able to do that in that country is very much with the you know Trump Donald Trump I mean if it was it was a a lecture in between him and Donald Trump okay [noise]\nYou know there's not much of a choice as far as I'm concerned you\nKnow I agree I think that you present those the the right type a contrast to to Donald Trump but I think that there'll be very difficult I think the Democratic primaries the ... are going to be really really crazy and it's going to be hard to do that for anybody to separate themselves what do you think Nancy\nWell it's interesting I like Michael Bloomberg but there are going to be people who remember when he kind of turn New York city in ... city we couldn't have a big gulp and stuff and I live in and we're going to get rid of soda and that I'm back on an\nHowever we use a different time several years later and we really do have to take a free fish to fry\nHere and I do believe that he is someone with the integrity princess and the fact\nThat could probably back Donald Trump into a corner\n[noise] yeah I think I I again I think that you know that Michael Bloomberg has everything to Donald Trump wishes that he was you know and I and that's what I think it's fascinating about it because you know\nYou know Donald Trump is is is is the fraud who claims he told me he got a million dollars from his father and made billions ah which we know it was untrue and another\nThing I'd like I'd like to interject back at this crucial but going in the meantime we got this crucial time when the presidential campaign will start again right after the midterm across really nobody\nAnd sell Michael Bloomberg come off as a viable today\nYeah I'm gonna\nAnd could go on a whole show on this but you know he he's solidified his base okay and it should it he won by a A R e didn't win by majority vote okay and you have to shell out you know um [noise]\nIt's um you know again getting back to what you should do I think part of it is a good substantial part of this based that now that that really didn't have good shaken our system or lost at some point\nYou know I get your shoe issue there was a way to ...

uh the young people before Trump became president or you had no problem where when Obama was the new Bill Clinton was\nTrump and it's certainly a bad it I you know for before he became president but

started well two years\nAgo we went to Beijing and China\nAnd we don't know how it happened you felt like the second or third night I I started having grand mal seizures and they didn't know why it was happening and we didn't want to go to the hospitals and try to\nEmulate the language so when we got back we went right to the doctors and they said I of epilepsy and I've had it for they said we I

so they recognize right away when he's having absence seizures um he'll explain it to you as he's um last time yeah so he'll\nBe paying attention in class and then suddenly realize something's missing um any kind of zones out a little bit and he's actually having a seizure um but tons of research has showed that the music um has really helped\nTo what have you noticed now now I Know you were definitely playing way before ... mhm now what have you know the Indian pristine since he started you know how many seizures would continue to place have you noticed a difference in it so\nAnd I think what's really changed his um his passion for as increased I think it relaxes him he'll tell you that your concentration improved a key fields um especially at night he'll play right before I go ahead\nI'm really relaxes him and um it's funny 'cause the research when I started following yet they started researching seizures with music because they were afraid that music was going to trigger a seizure and actually surprisingly what they found was the opposite that it was helping people I'm relieved among others\nI I hear that you know these two stories and on the surface seem so completely different but\n... showed that the music um has really helped\nSo what did you notice now now I Know you were definitely playing way before mhm now what are the you know the Indian Christine since he started you know I mean the ... what do you continue to have you noticed a difference in it so\nAnd I think what's really changed his um his passion for it increased I think it relaxes him he'll tell you that your concentration improved a key feel um especially at night helped by right before I go yeah I'd\nI'm really relaxes ten and um it's funny 'cause the research when I started following yet they started researching seizures with music because they were afraid that music was going to trigger seizure and actually surprisingly what they found was the opposite that it was helping people I'm relieved them up there are others\nSo I I hear that you know these two stories and on the surface seems so completely different but in the winter not it it kind of seems like they're both you know your love for music and toning everything in and and really have you met a heck of a lot more concentrated in when you are playing then when you're not gonna he feel like you're more concentrated on things even when you're playing music\nThat I Love playing music that yeah\nSo now there is no longer do we just kinda sampled a little bit of a rap music before which is great you other completely
