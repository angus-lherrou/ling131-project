is to me I think one of the best in the business and I'm so much to talk about you know what's interesting Bob is where a three weeks out twenty two days away from the mid term elections but\nI thought at this time of the year we'd be looking at the ... race the gubernatorial race so closely to you know the state elections it's been so quiet on that front you know even though yes Cuomo is is campaigning as his mark mall and narrow and you know but the gubernatorial race which you would think\nWould be making headlines every day\nIs a very quiet race and the state wide elections you know yes for the individuals senators and the individual assemblyman there races are important but they've been quiet there hasn't been a lot of controversy what is dominating the headlines of course is what's going on on the national and international\nYou know Brett Kavanaugh his appointments his confirmation has really divided this country yes he's sitting on the Supreme Court but\nA new ABC poll showed that most Americans did not believe he should have been confirmed um then of course we have what's happening with your mouth to show he be missing journalist outing journalist\nIn Turkey that seems to be making such big international headlines because it could have such an international impact as a journalist Bob it scares me that something like that could happen it does happen\nAgent ... to a larger one of the first time I've ever written for show 'em in the process of writing it it has to do with the new Saudi Arabian embassy journalists' hotel where German was going to do come out\nAnd ironically just a few minutes ago it it it passed on the headline that uh the Saudis are\nGoing to allow Turkish officials into that embassy but I'm sure whatever evidence might have existed if there was evidence if indeed what what happened what we believe happened did take place and we may never really know um that you know I'm sure any evidence has been washed clean if if you know what I mean I'm\nYou know it's it's it's frightening that in this day and age thing like that could happen and it speaks to\nThe dangers of our profession and it speaks to the dangers of of just the the animosity that exists in the world today it's frightening it's frightening\nMe you know or one of the one of the good things and and could show you should be remembered for the survivor knows his name right finally a country that has been white washed the death one of the most one of the most oppressive countries on earth\nThey can't even hold a candle a place like like like a rare and that gets a lot for pet projects and do of course of course and\nMight have existed if there was evidence if indeed what what happened what we believe happened did take place and we may never really know um that you know I'm sure any evidence has been washed clean if if you know what I mean I watch um you know it's it's it's frightening that in this day and age something like that could happen and it speaks to\nThe dangers of our profession and it speaks to the dangers of of just the the animosity that exists in the world today it's frightening it's frightening\nTo me you know or one of the one of the

earth I\nCan't even hold a candle a place like like like a rare and that gets a lot for pet projects and do of course of\nCourse and you know what ... and a while and it's time to I always say it's it's ... it's time to open the curtains and again you know uh what's what's a bit frightening understandably you know that President Trump has signed this arms deal for a hundred and ten billions of dollars coming into the U.S economy\nApparently four hundred and fifty thousand jobs for Boeing and all of these agencies that are going to provide\nThese fighter jets as well as a ... um you know ... consumer jets and and you know our arms pieces pieces of of metal that you know it's used to make weapons of war you know and Saudi needs this obviously and made this deal with the U.S and you know what President Trump keeps talking about is protecting\nThat deal which is understand\nSomething tangible will\nBring jobs same time you have to look at human rights and you have to look at 'em you know just ... just common decency and my gosh is that happened is that man was lured into that embassy\nAnd stand why he went and he had gotten divorced from his first wife who was the Saudi national he's Saudi national and he needed apparently divorce papers because he's now a was engaged to marry another woman\nAnd he had to get some final papers to prove that he could marry you know this is his fiance and uh that's apparently why he went into the embassy and you know people don't understand why did he go in\nAnd um it's just it's it just is a very unsettling thing to have happen in this day and age\nOnto a journalist on her own a little later you know a lot of journalists have been trying to spray bigger spotlight on to Yemen where the salaries are are are killing more innocent people as well as the people that are fighting\nThe enemy all the warring nation that person and that needs to be looked at as well\nYeah and you know Bob there's there's been more there's been turbulence there's been a atrocities towards human beings\nYou know since the beginning of time and we're never going to be able to stop all of that but in this electronic age and and the fact of course that there's more that some of this what happened to the show he may be on tape and might have been recorded audio visual\nIt just shows in this day and age getting away with some of the stuff is very ... it's going to be very difficult you know there is there were some electronic light on the world right now and I just think that it that the fact that we're all talking about it I mean I I was the family this weekend and that was one of the big topics because\nTrying to age and and the fact that there's more that some of what happened to the show he maybe I might have been recorded audio visual\nIt just shows in this day and age getting away with some of the stuff is very ... it's going to be very difficult you know it airs electronic light on the world right now and I just think that that the fact that we're talking about it I mean I Irish family this weekend and that was one of the big topics because\nAs a defense attorney yeah it's not it's not difficult no I think we've got all of this a few times right and uh\nUh everybody's entitled to good defense\nAnd you obey the laws and look if we don't if we don't start obeying the law if we we get away from obeying the law more correctly put in a like um da Vance in Manhattan um where are you won't prosecute certain certain crimes tail a turnstile jumping how\nHow do you not when they stop people continuously that have warrants out that we're literally wanted for murder okay that doesn't ... why doesn't everybody then just jumped the turnstile\nI'd say that again and again I'm going to jump to turn down next chance I guess\nRight okay I Want to see that I can see that hired me on the bigger [laughter] I I get caught in this part I don't want to get caught on that happened I was you know the passenger I was married\nFor a hockey game in about Twenty years ago was when they were taking the Susan B. Anthony calling I was running and I put the coin in but if I get to buy a car and it caught me in where the light doesn't shine I never I was riding on the flow of people\nBut I had a [laughter]\nWell yeah and I'm sure that wasn't a good site it was for the for the riding public was horrified but let's get back to the to follow you know what's\nThe I ... ... who who is I Know he's the I in Manhattan but who is he to say I'm going to enforce this statute and I'm not going to force that's not his job okay that's for the legislature\nSo if if he stops at enforcing one statute what prevents them from not enforcing another statute or if you're a defense attorney and you say you let all these people go but just stop my client and you gave you know it it's just\nIf you don't like the statute take it off the books okay if it's on the books it should be enforced whether it should be enforced or a thousand percent I mean you go out there and put a squad of cops here and say look for a turnstile jumpers no that's not it but if there's a loan police officer there\nAnd it's rush hour somebody's causing disturbs the jumped to turn so you see it all the time okay that person's what what's wrong with stopping that person they're finding out what the story is here then you get a summons anyway they don't get dragged off to jail\nCorrect and I but I yeah I technically an arrest but uh you know and they don't they don't appear then nothing happens anymore anyway\nSo if if he stops at enforcing one statute what prevents them from not forcing another statute or if you're a defense attorney and you say you let all these people go but just stopped my client and you gave you know it it's just\nIf you don't like the statute take it off the books okay if it's on the books it should be enforced whether it should be enforced or a thousand percent I mean you go out there and put a squad of cops here and say look for turnstile jumpers no that's not it but if there's a loan police officer there\nAnd it's rush hour and somebody is causing the services jumped the turnstile you see it all the time okay that person's what what's wrong with stopping that person then finding out what the story is here to to get a summons anyway they don't get dragged off to jail\nCorrect and I well I yeah I\nTechnically an arrest but uh you know and they don't they don't appear then nothing happens anymore anyway I think they don't issue warrants for those types of things anymore but\nThey said well what if they catch me jumping the turnstile what happens to me\nYou you probably get a ticket [laughter] they might know you're driving history Bob so uh all I have you on the lookout for you yeah okay thanks a lot I really hate forty two we're talking with uh my coffee\nTo give the Democrats a little\nCrack the whip here and and I this is gonna sound off with what I Need to a reaction to it if the Democrats weren't just trying to do right now a cap and all I Need them there if they weren't just trying to do ... now well into her let's move on to the next thing\nReally insulting you really thought that he committed perjury when he was in the Senate and I'm not saying that they should do it but I wouldn't have shown more sincerity and more honesty if they continue to pursue it\nAbout what's happened now right what do you hear now about capital nothing crickets right yeah that guy there's only there's\nNo they're they're in my opinion so it was obviously just to derail him and now everybody's quiet he's in their bodies quiet except for a few ... a ... demonstrators and that's going to come down to it already has calmed down a you know it's terrible it's a\nPlay by all sides\nI mean Cory Booker I think made a complete\n... yourself\nI think he did and he was obviously plane up for the uh the the twenty twenty election and so it was a Kamala Harris a ... that's obvious to people watching it and I think that's why you have the backlash that you have now\nWhile yeah thing you know what I look I Do believe I did believe the woman a but it doesn't mean you know like someone said very brilliantly on the show just you because you believe that doesn't mean that is true and in all fairness to process needs to be applied but my point again is that the Democrats\nAnd he did it either nothing happened\nBut that's my point yeah right but but but he obviously we're sampling understand but having said that if the Democrats are sincere they should follow through if not we've been playing\nYeah and the whole thing with the letter still hasn't been answered who released it and then what what why was the waiting period so long that whether it's just it doesn't pass the smell test\nDoes it ever occur to you that most of the leaders in both houses okay there were already ... themselves they should they should be a term limit for the for this week well Bob\nI was just when you just said that and then you use that term limits I was going to say these people are basically always campaigning for their job or a nice job\nAnd that and that's the problem with this and I and I'm a firm believer in term limits one of my platforms when I ran for assembly um yeah it's it's up to the\nThat you're you're doing a great job okay but you know what you can't do the great job forever it's just looking for the next\nWe're sampling all understand but having said that if the Democrats are sincere they should follow through if not we've been playing\nYeah and the whole thing with the letter still hasn't been answered who released it and then what what was the waiting period so law on that whether it's just it doesn't pass the test\nDoes it ever occur to you that most of the leaders in both houses okay there were already caricatures himself themselves they should that there should be a term limit for the for this week\nWell Bob I was just when you just said that and then you you use that term limits I was going to say these people are basically always campaigning for their job or a nice job\nAnd that and that's the problem with this and I and I'm a firm believer in term limits one of my platforms when I ran for assembly um yeah it's it's up to the people that you're you're doing a great job okay but you know what you can't do the great job forever if just looking for the next step\nBack but I was tempted to get even by saying now that work out for you know I mean they are listening to the game and the second so it was like it might be about as far as the great ... you\nCould always rely on him to be honest than

hurricane or Michael that devastated the panhandle of Florida and went through Georgia the Carolinas [noise]\nUm it seems like there's a it's like business as usual for for horribly devastating and and desk creating a hurricane's stronger than we've ever had before especially in the amount of them and their strength\nOf Florence and the Carolinas Harvey and in Texas Maria in Puerto Rico and now Michael in Florida this is an incredible uh increase in hurricanes and intensity of hurricanes\nAnd scientists [noise] uh well let's say because somebody might say well not every scientist will will will let's say Ninety nine percent of scientists say it's due to climate change [noise]\nAnd ah we gotta do something about it but there are ... climate change deniers and our president seems to me one of them\nNow but he's he does it in a in a funny way he says that a climate changes occurring but there is no evidence that it's created by man and it's going to go back and it just it just now here in severe it'll go back to being more normal [noise]\nUh and when Lesley Stahl on sixty minutes ... said to him well how do you know that I'm paraphrasing some of the dialogue I don't have the direct quotes\nYou said will will people say uh and and she said well what people and you ... well they say and and how many times have we heard him say they say and people say without ever being able to back\nThat particular state but not by a particular name of a person or name of a scientist or name of a society [noise] that that goes along with what he wants to believe [noise]\nUm what he doesn't want to believe is that there is something that would create a diminishing of coal mining which causes climate change the burning of fossil fuels and energy plants which causes climate change in the warming of the of the atmosphere\nWhich creates this uh these extremes in temperature\nAt because he he wants to be able to piece to people who all these companies and this is contributing to you know his causes Republican causes he doesn't want to cost them a a lot of money at the expense of everybody's a clean air [noise]\nUh and uh he has to find rationale [noise]\nUh and it it it is amazing that are\nIn this day and age he can be a climate deniers when it's only self serving a and uh I don't know what we can do about that but uh it is what it is and and maybe the only ... can be a change of government at some point in time to get people more realistic [noise]\nThen there's the other thing is Allison the Saudi journalist ... a Saudi citizen who works for the Washington Post to went into the Saudi consulate in Turkey\nTo get a marriage license to marry as bright [noise] and they had tastes\nCauses Republican causes he doesn't want to cost them a a loss of money at the expense of everybody's a clean air [noise] uh and uh he has to find rationale [noise] uh and and it it it is amazing that are\nIn this day and age you can be a climate deniers when it's only self serving\nA and uh I don't know what we can do about that but uh\nIt is what it is and and maybe that only ... can be a change of government at some point in time to get people more realistic [noise] then there's the other thing is Alice in the Saudi journalist ... a Saudi citizen who works for the Washington Post to went into the Saudi consulate in Turkey\nTo get a marriage license to marry as bright [noise] and they had tapes him going in\nBut no tapes and coming out and so he is either disappeared and suspicion is he's been murdered dismembered and disposed up [noise]\nAnd [noise]\nWhat a way to think about that will our\nPresident is not saying it's occurred he said there's no there's not sufficient evidence or and\nWhat is supposed to do in terms of punishing the Saudis if they did do that we have a multibillion dollar arms deal with him and his excuse would be as you said it to her [noise]\nOr we don't want to stop the arms deal because that would affect workers and Boeing and Lockheed here in our in our country that'd be a loss of jobs\nSo he he doesn't want to punish us so they'll continue even those Saudis may have caused this the government have caused this he doesn't want to Korea loss of jobs so we will continue to give them the arms that's like saying\nThat we have we have Allison pointed out\nYou have a rapist or who might run out of free health clinic and he threatens if he's arrested it uh because of it is having rape somebody he's going to shut down the health clinic and your you as a government they're going to say well he's giving free health care to the poor [noise]\nSo um [noise] let's not arrest him because we don't want to lose the benefits for the poor\nNow that's an extreme comparison but [noise]\nA murder of people dismembered meant in a medieval way is a horrible thing and and if we just turned a blind eye to it in an rationalize that it's okay [noise]\nUm ... when I think\nHe mad about it either I mean a threat to journalists something he left it constantly he's very into that idea well yeah and\nWhat the journalist has done [noise] he works for the Washington Post teach critical of the Saudi Government as he should be in terms of their their ... their human rights tactics and\nTruck doesn't like the Washington Post because it to him it's one of those papers like the New York times have risen accurately is fake news kind of paper so catty and really get all bothered by the loss of a journalist [noise]\nUm so that that's what we've got down and and what what what can what can we\nDo it my question [laughter] I I don't know uh\nYou're you're wondering okay people will vote for him or let let's take a look this voting for him and his son in law Jared worth over three hundred and fifty million dollars has not pay taxes for six year period not paid a single federal tax even though he's making a million dollars [noise]\nThat means he has never supported our military or our infrastructure or schools or health care anything not one of his dollars in Egypt as I say a multi millionaire\nBut it in Georgia if you have a valid or government id like to drive is why is that journey that even though you might be a sort of suspended right now you can test bringing it to the election booth and you'll be able to vote\nToday that they've seen it in person do or you can even without even today in person and you can

lying I [laughter]\n'cause you know it's one thing about vote he and he's consistent maybe what he said about if Obama would only produce his uh his birth certificate I think that was another all the he was going to do\nTo know what he's concerned about this guy is the worst scam women do quo if he backs one way hit my advice guy and Colombia listen it back the other way or the second thing I heard him say today here\nIs that you know they may have been some role people somehow snuck into the Saudi Arabia consulate\nKilled this guy snuck ... body out\nWithout any body and the counselor no

[noise]\nOkay and then make your rent and they listed as one of the top lawyers in your field by Connecticut Magazine Westchester magnet Maine and New York magazine\nOr why tell us about some of your cheap and well I think are the reason I was recognized and those publications has to do with the work uh I haven't\nThings on there I'm going to start with your practice areas Mike what had been focused on a for most of your career\nMost of my career has been dedicated to a land use and real estate development work a which is kind of ironic because I started out as a litigator or by transitioned into that field okay and David\nWell for a while I had a general practice farm or in white plains but at this point we just do civil litigation [noise]\nOkay and then make him recently lifted as one of the top a lawyer in your field by Connecticut Magazine Westchester magazine and New York magazine or why tell us about some of your achievements\nWell I think the reason I was recognized in those publications has to do with the work\nUh I have done in the real estate industry a inland juice or I have handled lots of big development projects I lecture on ah the topic I I right on the topic\nA and fortunately or have been successful in prosecuting cases in court all the way up to the Connecticut Supreme Court\nAnd of course David you've been held in New York magazine as well and many other places the top national personal injury lawyer or why and and what what's been the secret your success\nLost almost been around since the early eighties [noise] um [noise]\nYou know a ... a trial lawyer is a person who needs to convince the jury\nTo their clients a viewpoint so it ... it has to be a great student of the law as well as the great advocate is there's a lot of good actor if not better than that when they're appearing in front of the jury that their strategic abilities to get them to cross is never lost\nA that and also preparations it's been very key indication\nOkay I'm going to focus you though on on really what is perhaps your highest profile case or a which was the nine eleven case a one billion dollar lawsuit and perhaps the largest tort case that New York city they're paying who who were you doing and and on whose behalf\n[noise] while the case started when a part-time hockey coach at my kids' high school not Kisco contacted me I Am now leukemia\nAnd he thought he got him when he was a detective on the pile\nAnd no one to prove because the unusual Leighton see periods the cause of the relationship between the leukemia and the toxins that I took the case and built into a case that ultimately had ten thousand people and much resolved after ten years for about a billion dollars\nThe principal defendant was a New York city or for not getting a safe place to work for tens of thousands of firemen construction workers police officers et cetera were on one of the most toxic\nPiles in the history of this country if not world\nSo they always negligence involved a ... I mean how could they have provided to save a safe place to work\nWell it's interesting because in Washington DC OSHA or which is in charge of workplace safety took over and they had had met protocol which is really had to do you see fireman's arriving at piracy they're covered so that don't don't get exposed\nBut OSHA didn't run a New York city New York city decided to run in itself and therefore we had no as my protocol firemen and police officers were roaming around all the debris and the construction debris and the toxic chemicals\nAnd the benzene and the ... with the euro protection and that's why tens of thousands of them have gotten sick more dying today\nOh I can imagine that this was a case that or they wouldn't have wanted to have taken on given the sensitivity going\nDaly's

that's why tens of thousands of them have gotten sick more dying today\nOh I can imagine that this was a case that others wouldn't have wanted to have that taking on given the sensitivity going after New York city after nine eleven [noise]\nThat was turned down by cannot Fifteen oh the terms for that exact reason people thought that the city was heroic and we shouldn't criticize anyone with a few people had what they were considering the world Trade Center cough which they said should be ... you know a a mark of coverage\nUm but that was blind to what was really going on at is that these people getting sick sicker and it was the best kept secret secret until two thousand and three I bought this action\nMm [noise] I I I'm going to move on and and ask a ... a night in a word as we heard from a sky bacon and being given for excellence in the law\nBut and it's even more specifically here in the principles of judge learning hand of family and the right to the individual how do you see your work or as protecting or promoting a civil and human\nRights [noise] well it's in it's interesting because I probably first became interested in being a lawyer a when John Kennedy gave his to public service and that inspired me and I actually decided to go to law school career in public service\nAlong the way however I found that you can accomplish through an awful lot and perhaps even more than you can in public service and in the first case that\nReally convinced me exactly while I was in law school I was working for a farm in Manhattan\nIn Nineteen Seventy seven went down to a Johns Hopkins university and prepared the case ... into the U.S open as a woman or the was the first transgendered a case to come\nOff the shore the courts and way back then I learned being\nGetting her into the U.S open as a woman that you can impact public policy through the law as much as or even more than ... you can in public office [noise]\nWow I gave it a ... and the same question how do you see your work has said or protecting promoting civil and human rights\nDavid ... and the same question how do your work has said or protecting promoting civil and human right\nUm\nI just there's probably a good time to say they're AJC is a nonpartisan organization we take no position on candidates and we are we're honoring I'm Mike for his involvement in the community is general involvement\nI dated you keep so much to the community or the list is really very long and the pattern I see they are one of the patterns is performing arts the Avon theater some Senate or the Kennedy Center for the arts and more why the art\nI come from the very artistic family and my sisters assistant conductor at my brother's ... director I write music professionally I have a music studio in Nashville and I've always loved the arts so I get to my sister ... music and California to my brother's Westchester ...\nYes Anon lord of the Kennedy Center a lot of other sports that I just recently completed building the ... which is not for profit theater next to the collapse Davis leader in Bedford which is going to be educational and documentaries and hope they do a lot for the community up they are so yes I have been better off with the arts among other labs with these\n... you were waiting very quickly to me the fact that you're a musician yourself a songwriter and you're also a playwright you're really a renaissance man\nWell I don't know about that but thank you for the call [laughter]\n[noise] um\nAnd and besides that you're involved in other ways in the community what do you what I I mentioned the United way with Michael ... which is the community involvement that you find most gratifying\n[noise] you know again it's similar to my answer would have catastrophic United by a much more spread out for example I built war be cultural center at my temple\nUm I have a scholarship and robotics and that's a key program for under privileged kids enough Kisco I have the early

are less sleep pretty well [noise]\nAnd where did you grow up\nI grew up in the ... and then spring valley\nAnd what was your education\nI went to the public schools in in spring valley and then I went to Cornell undergraduate and Villanova law school that's another place where I was already involved I I that was the ... legal clinic there to teach lawyers when they're in law school how to function and to help with the ... stuff like that which is an exciting project\nHuh have you um it you've taught in schools I by giving lectures using okay\nAnd what about you where did you grow up I grew up in Stamford a large born in Westchester uh went to Fairfield prep went on to Fordham undergraduate in New York law school after that\nVery nice and then ah what's that it's great that you kind of straddle the line between ah Westchester in Fairfield in your in your upbringing well\nYou know as I listen to David talk about the the things he's involved with it it's a very similar a situation over Fairfield county and in fact uh many people refer to it as west west a Westfield\nAh in because you know it's really a mistake of history that we have a line that separate the two counties than they are in many ways very similar\n[noise] you know often lawyers are maligned for focusing only on the profit motive or for being a demand that our society is so the digits or I assume you're both see the role of lawyers I mean what would you what would you say somebody accused the legal profession of being that\nWell I think you know lawyers are often uh the whipping boy for people who wants to uh look can set the legal system but the fact of the matter is a most people are at some point in our life [noise]\nFind they need the services a lawyer and good lawyers or make for a better society in many many ways whether it's through litigation or providing a oh their services or to the city\nAnd uh [noise] at the end of the day most people a\nLove hate lawyers until they need a

I'm getting\nLike no no no no no but that's important to people care about their pocketbook right from one thing they do care about\nRory seeing it in in in the upper end of the of homes I mean we're talking about the two million dollar Bronx do highlights on my last friday in Bedford and was it was like that\nWhere uh the homeowners are saying you know we're not being able to not gonna be able to sell our homes because we are going to come down in price to also as the tax\nBill right so what they're doing so renting right exact and they're losing their homes for like you know because there's still a lot of Wall Street people want to lose about ... so they're they're actually renting these four bedroom rye houses for Fifteen grand a month right now it's just amazing amazing\nAnd people are paying which in an area yes I Do just what what were blocked that I'd say politics but it's the laundry is still recovering she ...\nPrecautions one way or another we're already seeing it in real it's a ... I'm getting\nLike no no no no no but that's important to people care about their pocketbook right from one thing they do care about\nRory seeing it in in in the upper end of the of homes I mean we're talking about the two million dollar Bronx at all hours on my right and Bedford is like that where uh the uh home owners are saying you know we're not being up we're not gonna be able to sell our homes because we are going to come down in price to also in the tax\nBill right so what they're doing is renting right exact and they're losing their homes for like you know because there's still a lot of Wall Street people want to lose about ... so they're they're actually renting these four bedroom right houses for Fifteen grand a month right I mean it's just amazing amazing\nAnd people are paying it which is in the area to do just what what were blocked that I'd say politics but it's the laundry as to what she does indeed become majority leader if the Democrats take full control of the state Senate of the state of the state assembly which they already have and then you've got a democratic governor does that bode well\nFor a while it certainly bodes well for the Democratic party but to your point does it shift too far to the left where ... is looking at that twenty twenty potential for a presidential race doesn't hurt or help\nThem out to a good question I I really don't know the answer I think um I think he let's put it this way well first of all things about this and interest or cousins now no longer will be three men in a room\nOh yeah we got a woman that fine line right\nSo so it'll be it'll be a two men\nAnd a woman finally finally right exact took out a little bit that's an an Eighteen are actually two thousand and Nineteen to write it happen if right\nNow I don't want to stereotype you know a a ... a woman might legislator legislator rights as only being interested in in women's issues although\nAlthough it is interesting that Cuomo has bent over backwards to um play to the so called women's vote everybody here called ...\nAnd so she might have some things that actually are some insights and things that are unique to her that that he hasn't really thought of that so maybe that actually will help you know I don't know\nAnd what at some of us tend to overlook better but it's very important to the minority community Andrea Stewart cuts in an era in American too and she has represented her district and and you know so well and she had such respect among minority communities throughout not just her own district but throughout the state right\nThere there are we all know that there are issues particularly\nLooking at a Trump Administration and the concern for you know um and I've had um line so to scream on the show many tied up and he's expressed such major concerns you know with the Trump Administration regarding the treatment of minorities and and perhaps that will see a change there\nWas also would say that she is um of the um it's that I shouldn't say establishment I guess that's for better or lack of better she played the game along ... she's she's a she's part of the Democratic team\nThat uh was not is not necessarily the a ... a Casio Cortez a wing of the part\nNow she's not she's not would not be considered far less\nSo she exactly so she's not going to radicalize the legislature nor was she put a Andrew Cuomo if he is interested in running and twenty twenty which I doubt at this point for a lot of reasons one of those I don't think this guy plays on a national level to could get his\nThe game along ... she's she's a she's part of the Democratic team\nThat uh was not is not necessarily\nThe a ... a Casio Cortez a wing of the part now she's not she's not would not be considered ... so ... so she's not going to radicalize the legislature nor\nWas she put a Andrew Cuomo if he is interested in running and twenty twenty which I doubt at this point mhm for a lot of reasons one of those I don't think this guy plays on a national level I think he'd get his\nA dabble with yeah was that was you know or yeah the double Dutch despotic figures and this is you know a not a Republican thing to or a democratic thing it's whoever's in the White House kind of a thing right\nAnd um [noise] however I think what what has surprised people in this singer Marco Rubio coming out you know basically saying that we have to\nPunish something something you know and I may include his mind Congress in general\nWith the idea of Nixon sanction was All right but I think what makes what you just set at a Janine was that what makes us different is that Trump isn't talking in terms of human rights he's talking in terms of the bottom line and ah even though in the past we've done deals with with people like\nYou know ... ... prince the crown prince of Saudi Arabia including Saudi Arabia\nUm we've always said that this was um we always put it in the context\nOf national security that that it that we're weighing two\nThings here national security versus human rights and in this case we're going to have to take the national security and and that is palatable that's acceptable to some people who might blanche at something that Trump says when you know this has to do with the bottom line ...\nIdeal for us right and and again as we as journalists we know that journalists around the world have been murdered this is not the first journalists\nBut and and we should mention that even though he was a Saudi national he had been very outspoken on what the crown prince was doing right and and picked off the you're just ... now ironically I'm not talking about Muslim Theresa now actually that's important to\nKnow this guy was it was a a player\nOn both sides yeah so anyway and\nAt the same time what's ironic here is the president just really a brokered a deal with turkey to free pass them around and I want to get his name right answer Bryson yeah who was in a Turkish prison for two years now they say that was completely coincidental that got out\nBut we speak to you know I pictured spread thin within the oval office with a family I Believe it was on Saturday you know got down on his knee how the president's hand I referred\nI have been murdered this is not the first journalists but and and we should mention that even though he was a Saudi national he had been very outspoken on what the crown prince was doing right and and kicked off the but you just ... and now ironically I'm not talking about Theresa now sadly actually that's important\nTo know this guy was it was a a player on both sides yeah so anyway\nAnd at the same time what's ironic here is the president just really a broker to deal with turkey to free pastor ... I'm a I Want to get his name right pets are Brunson yeah who was in a Turkish prison for two years now they say that was completely coincidental that once and got out\nBut we speak to you know odd pictures Brunson within the oval office with a family I Believe it was on Saturday you know got down on his me how the president's hand I referred to it in like kissing the ring of the pope and prayed with with the you know I'm the president and the oval office it was certainly a pictorial event\nAnd then you got Kanye West in the oval office with the president going off on every tangent in the world yeah and I remember thinking to myself watching both of them were supposed to be separation of church and state yet yet this looks very much like the kissing of the ring\nYeah well you know in the case of the pastor or I mean that just up to his approval rating with the religious right by X amount Kanye West I mean the thing with Trump is you know the kind of a west reminded me of The Apprentice show but it also reminded me of the world wide wrestling federation and understand Trump\nYou know you have to look at how he got involved with Vince McMahon did ask all of that yeah I really think back right my gosh so how do you explain his popularity well you know I remember when I was in college I went to a of some friends to wrestling spectacle than Hamburg, Pennsylvania\nAnd there's a crowd you got the impression that uh the crowd believed this stuff yes they all they all think wrestling Israel Israel and and put some of them really don't think it's ... it's almost like they have a a good argument of diet is the cognitive dissonance other\nThey they know what a joke but they still believe it or by the time and that's what Trump has recognized about a shirt and showed most of the American population nine bay like wrestling and you know like entertain they like the former\nStuff are they likely in your face and Trump to them it's like Trump's gotta costume which the blue suit the ride pirates tie and it's like he's up against\nThe Democrats or whoever the enemy is right on any given day the enemy and their whole Colgan or whatever or a killer Kowalski you know whatever the villain in the ring is and they loved it yeah and you know you mentioned before you know I I don't know if it said on the air or during the break you know he's insults people was part of a whole lot of it that's part of the whole\n... that's ... and he said as you mentioned the CBS interview he said I'm the president and you're not basically rodeo in other words I'm I'm here and I try to ensure our members of trees and you're not exactly\nBut yeah you know or so and that's what he does I mean that's the that's the whole\nThat's the whole trend and interestingly enough you know who's on his cabinet but Linda McMahon man's life although I like her I think I mean personally I I actually met her she was pretty smart but you know what I'm saying it's just it's so he's it's the whole culture\nAntics yeah the antics are all part of it the ah robot and we're going to talk a little bit more in the next segment but let's go to Brett Kavanaugh now yeah I mean\nIt literally other

personally I I actually met her she was pretty smart but you know what I'm saying it's just so he's it's the whole culture\nThe antics yeah the antics are all part of it and we're going to talk a

objectives with talent\nShe's on a mission to leverage her experience to help organizations hire and retain exactly the right talent for growth\nSuzanne welcome to the show thank you thank you for having me John So tell us a little bit more I mean obviously for any employer finding the right talent for their business whether it's a multinational company a small midsize business or a non for profit it's essential\nBecause any time a new employees starts they're part of a of a team they're part of the dynamics of what goes on with the team and if it's not the right fit that could have serious ramifications\nOf for for not only that employee but also for the business as a as a as it stands so tell us a little about your organization and really what led you to start actually being a chief telling advisor\nDuring the years I was recruiting for several years was Bridgewater Associates they're the number one hedge fund in the world and I worked closely with the C O for many years to help them grow and they have now they have roughly twenty five hundred employees and I started working with them when they had thirty five\nAnd I have five people that are still there and thriving between Fifteen and Twenty years later and that's a testament to uh the the value of investing the time on the front end of a hiring process\nI I sew some companies like come in for the smaller to mid sized companies I come in and help with hiring insights like Peter and Karen but then I have other clients some big pharma clients\nWhere I Do projects at the ... my methodology is most valuable at the executive level because the higher the level the greater the risk when it's a mess higher and the more costly again so my my client base ranges but my my my workshops and the teaching\nTo help them grow and they have now they have roughly twenty five hundred employees and I started working with them when they had thirty five\nAnd I have five people that are still there and thriving between Fifteen and Twenty years later and that's a testament to uh the the value of investing the time on the front end of the hiring process\nI I sew some companies like come in for the smaller to mid sized companies I come in and help with hiring insights like Peter and Karen but then I have other clients some big pharma clients\nWhere I'd do projects at the ... my methodology is most valuable at the executive level because the higher the level the greater the risk when it's a mess higher and the more costly again so my my client base ranges\nBut my my my workshops and the teaching of hiring inside are more for the smaller to midsize\nA target market and then larger companies bring men to teach them my methodology or to apply to a conducted for them\nTo get as we talked about earlier some of these smaller businesses don't have a higher professionals though right they've just been somebody who's been trapped by the c._e._o. or to to really go out and and find a better future employees were or whether you're a direct CFO or is your if you don't have\nA good for the training in the in ... in what you're looking for it can be a real disaster\nAbsolutely and that leads me to hiring mistakes\nHigher mistakes happen to the best of us\nIf there are a lot of people out there that are very skilled at interviewing and you just never know whether someone is who you think they are\nAnd so it's so essential to really be in the know when you're hiring because an average hiring mistake let's just take a one hundred thousand dollar mid range higher\nEnds up costing roughly Fifteen times that when it's a mess higher because the average time that a a a bad higher stays on board it between twelve to Eighteen months\nAnd the worst part of the the mistake I I think of it as the carbon monoxide of hiring mistake the opportunity loss and waste\nAnd when the job isn't getting done the hard costs are nothing compared to that\nAnd then you've got disruption which is in measurable so when when companies were pulled in terms of costs area president and above they found it almost impossible to measure the disruption and that sometimes the most agonizing part\nWill throw food she was ... and what goes into a twelve and a two month obviously there's the training and the orientation and if the work they're not getting done then is there are problems among staff as well because they're seeing that the works marketing gone right even if you run free okay we've made a miscarriage\nWho's been going to feel when Wilde but you're still looking for a new candidate for the ...\nAnd a lot of good people might leave because of a bad manager or about higher and so it has such a ripple effect across businesses\nAnd part of the problem I see and that's why it's so important is my mission in life to create awareness around it is that companies aren't measuring the costs of hiring mistakes so they're not really thinking about it oftentimes they're focused on the what and not the who and we all know companies are successful because of the people for\nLeads to a retention of not just three employees who who's been hired but also for their college was well because we want to have a good trip or afternoon Susan ... who was a chief drove advisor to them if we could get your website and phone number ...\nSure my website is Suzanne Kelly dot com SUV ... and any Kelly K.

obviously made your career as a recruiter and were hired by huge corporations are from all over the over the country and all over the world and now you moved to Westchester gas\nLaw and obviously as joining the business costs of Westchester which were thrilled about you are beginning to engage in working with a with businesses in Westchester County talk to me a little bit about the move I mean obviously was is not something you just probably the size of the last minute of something that you've bought out and how it's going\nI I did I thought I thought about it for over a year and I moved up within the last nine months from Connecticut from Stamford, Connecticut to Terry town\nI'm living right on the river I couldn't be happier I've met so many wonderful people in West Chester I'm really excited about the business council Peter and Karen introduced me and so it's just been an extraordinary experience and I'm only getting started ...\n... and again the opportunity to have you not only on our show oh you're also going to be speaking to our small business council or to really begin introducing yourself and and the experiences that you've brought to them as well as some of the lessons that can be learned [noise] I'm On the flip side of all that\nObviously a you come in and you give your clients all the road map if you will on how to do the best tire 'em and sometimes about\nNot work because they just won't stick to the script if you will and they go off on their own and then you have to clean up the mess so to speak\nOf this really a lot of mess for me to clean up because I'm not placing category and you know that expression you can bring a horse to water but you can't make it drink\nUh but I I think most of them are very receptive than just helping them to create awareness around hiring insights and strategies\nOr is it really empowering for them and it gives me so much satisfaction to help them grow at because there are a lot of companies that are not equipped to absorb the losses of hiring mistakes like larger companies and I'm really a huge advocate for them\nAnd I guess also because you've seen\nThe process work in the process was not work you've had what people call by how moments where you really so you know what if I could leave my client with one piece of information that will stick with them as they go through this process of done my job so can you talk a little bit about some of those\nIt would be don't skip the reference chat and that is so critically important to establishing whether or not someone is he thinks they are and\nI'm curious and again I I fell into the same problem to people not do people skip the reference ... either because they're at the point they really feel that they have a connection with this person they like this person can really do the job or do they just think you know what I'm I'll get to it from time later\nTo absorb the losses of hiring mistakes like larger companies and I'm really a huge advocate for them\nAnd I just also because you've seen\nA process work in the process was not work you've had what people call by how moments where you really so you know what if I could leave my client with one piece of information that will stick with them as they go through this process of done my job so can you talk a little bit about some of those\nIt would be don't skip the reference chat and that is so critically important to establishing whether or not someone is he thinks they are\nAnd I'm curious and again I I fell into the same problem to people not to people skip the reference strict either because they're at the point they really feel that they have a connection with this person they like this person can really do the job or do they just think you know what I'm I'll get to it from time later I'm the most important thing is filling deposition now\nI'm I'm really happy that you asked that question so first of all if you make a hiring decision if you if you make a hiring decision and then decide to do the reference check\nYour flirting with disaster because you're already psychologically invested in that person so once you've selected your top tier candidates and before you made that decision is the time to conduct the reference check\nBut ... what I find and what I found and and again hiring mistakes don't discriminate you would be shocked at the companies that treat this process is completely cursory and check the box\nBut what I find is that once they've decided to hire they make it a a formality of the offer letter\nIt becomes extremely cursory or it even gets delegated to the back office one company that I worked with a very large market research firm\nHad a policy for compliance purposes to check references but their policy didn't in the process didn't involve reading them after they came back and so one of the business leaders came to me and had a huge\nHiring disaster on his hands\nSo it's it that would be like the number one thing I Would say because if a resume and an interview and an instinct establishments whether or not someone could do a job or fit into a culture they would never be about higher better I guess\nIt was which was so surprising when you when you when the way you just laid out a for a business to issue an offer letter\nWhich is a in a sense of the story of a binding contract because we should lay out again the start of employment salary whatever health benefits or our one case might be a real well the answer move out during the references first then as you said as soon as that person steps for then there's a real red lights go off of this is not\nWhat we thought it would be ... I Believe it was already a major disadvantage and also could probably be liable for for ...\n... exactly it's the most valuable component of the hiring process in my opinion and the most shockingly underutilized but it all starts with awareness because we can't have awareness without awareness and that's when I'm here for\nOur justice afternoon is a sin ... who's the chief telling my mother ah she's I knew a member of the business of Westchester but more importantly she's bringing in expertise to businesses of all sizes on really would hopefully help them as they play on their future are and I think that that's so critical as businesses\nBegin to to to want to expand\nAnd sometimes ah we've seen where people have a great idea and a great vision of how they want to expand but again it's\nSometimes they need to slow down and think about who they're going to put in those positions through the methodologies which you've developed can you help refocus or some of those people those situations where people can take a breath and so you know what was really think about what makes them\nIt all starts with awareness because we can't have awareness without awareness and who and that's what I'm here for\nOr just this afternoon is uh to send ... Kelly who's achieved town advisor or she's I knew a member of the business council of Westchester but more importantly she's bringing expertise to businesses of all sizes on really what could hopefully help them as they play on their future uh and I think that that's so critical as businesses\nBegin to to to want to expand\nAnd sometimes ah we've seen it where people have a great idea and a great vision of how they want to expand but again it\nSometimes they need to slow down and think again about who they're going to put in those positions through the methodologies that you've developed can you help refocus or some of those ... those situations so people can again to take a breath and say you know what was really think about what makes the most sense for us entirely repetition yeah\nYou got to you you got to prepare for things like that it's not like an ... you know something unexpected and you've got to say yeah we got five planes on a hanger these planes are in the hangar all the time anyway well they're getting routine maintenance that's correct well routine maintenance as like Fifteen hours every hour flight time minds are very\nHard to prepare for flight they're they're like an old Ferrari yeah well there are like a brand new Ferrari that needs a lot of maintenance no but hold for our you need a lot of war and we're going to have to check into that one I if we can uh we moved our microphone\nThey'll go it was okay I ... down anyway I think it's a that's really odd you got to get those planes out of there\nAre those that's a billion dollars worth of airplanes sitting there that um you know or that they I guess like a damage hopefully not to severely homeland nobody got hurt us all the more important but yeah absolutely\nAnd speaking of the storm a more than five thousand troops under the ... us northern command and Colorado Springs have had it down to forward to help out with relief efforts equipped with a hundred helicopters Ninety

B. O. X.\nGames\nWelcome to focus on the state capital there's kind of a wonderful warm summer weather that we're having today almost Florida like\nGood thing it's not really Florida like at least if you're in the panhandle of Florida I was just looking at some of the stories about hurricane Michael as a category for I mean this is really very very serious or could be a lot of loss of life\nLife tremendous property damage and just the fact that no category for apparently has ever hit the panhandle of Florida before\nIn a way he says it all so hopefully the people down there will be OK I'm excited about today's show I've already hearing from some people who saw that I had that she has doubts that Senator Joe Bruno the former Senate majority leader\nOnce the most powerful Republican figure in New York state really are upstate New York certainly and the most powerful figure in upstate New York when he was the leader of the Senate when the Republicans really had a strong Senate majority are reasonably strong one\nHe was a powerful figure even stood up to the Republican governor\nWho helped elect George Pataki and Becky for those who know the history kinda turned himself into a Democrat burn some degree I resisted that and ah he um\n[noise] how one uh the um [noise] uh in ... I think response from Kentucky at one point but that's kind of ancient history shepherd has been retired for several years as many people now the fed broad very serious criminal charges against him he was convicted on the first trial reversed\nFor cost of a decision by the Supreme Court tried again and I'm Troy hours over our excuse me Albany in federal court in Albany I went to that trial and covered it for the show it I'm a horrified me how weak\nThe evidence was against Bruno and arguably I Would argue that there was no evidence of all at all of any criminal conduct and I didn't take the jury long it was a stunning moment that I'll always recorder I recall in the courtroom when the jury came and it looked like the judges draw dropped at the time and they said\nA verdict of not guilty and I'm juvenile has gone on from there is a corporate executive I think it's fair to say he's enjoying a is retired semi retirement down in Florida at times he also still lives in Brunswick and rents are county where I when I met him many many many many years ago\nHe was the high energy rents are county a Republican share and he ... he of course become a senator but he was once a leading figure in the Republican Party before he had gotten into a elective office\nMe how weak the evidence was against Bruno and arguably I Would argue that there was no evidence of all at all of any criminal conduct and uh it didn't take the jury long it was a stunning moment that I'll always real core I recall in the courtroom when the jury came and it looked like the judges draw dropped as the time and they said\nA verdict of not guilty and I'm Cuban who's gone on from there is a corporate executives I think it's fair to say he's enjoying a he's retired semi retirement down in Florida at times he also still lives in uh Brunswick in ... county where I when I met him many many many many years ago\nHe was the high energy rents are county a Republican share\nAnd he ... he of course become a senator but he was once a leading figure in the Republican Party before he had gotten into a elective office and they did a good job over there and he and bill powers are also came from ... county was of was also a Republican\nCounty chair really a lead the renaissance so it was a historic high point for the Republican Party\nReelection Daphne Jordan is the Republican candidates seeking to succeed her and she's running against Aaron glad the Democrat who's a former Cuomo operative I gather Andrew Cuomo operative who uh unexpectedly I Would think although maybe on the inside of wasn't unexpected received the endorsement yesterday to Democrats id\nI've kind of a turn coat Republican Roy McDonald who used to be the Wilson town supervisor and became a senator I think he succeeded you\nAnd he became very embittered because a caffeine marsh showing the current senator defeated him in the Republican primary after he back climbing supporting same sex marriage but that's the context in which you're now indoors indefinitely Jordan isn't that new Jordan is it not\nThat's exactly right Fred and thank you for that and that background and that's why you know I'm On the phone and is critically important [noise] and um\nHe kept the marsh you own excelled as a senator representative of the district and she supports a dance me and then a quick break closely with her and work with her for a number of years\nAnd that is nice the mother of two boys so why she's ... she had a couple of small businesses earlier in her life\nAnd uh all well rounded and very learned in knows how to function in government and in society\nAnd in business so she would be a great addition to the Republicans and to the Republican majority but friends I really need\nCritically important and um\nHe kept the marsh you own excelled as a senator very representative of the district and she supports a dance knee and dance and he worked very closely with her and work with her for a number of years\nIn the past needs the mother of two boys so why she's ... she had a couple of small businesses earlier in her life\nAnd uh oh well rounded and very learned in knows how to function in government and in society\nAnd in business so she would be a great addition to the Republicans and to the Republican majority but friends I really\nNeed to dwell on check and balance the governor's an executive and there's three branches government the executive legislative judicial\nAnd the executive is Democrat and wants his work Pataki was Republican but we have Democrats great deal of the time and that's fine\nBut the legislature is split and has been Republican in the sense that is why definitely is a critical edition and the forty ... district and I don't take anything away from her opponent because I Know him\nBut I Know he works in the governor's office now I Believe\nAnd um [noise] but that's not representative to me in a check and balance because he would be primarily voting than have to almost with the state Democrats [noise] so that's why I'm On the are now in finders critically important\nAh that definitely get the support of the majority of the people in the forties or district after the short because she will be truly representative and be a welcome addition to majority in the New York state Senate\nSaturday you make of Roy McDonald supported as Democrats and he's a guy who was I don't know if he's a lifelong Republican but he was a long time Republican official what are your truck it up to where do you have you had a chance to speak to him about it\nI Am not spoken to Roy when I talked with him many many months ago\nHe was very cordial very friendly and very pleasant I always do well with a with Roy\nI helped him get elected his first time I get one of the largest contributions ever I think by an individual up from my campaign account to Roy to help them get elected helped him get the nomination and so I'm absolutely amazed and surprised\nA that he would be doing this but again in a democracy is a free country people have a right to express themselves\nAnd so I'm not good not good with it but he does or how does it because she's a ... pen in citizen and has a right to do with it\nBut I just think it's the wrong way to go and Daphne Jordan is the right choice poor checks and balances and the un representative of upstate New York in the capital region\nAnd again if I wasn't in the majority when I was in the Senate all of the good things that we're able to do with all the support that I got from great friends and people like Daphne\nWould not have happened in the capital region in upstate New York we offered to balance to the rest of the state and I'm proud that we were able to do what we did which Puerto so many people including you for it\nWell I I wouldn't I Would just describing what was going on as a journalist and to the extent that you saw that as supportive I saw it as being objective and honest about\nBut I just think it's the wrong way to go and Daphne Jordan is the right choice poor checks and balances and the un representative of upstate New York in the capital region and again\nIf I wasn't in the majority when I was in the Senate all of the good things that we're able to do with all the support as I got from great friends and people like Daphne\nWould not have happened in the capital region in upstate New York we offer the balance to the rest of the state and I'm proud that we were able to do what we did which Puerto so many people including you for it\n[laughter] well I I wouldn't I Would just describing what was going on as a journalist and to the extent that you saw that as supportive I saw it as being objective and honest about the reality is out there you know anything about Aaron glad the Democratic candidates\nI've never heard of them I've covered the area you're old district for many many years I've never heard of him doing anything related to the area have you are you familiar with them at all\nNope I really I don't know I don't believe I've ever met him and I'm actually I didn't know who was running until just a while ago but I Do know that he has a mass ... a lot of money\nYou know it's Colombo money a lot of the first time caller I'm always you know the governor is thrown themselves into this because he's got to keep the or left wing Democrats who've been so critical of him off his back so he's made a major play this year for the first time\n[noise] well and I think you'll hear from her opponent because he does have a lot of money and he will be spending the last couple of weeks and that's just kind of smart politics because that's when people are totally focused\nAnd both get out to vote but again it's a free country for each day and the people I have a right to do whatever\nYou know I Am talking up jak differently about what's best for upstate New York especially as the capital region especially and that's that checks and balance a balance will come from a senator like Daphne Jordan and\nThe majority in the Republican Senate\nCenter I Know you're not directly involved you may not even the following it that closely but I'm sure you're following\nPolitics to some degree and a tremendous polarization and the country over President Trump it looks like here in New York the Democrat to a considerable degree or trying to\nNationalize the local elections and make President Trump a local issue makeup Brett Kavanaugh wine is nomination to the Supreme Court a local issue\nWe even have a situation now where the candidate for governor of your party mark mowing arrow is ultimately saying he didn't vote for President Trump and he refused to say whether he thought Britain cabinet should be confirmed for the Senate or not\nYou think that's going to be a smart tactic in New York or do you think this is your party risk alienating many Republican voters or maybe some voters who may not be Republicans like some of what Trump is doing\nBy saying away from the president and the way they are\nWell uh I Know politically predators you know as a pro I bet you have to be pretty objective and pick your spots in right now in New York state polls show Trump is very unpopular\nSo you don't want to be crappy and his coat tails wouldn't have sat on popular but I can tell you this whether we like President Trump or not\nA lot of what he has done whereas the lowest unemployment rate and and the I think ever in the United states three point seven percent\nOr the economic growth which is breaking records stock market\nParty risk alienating many Republican voters or maybe some voters who may not be Republicans like some of what Trump is doing by saying away from the president and the way they are\nWell I I Know politically predators you know as a pro I bet you have to be pretty objective and pick your spots in right now in New York state polls show Trump is very unpopular\nSo you don't want to be crappy and his coat tails wouldn't have sat unpopular but I can tell you this whether we like President Trump or not\nA lot of what he has done whereas the lowest unemployment rate and and the I think ever in the United states three point seven\nPercent or the economic growth which is breaking records stock market was somewhat reflexive all the positive what he's been doing some of the foreign affairs like with North Korea is\nAn Brickell and so you have to give him credit worthy of like him or not now he talks too much in my mind he creates a lot of the negativity he should he talks when he should be listening and I know him extremely well\nAnd I'm always had a great report to be with them talk with him after he was elected president\nAnd a big could genial very friendly and very personable but you know people have to make their own choices for objectively if you take a look\nAt what's going on in the country I think you have to come down on the side of the positive\nWrap it around you in New York state politically doesn't help because his numbers are often you know ... ... people know that Democrats and Republicans know that\nThere and just quickly or as you are well now you're a conference someone you are close to one time a politically lost one of its members a long time Senator Frank pattern van I passed away yesterday just any quick so much about the Senate or we have about a minute and a half left\nI'm just so sad and they hear about that Frank was a great friend a real patriots you probably know he was in the circus like active duty for about Twenty years\nThe ... year was here in the army I sometimes I feel okay\nHe was in the service yeah he was Thirty years in the reserves and I'm sure with great distinction became an officer and then when he came into the sun and I think two thirty\nSeven years in one of the most democratic districts and all of New York state in Queens\nTen to one Democrat enrollment he was left to it for thirty seven years\nAnd you want to talk about a patriot in a in a true spirit of a democracy that wins Frank ... he was a great friend and when I was leaving he does everything he could to keep you there I'm Talking personally and end conference\nTrue spirit of a democracy that would strike better than he was a great friend and when I was leaving he does everything he could keep you there I'm Talking personally and end conference\nThat's about what the amount of\nThe cat okay now I got I heard Roy McDonald snake mentioned which always makes my ears perk up in two thousand and two I was up at the sunset in North Troy a political event like before election\nAnd Roy myself and someone else for on stage Roy always kind of guy ... how patriotic is he drank out the picture of him and his Marine Corps uniform you know at the VFW cake and all that they had that happened to Mike and they asked him to do the pledge of allegiance\nHe froze up hand it to make and ran off the stage\nWhere did you make of that what does that say it's a win back that's the short answer is a win back\nIra thank you would get some other callers out there I Want to go to Saratoga Springs where a longtime public officials who I knew in my year early years as a journalist and I still do today I think is on the line and he's a longtime public works commissioner up in Saratoga Springs comic tiger morning John nice to hear from you in\nThe morning Fred uh I really enjoyed the talk your head with a former senator Bruno\nYou know working for the legislature for the number of years that I work I certainly understand the leadership and we'll never see that kind of power come to this is true and the leadership he brought here to this district and he was very good to our community\nThat is democratic you're a Democrat or Republican\nQuestion no question about it I was concerned and interested in doing things for my community and senator Bruno was very very supportive of many things that we did hear in Saratoga Springs\nMatter of fact he gave on the lead money to put up a terror cell in Congress park beautiful or a hundred and twenty five thousand dollars that would've allowed us to put that ... not in Congress park he also gave us money to do improvements on union avenue\nYou also made a donation or towards the improvement is fitness fat when was vandalized in the park\nI knew how important it was working at the legislature over the years but I Know what upset many of my democratic friends here in the city that I Would even consider working with senator ruined though but I was concerned for the improvements for the community that nine that never mind the politics of it all he was a great guy yeah and what they did him was was\nWas unbelievable I leave that I couldn't believe the money that the federal government spent and the people that they had investigating him over the years who is in the millions and millions of dollars and a pretty much tried to break them\nSome good here for you and thanks for listening comic type longtime official in Saratoga Springs is go to Steve in Albany wants to comment on the narrow go right ahead thieves\n[laughter] it's\nI'm trying to figure out who I'm going to vote for for governor because uh I certainly don't want to vote for the current governor\nAnd ... seems to only know about down state and then we you know talks about corruption some everybody talks about corruption even Cuomo sure\nSo I'm trying to figure out who I Wish John Francisco had been the Republican nominee right and I and I don't know why the county chairman chairs and the committee people decided on\nMark mall narrow I Wish I knew that and I'm thinking about voting for a\nA Stephanie mind\nKnow the former mayor of Syracuse who at least knows what the problems of upstate New York orange seems to be pretty candid about a lot of the problem didn't look at how honesty is about Andrew Cuomo now she was Cuomo's top pick to help lead the Democratic party and now she's very\nAnd more narrow seems to only know about down state and then we you know talks about corruption some everybody talks about corruption even Cuomo sure\nSo I'm trying to figure out who I Wish John Francisco it in the Republican nominee right and and I don't know why the county chairman chairs and the committee people decided on\nMark mall now I Wish I knew that and I was thinking about voting for a a Stephanie minor\nYou know the former mayor of Syracuse who at least knows what the problems of upstate New York are and seems to be pretty candid about a lot of the problems and look at how honestly is about Andrew Cuomo now she was Cuomo's top pick to help lead the Democratic party and now she's very very critical\nWhat do you think about that it seems to me that whatever you whatever we whoever we vote for a thread governors don't give back when the question is how does how to send a message to the Republican Party\nI mean they're looking for a protest route I think Stephanie ... is a good place to go she's not going to win\nA neither is the libertarian candidate or the Green Party candidate so if you don't like about arrow and I know a lot of people are disappointed is not mowing arrow personally if the forces behind him and his failure to run a real campaign and you shouldn't have been in that position if it wasn't going to be able to do so and they shouldn't have put them in that position\nWithout the guarantees of money which he is not gotten so we just have to find\nThe right protests and all that I think Stephanie mine is probably a good one games that are going to take a break right now

issues at hand in your assembly race\nWell no I was a pleasure to be here and thanks so much for a given the opportunity to come on your show um but yeah I mean I'm I'm Joe opinion born and raised in Yonkers\nOr like a set of someone who um is that the opportunity to talk about you know political issues on CNN and Fox News but more importantly again had the opportunity to do a lot of work I'm at the nonprofit sector um had the opportunity to be a huge development director I'm helping to\nCreate an actual funds to provide at risk youth with the resources they needed to be able to go away to college\nUm people don't really realize that extra two thousand dollars extra three thousand dollars that kids need a particularly kids of of of various uh various financial or disadvantages um has a big difference on what did they have the ability to go away to college or whether they end up\nI'm having to ah pursue educational opportunities close to home\nUm and so we were able to do a lot of that work um and to me you know making the decision to get into the race to run for state assembly in my home town of Yonkers was really simply about the fact that I saw\nA home town that I loved in trouble um I saw a city with twenty four percent of our children living in poverty I'm Seventy percent of our children not able to afford lunch saw those who attended a public schools\nSo I saw a city would eat and eat meat um and a leadership devoid of a plan to meet those needs um and so that's why I thought it was time for somebody to step up this the first time were happening at the post election at the state level than eight years in a city of Yonkers and I think that the ... elections I missed part of the reason why\nAre the resources that Yonkers needs um\nIs um has a big difference on whether they have the ability to go away to college or whether they end up I'm having to ah pursue educational opportunities close to home\nUm and so we were able to do a lot of that work um and to me you know making the decision to get in the race on to run for state assembly in my home town of Yonkers was really simply about the fact that I saw\nA home town that I loved in trouble um I saw a city with twenty four percent of our children living in poverty I'm Seventy percent of our children not able to afford lunch saw those who attended a public schools\nSo I saw city would eat and eat and eat 'em and a leadership devoid of a plan to meet those needs um and so that's why I thought it was time for somebody to step up this the first time were happening at a public lecture at the state level in eight years in a city of Yonkers and I think that the apathy of unemployed lessons I'm it's part of the reason why\nI'm the resources that Yonkers needs 'em and they reach was that our children deserve um have not been provided\n... experts to her job because I have to tell you a that's the western part of the county here in the eastern part of the county and

community in Mount Vernon\nAnd I have to tell you that these kids are very curious they're very interested and I am very much surprised that they're open to war message that my friends and I bring which is sort of pro business not political at all but the orientation so that's why I think it's great\nThat you're representing the Republican Party in a race that you say has not been opposed and

ninth about over where I Hope to be talking about other issues of the day state local\nFederal international intergalactic if possible whatever's in the news we look to talk about it here at WBAI works tonight I'm speaking to Joe pinion and we're talking to our listener Chris Chris you were making a point\nYeah at the point about school security you know which I think it's a bit more complicated and the and the school board you know because you know you're on a ... it's a separate a\nKind of a a a shuttered political activity or entity within a community you know as opposed to when you have a mayoral control or a school district I think it's\nYou know be a ... protection is done with police so what is the protection system in Yonkers shut ... you know security she'll security\n... what would we do have obviously would not would not arming teachers or anything like that I mean we do have a security guards um and ah there have been efforts to try to see if those security guards can be put under the purview of the youngest police department um I Know that uh you know are they school\nResource officers or their school resource officers\nAre you talking we we have reached with officers yeah we used to secure all of the day not they're not under the authority of the Yonkers police department and so I Know that they have been efforts 'em by people to do that um to me I think that we as not only in the city but as a nation we have\nA big what happened the wrong conversation I mean when you talk about school safety you're talking about infrastructure\nI think that to me that is the missing component of the conversation that we're not did not being had because that is not a conversation that is sexy what gets people to vote I'm particularly in some place like Yonkers we're getting ready to potentially hopefully spend two billion dollars\nTo revitalize schools I'm going to the question must be asked it what are the things that we are building into um those infrastructure plan that are appearing security security I mean like I said you talk to you any of my friends in the army or the navy\nThey'll tell you the first thing they do when they start talking about threat assessment is not to go go and get more guns I may have how do we secured the perimeter and how do we have the ability to lock down the buildings infected by sector unfortunately we need to start having a plan\nOn that relates to perimeter security and also sector by sector um locked down within the school for our children um because we know that that the threat that they will be facing in years to come a much different than the threats that the schools that were built a hundred and fifty years ago as the case in Yonkers where the average ... eighty five years old I'm those threaten exist back\nNow are just two billion dollars who has floated the numbers that in the so we got the uh the Yonkers school redevelopment a ... look at that point to the you know one point six billion dollar plan to uh to reinvigorate Duncan schools\nUm that plan has been approved however that plan also on the upper middle of the state legislature um however that plan does not um\nHey how do we secured the perimeter and how do we have the ability to lock down the buildings sector by sector unfortunately we need to start having a plan on that relates to perimeter security and also sector by sector um locked down within the school for our children um\nBecause we know that that the threat that they will be facing in years to come a much different than the threats that the schools that were built a hundred and fifty years ago as in the case in Yonkers where the average school in eighty five years old I'm those threatening exist back then and now are just two billion dollars who has\nFloated that numbers that in the Soviets in a week later the Yonkers school redevelopment a by looking at parts of the you know one point six billion dollar plan to ... to reinvigorate Duncan schools\nUm that plan has been approved however that plan also only approved by the state legislature um however that plan does not um include the dollars that we really need to actually build the school is Nick in entirety right you're talking about the fact that we're still on the hook\nOn for a large chunk of that money because we only get a Seventy percent reimbursement for capital investment um and so again like I said there's that you'll be outstanding thirty percent and ... religion you can make your ankles or the forty five percent when you factor in the bonding on the at the city where some on the hook for of course I'm interested\nIn what concerns me again that's a good number two billion one point six is pretty good too but let's face it it seems to me what Joe has eluded to win what we're talking about now is a centralized funding centralized taxing and disbursement of\nBig amounts of money to localities but lack of local control I sort of wish a lot of this money could have been raised or at least solicited locally and spent locally that's white community schools is such an attractive title I know we need to dive deep and to know what it means but I just get the feeling Christ that centralized\nSchool funding in school administration is the same problem is\nCentralized political administration there's a lot of ways and Albany is a lot further from Yonkers than the miles would indicate what is it a hundred and Fifteen miles in terms of spending and responsibility that's what scares me that's what I like about charters Chris\nYeah well I mean you got to remember if they commit to public education comes down from the state of the state constitution so you know it's it's they have a a primary responsibility for that or you know for for the educational\nThat's the tradition Chris thank you thanks for pointing that out and thanks for calling again speaking two weeks [noise] this is Steve ... show and without further production let's go to our next caller Mitch Mitch\nHey how ya doing the ... I Know we we only have a few seconds so let me just get to the point a charter schools now there's a charter school in Yonkers or\nYou know it does well but it also doesn't take a children with a special needs which as we all know it's been a major challenge for for all schools\nAnd they get to say no we don't take that those kids go to the school says right [noise] and in spite of that the public school system\nHas an eight week let me be eighty three percent graduation rate that they're the best of all the five big cities eighty three percent isn't it an amazing amount a a nun but given that the challenges that such a school system has [noise]\nAnd they don't get the credit so yeah you know they might be some good for charter schools but weren't showing them how to do it\nA major challenge for foot wall schools and they get to say no we don't take that those kids go to the school says right\nAnd in spite of that the public school system\nHas an eighties week let me repeat eighty three percent\nGraduation rate that they're the best of all the five big cities eighty three percent isn't it an amazing amount a a nun but given that the challenges that such a school system has [noise] and they don't get the credit so yeah you know they might be some good for charter schools\nOr less the agenda for the Democratic party\nThey used to be a group called the end the sea new democratic coalition new democratic coalition that used to harass\nMy father because he wasn't liberal enough believe it or not [noise]\nUm most people would say uh he was a great liberal or many people would say he was too liberal but\nThere was a left to my father who complained that he was a not left enough [noise] ah he would say they were professional\nUh liberals or professional a political people meaning that uh\nThey have a valid point of view but it's a\nProfessional point of view or as opposed to a populist point of view I think that's actually exacerbated now and if I can just take another second on it you have\nA group of political people who are are engaged on a daily basis for one reason or another they're running an organization with it\nA political reporter or blog ... and the communication and intensity among them is much higher\nThat is ... Instagram and the energy they generate among themselves is much higher\nThan it has been in the past and some of them then believe that\nIs reality or it's not reality are that's their own political reality reality is what\nAre people live day to day who aren't reading blogs because they have jobs and they're trying to make ends meet [noise] uh and uh one uh\nAn organization with it a political reporter or blogger and the communication and intensity among them is much higher\nThat is ... Instagram and the energy they generate among themselves is much higher than it has been in the past than some of them then believe that\nIs reality or it's not reality are that's their own political reality reality is what\nAre people live day to day who aren't reading blogs because they have jobs and they're trying to make ends meet [noise]\nUh and uh when it came to the primary uh this state is the most progressive state in the United states of America\nNot because of blogger whole pines but because people know it they know that we passed the marriage or ... it was a very big deal they know that I passed the gun saved the law they lived that they heard that they saw the controversy [noise]\nAh they know that I raise the minimum wage to the highest in the country because to point three million people got a raise or that's how they know they see it in their paycheck\nOr they know that we have uh the best free college tuition for middle class families in the country because they're looking at it for their child [noise] so uh I understand the academic attack but\nYou're not going to tell the people in this state that I'm not a progressive because they know differently\nOr governor I Want to label you forgive me or that are you a centrist or a progressive ...\nI Am a pragmatic progressive [noise]\nWhose definition was that bill those your father yep of yeah let me ask you but let\nLet me interrupt her for a second I think about that for a second pragmatic progressive now this is Mario Cuomo right the the greatest a liberal or the greatest intellectual politician\nProgressive why and I I hated the term by the way I used to [laughter] you know no one understands without me and he would say\nAs only if they're not smart enough to know where to meetings I don't can't hear\nPragmatic progressive\nIt almost sounded like an oxymoron but his point was\nYou cannot be a pro grass of if you want to not pragmatic there is no academic progressive politics\nProgressive ... politics happens\nIn actuality there is no theoretical progressive politics either you made my life better or you didn't either I have more a bread on the table or I don't\nI don't want to hear your theory and your intellectual exercise\nI don't care they're\nPragmatic progressive\nIt almost sounded like an oxymoron but his point was\nYou cannot be a pro aggressive if you want not pragmatic there is no academic progressive politics\nProgressive ... politics happens\nIn actuality there is no theoretical progressive politics either you made in my life better or you didn't either I have more a bread on the table or I don't\nI don't want to hear your theory and your intellectual exercise and your academic\nPolitical analysis\nI Want progress in my life because I needed because I'm poor because I'm a working family because I'm disabled because I'm a victim of discrimination so I Need progress so his point was\nProgressive needs a model fire\nAnd the model fire is the word pragmatic\nNot because [noise]\nIt is a an oxymoron or inconsistent but it as a model fire it is the practical\nProgress it is the actuality and the concrete accomplishment of the a progressive a theory that was his point and when you are an executive\nAh you realized very quickly as opposed to a legislative branch or a an academic a beer is to make actual will change\nThat is much harder read it often involves compromise or it didn't ... it involves nuance it involves fashioning a specific solution a to a problem\nAnd it's not as easy as just old pining or pontificate ing about absolute ideal as some of the pragmatic\nTakes you to a different place we now have to get it done that means I Need to get a piece of legislation passed that means I have to talk to Republicans that means I have to talk to conservative Democrats that means we're going to have to shift a little bit from the ideal\nBecause we live in the radio and that's the pragmatic part\nA and he would voice this or in the on growing debate he had at that time with the people who were to his left\nAnd he would say look it's very easy to be a purist ideologically if you don't have to get anything done right there boil it is is about a writing a paper on it or giving a speech on it\nThen it's easy to advocate for the perfect\nUh but if you have to get something done as an executive or because you believe people actually need help or and because you actually want to improve the situation that then introduced\nPart a and he would voice this or in the on growing debate he had at that time with the people who were to his left\nAnd he would say look it's very easy to be a purist ideologically if you don't have to get anything done right there boil it is about a writing a paper on it or giving a speech on it\nThen it's easy to advocate for the perfect\nUh but if you have to get something done as an executive or because you believe people actually need help or and because you actually want to improve the situation\nThat then introduces the element of pragmatism so he was a pragmatic\nProgressive uh and that's what I Would call myself\nGovernor or what first of all the clock is ticking\nOr the Democrats [noise] your party they got to pull out somebody again\nPresident Trump's first of all uh I ... risk our friendship full of many many years or is it possible uh like Donald Trump President Trump and Governor Cuomo\nAnything is possible [noise] ah the can you like both\nA theories both philosophies ah no\nUh my philosophy\nMy theory of government is a diametrically opposed a this house so this president the lights in division or he thrives\nIn division it's not just that he thrives in competition or he thrives confrontation he thrives in division\nUh he he looks to energize people through anger I Believe\nUh I Try to do the opposite [noise] uh I Try to appeal to people's better angels now it's much easier to appeal to fear\nAre they the book on Andrew Cuomo governor Andrew Cuomo is that he's he's respected even your critics respect or that he he's got dynamism he's a he nobody knows the levers of government\nLike Governor Cuomo he's the door a he's in the Catholic\nOr you were the son of a man they called the great philosopher states one of the American ... Boston Globe and I hear that day I hear your voice\nI hear it in your thoughtful comment why the hell there to talk more like this you know bill [noise] with all due respect nah\nNah it with ... [noise] the\nIt was a different time when my father growing burned they don't give you more than thirty seconds they there's no the the intelligence\nThe substance of government that theory of government the philosophy of government\nUh there's very little appetite for that now [noise] ah I don't want to get myself into too much trouble but [noise]\nYou know we had great reporter's back then where you could have a two hour conversation on an issue before they\nWould write a story and they would think about it and research it we're in an age of blogs and tweets and frankly reporters who don't have the background\nOr or the time to develop a a really substantive piece [noise] my father\nWas a brilliant communicator he was a brilliant intellectual\nUh uh uh but he also had died pragmatic side [noise]\nA part of it I think is a reaction to what they said about my father because they said that about my father but also remember they said uh unfairly but so much of this business is unfair\nBut he didn't accomplish a enough right\nThe naysayers the the nasty ones\nUh and I won't mention it all the blonde argument yeah so hard to write he gave a great speech but he didn't get anything done he gave a great great talker that's what he called the dumb blonde\nUh uh but he also had died pragmatic side [noise]\nA part of it I think is a reaction to what they said about my father because they said that about my father but also remember they said ah unfairly but so much of this business is unfair\nBut he didn't accomplish a enough right the naysayers the nasty ones\nUh and I won't mention it all blond or yeah or to do it right he gave a great speech but\nHe didn't get anything done he gave a great great talker that's what he called the dumb blonde you can't say that any more but was it [noise] but he did call it the dumb blonde singer ...\nLet let me ask you as you go for a for governor or president or whatever is in your future and Mario Cuomo wanna be love or they want to be respect because as I hear you today\nOn this rainy drugs and the uh [noise] you know really showing this and they're wonderful stuff what do you want to be loved to respect\nI wanted it all I Want to be loved by the people I respect\nAnd\nI'm going to give you the final words were grateful [noise] was your father's a\nVacuum good to talk to my brother though thank you for [laughter]\nFor you to\nRochelle are pretty town needed to learn [noise] judges\nThings don't Daniels detonation lawsuit against President Trump the ruling also said that the president is entitled to win a war of his attorney's fees again Stormy Daniels\nA copy the ruling is coming on no amount of spin or commentary by Stormy Daniels are her lawyer Michael ... can't truthfully characterize today's ruling in any other way than ... total victory for President Trump and defeat for so many Daniel the announcer the award for President Trump's attorney fees will be determined to add a later date once again a federal\nJudge dismissing Stormy Daniels defamation suit against President Trump\nThe federal budget deficit hits a six year high federal\nBudget deficit hit seven hundred and Seventy nine billion dollars in fiscal year twenty Eighteen Seventeen percent higher than the previous year in the highest deficit total sense twenty twelve\nThe Treasury Department figure shows tax revenues were up slightly for the year spending increase more than three percent increase in defense spending disaster relief Medicaid and Social Security\nCongress passed the tax cut bill in December signed into law by the president that summit show deficits topping a trillion dollars and twenty Nineteen and twenty twenty [laughter]\nThat would match the deficits in two thousand nine through ... eleven that followed the financial crisis and Greg recession\nIn Washington Jared how for Fox new\nSecond largest health insurance agreed to pay the government records sixteen million dollars in federal potential privacy violations of the biggest known healthcare hack in us history their personal information of nearly Seventy nine million people including birth date\nSocial Security numbers in medical ideas but exposed in the hack which anthem discovered three years ago the company also agreed to a corrective action plan that will be monitored by the government and Detroit police say they will\nWith increased in defense spending disaster relief Medicaid and Social Security Congress passed the tax cut bill in December signed into law by the president estimate show deficits topping a trillion dollars and twenty Nineteen and twenty twenty\nThat would match the deficits in two thousand nine ... eleven that followed the financial crisis and great recession\nIn Washington ...
