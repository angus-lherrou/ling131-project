the devil made me do it could save ...\nImplied exactly right let's move on to the elections you know it's gotten so bad that the polls are diametrically opposed to depending on who got the polls MSNBC says the Democrats are going bizarre Fox says the Democrats are going down\nThey put on ... clearly biased talk show hosts and and parading around as news people it's sickening what's really what's your view of the mid term\nI I think that you look at the independence the independence looked like the great thing you know breaking a democratic\nI think that the uh if you look at his favorite boats a federal Bolger up by the way in a partner at least in the Fox poll on a couple of other polls\nAre they're they're up in a high forties\nUm which is not helpful to the Democrats but if you look at the favorite bowls and the independence they they're down in a high thirties so uh if the independence of going to come out now they're going to a vote and they may\nThey may have you know I have yeah\nKiller independence and you've got the other ones that just don't like you know they they said on like a party and they usually come out\nIn the midterms so uh I think that it's there I think I think that that it's a horse race all around that's the way I I see\nYou really do we trust to pose as much as we\nIf you look at his favorite boats are favorable to her up by the way in a partner at least in the Fox poll on a couple of other polls uh their their weapon a high forties um which is not helpful to the Democrats\nBut if you look at the fate we're both in the independence they they're down in a you know high thirties so uh if the independence of going to come out and if they're going to vote and they may they may have you know I have yeah\nKiller independence and you've got the other ones that just don't like you know they say they're on like a party and they usually come out\nIn the midterms so uh I think it's it's there I think I think that that it's a horse race all around that's the way I I see\nYou really do we trust to pose as much as we used to I mean the polls said that that Mr Trump who's going to go down massively and he does not he won't\n... no no you know you can't then I ever talked to her friends who are both those ... you know good old stuff and even they have concerns about\nAbout the polling a you know you got all kinds of variables going on now people are people are more sophisticated they're all like to talk to you want to totally lie to you one poll you got the cell phones you got all kinds of things going on\nA date guidelines for campaigns and what you don't see is\nThere is a a section in all the polls are\nWhere they go into the weeds you don't see any of that nature folks and they usually have you know we're very subtle indicators that pollsters are good at reading and good political people will go to rating and and they usually tell you a lot more they give you a lot more direction\nAnd the numbers that you're seeing out front you see him and I don't see him so I don't I don't know what those things so\nInteresting so it's going we're going to be a plane on election night aren't we hate for night\nI I I think so I think so I think the Senate thing will be of course a determined much more quickly\nUm you know because she got you got a few situations you got three stage\nA where if they lose the three states it doesn't matter what happens in the rest of the country um they've got to run when one of those three and the woman at a street and then the rest of the reason why you know and then then you've got to see what happens on or not but I mean that one loss\nIn in one of those states and it's over a coup losses and two of the other states and it's over so you know by watching only about four or five states\nYou know whether it's all very early wow in and they um\nUh in the house\nWhole different story a smaller districts you know the districts that Jerry mad that so that's a problem so that's another problem with the polling you know what I mean I'm sure\nThat you know it's it's definitely the Democrats win the of the ... vote you know that for them that I don't think that's a problem at all\nBut they think I think when they win the popular vote in a house and lose lose the seats significantly which has a problem\nAll it's about ... ... do we need we probably need to get rid of the electrical electoral college and the kinds of gerrymandering to make this all possible don't we\nWhy don't I don't I don't know if the electoral college is a big problem but I I certainly make the gerrymandering is that's a good crop or because the gerrymandering ... ... you know keep the conversation very different than the um you know so let's say you had more Democrats mind\nThe polling you know what I mean a sure or you know that that little leading Democrats win the um the the ... vote you know ... that I don't think that's the problem at all\nBut they take a break when they won the popular vote in the house and lose lose the seat significantly which has a problem while it's very ...\n... ... do we need we probably need to get rid get rid of the electrical electoral college in the kinds of gerrymandering to make this all possible don't we\nWhy don't I don't I don't know the electoral college with a big problem but I I certainly think gerrymandering is that's a great grow up a book has been gerrymandering at it you know keep the conversation very different than the um you know so so let's say you had more Democrats mind some of these\nRight now I got ... then then then it\nChanges the whole idea that the the college they're\nCounting you gotta wait we we have to go but someone who aren't written some ideas you know you don't

idea that the property values are probably the highest in the country\nWe opportunity the opportunity to make money is probably the highest in the country\nYeah Ben you need to make more money to live in New York I'm\nFor capita income is probably higher\nAnd eat it indeed it when you think about what a real estate taxes are and what I hear your mortgage your cost of living here for you you know the\nPre tax dollars before you even take a breath okay uh\nAnd you know make you know almost forty percent more than you would make if you lived in Florida a you're not going to make it here was Florida\nAnd that's what's attracting a lot of people to Florida and South Carolina is the actual low the houses are cheaper right ah in Florida you get a mansion for eight hundred thousand dollars a year you got a nice house\nIt must have value is their key you know when you sell it to value or\nNot right now it's not well that's close to the Trump tax plan that Trump now why is the real reason that that that that really took it hit on\nPeople that are buying three million dollar homes don't give a damn about the tax plan what am I really care about right now is the problem is that\nRaw

this is not something that just happened over the last year and a half two years this has been happening for a while um and that's kind of\nA problem you have to eliminate your biggest asset most people's biggest Austin is there a home as a growing asset and considering a place to live and\nThat if you come out of it even and your cost of living is less than if you were renting you made a good deal that's a whole different in the house\nAnd it's All right it's a whole different model now I mean it's globalization and you know or that you know a attachment we had a certain grounding in our life should ground we were grounded in our neighborhood grounded in in in in ... where we live you know and family but that that's not the case anymore I mean\nIf I wasn't so committed to to

retired middle line but [laughter]\n[noise] um because you know who wants to be here in the wintertime\nRight right [noise] uh\nI don't know what you know it's it's hard to apply the certain values and standards that we have to watch\nWhat are you happy with the increase in budget on spending in New York although the last Fifteen Years are you happy with it or you have oh\nI mean well even on the federal level we have a a big a big explosion of the the debt\nYeah or you know there's no particular reason why I was in the state other than other than than runaway spending\nWhat you call it run away you know I mean\nIt is so I'm checked out\nI mean well we had branches of government in ... in the state that theoretically a are accountable for that\nYeah we don't vote him out because you know I mean of course New York or like a lot of other states Republican and Democrat\nThey end up voting party line and um\nSo\nIncrease in budget spending in New York over the last Fifteen Years are you happy with it or you have oh\nI mean well even on the federal level we have a a big a big explosion of the debt\nYeah or you know there's no particular reason why I was in the state other than

pushback but if he wants\nAbsolutely insane while left wing social policy in engineering whether it's Latham around the county level or Cuomo on the state level it it really it really is remarkable

about fifty to sixty million people lower the absolute number it was like a one million something hundred thousand\nThat is a tremendous success of this economy ... all kinds of groups\nFor what is it three point seven percent of these are things that people need to think about\nBut here on the issue is the issue if you looked at the latest polls the economy is not number one and the owners mine spent this mid term election now I Know an issue is health care and you have you on anything about health care really\nWell the Republicans tried to get something through and fail they got rid of the

I'm Sorry oh I I I think of my father a lot in the conversations that you guys had\nBut [noise] ah during my father's time there was always a an activist or left the agenda for the Democratic\nParty that used to be a group called the end the sea new democratic coalition\nNew democratic coalition that used to or harass my father because he wasn't liberal enough believe it or not [noise] um most people would say uh he was a great liberal or many people would say he was too liberal but\nThere was a left to my father who complained that he was a not left and now what are puffing lecture by he was going to stay\nRight there were professional uh liberals or professional\nPolitical people meaning that they have a valid point of view but it's a professional you're wrong or as opposed to a populist point of view [noise]\nI think that's actually exacerbated now and if I could just take another seconds on it you have a group of political people\nWho are are in gay goes on a daily basis for one reason or another they're running an organization\nOr they have political reporter or blogger and the ... in Tampa now what are you among them is much higher\nThat is ...

Teachout so [noise]\nUm whatever celebrity something mixing has meant was that that Cynthia Nixon then somehow resonate with uh the liberal wing the way that she thought she was supposed to she was supposed to be that a representative of that side of the\nThere well I think I mean if we can we can talk about that primary again but for one thing one thing he did was he shifted far to the left in response to the the sort of I don't know which are called social democratic ah attack from the left which which really was an irritant to him big time\nAnd uh because he's always projected himself as this great progressive\nAnd so he had to do a lot of things that were kind of weird you know to try to shore up his his uh his liberal left leaning a you know credentials yep a including to the point where you would even talking about freeing the ... ... a truck a\nRobbery or ... what's her name ... uh can't remember her name but you know he was doing things that really were appealing to the radical left you know even though some of it didn't succeed\nBut even to the point where he was like participating in a Diane anti gun or event with Randi Weingarten the teachers' union you know I mean that's where he was coming [laughter] you know and they hate each other you know it's actually a point in his favor that he actually is a is a um you know sort of an antagonist of the teachers union in New York state\nUm but that's well it's interesting right\nProjected himself as the great progressive and so he had to do a lot of things that were kind of weird you know to try to shore up his is a is a liberal left leaning a you know credentials yep a including to the point where you would even talking about freeing the ... ... a truck or\nA robbery or ... what's her name ... ah I Can't remember her name but you know he was doing things that really were appealing to the radical left you know even though some of it didn't succeed\nBut even to the point where he was like participating in a Diane anti gun or event with Randi Weingarten the teachers' union you know I mean that's where he was coming [laughter] you know and they hate each other you know it's actually a point in his favor that he actually is a is a um you know sort of an antagonist of the teachers union in New York state\nUm but that's well it's interesting right so he was doing all of that ... you know plus they had a he has and had a ton of money you know her campaign had only so much she was mainly in the city she never really got outside of the city sort of campaign wasn't really all that well run either you know I'm I\nKnow you're you're right and I you know I think it's it's it's really interesting and should be noted a there's a story on low ... dot com today by my colleague or what have they been about a mark ... campaign that can compare to Rob ... campaign four years ago and\nJust in talking to him as he was writing it and even reading the story and kind of as a reaction it's amazing\nFour years ago the ... the the discussion as compared to today\nThere was talk that the U.S Senate Republicans they didn't come out to back ... much because\nOf their non aggression where it all with the the governor right thinking about how that did for this year with the pressure to dissolve the I'd be seen we saw all of the of all of them six to eight\nIndependent democratic conference or a members were voted out in the Democratic party primary yet Andrew Cuomo who you know maybe didn't uh put the they grouped together right but certainly was a somebody that\nUh worked with them a benefit in in some ways politically from the a tension between\nThe ah independent Democrat conference democratic conference and the Republicans in the Senate because he was able to broker out whatever deals that he had with them so it's kind of interesting how much that now shifted in changed by the way there was talk about dissolving the ID said back then at that point and um the Republicans are\nThe Republicans had a at a definitive majority at that time as I recall or they were just about the you know they they had one I'll I'll hear him of rich [laughter] into that it was close but the point is that um you know he didn't wear that at all this is a a governor that came and certainly as somebody that was looked at the centrist\nWas looked at as somebody that\nI'm was going to be tougher on unions then er which are expecting from uh maybe some previous governors and stuff like that and certainly that pendulum has swung very much in the opposite direction\nI'm was going to be tougher on unions and know what your expecting from uh maybe some previous governors and stuff like that and certainly that pendulum has swung very much in the opposite direction\nWell you know and then the interviewer I don't know if all the time to play this next clue we asked well I'll tell you well let's take a call we got a couple of backed up we'll take one we've got a break or a few minutes you've got to make a quick thank you you're on the air Hi\nHello yes yeah just a couple of thoughts I propose what you're talking about with\nThe so called Trump effect or the Jim ... seat which was really uncontested unsafe and newer shelf here's a Republicans put up a very qualified candidate I think that Mr Freeman I Believe it was [noise]\nYeah and he was defeated by an unknown person or right as Clemens I had you know you know I'm not the expert in politics but nobody ever heard of her [noise]\nAnd ah but that's like you say you know the the militants on the left have been very good at organizing and I give them credit for using democracy if you get people to vote you win and as you said there was a higher turnout of the left wing in the last election [noise]\nAnd that's just the way it is but uh you know anybody who looks are elated the land here [noise]\nUm some of the statistics that people aren't really focusing on of course uh the lowest number of people for ... making unemployment claims since Nineteen Seventy three and ...\nOkay let's just get up to the next might be I was wondering yeah I'm not really talking about the Trump and stuff like that so what what else did you have to yeah yeah go ahead then we're gonna we're really basically I mean we're actually what you're saying is that the the but the point is that here's a guy that has the Roman in his favor he's got the money in his favor\nAnd he's he's this paranoid guy that sits in a little dark room and he has a disembodied voice that comes over that interview he looked debate the Republican who's ... at this point it's got like what thirty three percent of the of the pole vault this point\nIn his new distressing and I just I give ... past ah I you know in terms of not pressuring Mr Cuomo I understand sure I guess I don't know I Know this is true of any other say we don't do that and he got the interview I Do hope he invites risk I'm all for half an hour [laughter]\nBut well everything of course as we tried to get Mr\nAnd so now we're gonna we're really basically I mean we're actually what you're saying is that the the but the point is that here's a guy that has the Roman in his favor he's got the money in his favor\nAnd he's he's just paranoid guy that sits in a little dark room and he has a some body voice that comes over that interview he woke debate the Republican who's ... ... at this point it's got like what thirty three percent of the of the poll on this point\nIn his new distressing and I left I give Mr Bush on the past I you know in terms of not pressuring Mr Cuomo I understand sure I guess I I don't know I Know it was true of any other say we don't do that and he got the interview who will be invites were stolen for half an hour [laughter]\nBut well ever thing with questions when we tried to get Mr Mr Cuomo unfortunately are just lives up to all of my worst expectations of political public service\nFor him to compare ice has he said in a debate with Nixon\nTwice that the ice agents are and this was a quote a bunch of folks and this is our governor okay the miners understood what this except for the fact that not enough people really pay attention so it's a shame okay but that's how it is\n... recall you take care uh\nYou know uh but you remember during a debate about the corporate memory called the next in a corporation\nYeah [laughter] yeah one of our corporate ... let me as an actress come on let me jump in before we move on fell because I got these numbers for I saw our research has got the numbers for a team of mess right we have a theme homo raked in one hundred million dollars in campaign contributions okay\nI'm eighty percent of his money coming from those who have given a ten thousand dollars

I'm new to it it's not going to do both in the desert yeah no and\nBut but I I just found it a little concerning that seem like the president was was was already and immediately tried to make excuses for the for the Saudis when he talked about a rogue my team might have been a row you know\nIt ... ... ... ... it just October I used to have to worry about clown ...\nAnd he has not done what I think\nPresident Obama or President Bush would've done which was talking about how important the the prices that lawfully how they you know the that there'll be repercussions for killing an American journalists\nYou know they're just\nThey're there do seem to be um in tone\nUm what I Would expect and what are the expected from any of our prior president's ah regarding this and and recognition but the Saudis are an important ally but you still have to really protect your country's interests and what your country stands for\nWell that's it you know again he's looking at our son that's a lot of billions and billions of dollars ... the Saudis but she also a very chilling one since his comment was this guy's not a citizen\nI put those very troubling\nYeah and that is troubling whether he's a citizen or not she was a human being\nAnd he was the end and he had a green card here and and he worked for the Washington Post for us company\nJournalist right\nIt's outrageous to try to differentiate that that I think that just is it do you mind human either one of the ... on an awful thing\n... comment was this guy is not a set of yeah I thought it was very troubling yeah and that is troubling whether he's not she was a human being\nAnd he was the ... and he had a green card here and and he worked for the Washington Post for us company\nJournalists right\nIt's outrageous to try

lowest absolute number of people applying for unemployment since Nineteen Seventy three\nWhen our population was fifty to sixty million people less so the ... when you look at what's been accomplished on the international stage is well the renegotiation\nWith Mexico and Canada they're both seem to be very happy with the new deal is basically telling China will fire me going to stand up to you\nHis accomplishments and North Korea although not finished yet\nI don't know what even ... pardon me I don't I don't know what he's accomplished north ... hostages that were returned\nHeld up as I got I got the hospital but I but there's no indication that anything changed North Korea south\nKorea have agreed to re opened the lines of road lines together they've agreed to reopen factories together they negotiated with the\nHappening with our muscles\nAnd nuclear tests in many many months I mean these are just some of the proliferation accomplishments but the shows that the Trump payers will focus and Stormy Daniels and over stupid things so are you know I hear that\nBut I Do think that eventually a reasonable people begin to say\nThat drum beat against Trump as being unqualified for this\nShould be shared with him to the dustbin of history the men have a chief remarkable amount of success in a short amount of time which will come to a screeching halt if the Democrats take control of the house and we put fluids\nLike Maxine Waters shift andme Adler and those other idiots in charge of companies but that's just that's what the Democrats want let them live with it\nWell I we can beg to differ on some of the different idiots both parties because their\nColor and truly or idiots as dramatic as some of these Democrats\nBut I think that that actually last year that will people will begin to the drum beat against Trump as being unqualified for this\nShould be shut the dustbin of history\nThe man as a chief we walk one night of success in a short amount of time which will come to a screeching halt if the Democrats take control of the house for like Maxine Waters shift and Adler idiots in charge of committees\nBut that's just that's what the Democrats won't let them live with it\nWell I I we can beg to differ on some of the different idiots and both parties are because they're\nCalling for his dramatic as some of these Democrat\nOh I Hope I think I think that a number of members the Freedom Caucus all probably worse than not learn waters than any other\nCouple of the quotes that that that go to the level of Maxine Waters practically inciting violence and threats about the mood you're correct\nThe first amendment is under threat by the far left here are conservative you are not invited on campus if you're conservative you can sit and have dinner with

around who remember that I remember it well but many people to forgive and if they don't remember but remember it but\nTake it for me it was a disaster for the Republican Party they emerged four years later to move the seat Mario Cuomo but they had something going for them back then that they have nothing like today\nAnd that was um house on the monitor was a U.S senator capable of raising millions upon millions of dollars a guy with a strong sense of leadership and command and there were other important people around who helped out like Bill powers who would become the state's\nRepublican sure I'm In a year later or several months later and Rudy Giuliani was on his way to becoming mayor having watched the eighty nine election he did not lose the Ninety three election that's for sure I'm just looking at\nSome of the results from the polling from Quinnipiac this morning there was nothing really surprising in its huge divide between upstate downstate\nWhen it comes to um Cuomo's road it's all New York city or he's actually losing as probably anybody on the Republican line is losing upstate upstate according to the Quinnipiac poll forty one percent Cuomo sixty two percent mowing arrow into present someone else\nThen I Would like to see what would happen if we had the five where you can't show him there in New York City Seventy seven percent Cuomo\nAmir Thirteen percent mowing arrow he's having no impact in New York City whatsoever suburbs Cuomo fifty to bow and arrow forty five and he really fallen arrow comes from the suburbs ... county certainly narrower there\nUm non white voters they don't have African American and Hispanic it doesn't look like it may just be they didn't think the pool of a non whites was large enough non white Seventy seven percent Cuomo Fifteen Percent mowing narrow\nAnd this is interesting amongst white voters forty eight percent Cuomo forty six percent mowing arrow it's the minority vote in this state especially the African American vote that is the driving force behind democratic control\nA large percentage of a democratic politicians would come out of New York city and explains why some of like Andrew Cuomo whose father\nMario

humiliated\nBy the likes of Al Sharpton now goes down and figuratively kisses Al Sharpton\nRain over and over and over again\nBlack voters are the key to the Democratic vote in any case is nationally but certainly here in New York and um they ... many rewards as a result there's no question about it I'm just taking a look at a couple of the other findings here interesting enough I think for a lot of people the most important issue\nA lot of people would think it would be for voters\nOr would be the economy or taxes\nThe economy's doing pretty well and it does pretty well and people don't focus on that much most important issue health care\nHealth care people are worried about their health care which is why the Democrats are hammering healthcare and all these congressional races and accusing Republicans fall asleep in my view and the view of many others of seeking to do away with\nBasic healthcare coverage a pre existing conditions and things like that that frightened people and\nThat's why they're doing it because they know it's on the lines of many many people do have a favorable or unfavorable opinion of Cuomo total this says is fifty one percent favorable forty percent unfavorable\nBut um [noise]\nWhite voters favorable Andrew Cuomo forty two percent unfavorable fifty two percent or upstate favorable Cuomo's thirty five percent\nUnfavorable fifty eight percent\nImagine if you took out from what their category of upstate the upstate cities of a buffalo Rochester Syracuse Albany which have a relatively large African American populations it would be even more skewed\nBecause even to the extent that Cuomo's underwater upstate he'd be underwater that much more\nIf the African American populations of the big cities of upstate New York were removed from the calculation is no question about that\nI was going to take a break this half hour but I think I may I ask 'em well let's see you know take a break and I got a terrific letter here I wanted to

they tell me what they think and they talk about the struggles in their lives and I appreciate always getting them\nYou can write me a foot report at AOL dot com if you do your E. P. O. R. T. at AOL dot com hurt from record directs them regularly I don't know his last name is articulate in my view very thoughtful guy like tearing Larry sharp\nFrom the Libertarian Party and he said that um enjoy the show was a couple of days ago and he says I'm definitely one of those people that Larry talks about he's gotten my attention\nI Am a longtime listener of your show and I don't know if you recall my particular story I'm the son of immigrants blue collar working class pro labor Democrats\nI grew up in the Syracuse in the seventies and eighties have a political science degree from a Sunni institution and served in the military I had been with the state agency for about Twenty years now I served in the military during the Clinton Administration was disturbed at what I saw\nLater I had some experiences with both the Obama administration then when I left the military and got into the state's equivalent industry and one day suddenly hit me that the Democratic party was no longer familiar to me it's sort of happened like the frog and the boiling water story you often referred to\nI saw firsthand how morally bankrupt the Democratic party's progressive at the allergy was as you've discussed many times and many of us realize this particular governor has been an accident the and this had eight years to do absolutely nothing of substance he is the ... the party itself lacks any new ideas other than hating Trump\nI turned to the Republican Party but became disgusted in the last four years especially after party both in the state and national left broadcaster Reno hanging out to dry apart from a few key people's right to say you know who they are the party leadership is pathetic\nState Republican Party needs the same thing the nation got and Donald Trump\nBut that is cool and they're not going to happen anytime soon you've talked about it before\nThey're stuck in the pathetic slate of candidates ... lack of resources from these people I have the message to the Republican Party's leadership you had your chance and you blew it\nLike Larry ... who wants to stay in New York I admit that are probably just emotionally attached to the states who I work here\nBut after I eventually retire I Would like to spend most of my time here I Love what to say it has to offer in terms of the change of seasons history and recreation as many of us ah we hate the corruption bureaucracy stifling faxes lack of any action to effect change\nI realize that if I wanted to continue living here something has to change soon or will be a lost cause\nHanging out to dry apart from a few key people throughout the state you know who they are the party leadership is pathetic\nState Republican Party needs and same thing the nation got and Donald Trump\nBut that is cool they're not going to happen anytime soon you've talked about it before\nJust look at the pathetic slate of candidates look at the federal lack of resources from these people I have the message to the state Republican Party's leadership you had your chance and you blew it\nLike Larry I to wants to stay in New York I admit that are probably just emotionally attached to the states who I worked here\nBut after I eventually retire I Would like to spend most of my time here I Love what to say it has to offer in terms of the change of seasons history and recreation as many of us ah we hate the corruption bureaucracy stifling faxes lack of any action to effect change\nI realize that if I wanted to continue living here something has to change soon or will be a lost cause I Am willing to take a chance with Larry sharpest selection is clearly exhibited morning soon as he as a man energy that I've seen from anyone in a long time I'm Amazed at how we as singlehandedly got all over the state\nExcept for fundraising where Nancy Pelosi's raising records from for the Democratic party to take over the house and uh uh she's very popular I mean if if if they take over the house she becomes the highest ranking Democrat in the country\nThird in line from the president who still tried to impeach my guess is we'll try to impeach vice president Pence at the same time\nAnd maybe make yourself president that way but much he'll be the highest ranking Democrat the voice of their party she'll be the the the most powerful Democrat in the country again and we know what it was like the last time she was speaker of the house\nUm where she really you know she's a ... right now among Americans in our in our last a national survey in September she was a thirty percent favorable fifty five percent unfavorable\nWhen you ask voters do if if the Democrats took over the house you want to be speaker again twenty three percent said yes fifty six percent said no that's all voters I mean you have eighty six percent of Trump voters around the world to eighty five percent of Republicans are entree or\nFifty three percent of independent women are unfair to her and a quarter of the Democrats are unfair to her and she is she's about to take control of the house if they win it and the Republicans\nAre you know they you know like I always say to people as you know can you tell me a a President Trump's slogan and you probably could right\nIf you're making America great again of course\nHe had a message and he had a slogan if you ask what's the Republican message right now\nA ... you know they really don't have one as a as a party it's a theme right now it's and the president does but the the reason to reelect Senate re elect the house Republican majority they really don't have a coherent message for what they need\nFifty six percent said no that's all voters I mean you have eighty six percent of Trump voters are on the will to eighty five percent of Republicans are entree or\nFifty three percent of independent women are unfair to her and a quarter of the Democrats are unfair to her and he is he's about to take control of the house if they win it and the Republicans\nAre you know they you know like I always say to people as you know can you tell me a a President Trump's slogan and you probably could right\nIf you're making America great again of course\nHe had a message and he had a slogan if you ask what's the Republican message right now a ... you know they really don't have one as a as a party is the theme right now it's and the president does\nBut that that the reason to reelect Senate re elect the house Republican majorities they really don't have a coherent message for what they need to do is to stop policy because if she takes over the house\nYou'll have open borders I mean they you know with this character and come up that's what really what they represent they really represent open borders they represent sanctuary cities where you get criminal legal hanging out you get a you get\nReally represent anti Trump Sean rhyming their messages were not were against President Trump and if you don't like Trump vote for us and that's basically interested\nBut they have an agenda their gender is higher taxes more government control government control health care\nUh open borders a weaker United States where they put global interest for America first and it it really would be a terrible thing if they take over because uh the progress that the president has made in terms of uh things that people said he just couldn't do I mean he's reading shit adapted to a better deal\nI don't know what you're saying I mean they don't learn how to me what you describe is their platform and I'm not arguing with it is not exactly what they go out and brag about I mean they're talking about health care is you know and they're talking about being against\nDonald Trump but let me ask you this I mean you've seen is on the inside for many many years do you reach a point of diminishing returns with money or can the massive amounts of money or greasy and the race in Texas for instance overseeing locally in New York and you know about this because you're involved in polling that John fast so is facing a candidate who doesn't have any roots in his district\nAntonio Delgado who just raised more than three times as much as John fast so did in the most recent cycle can add money uh Austin by victory and things that you can spend the money on that really will make a difference or do you reach a point of diminishing returns\nHotel was outspent last time by a professor Teachout she spent a couple of million more ... you know even more\nAnd uh we were still able to win and the differences you it's the quality of the candidates and the character the candidate you have plus the candidate's message and John really has deep roots in the district where he really is is you know he does work very hard for for the constituents there that and the people in the district\nAnd uh um it's it's a it's a very tight race right now where a a just like it was two years ago but you know basically what you're right about his Delgado is been parachuted in there by dance people in our allies\nAnd their funding their funding him to the millions of dollars because he represents those things I was just talking about single payer health care where\nThey'll end employer or a paid health care they'll end Medicare as we know will end up on a government program where where the Mercator center says you're going to double your ... you know the federal income taxes to pay for\nJohn let me ask you what is the money by that's really what I was asking you about though is there are there things now technologically tactically that if you have an ... teen amounts of dollars that you can use and that can be effective I mean could you talk a little bit about the mechanics that this money can\nUm it's it's a it's a very tight race right now where a I'd just like it was two years ago but you know basically what you're right about his Delgado is been parachuted in there by Nancy Pelosi and our allies\nAnd their funding their funding him to the tune of millions of dollars because he represents those things I was just talking about single payer health care where\nThey'll end employer a paid health care they'll end Medicare as we know will end up on a government program where where the ... center says you're going to double your ... you know the federal income taxes to pay for\nJohn let me ask you what is their money by that's really what I was asking you about though is there are there things now technologically tactically that if you have an ... teen amounts of dollars that you can use and that can be effective and could you talk a little bit about the mechanics that this money can contribute to\nWell well I mean no longer derailing that come in your mail anymore it's all kinds of other things on on the engine of course social right at ...\n... absolutely still people look at TV TV's mostly watch by voters for over forty and this district being rarely unique half the vote comes out of the New York city meeting a market and uh you have pieces of you there and bring them to end as well as the Albany Albany is about a third of the district\nSo he'll spend money on that and but then he'll spend a lot of digital they'll they'll you know you'll you'll be seeing Facebook ads you'll be seeing a pop up pre role as\nA you'll be seeing batteries when you're on the Internet when you pick up your iPhone et cetera and they'll do they'll they'll mail plus the also do a lot of manpower canvassing I mean there'll be a lot of out of out of district\nDemocratic workers coming up for New York city knocking on doors of people in Colombia and green county is trying to get them to you know they'll go door to door and there'll be saying you know things like the ... there'll be spreading their propaganda against John but uh um\nYou know ... ... you think that door to door works I mean I find that annoying I don't want people to come to my door but is it considered a plus or is it just a way to engage people wanted something to do\nWhile the Democrats think is that the Obama model it's community organizing\nAnd uh so they think it works but it works if if it's somebody for your community\nAnd it with somebody for you know certainly the biggest endorsement you can get is not from\nAny political figure it's really from a your friends and neighbors and if and and and I think that's where John had had a has a big advantage I mean I mean one of his neighbors lives on the same street as with them is former Congressman Chris Gibson\nAnd uh uh you know but people know him and they know the district is and they know they know they know John So uh um so you really have it's another situation where they parachuted Delgado in from\nA from outside the district is really a creature of Washington in New York\nAnd and he represents their agenda and and there's ... they have to spend a lot of money because they're trying to fool a lot of people so uh uh so but you're right as far as uh the ways to spend this money they they ... they will ah ah they'll spend whatever it takes and at the same time we need to have enough to be able to\nGet out the truth about sounds record of of uh you know helping the economy helping jobs in the district as well as a helping the working taxpayers and the district and really gone represents the values that there's this district because he's lived there for so long\nAnd uh I don't know if you've seen it but there's a there's an age where John and ... and his wife and they talk about health care and education and John you know I mean really is the type of person who\nWould make sure that people get the health care of the coverage that they need and uh [noise] uh it's it's but it's it's very down to earth and is very real and at the same time it's something that I think the the voters of the district to relate to because there's he's one of them\n... they have to spend a lot of money 'cause they're trying to fool a lot of people so uh uh so but you're right as far as a way to spend the money they they ... they will ah ah don't spend whatever it takes and at the same time we need to have enough to be able to\nGet out the truth about towns record of of uh you know helping the economy helping jobs in the district as well as a helping the working taxpayers a district and really John represents the values that there's this district because he's lived there for so long\nAnd uh I don't know if you've seen it but there's a there's an age where John ... and his wife and they talk about health care and manage them and John you know I mean really is the type of person who\nWould make sure that people get the health care of the coverage that they need and uh [noise] uh it's it's but it's it's very down to earth and is very real and at the same time it's something that I think the the voters of the district to relate to because there's he's one of them\nWere trying to John o'clock then of course the McLaughlin associates you see 'em on national TV a lot you here on national radio shows and\nHe's good enough to join us oh every week or every couple of weeks and it's always a privilege to have more this because this is a guy who was opposed to run for President Trump before he was President Trump became was polling in the presidential campaign he's involved in several races in New York and has been for decades and is involved in\nHow many races across the country John approximately does your from have business in our business with\n'em I it's it's not as ... because the only you you try to concentrate on those races but a ... there's a sense about uh between my brother Gemini there's probably about twenty congressional races that will polling for and\nI'm a governor's race in Connecticut where we're running in Connecticut were running dead even with the Democrat Ned Lamont because uh the\nThe amount of taxes I mean you've had\nThem all in any of it I'm having a country yeah he's he's a he's raised taxes so much he could run for reelection so that when you see a tax revolt in Connecticut fight ... opportunity going on\nJohn just quickly what did you make of today's Quinnipiac poll in New York has um a combo I have a fifty eight to thirty five against small an arrow I was full thing it aggressively before you joined us for failing to include three\nA minority party candidates who are out there or something like you know arguably are real and we'll have an impact on their vote I also pointed out in my view that the ... thirty five percent\nBeing received by um mowing narrow Interpol is a generic Republican voted search really then Ikle to what they have Shelley Farley at nobody knows Shelley far far fewer than who know mark mowing narrow so it's just a baseline Republican vote in my view but how did you uh view this new Quinnipiac poll\nBy the way they didn't ask your question about Governor Cuomo at the uh uh and you know if you if you really think America wasn't that great\nSurprise surprise I I haven't seen a pollster asks that\nCuomo is corrupt they're not given all the corruption arrest in New York and convictions\nBy but I I agree with you about first of all

narrow Marc Mauer narrow the Republican candidate for governor will he ever get to debate governor Andrew Cuomo\nThe decision still has made that if I was a betting man I Would I Would say no yeah I just don't see it happening I'm you know the governor is way up and the poll is way\nUp on funding and he doesn't see that there's any benefit beyond of course it would make the argument of democracy but to me well do it and you know what he won't be the first\nGeorge Pataki refused to uh in ... when he was seeking ... to\n... or ... or the Democratic above his Democratic opponent Mario Cuomo in Nineteen Ninety four refused to debate George ... tacky when there have been debates fat all the minor candidates so really the majority of the major party candidate\nDidn't get real much of a chance to get any uh airtime or anything and so uh I just don't see it happening\nAnd and you know Ken politics is politics\nAnd Andrew Cuomo has has been a politician since she was a teenager I mean you you might say that he and his father grew up together you know Andrew being a young boy in in in Mariel\nAlready being a man who didn't start out early in politics than Andrew was with his dad to all of it you know the mayoral campaign against the Ed Koch yeah he he was with his dad in Albany when he was secretary of state Senate governor\nA hope three governorship\nA quite frankly you know I'm not\nEnamored of Andrew Cuomo at this moment but I have to say that you know based on his wife he's highly highly qualified person who knows what it is to be governor of New York\nAnd also is a highly highly skilled politician so I Can't see him\nOr did meet debating missed among the narrow at this point under any circumstances but recently wrote an article titled I'm not done I Swear mall narrow she'll piece governor hopeful hitch president and large Obama tell us a little bit about that one\nYeah what happened was he called ... and he was talking about really the tenor of the debate right

about really the tenor of the debate right now in politics and how divisive and how a divided and he did the rhetoric has become\nAnd he was saying that he would have liked to see that ten or change from the anger and this is his words of Donald Trump's America\nBack to the time to find commonality of Iraq Obama's America and it was kind of surprising statement or a given that you know obviously he's a Republican is base polls show there still are still but it's still going to nominate\nWith the President Trump the hometown president and uh [noise] um but he feels that there needs to be more civility\nYou know can I had the opportunity to meet ... narrow and speak to him I was very impressed\nBy a by his appearance by his knowledge of all the issues about his background and he seems like a formidable candidate but I think he has any kind of chance in this election\nI think it's going to be extremely ... you know he walks around now he wears a a painting of underdog get on the cartoon character\nAnd uh you know he's obviously chose that on purpose\nIs a tremendous underdog look you know I think it was last week of the week before when he put in a financial filing he only had two hundred and fifty thousand dollars left and Andrew Cuomo has nine point two million and that's after spending twenty five twenty six million in the Democratic\nPrimary people know who he is they still don't know who ... mile an arrow is the polls show there was a new poll today that Columbus up by twenty two points with three weeks to go it's going to be extremely ... a hard look New York is a blue state that has gotten boy we're used to be five to three\nDemocrat enrollment advantage over Republicans\nNow it's two to one and and um it's you know with Donald Trump and being very unpopular particularly among Democrats but the overall you know two thirds spy a view him unfavorably in New York\nIt's going to be difficult from all over the arrow to break out from his Republican base\nWhich is what we saw in large part with Carl Paladino in twenty tend uh and and I'm ... twenty fourteen\nBut look you know New York has not elected elected a Republican state wide since two thousand two when George Pataki won a third term so it is an extreme uphill battle and the and the state is getting even more democratic\nHe'd get the free from party a endorsement of my own their own means anything or ... or the less the less people know what the reform party is then who mark mall in aerospace\n[laughter] yeah I I don't uh you know and the only thing where it would help Arlen arrow is if someone really isn't paying attention and they see the word reform and I'm a supporter of Columbus so they probably well you know pull the lever anymore but they fell in love with a box for ah for modern era\nIn ... which is what we saw in large part with Carl Paladino in twenty tend uh and and um ... you know in twenty four\nBut look you know New York has not elected elected a Republican state wide since two thousand two when George Pataki won a third term so it is an extreme uphill battle and the and the state is getting even more democratic\nDo you think that the free forum party endorsement of my own their own means anything or ... or less and less people know what the reform party is then who mark mall in aerospace\nYeah I I don't uh you know the only thing where it would help Marlon arrow is if someone really isn't paying attention and they see the word reform and I'm a supporter or I'm not so they probably well you know pull the lever anymore but they fell in love with a box or a\nPromote arrow but no I don't you know he'll get some votes they're hoping he gets at least fifty thousand because\nIf he does that means the reform party will have a guaranteed spot on the ballot for the next four years if he gets under fifty thousand on the Republican Party line then mowing arrow and then the reform party has to petition to get on the ballot every year\nWhich might really mean the end of the new reform party which is you know the the invention of the of the uh my friend Frank Marino and courage ... uh I'm involved in that and and I have to say that it was kind of\n... you know it it seems to be amazing uh any ordinary person might assume that anyone could donate anything they want any political party and yet we're living in a world where where are so many forces are up in arms against\nUh uh that principal and the principle that the\nPolitical candidates have to be a limited in reference to the mountain dew nations they receive from one person one corporation one entity\nAnd you don't seem to me that the alternative I Know New York city if they're trained to do something with each city charter to to make the payers\nPay more of it where it's not\nThat they have that in New York City there's been a push to have a statewide a public financing of campaigns you all kinds of ... citizen or United\nUm you know yes there's a lot of money being thrown around to Canada and ex but the reality is what the superPACs that come in whether it's the unions on the Democratic side to create their own script or a pact\nOr or the real estate interests are Carter school interest on the Republican side\nWhat these super PACs can do as long as there was no coordination with the campaigns they can raise as much and spend as much on behalf of candidates\nThey are and you know it seems to me that the alternative I Know New York city if they're trained to do something with the city charter to to make the taxpayers pay for more of it where it's all have\nThat they have that in New York City there's been a push to have a statewide a public financing of campaigns yeah all kinds of changes since citizens are United\nUm you know yes there's a lot of money for 'em to candidates but the reality is what the superPACs that come in whether it's the unions on the Democratic side to create their own script or a pact\nOr or the real estate interests are Carter school interest on the Republican side\nWhat these super PACs can do as long as there was no coordination with the campaigns\nThey can raise as much and spend as much on behalf of candidates and and uh parties as much as they walk so really even if you have public financing that's all of us who have these super PACs is going to be more lands and millions and millions of dollars in a while after the show is\nUm another article that you wrote this week is something that you've been concerned with for for pretty long time and the the headline of it was here arm pain sexual abuse victims urge Albany to take action\nAnd then you know it was a big photo of a a former Democrat king pin Mr Lopez in there and you know there's a lot of sexual harassment stuff\nThat is really you know going back a quite a while what's going on with that\nWell well the the the legislature and governor path from anti sexual harassment measures this year the government has way says it's the ... or some of the nation but these are\nThese victims of sexual harassment in the legislature say it doesn't go far enough that they didn't involve any of the victims they didn't hold any public hearings and\nThey're asking for more legislation and they're asking for public hearings in the matter and have people who are involved helped shape the legislation and sad sadly and ironically\nThe day they held a press conference we learned that a a chief of staff to send them to some ... from Brooklyn\nHad to grow up to a woman up state Senate fundraiser so yeah you could pass all the love your but are people still people and they do bad things sometimes\nYou know I think alcohol has a lot to do with that and you know there are a lot of political parties and stuff like that with people go out and the drinking and they've been working all day and they've been working all we can get together and they go to these parties have a few drinks\nAnd they they kinda let the head down but let their morals down too so I guess hopefully a lot of this in the future\nShould be corrected by the way to do it is not so much to go back into the past but to create new standards for the future huh one last question for you Ken\nThis is a very crucial election in New York state relating to the Senate and the Senate goes Democrat then we're going to have a democratic governor presumably a assembly and Senate how would that look into you up in Albany [noise]\nIn terms of whether that will\nHappen and I said\nI think that's a good chance I mean I I don't write off the Republicans but the Democrats made a single seat they need to pick up a single seat\nA typically and then off presidential year it favors the Republicans however given the whole situation where Trump and the fight for Congress and the fight for the house\nGo back into the past but to create new standards for the future uh one last question for you in\nA very crucial ... election in New York state relating to the Senate and the Senate goes Democrat then we're going to have a democratic governor presumably\nA assembly and sent it to look into you up in Albany [noise]\nIn terms of whether that will\nHappen and I said\nYeah I think that's a good chance I mean I I don't write off the Republicans but the Democrats need a single seat they need to pick up the single seats\nAre typically and an off presidential year it favors the Republicans however given the whole situation what Trump and the fight for Congress and the fight for the house\nUm I think Democrats are charged up and you know we saw a very high turnout on the gubernatorial campaign a primary or for the Democrats that only wants to be very high turnout but higher than we've seen in recent years\nAnd I would expect we're going to see something similar coming out and that would favor the Democrats but\nYou know you can never underestimate the Republicans have been written off before and they ended up keeping the majority somehow\nAnd what do you think about my state senator or money golden who at one point in time was almost you know on a post and now he's got a really tough for a lot of people asking and you think he's going to survive\nYou know I'm I'm really turn on that one um earlier a few months ago I would've said certainly know that that I thought he would provide a I think there is a good chance it could be defeated it you know a lot depending how will this blue wave is\nIf if if you have a lot of new people and young people are really not voted a lot in the past that they do come out and they come out in that district then I think\nGolden's in trouble if it's overstated and and you still get the traditional kind of voters um then I think he he'll take it\nBanks can love is being our guest today is always

something really new coming up that I Want to bring up let's say that for later on by\nYou know me as a diver I'm interested in you know not just the diving and I'm saying right now I feel like I'm with you know Bill Nye the science guy [laughter] we're getting a lot deeper than just the fish and you just do that something pretty so your history is really goes back and the things that you've done or totally incredible and we\nWe talk a little bit about mixed gases and what that is they'll do that missed it I archive everything check on my website and survive even see that but\nWe did with you talking about dining out of the feed on her so obviously you have a very protected and careful and trained to do that in their specific way that I had blown up kind of thing right\nIt's a little bit more about that how does that work\nWell people have been to several thousand feet and the limiting factors affecting gas than for the\nBecomes impossible to breathe for gas becomes thicker more dense and it becomes almost for fluid and it's difficult to inhale and exhale it get rid of the carbon dioxide we we worked um at a thousand feet\nAnd the idea was made people today are right now are working at the bottom of the ocean and a thousand feet they go very slowly and then they live with that pressure in ... in inside hyper Burke chambers\nAnd take an elevator back and forth from the from the drilling rig let's say with the chamber's are down pressurized elevator down to the water level where they're working to get out and do the work and then go back and forth but it's being done every day\nUh getting their they normally take two or three days to get there with the military wanted to do when we're commercial diving one to do back in in the in the early seventies was how fast can you get there there were things being dropped\nBut they were very concerned about being the ones that victim backup or picking back up the stuff that the Russians dropped\nAnd um that they had a decompression chambers capable of getting some place pretty quickly on board a navy ship but since it logically what was possible to do show will we we looked we said let's pick some round numbers let's say a thousand feet and let's try ten minutes a hundred feet admitted his pretty quick\nAnd the problem with that is the physiological changes take place could we taught tolerate those physiological changes\nAnd could we could we do searches adding nitrogen to the helium oxygen mixture to access at actresses sedative\nTo help offset the effects of rapid compression so we did that and it was intended to be used of it of course I'd commercial applications but his primary initial application of was to be able to pick things up a from a security standpoint [noise]\nSo I imagine you're saying that they get down to get out\nOf it you can get down to a few middle it takes to get back from a thousand feet it took me nine days so\nNow it's in a very very small little device you're going out there and and we're not alone\nNo but in a in the uh the chambers that were utilize a fellow named Tom ... and I were in two five foot diameter steel balls and a connection to a cylinder ... chamber like a ...\nAnd to the helium oxygen mixture to access at actresses sedative to help offset the effects of rapid compression\nShow we did that and it was intended to be used of it of course had commercial applications but its primary initial application uh was to be able to pick things up above from a security standpoint [noise]\nTell I imagine you're saying if they get down or\n... it it you can get down to a few middle it takes to get back from a thousand feet it took me nine days so\nNow they're very very small little device you're going out there and and we're not alone\n[noise] no but in a in the uh the chambers that were utilize a fellow named Tom ... and I were in two five foot diameter steel balls\nAnd a connected to a cylinder ... chamber like a living chamber\nAnd the end those two five foot diameter balls we compressed at a hundred feet emit it down to one thousand feet and then did a series of experiments to and we're wired for for brain waves and for cardiac\nAnd do a whole series of performance tests in order to determine whether or not we could actually work and what was our debt commend how much that the effect of the pressure have on our cognitive and and small find dexterity and so forth [noise]\nAh we also had an exercise machine like you'd have a ... it's been cycle you know machine a splinter or that we could pretend we were swimming in water and exercise because that would produce carbon dioxide and we had to be a ventilator very carefully\nIn order to avoid will recall getting behind you get to a situation where you can't get rid of this show to produce and it's a it's a terrible feeling that's\nSomewhere in the air coming from well the gas tax to the actual bell\nThe gases inside the gases inside the chamber where we are and ah and there's gas cylinders outside that are the gas is being pumped into whether you're underwater or you're in a laboratory it's basically the same technology and uh the gas is pre mixed\nAnd analyze the term in the right mixture and then it's injected into the chamber to a at a sweet typical rate\nAnd they are there a way to monitor the mountain using on sale el ... things like that all kinds of different systems in order to determine one what is happening to us too and then several ways of doing anything case of a problem\nSo now I'm married but I'm sure people have asked for it and you know and that's why I feel like it's OK to ask\nThem coming up that logically has to happen for a couple of days you know you you're going to have to eat and it's\nKind of have to go somewhere you got to have to get it got to have to go somewhere how this all set up where you are in dire men that you also on the feelings don't want to contaminate and get sick on the way up either\nSure well you're the one issue is the gas density is is when you when you go underwater in it a pool and you move your arms back and forth\nBe sure well you're the one issue is the just the city is is when you when you go underwater it it'll it'll pool and you move your arms back and forth\nMust see things like that that have nothing to do with the you know a charity of your choice they need those things still right they they still have people that you know in a part of that of whatever your expertise is\nWhatever your passion when you share with other people it makes it better and other people can enjoy that so right now I have one butler with me and he is very very big in the ... world and he also is going to talk to us later about\nI have a ... chamber and what are you doing now but I have to say as a diver\nI'm very interested in all the background of it and and the cool things that go into it because I Want to push today as scuba beyond the pretty fish beyond the the nice warm water because there's so much technology that goes into it that people like you have put in to let people like may not have to worry about those things and I take for granted\nSo a little bit about your Glenn I Know you have well over thirty five plus years of dining experience\nFor you is forty five five now I Know people were my first thought it was one of those seven years old in Florida so\nWow what are the so clearly this is going against Patty regulations cared about their certification ... it didn't do that\nBut you know you get the bug and you know as we were talking about that I talk about the bug meaning like the ... but it goes really for anything you know I had musicians on last week that were little kids and they play the Carnegie Hall already you know eight years old\nAnd a Radio City and things like that because they had this bug and they caught on early and you know it's really great when you find that\nI Want to know a little bit about what you've done for the military just to recap people that are just tuning in and the commercials I mean I'm\nSure we'll go worship ... for dogs and diving that we did that was the head military applications and some civilian\nThat the idea was to be able to go out for us in the ... we go and we saw it to the number one thousand feet which [noise] four hundred and forty five pounds or Florida one time and global atmospheric pressure\nAnd a and to be able to do that in ten minutes\nA physiological structure but the idea of being sort of take a long time to go there\nThey used to show up pick somebody up off the bottom of be gone before anybody else realized you were there\nAnd ah there's some real serious military applications as well as in slowing it down some commercial applications as well as the timeline or she was being developed as an excuse for shell was torn about four hundred and fifty\nSure well there was a series of dives and and diving that we did was had had military applications and some civilian\nThat the idea was to be able to go how fast and deep could we go and we selected a number of one thousand feet which four hundred and forty five pounds or thirty one times normal atmospheric pressure\nAnd a and to be able to do that in ten minutes\nThat's physiological structure but the idea being instead of taking a long time to go there\nThe idea was to show up pick somebody up off the bottom and be gone before anybody else realized you were there\nAnd uh they said some real serious military applications\nAs well as in slowing it down some commercial applications as well at the time that or she was being developed\nAnd then or she is very shallow it's only about four hundred and fifty feet deep that may sound the two guys but it's not really very deep but a lonely trench in Norway the trash the thousand foot deep\nAnd to try to bridge a\nPipeline across that trench or in order to bring Norwegian alter Norway was a big challenge show instead of goes to ... all the ... goes to other countries and they run a more of a meter because it's too difficult to get across the or are under\nTell you know don't do any as we're talking about going on out in ... and living the way in Spain a tiny little bell and you can you imagine a town that a couple of days to get back though you know like they were saying thank God for losing years now and\nI guess you know you're right though I Would assume you can't on the banks [laughter]\nYou know the civil Larry's to a rural frustrated astronaut says is back when the moon landings are going on and so forth and a lot but we were doing was extremely similar to the to the to NASA\nAnd or a doctor Hamilton was was or was it a try it out to be an ... a NASA astronaut and we're all very much involved in that whole interest in that side of life\nAnd ah but the similarities are just amazing and uh you know you can be looking through a window looking through your window but um it five hundred you know I'm of house and feed your sea level\nIt'll take me nine days to come back to his father was in a few are circling around the moon anyway back to earth\nNow just a little bit for people that don't understand the connection between now\nAnd I mean I was about I don't want to give it up training at the national that involve water\nSure one of the what are the best ways to simulate zero gravity or micro gravity is to do it under water if you properly balanced someone in the space suit and you do certain simulations put some weights on their on their boots and other other customers Asians\nYou can make it very similar to actual space walks or where we call\n... or extra ... vehicle of um uh walks\nAnd show the the uh uh that allowed this to chew a loser essential part of of of\nOf the work in the space station or a other activity and so a betraying astronauts do that when the Hubble Space telescope was was needed to be repaired at a defect in the mirror had to be repaired as a disaster for for NASA they needed to fix this\nAnd they had to go back up now on and do a repair the space walk the time they'd only been two hours now they're going to have to be several people eight hours a day times three days to do the actual warfare\nThat required they simulate that underwater for eight hours at a time so we doing that we had to change the gas mixture that there were breathing\n... to ... the goal of of a wall and show the the uh uh that allowed us to to a loser essential part of of a\nOf the work in the space station or a other activity and so uh betray you asked for us to do that when the Hubble Space telescope was was needed to be repaired has added a defect in the mirror had to be repaired was a disaster for for NASA they needed to fix this\nAnd they had to go back up now on and do a repair the lowest based walk the time that only been two hours now they're gonna have to be several people eight hours a day times three days to do the actual warfare\nThat required they simulate that underwater for eight hours of time so we're doing that we had to change the gas mixture that they were breathing and that's where I got involved\nYou know as I said oh no I don't know it's still there but was in um in fact that the city and they'll get that yes it is the\nSo one of the things he go there are there are people they're planning when it happened and every now and then they have some of the astronaut tell me about it I Would definitely check out their website and see what the next time one of the ... very very interesting we'll be right back after ...\nNot [noise]\n\nWorld MS

I\nWas using I was saying a cap and you know my little offer which is with staff and lawyers Fifteen people maybe twenty\nUm you know it's a tight knit little family and\nI like to think frankly we would probably be open to giving someone a chance\nI've got to worry about everybody in my office and my firm so\nI'm like I said I Want to know what that background debt and then I'll make a reason right right right which is older sister um I mean if if if it was like this and that may be an out when you know you wouldn't have someone running your cash register if someone's crime was yelling money again\nAll that said and I am supportive of all of that and I think most reasonable people would be in part out of self interest could we don't want to do with a crime against\n'em but at the same time an affair I ... I was using I Would say to caffeine you know my little law firm which is with staff and lawyers Fifteen people may be twenty um you know it's a tiny little family and\nI like to think frankly we would probably be open to giving someone a chance\nI've got to worry about everybody in my office and my firm so\nLike I said I Want to know what that background it and then I'll make a reason right right right which is the oldest is in um I mean if it was a you know and and that may be an out and you wouldn't you wouldn't have someone running your cash register if someone's crime was the only money again\nWe talked about it on the Bronx will two weeks ago the Catholic parish saint Joseph and Bronx bill here we go we had a priest who stole we it was convicted of a felony for stealing from a parish up in Rockland County they send them away to a funny farm for a year they bring it back now he's the St Joe's and he got into trouble there within a\nMatter of months yeah yeah well I'm Kenny hand we do I weigh three or four hours to fill in that case the pastor new parents will didn't they never told the ... right and that's a common thing called pet the trash but um [noise]\nThe um one thing I Do want to mention which is already in New York state code which is that if someone believes that they did not get a job because of their criminal background they are all ready entitled to ask for an analysis of how that conviction\nI'm influenced their application a lot of people don't know that but that is already in New York state um New York state I think it's in the\n... I Can't say that but um it's in a ... you you are already so so employers who are rejecting people on the basis of the criminal background are already obligated to do that if asked by the application\nTrusting ... I mean I I Would have been married for an excuse me I Would imagine that's\nNot that common phenomenon in other words you know people don't really know that they have the right to get that information well that's probably true too but what I'm thinking of I'm not even thinking of employment and I'm thinking like for example uh the the whole you know call up apartment application process so\nUh I was on a co-op board for years I Do some to real estate work\nThe co-op board does not have to tell you why you were turned down not right now they don't do that and and where do we keep it that way [laughter] about that but if but if you believe you were turned down because you were a woman because you were an African American because you're Spanish because you were gay because you're a Democrat\nAny of those um you can actually be turned away because you're a Democrat [laughter] and you can establish the pattern mhm venue can go after the fellow certainly private right of accent right but but what I'm saying is so so in a way that law you're describing almost sounds like\nAs you said most people probably don't even know it but that criminal classification in a way is sort of a protected class in the sense that if you can establish a pattern and said the employer just uniformly\nNo it's not exactly that it's not for damages it's just that you have a right to know what the what the weight of your ... your criminal conviction\nA plate and whether or not you were able to to get the job so so if for example you can be turned down for jobs for many many many reasons of somebody who's more qualified to somebody he'll do it for less money you know there's lots of reasons why the employer you can be turned down because they interview you and just don't particularly care for exactly exactly and all that's all that's legal\n... right but but what I'm saying is so so in a way that law you're describing almost sounds like as you said most people probably don't even know it but that criminal classification in a way sort of a protected class in the sense that if you can establish a pattern and say the employer just uniformly\nNo no not exactly that it's not for

because they interview you and just don't particularly care for exactly exactly and all that's all that's legal\nThere's very compelling evidence that misuse of these of a small fireworks not just sparkling sort of a whole class of of the fireworks like um [noise] that have caused serious injury and harm and property damage as in other places they gave us a lot of ... to ...\nUh and they asked us to pass it before\nI'm a January first quit because like New Year's eve is also a very popular time for on\nRegulated fireworks although I didn't know what I write so we did ... mind either quite frankly we did ... we did take it up because there was a lot of lobbying done by the fire safety world down here and there were a well I mean typically Republicans loved firefighters\n[laughter] this one will love this Republican but that's [laughter]\nI go into I go into the well it's different for me too 'cause I've been around so long but um at least at the beginning that the fire houses that we would go into wouldn't wouldn't exactly be welcoming now it's a little bit different but\nUm [noise] so it you know they they made it very compelling case first they lobbied for the whole year basically and um and convince convince us\nWell you've explained why the Republicans are behind it because the unions leaned on the firefighters leaned on them which is to you know no phones here firefighters to but but\nStill in all there are fundamentally he said\nA little while ago I was for criminalizing marijuana and I don't know why anybody would ever smoke marijuana I never have and I never will and I never ...\nAh I could get down the list tobacco blah blah blah blah blah\n... billion things out there\nThat are dangerous but what these new uses of the west and I mean what's the

people used to ... in the house or whatever why there's many mentality I don't under so as I said that you know this wasn't really my issue it wasn't my I was the highest priority it anyone now however I Will say if you want another reason why it because that\nGovernments are charged with healthy did welfare and they when things happen like fires like people getting injured the\nThe government does pick up costs associated with that we pay for half of Medicare and Medicaid in Westchester County through county probably that becomes that\nThat's a little like the commerce clause in

[laughter]\nAnd and they ... and and but you know yeah so you know the argument look I think anyone who just behind the wheel of a car and doesn't put a seat belt on this damn fool I don't think that Mario Cuomo had the right to tell me I had to put a seat belt on\nAnd the argument is old but if you get into a car accident or it's going to cost taxpayers money because you're going to be an
