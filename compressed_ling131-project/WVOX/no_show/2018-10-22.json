credit's due [noise]\nYou know I got to look something up and maybe you can look it up for me um there's a word that people use today I'm going to say it sounds like ... and I want to find out if I can say it on the air because I Want to give Alan Dershowitz a new name as my new thing now I'm telling Trump these days\nAnd you know a ... for example the Jared Widner I Want to give I Want to give

office around here is the one in ... by the way they said wait what was really nice woman with blue eyes there's always their God Bless you I haven't noticed her wise but that they're very nice forget her name as thank God they're they're the rest of the place forget ... that's\nHaving said that what else is on your mind go to the post office the only good post office around here is the one in ...

the rest of the place forget ... that's\nThe administration I may be wrong but there's nothing that that holds them back from notifying I saw the detained or maybe lodged at the jail same thing with probation they go to the department of probation they have to show certain documents and they can't show um ice again maybe notify so\nLet me let me put my another out on the table because I I you know conservatives get painted with an unfair brush with these issues because\nWe'll see in cities uh they really do their housing inspections because they know they're going to come up with a lot of undocumented immigrants are illegal aliens southern boy the problem they that these kinds of tickets we've got people driving around all over the place without life without insurance\nAnd they don't want to pursue that either because they don't want to do with the political issue\nI don't think the cop on the beat ... now I got before sometimes they don't they don't if you ... they pull a car when that person licensed they're going to write that for my point\nIs that the you know my point is not the as you pointed out earlier the government or most of the government's here in town don't want to deal with that issue when the cops are instructed that just write your ticket\nRight now well that's exactly right\nYeah similar we saw in Yonkers where they just started giving everyone free lunch because they couldn't get people ah and generally was Latinos they couldn't get Latinos to fill out the form and give addresses and whatever because they you know they were afraid now I understand from a human perspective these people were afraid\nBut where it's fake\nOnto this way Bob also if you're driving your brand new Mercedes down the road and uh some body who is ill illegal so they can go back to their country or may be deported back to their country they are unlicensed there is no insurance and the hit your car\nThat's how you on how how are you made whole because somebody blasted into your car or you're never going to get paid for that and you're out of luck to you know ... ... ... who is going to cover that\nAnd and that is the point that we continue to kick the can down the road in perpetuity rather than let me not an anti immigration message this is the question of oil and how do we created but yet a conservative and I got to defend them here they will bring up what I just brought up and they'll be called racist or no no well\nWhat kind of dancing around the uh the caravan issue right if you left in the first five thousand seven thousand then you have to let in the next seven thousand\nSo this way Bob also if you're driving your brand new Mercedes down the road and uh some body who is ill illegal so they can go back to their country or may be deported back to their country they are unlicensed there is no insurance and they hit your car\nThat's how you on how how are you made whole because somebody blasted into your car or you're never going to get paid for that out of luck but you know ... ... ... who is going to cover that\nAnd and that is the point that we continue to kick the can down the road in perpetuity rather than let me this is not an

no no well\nWhat kind of dancing around the or the caravan issue right if you left in the first five thousand seven thousand then you have to let in the next seven thousand in the next seven thousand I mean that's a potentially explosive situation there\nAnd I don't know how it's how it's going to stop I Would hope Mexico would lend a hand in in in forcing the law down in their country\nAnd again there's nobody wants to exclude people who come into the country legally nobody wants to do that okay but you can't just invade another country either\nWell I Know this is something that just isn't right here and I'm not doing what the President Johnson framing the Democrats or I jokingly blame the Republicans before because that's involved to make stuff up you know\nUh you know I could do I could go Alex Jones and say\nThis was a Republican plot headed towards the election to make people afraid of making sure that I Would do it because one of the things that the president has to be fairly cheated on here it's I mean we got that to twenty thousand people headed to our border what do we do about it we let them in the process that we created another uh\nEllis Island I I don't know why they coming on one day what's that why they're all coming on one day\nWell that raises suspicions right out there and they're not only one day but also near the elections so is there is some type of funding for these people I Do know that that's to me that's a little bit of a stretch but it could be I don't I don't know\nThe answer to that will jumping rivers I mean there are people that desperately want to get here and they're clearly All right how do we sat on yeah separate the refugees from the phone and he's ... jeez you know it's humane to help refugees\nWell there was one I think ... mayor and I don't know if this is accurate or not but I did hear it a report on the news that one Guatemalan they're sort of the of that crowd of people there were at least one hundred documented ISIS people\nNow I don't know how this guy knows this I don't know if he was just saying this but there is a potential terrorist sneaking it on your job when you have a large number of people go it because that's their perfect avenue to get in right let me get in this crowd and blend and so\nIt it's really a sticky WeChat and and and and unfortunately trying to be fair to both sides I we entertaining beach knocking it's very hard to do this sticky wicket and it's a tough tough tough thing for the president at least be decisive about it\nIt's tough it is it's very interesting from a human standpoint a legal standpoint how this is going to resolve itself when these people eventually do get to the border\nBut ... and then all the Hillary problems that creates locally as I said everybody gets re launch because people don't want to put down where they come from we don't investigate illegal apartments because we don't want to know who's here legally our insurance rates going up because we don't want to know who's here illegally\nSo you can be it seems to me a a sanctuary city all you like but the people to be able to pay for it\nBut on a legal aspect Bob once people get in the country they have to be interviewed\nTrying to be fair to both sides I we entertaining be snarky it's very hard to do this sticky wicket and that's a tough it's a tough it's a tough thing for the president at least be decisive about it\nBut it is it's very interesting from a human standpoint a legal standpoint how this is going to resolve itself when these people actually do get to the border\nBut at and then all the problems that creates locally as I said everybody gets free lunch because people don't want to put down where they come from we don't investigate a legal apartments because we don't want to know who's here legally our insurance rates going up because we don't want to know who's here illegally\nSo you can be it seems to me a a\nSanctuary city all you like\nBut the people but to be able to pay for it\nBut a a legal aspect Bob once people get in the country they have to be interviewed and see if um they're eligible for asylum et cetera et cetera do we let them in

so are we going to just continue to allow all this development because I'm I'm fascinated to hear what's going on here\nUm I you know I feel like you're a lot of people complaining but yet I don't see anything happening or better yet I I don't see our city council responding um they they kind of you know nod their heads but yet everything proceeds\nUm so I don't know I don't know if there's going to be any potential response um\nThey keep saying yeah it's getting better getting better gonna it just takes a little bit of time\n[noise] [noise] okay All right we'll have to proceed [noise]\nOkay so the interesting point is what we're going to just we'll just go wait it out we're gonna wait it out and see what's going to happen with the um with development and see if anybody shows up\nWe're going to we're going to and that seems to be the plan with all of the stuff we don't wait it out and see if anybody shows up and lives in these apartments are going to wait it out and see if anybody if if the number of units a number of students that they project to be in those farmers is actually equal to the numbers and if it's too many\nThen we'll have to recalculate oh yeah and if it's too many ... what are we going to put them because the schools are already too overcrowded\n[noise] okay\nOne of the callers and went to the prior show raise the question right at the end of the show that I thought was an interesting question\nUm and and I I actually I Know the answer to this question but I I Want us to talk about it a little bit and the question that he raised was um what if someone registered their their their student the child but they live in a cell live in an illegal apartment\nI'm at is that permitted and answer the question is yes\nUm and why is that permit it well the answer that question because in order to be able to um Bush or child they have to have a legal address not necessarily legal laced with the the main building to pour the the [noise]\nSchool district has not verify the effect to forgive occupancy for the residence or do they make that information available to the building department it's protected under federal law before the the residents

yes the the municipality should be more aggressively enforcing\nThe code with regard to illegal units but of course that's going to have a big negative effect a lot of people\nLaced with the the main building to pour the the [noise]\nSchool district is not verify the effect to forgive occupancy for the residence or do they make that information available to the building department it's protected

should be done and what should be done is in fact yes the the municipality should be more aggressively enforcing\nThe code with regard to\nIllegal units but of course that's going to have a big negative effect\nA lot of people there are a lot of people that rely heavily on those on those illegal apartments and then of course the line then there's a big problem with that because there's there's the illegal apartment that's the mother a Mormon and then there's the illegal apartment that's\nReally not even be on and on and mother in law apartment and see the house that's been subdivided and there's six families living in it and that was the problem that was I I actually dealt with quite significantly when I was um what my office is still is in Port Chester\nA well as um porch or put those approaches to ride horses the Asian\nOr of all that I'm actually surrendering at the end of this year I'm I've been president approaches to rub or association for about eight years now [noise]\nUm and I'm turning it over thank you very much and I'm One of the other projects we worked on with the village was a an amnesty program in Port Chester with regard to detect it gets to the documents say a because there were so many unit so many homes that had\nA illegal occupation and you know sometimes it's easy to spot you know depends on the ... but on the area of town you can start it by\nUm satellite dishes number satellite dishes on the roof and it's brought it by um you know getting a number of cable feeds into the house I'm ... spotted by you know mailboxes outside\nUm you know if it's brought it by names on the mailboxes outside you know things like that but you have to take some work it definitely takes from work and of course the municipality has to have the\nUm I just have to have the stomach to do it\nBecause it is politically\nI'm challenging it's not going to be a popular thing to do a particularly in in situations where uh it's a senior who's um who's doing it who are doing it to keep themselves in their home where they were they're renting out that\nYou know that downstairs base that they maybe had created for their child and now the kid has gone and now they could use that money to keep themselves in that house um and and the and they and now they may be the rent you got some extra rooms upstairs to to keep themselves in their house\nUh and it gets complicated\nI get very complicated it really does um\nThere's there's some serious issues with regard to this um because there's it's hard to draw the line and friends are hard to draw the line but it can be hard to draw the line\nBecause there's questions of of good faith and whether or not the person is operating in good faith and whether or not the um landlord and I put that if I didn't hear quotes the landlord is also operating in good faith or are they taking advantage of people\nUm and and for that and they ... and now they may be the rent amongst rooms upstairs to to keep themselves in their house uh and it gets complicated\nI get very complicated it really does um\nThere there's some serious issues with regard to this um because they're hard to draw the line I mean at the heart red light but it can be hard to draw the line\nBecause there's a question of of good faith and whether or not the person is operating in good faith and whether or not the um landlord and I put that of course the landlord is also operating in good faith or are they taking advantage of people\nAnd I'm One of the things that he ... he worries about here you know here that they got it will be\nAnd I thought to myself well jeeze this is the stuff gets pushed through inside the code lord knows what happens when people are doing things outside the ...\nRight ... well I I mean I did attend a number of zoning board meetings when they had a lot of authority mhm and they were very strict about that people couldn't even sell their houses until everything was up you know snuff so um I think we should go back to that here\nBut I'm I'm hoping Dr Paul Harvey would pull put to rest the language programs especially in the elementary school I mean you know one of those blogs there was a lot of back and forth which has wide Ryan my\nYou know ... are you allowed to take it when you go to middle school was it only one middle school that has this break\nYou wish you would clarify what's appropriate where it's very confusing what's offered where and when\nAnd if it's called a different meaning but it's still a program and in fact everyone can participate I mean we really have to know about\nRight it's very confusing and especially you know for me that I I'm On the outside and you know I I did not have a child in school at all and and I am very much in favor of every child being properly educated\nSimultaneously however I also am not in favor of of the leveling I'm also not in favor of bringing programs down I\nOh I agree but there is a um [noise]\nA feeling I think that because you live in a certain ... certain ZIP Code you are not intelligent or your parents aren't ... excuse me lawyers or I already so Dr I great you don't have a chance I mean this this has to change\nI totally agree with you one hundred percent on that point we have to come up with what we have to come up with a better solution yes hum but I you know I'm I'm not in favor of\nA of of something that would take a program away I'm ... I'm never in favor of that I mean that dude leveling look but you ... is is clearly not a good thing that is not working\nEducated simultaneously however I also am not in favor of of the leveling I'm also not in favor of bringing program down I\nOh I agree but there is a um [noise]\nA feeling I think that because you live in a certain ... certain ZIP Code that you are not intelligent or your parents aren't ... excuse me lawyers or are we so Dr grace you don't have a chance I mean this this has to change\nI told him I agree with you one hundred percent on that point we have to come up with what we have to come up with a better solution yes um but I you know I'm I'm not in favor of\nA ... or something that would take a program away I'm ... I'm never in favor of that I mean not leveling look but you leveling is is clearly not a good thing that is not working and that's what's on the ... that is what's on trial right now with regard to Harvard\nBest that's ... that's at Harvard was going on with regard to the the the agency that that's what's on trial do leveling and that's not a good ... that's not a good solution when you cannot\nYou cannot take away programs you can not admit people by the numbers you cannot as people by the number that that's just not a good way to do things\nWell I I I kind of have a feeling that in our school system if there's only one or two children that would qualify for something they just don't get it my my you know and I agree not fair and that's very easily with that he did act them\nExactly you know and I and I'm also you know this concerted by the fact you know that that you know and and the answer that well there are so many children that that already speak Spanish as an answer that's not educating children that\nI agree that you know 'cause I mean I see it the train station the moms are dads are buying tickets they really don't speak the language right wow where I don't understand and right away a child even a little one has come up\nTo the window to the ocean right what is going on right now these children I'm going to classify them as first generation where they are and they must learn after leaving must under every single circumstance that we had every program that way\nAnd they will will but the fact of the matter is it that that's not why we should be teaching Spanish in school because they because that that's just not the reason we should be punished in school because that that's just not the reason\nBut no I I I agree I don't know there's so many dialogue dialect Mike in Chinatown and I'm hearing French exactly you know um when are we going to just give them the tools now to survive in this year it was\nAbsolutely that is that is not the rationale to be offering a language absolutely not but it's not the ... you know\nIt's just I I'm you know Dr ... has a lot on her plate and um I I'm I'm not I mean I have spoken to it at some point because I have watched presentations in elementary schools and I thought what the heck is going on\nBut when I really thought about it it's because of the children being brought up with the cell phones with the ... they don't relate to each other and I think elementary students are teachers are finding this out so they have the circle\nTime about why they haven't been helping each other because you have to be able to communicate to each other I mean\nIs is that this is I Know I I hear you I I agree with you a hundred percent because it is it's it's it's oh yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah you know and then\nIn the meantime you have children that have real problems how we can't afford to have these children go through the cracks now I Know that a boy that's going to jail\nAnd I have spoken at some point because I have watched presentations in elementary schools and I thought what the heck is going on\nBut when I really thought about it it's the collection of the children being brought up with their cell phones with the pets they don't relate to each other and I think elementary students there are teachers are finding that out so they have the circle\nTime a lot they haven't been helping each other right 'cause you have to be able to communicate to each other I mean\nIs it is I Know I I hear you I I agree with you hundred percent isn't it oh yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah you know and then in the\nMeantime you have children that have real problem how we can't afford to have these children go through the cracks now I Know that a boy that's going to jail probably for the rest of his life try I mean he he started somewhere by going wrong we know where he\nAnd his parents fail and the schools stay up through and the community I'm\nLorraine thank you for calling thank you thank you for like\nYou know when you were with WBAI way beyond your AM dial W.

and the Senate or ability to\nChange the laws to do what I Want to because you're the one who you know there's this morning\nI was talking about exact match right now no matter what the one we're with the Senate obsession oh right so some had like many of his promises aided Barclay that um\nI Love my thought for a second there were so many things he said no no\nLet's return to take off your shoes when Walter an hour Philip out on fourteen sixty W feel what\n[noise]\nLooking back near the water out take off your shoes off your host on the now joined by my co host\nAllison lip out just before the break we were talking about um the the voting and the Senate or ability to\nChange the laws to do what I Want to because you're the one who briefed on this this morning\nI was talking about exactly match right now no matter what the one we're with the Senate being out of session All right so some had like many of his promises faded falsely that um\nI like my thought for a second as well so many things he said\nNo no he was going to\nPromise and these two weeks before the ... to have\nA ... another tax reform bill right to play all male NCAA much lower the taxes on middle income folks admitting that that first tax without actually for which is an audience not popular it's clear that everybody knows that it went to the mostly the ... the corporations to the very rich\nAnd the and the middle class and lower got no benefit at all and there was a promise that you get rich people more money they will create more jobs for poor people like\nOne percent not confused with the one percent well but there was like one percent of middle income folks who did get that tax cut and they were the ones touted as the winners and\nRight and there was always a sense of we noticed trickle down economy make rich people richer they'll give you a job so poor people will get better as opposed to oldest speculate that right to the poor people in the middle class people right away right so so he said because he knows that the last tax cut not working too well\nFor middle class and lower pay all\nOf it but he wants to vote he's now saying all the stuff you know as he's campaigning that he's going to have another tax cut go into effect that will specifically target and benefit\nMiddle class and poor people right while Congress didn't session oh so he's going to have Congress pass something just before the midterms\nThat they can't pass because they're out campaigning in that district said that out of Washington where they could make laws because it it's officially added ... mhm [noise] so I'm trying to think how do you pass a law\nWithout Congress bean and the place where laws are passed you know\nMaybe you maybe you could have a telephone chain or [laughter] or tax change you know you could put more people that's how they should do now and yeah so this is our cynical hopefully humorous way of saying that there are promises being made\nThat can't be kept with the expectation that people don't know enough about how government works so that a middle class or a poor person is going to vote and say well he's going to give us tax relief retro to him and then right\nI'm going to have to kind of not anything about it that people will call in to the show today or whenever and or just think at home\nThey just hate on Trump so much why do you just have so much among support and believing in it's not that I Swear to God that I Wish something good something good would come out of that if he passes and middle income tax break before the election support for them in terms I Will be so excited\nI Would consider signing up for a rally because that is really often if he got that\nBut he gets he can mark my words on that and and then\nEverybody could check to see Congress somehow catch with emergency session everybody flies back to Washington instead of getting out to vote instead of going to the rally the gang shooting up to their voted let's see\nWell he's going to give us tax relief let's vote for him and then right\nI'm going to have to kind of not anything about it that people will call in to the show today or whenever and or just get home\nThey just hate on Trump so much why do you just have so much ... support and believe in him it's not that I Swear to God that I Wish something good something good would come out of that if he passes and middle income tax break before the election support for them in terms I Will be so excited\nI Would consider signing up for a rally because that is really often if he does that\nBut he gets he can mark my word on that and and then\nEverybody could check to see Congress somehow catch an emergency session everybody flies back to Washington instead of getting out to vote instead of going to the rallies against ... up to their voted let's see if it happens we're cynical I think we're all also\nRealistic in terms of logistics and say it's not going to happen [noise] the other thing that we talking about before the break was the the hurricane Michael in the panhandle which Trump country [noise] uh and it is now an incredibly has stepped up\nA effort to restore the voting booths to location is\nNot near where the hurricane was because those rotations don't even have power anymore but to make sure that all the people in the panhandle can now get to a vote goatee booze it two weeks and cast their vote uh for\nFor ... well I guess for Trump backed candidates [noise]\nIt it's amazing how you let let stretch for instance say that this was a an area the pan handle was mostly an area where poor people and minorities live who might be a thought to vote for a democratic candidate [noise]\nI I'm Wondering do you think there might be a slow walk towards getting those voting boots ready for the vote [laughter] do you think it might be slow walk the same way Katrina was slow walk through New Orleans that are Harvey was slow walked in used in that my real was slow walked\nA in Puerto Rico so without talking about something being done in two weeks we're talking about months or a year before anything what happened I I'm more inclined to think it would go that way\nIt's just so frustrating because a lot of people choose to believe his word and one thing he's never been known for his his word\nIf you don't investigate if you don't do a little muckraking you're not going to find out the truth\nSo little to say a thing is that it's a question of how much of a majority that these people have in terms of getting out to vote in getting somebody elected [noise] it is will the fact\nBecause it's now it's down surveys have been taken Wall Street that'd be sheet your you know polls have shown that\nMost of their supporters of Trump no he plays loose with the with the [noise] so there's that admission that he lives [noise]\nIt's now question will they elect a liar well they did it two thousand is sixteen will they support him now and support the candidates who he watched\nWell there's this feeling that thanks to my because they're saying you know\nHe doesn't live but he's all liar and what he's doing for us is he's creating a better economy there are more jobs the GDP is going up a ... there's a\nTax reform fair to Supreme Court where we're getting the right judges in in their mind the right to use judges who lean towards the right in my mind [noise] uh so how much will approached\nHe plays loose with the with the [noise] so there's that admission that he lives mhm it's now question will they elect a liar well they did it two thousand is sixteen will they support him now and support the candidates who he watched\nWherever there's this feeling that things to Mike because they're saying yeah [noise]\nHe does lie but he's all liar and what he's doing for us is he's creating a better economy there are more jobs the GDP is going up a [noise] there's a\nTax reform fear the Supreme Court where we're getting the right judges in there by the right drug use judges who lean towards the right in my body [noise] ah so how much will approach and be willing to accept and a candidate for president [noise]\nUh [noise] as long as they get what they want and if they did if getting what they want to means other people not getting what they are entitled to\nThere are people might say though is that that's just he said something that you know it it's okay to say that is nothing racial about it [noise] uh but uh I I think there is and it's\nNot a stretch you know it was like I think it was like Seventy three years ago there was a\nPact that at the front of that bus around a long time\nIs real stuff that still goes on\nAnd then restore certainly even in the early Nineteen hundreds in the late Eighteen hundreds a ... a\nCartoon you know political cartoons to pick team people of color in in in a not flattering light in any way by by making them look a certain way that we've clearly call out that they didn't look\nLike the vision and the media in general all throughout history\nBut it but that that that that's sadly in America are the norm and we've we've fought against it for so many years and I'm old enough to know Alison and I've said it on the show before I I started back in the sixties with the civil rights act the voting rights act\nThat ah we would have stopped this and there was a lot of good feeling when Johnson signed these laws into being in a\nResort town it was going to be better now and a lot of fear that\nThey may be other people of color will do to\nA person I can say us\nUm I don't feel this way but I think there's a lot of fear that one side will get to the other side what that site it's been doing that\nAnd thanks I understand that's never going to be the case 'cause the idea of violence against white people black people is so minimal compared to the other way around that that's what's so frustrating about it that that's the amazing thing\nThat for so many years and I'm old enough to know Alison and I've set it on the show before I actually thought back in the sixties with the civil rights act the voting rights act that we would have stopped this and there was a lot of good feeling when Johnson signed these laws into being in a\nResort town it was going to be better now and a lot of fear that\nThey pay the other people have color will do to\nA person I can say us\nUm I don't feel this way but I think there's a lot of fear that one side will do to the other side what that is that it's been doing to me that I get it down thanks I understand that's never going to be the case because the idea of violence against white people black people is so minimal compared to the other way around that that's what's so frustrating about it\nThat that's the amazing thing and it's been said by many scholars but mostly black scholars a but it's a true fact anyway that uh where are the cases where black mobs have risen up and going out against white people [noise] uh there there are\nThousands reports of white mob is\nGoing to have to black people historically there are towns that have been wiped out and how's that were minority\nBecause this is of course we have to clarify we're not saying all white people you know it but the small groups why people who do that and that ruin it for the rest yes\nBut the idea of anybody faking it coming up with a theory that if people of color gained control of government in any way\nThey would do terrible things to white people I think that is what you might call a psychological projection\nAnd psychological projection for those who may not know it [noise] it's kind of when you when you wanted to die things that are really inside you bad things to decide you what you do is you projected on some what else [noise]\nSo so he's been fed media that makes me think that what you think about the psychologist will tell you that if if you call a personal lawyer with no evidence of it [noise]\nIt's it's your ego\nUnconsciously try to portray yourself who do slide as not a lawyer and a scribe unit or ... or sort of like\nWhen I'm when a person has cheated on their their boyfriend or girlfriend and then they're constantly concerned that their girlfriend or boyfriend is going to cheat on them they're ... they're still vigilant about them because they are capable yes\nBut so there's no basis at all I to to think that people of color would do terrible things if they had power\nIt's because people who have power who may not be a color and do things to people of color\nBad apples in every group yeah not just because one does it doesn't mean the entire race doesn't\nExactly and to think that what you're doing badly would be done by someone else\nJust because you've done it maybe I just don't pay off in fact today so [noise] but but the logical thing into electrical thing at it and it's people defend their point of view which that logic rabbit then with evidence to back it up that puts out its ...\nIt's never happened but it seems close to ...\nUm [noise] now now the ... that was fun [laughter] I I just hope people out there couldn't understand we are not talking if you ... anybody who might not agree with us might want to say well you want Democrats to win\nI I think we're we're both crippled in our thinking because we all logical and we don't say that that is so pay dance [laughter] no no I\nAnd to think that what you're doing badly would be done by someone else\nJust because you've done it maybe I just don't sit back for that so but but the logical thing like in the ... thing at it and it's people defend their point

way for even just um the boys in the community even if they want to come out and draw me up extra drums\nUm it really just built community and I'm a self self esteem ... where it is though [noise]\nSo Stephanie thank you Cairo to Stephanie I also know that a lot of ... a newer shelling and all the volunteer\nAnd not in um the kid's closet so did you want to do do you want to shout out to any of them maybe they're listening sure the fortunate thing about kids closeted that we have now we have a very big Qadri a volunteer shells to support it with supporters all over the ... I'm sure I mean just to get across\nBut big shout out to hopefully they're listening I could probably now yeah ... okay that static ruined Berg\nTo Greta bearing down and the young\nAnd there's tons and tons of more than I think all of my New Rochelle friends and and just the community for what they give to kids closet and when I talk a little about that no show gala which isn't that interesting I Love the idea than you\nSo I was kind of a pioneer in this um after I got over my devastation of not being able to eat pizza and bagels and all my favorite foods that I was addicted to\nUm I had to start eating mindfully and I had to pay attention to everything I put in my mouth and I started counseling people because I was a social worker on gluten free diets and how to deal with it emotionally as well as physically but then I realized I knew nothing about nutrition [laughter]\nSo I went back to school I got my health coaching certificate from the Institute for integrative nutrition in Manhattan and became a health coach in addition to a psychotherapist so when I was in my health coaching school not only did I learn about\nNutrition but I learned about how strong the mind body connection is and how our thoughts really control so much and I started learning about mindfulness and stress reduction and\nI wanted incorporate all of that into my practice for a holistic approach\nTo refer 'em learn what I was getting out also I wanted to find out whether or not the um [noise] you do a job in practice\nA is you know I'm resulted in a book\nIn other words your experiences with people yeah you know took notes on all of these different cases over the forty years so at some point you you may have said yourself I Want to put that into a you know get into some kind of a piece of literature\nSo when I was in my health coaching school not only did I learned about nutrition but I learned about how strong the mind body connection is and how our thoughts really control so much and I started learning about mindfulness and stress reduction and\nI wanted incorporate all of that into my practice for a holistic approach\nFor for a living but it was getting at all so I wanted to find out whether or not um\n[noise] you do a job in practice or it's you know I'm resulted in a book\nIn other words your experiences with people yeah you know took notes on all of these different cases over the forty years so at some point you you may have said yourself I Want to put that into where you don't get into some kind of a piece of literature or or documents like almost like a ... professional diary\nAnd also the book has sections um talk a little bit about that Jody I mean some about food that's also route right mind and helping out of your mind\nYeah so it's ten transmit information all steps as you said so I talk about all different things in the book but basically you're right I mean that's a psychotherapist we have to take notes anyway on our clients so I did have you know a full I'm a full range to choose from but I also created a mindfulness boot camp and\nAll that I had the outlines to boot camp that I created a six weeks to camp to help you feel lighter inside and out using mind and body using mindful eating techniques just revamping the whole way you think and I said I'm going to turn this into a book I have such great information my clients were responding so well to it\nAnd I wrote everything out in three months I was ... given it to my editor and I thought you know now I have now I'm going to have a buck and three years later here I Am you know I'm with the book finally finished because it had to be in certain sections that had a you know have a flow and makes sense and\nI added meditations into the book so in this book you can actually\nUm scan talk about technology can scan your ... and you can get in for a day or something so a cue our code if you have the Kindle version you can just click a link and go into this meditation and resource area where you can listen to meditations and get recipes and all sorts of tips\nBut the ... code is in the print version of the buck and that's like that little square that you see when you can scan of grocery item or you know vote a bar code yeah thank you but they call them ...\nYou can scan it and get right into this meditation and resource center so I wanted to make an interactive and now it's technology can so\nWhat's really cool about that because I actually did it when I was reading the book is\nYou you take a picture of it with your camera and all of a sudden a video once you go through just I think one quick step where you put in your email address or something\nAnd then Jody appears on a video on she's known you know I can see your directly yeah it was like oh she's very relaxing as you and and it's like you're getting a new one on one counseling session at that moment\nYeah code at school magical feel the pressure that are good is that um you know over the years so psychotherapy is nothing new obviously it's some breakfast all over the world\nWhat what ... the about the um the boot camp and under ten points is that it offers the structure oftentimes when you go you know when when you go forward and try to get psychotherapy or\nOr any kind of psychological counseling or whatever it's an open ended bore mhm and people don't know when you do when the end just called me at least you've given a little bit of a parameter yeah human [laughter]\nYes you're fixing to when you're designing well yeah I mean people don't want to sit in that well you know\nYeah and it's like oh she's very relaxing as you and and it's like you're getting one on one counseling session at that moment\nYeah coed school magic like another impression that I get is from you know over the years of psychotherapy is nothing new obviously it's a breakfast all over the world\nWhat what about the about the um the boot camp and and your ten or ... people structure

I'm dating for nutrition instead of weight loss I mean there's so many bad\nYou know hundred calorie packs that don't you know nurture us we really need to move to um eating healthy foods so we feel good we have good energy and not worrying so much about the calories of course portion control\nBut heating to to be healthy and and the weight will come off without you know\nYou beating yourself up because you're going to fail the other way\nWhen to think about what you're doing right it's a tension evidence cause and effect situations where I'm a you know many\nPeople that I grew up with and I worked with you know I'm over the years at very demanding jobs than Leno's that it was very demanding jobs and Jodie touched also\nBut there's a there's the clock exists in other words interests at six o'clock mhm mhm right you think you can come home at nine o'clock\nAnd have dinner at nine o'clock and have a restful sleep is going to happen mhm because of biology at that there was nothing to do with what you want\nYour body is not going to allow you to go to sleep right right no I Do a little layer your this is the life coaching a very small example life coaching of advice I'm sure that you are important to your your patients\nRight well just eating you know paying attention to your food knowing what you're putting in your mouth you know being mindful of the cues that your body kids do you know you don't have to eat until you're so full that you're sick you\nKnow and and when you're mentally and the president you are you pick up on those cues like because it all kind of tired and gather I can see how mindfulness\nCan help you and meditation because meditation allows you to increase their capacity like I was saying before to be uncomfortable\nRestless sleep but it's not going to happen mhm because of biology at there was nothing to do with what you want\nYour body is not going to allow you to go to sleep right right no held a little layer your this is the life coaching very small example of life coaching of advice I'm sure that you're a reporter to your your patients\nRight well just eating you know paying attention to your food knowing what you're putting in your mouth you know being mindful of the cues that your body gift you you know you don't have to eat until you're so full that you're sick\nYou know and and when you're mentally and they present you are you pick up on those cues like because it all kind of Thailand together I can\nSee how mindfulness can help you and meditation because meditation allows you to increase their capacity like I was saying before to be uncomfortable so you can sit with an emotional pain without reaching for a cookie you know we stress seat that's a large part of our problem so it can help with that and also\nUm increases the time between stimulus in response we're not so reactive so we don't need to jump up and go do something it teaches us to be able to sit with\nUncomfortable feelings which can help with eating so that's why I say mindful and it's getting it's really about managing your mind not so much your weight and your food and all of that it's ... it all starts in the mind\nThe flip about what you're doing\nRight mindful mean and we are right yes\nFor for ... to summer school [noise]\nYou know what kind of phone you're do you you started a\nNumber of years ago just go up to this level\nOf yes I have a little sure I have a private practice like I mentioned at the center for health and healing and at the center we have lots of different practitioners that work there I'm One of them and I\nAre focused mainly on stress reduction and anxiety and mindfulness meditation and mostly women and there are other practitioners that do um any thing from um you know spiritual\n... killing two reiki to chiropractic to natural we have a natural path to Dr we've all different modes of healing acupuncture\nSo and and on the weekends we have lots of workshops um that we teach as well then I'm going to be doing a retreat in the spring um and I also have a ... a group that Iran mindful mom's group\nThat I'm building I'm trying to create a community of like minded women who really want to practice stuff practice mindfulness and um you know so that community is growing as well\nAnd let me just say she is very creative in her in her methodology is well this summer Jody had a at a local lake had mind you know medical mindful moments where I forget what you call it at the lake and it was sold out a ... I mean it was you know routed [laughter]\nWell attended outdoors very old outdoors by a lake\nI had probably you know twenty to thirty women I had a lot of sections of it too I did it about six times and um it was an upper Westchester nor the Westchester and it really was great I mean people really respond to bring your own child I mean who don't want to sit by a lake and just in the nature of the state of doing I always\nWell attended outdoors very held out the door by a lake I had probably you know twenty to thirty women I had a lot of sections of it too I did it about six times and\nTo grow it I don't have to wait for years to get a license and hope that his majesty king Andrew happens to be nice to have to give him a license then they have to pay two hundred thousand dollars to get that license no\nIf you want to grow grow I Want to help small but it's a small farmers not that big business\nWho the cronies you were just referencing\nDo you think I Know all of his cronies\nWell no what is it give us a sort of group at\nEvery single person who was a bit license right now every single person who has a ... a license to grow hemp right now that the person who have a kind of a school right now ...\nWhat about the guys who were being arrested you know who've been convicted and people around him it's close and they can uh you know and those cronies\nOf course that's what they into all the boards and all the authorities are for look what are the other problem which is different from what you mentioned earlier but the idea of corruption there are several ways to repair and make corruption a whole lot less than they are saying you can't get rid of corruption nobody can but you absolutely can make it less and you absolutely earlier here's one of these other do\nGet rid of all these unaccountable boards authorities corporations like\nFor example all of the regional economic above the corporations should all go away these things all literally just petri dishes for corruption if you see all those people you just mentioned all those people who got arrested indicted convicted almost every one of them\nIs on a board ordered authority or the committee or one of those things that's how he uses those things to reward his cronies and his party loyalists and those who get your money\nYou check it it's just it's just common knowledge he's raised over eight hundred thousand dollars from people that he's put on boards\nSo of course there has probably it is obvious that it is it's screaming at you\nRun on people seem to care you know two to one in the polls what's that ...\nYeah I tell you why it's fear there are two aspects of fear number one fear people out are so afraid of the other the other is this case is usually a Republican or they'll vote for Democrats\nThe next thing is when you fear tactics in all of our marketing right for candidates every commercial is not I'm going to help someone but this guy is evil that guys bad guys evil\nAlways voting for the lesser of two evils that what does that add up to that adds up to people actually being so afraid also\nA ... disheartened that they don't even vote sixty Seventy percent of New Yorkers don't even vote we have given up so and those people don't vote of course his majesty wins 'cause the only people who do\nKnow one on people seem to care you know two to one in the polls what's that ...\nYeah I tell you why it's fear there are two aspects of fear number one fear people out are so afraid of the other the other is this case it's usually a Republican or they'll vote for Democrats\nThe next thing is when you fear tactics in all of our marketing right for candidates every commercial is not I'm going to help someone but this guy is evil that guy's by this guy is evil\nAlways voting for the lesser of two evils that what does that add up to that adds up to people actually being so afraid also\nA ... disheartened that they don't even vote sixty Seventy percent of New Yorkers don't even vote we have given up so when those people don't vote of course his majesty wins 'cause the only people who do vote or those who are afraid of the Republican they both the Democrats the rest of the people just stay home\nWho may I ask you a question do you think you could win\nOf course absolutely\nOdious than we were all these people in the third Buddy Guy goes am going to win either way and they never win the luxury believe you\nYeah it's a great question and I didn't say I'm going to win so I said you said Kenya went and I said yes let me\nAsk you then go and\nThere's a difference I didn't promise you victory they do I didn't I'm telling you I Can't wait let me give you a couple of reasons why number one older guys in the past the last three libertarian candidates for governor it all for the last three combined\nDid not raise ten thousand dollars I raised over four hundred thousand the last three candidates libertarian line combined didn't make as many stops as I make\nIn one month I make over thirty stops every single month this is not your father's libertarian can't pay isn't ... Libertarian Party this is a different Libertarian Party that's number one but that's not enough the second thing is you look now at the situation itself five way race\nIn a five way race thirty to thirty five percent could actually win this thing\nThat's a big number two when that's also not always true but then they go to the numbers the last poll we put out I'm about about thirty three percent name recognition this by the way is my biggest hurdle to victory is name recognition\nBut people know who I Am they tend to vote for me at first they present day recognition I'm Still poll yet Thirteen percent so the math is as follows a few triple thirty three percent to get to a hundred percent name recognition that makes me triple Thirteen which was the numbers up the polls which means I can win so what does that mean my hurdle my Mt Everest\nIs the recognition if people get to know who I Am but I've ever sex that's how I Would if they don't I'm a struggle that's how it works\nOK so let me ask you questions so we'll get to know a little bit who are your contemporary political heroes and Rand Paul from the government or you have any heroes\nOn my my heroes tend to be more business people in general but most of my heroes believe it or not or my actual activists everyday who out there trying to make things happen the the people who are actually sitting there saying I'm going to volunteer my time with my energy and my money to try to make a change in this state\nThese people are actual heroes the people who are running our state for the past sixteen years they're shameful sixteen years the Democratic party has run this date and if they were going to fix it said they would affect the Republicans have watched this they'd be destroyed for sixteen years\nSixteen years last eight years of this over a million people have voted with their feet and left the Republicans have watched that would have they done nothing by step plan zero where's that move it nowhere I've been doing this for one year\nI have a movement and apply for almost everything these are the real heroes to people or helping me do this\nOn come on now you mean to say you can't give them run run a hero one person like you know in the body and the Libertarian Party round ball and I love OK rent\nNot on my actual activists every day who out there trying to make things happen the the people who are actually sitting there saying I'm going to volunteer my time with my energy and my money to try to make a change in this state\nThese people are actual heroes the people who've been running our state for the past sixteen years they're shameful sixteen years the Democratic party has run this date and if they were going to fix it said they would affect the Republicans have watched this they'd be destroyed for sixteen years\nSixteen years last eight years of this over a million people have voted with their feet and left the public is I've watched as what did they done nothing by step plan zero where's that move it nowhere I've been doing this for one year\nHave a movement and apply for almost everything these are the real heroes to people or helping me do this\nOn come on now you mean to say you can't give them run mental hero run person like you know in the body and the Libertarian Party round ball hey I Love\nOK Rand Paul's libertarian Rand Paul's Republican to just be grown that lots of Republicans call themselves which areas\nBut the Republicans he's Republican libertarian you want me to give you here yeah Gary Johnson the man who stood up twice to try to stand up for this party and lost both times but it's still going strong that's my hero a good man a man who cares about people who knows what to do the right thing that's\nMy hero and remind is Lee and again did you just say that you know I said there are a lot of people out there and you know idea where to turn twenty six to eight yeah and actually it and you think of who took a poll when ten percent with ...\nIf you ask me for someone famous or did you ask me for a hero\nNine yeah you're a hero no no no you said you really said that I was explaining why fan because I wanted to add new hero to introduce them buddies and they would know who he was I Love it please Google Gary Johnson that'd be amazing okay\nThat sounds a little ... for me but that's okay you can do that too like so now you can buy you a policy and she was ... was the one of them I Do one of them and first on the list that I suppose education calling\nFrom young when you're a libertarian approach to education with me\nHe asked uh this is a great what a total ... of education is just the right now we're dropping twenty two thousand dollars per person per year per kid I should say per year and their state ten thousand more than the average and we're at\nBest rank thirty seven and be in the entire nation we also have a massive teacher burn out and then we have trouble finding teachers we have a lot of problems and assist in a situation right now is low graduation rates nothing but bad so here's the answer number one is the larger answer but I'll give you the whole thing\nThe first thing is and standardized testing until high school satellites testing before high school just makes it's unfair where teachers as an unfair way of rewarding schools it makes kids who are ten eleven twelve years old feel stupid if they can't test well it makes a second class that's did it\nIn elementary school is a terrible idea is that when the case of success at that age that should go away if that goes away several things will happen number one will lose Common Core but don't care if it goes away but he just decided that makes sense or not\nThat's not my choice that should be a teacher's choice to use that tool or not second\nWill lose federal funding will lose about four billion dollars out of the budget is about sixty billion dollars total with education budget and about four billion of that comes to the

V. O. X.\nRay machine rose my guess today on W. veal exporting the the journalist\nAnd political analyst Phil writes men but also has its own show here on WBAL act\nI knew with Bill rice men at noon every Thursday and like I said earlier there's just so much to talk about but we were talking about the gubernatorial election I Want to ask you off though elections than what people forget it we're voting for state senator state of family members as well uh let's go back\nTo the primaries when the idea the independent democratic caucus took such a major hits Senator Jeff Klein defeated Senator Carl Lewis she holding on by just a couple of percentage points\nI mean the idea came out for most people don't remember about six or seven years ago a bunch of Democratic senators and sided with the Republican by major voting issue to keep Republican basically in power in Albany ...\nUh the the the governor Governor Cuomo gave a blessing back then then he pulled away but a lot of damage done it and then you know anti Trump New York environment they paid the price on primary day for well Andrea Stewart cousins emerge on on November ... as the Democratic majority leader of the well\nI mean if you're asked me you know with a gun in my head yeah sure yeah\nAs well uh let's go back to the primaries when the idea the independent democratic caucus took such a major hits Senator Jeff blind defeated Senator Carl ... holding on by just a couple of percentage points\nI mean the idea came out for most people don't remember about six or seven years ago a bunch of Democratic senators and sided with the Republicans on nature voting issues I keep Republicans basically in power in Albany right\nUh that that the governor Governor Cuomo gave it back then then he pulled away by a lot of damage than in and that you know anti Trump New York environment they paid the price on primary day for well Andrea Stewart cousins emerge on on November ... at the Democratic majority leader of the well\nI mean if you were to ask me if you know with a gun in my head and yeah I Would say sure yeah [laughter] you know I mean yeah\nActually it's funny about the ACC talk about inside baseball that most people in the south now idea no idea um that was very interesting um political development and in in in that it allowed a Andrew Cuomo\nTo do with his trained triangulating strategy was to you know pretty much play to some of the Republican issues while also staving off road Democrats but it was it was a classic\nMove that have benefited from ... and ah and then when the political winds for shifting to the left in the state which they have\nA markedly I think I'm certainly did the steel you know where he said uh you know uh I I won't campaign or I won't live a it was sort of a it was sort of a a I don't know what you call it a non aggression act which is which is common in\nPolitics right so yeah I mean I think what's gonna happen is that once he takes office ah again so did you will or in January ah there's gonna be a lot of um [noise]\nDemocrats are who are now going to try to a\nShift the agenda in state and that'll be everything from the legalizing marijuana probably two to health care social\nAnd of course that the concern about taxes and trying to ... ... and our inability with that you know our property\nTax rate at which we still don't really know answer we were yeah and I think that also by the way a sort of a hamstrings and handicaps ... to ... he's a ... he was against the Trump thing because I kept the state and local tax dollars and ten thousand dollars which is probably going to probably affect\nYou know almost every homeowner could almost be home on and you know as I said I it's more than ten thousand dollar property\nExactly and then you add in the state to\nAspect to if you're even if you're on the cusp of that exactly of the number is probably going to go beyond\nBeyond that so we don't really know you know um what the effect of the tax the deal is going to be so we'll find out and it's going to have I think you know it's going to ask the repercussions one or another we're already seeing it in ... I'm ... I'm getting\nRight now none of that but that's important to people to carry out their pocketbook right the one thing they do care about\nWorld War II seeing it in in in the upper end of the of homes I mean we're talking about the two million dollar Bronx though highlights on my last friday in Bedford is like that where uh the homeowners are saying you know we're not being if we're not going to be will sell our homes because they're gonna have to come down and priced off so as the tax\nBill right so what they're doing or renting right exactly and\nThey're losing their homes for like you know because there's still a lot of Wall Street people will want to live out back late so they're they're actually renting these four bedroom right houses for Fifteen grand a month right now it's just amazing\nAnd people are paying it which are very active and they're just sort of rubber on I'd say politics but it's a laundry list\nCan I ask the repercussions one way or another we're already seeing it in real it's a ... I'm getting\nRight now no no no but that's important to people carry out their pocketbook writes the one thing they do care about\n... seeing it in in in the upper end of the of homes I mean we're talking about the two million dollar Bronx no ... in Bedford is like that where uh the uh home owners are saying you know we're not being if we're not going to be will sell our homes because they'd have to come down in price dogs so as the tax\nBill right so what they're doing so renting right exact and\nThey're losing their homes for like you know because there's still a lot of Wall Street people want to live out back late so they're they're actually renting movies four bedroom right houses for Fifteen grand a month right I mean is this amazing amazing\nAnd people are paying it which has been very active there just for ... I'd say politics but it's the laundry is still a cousin she doesn't have become already leader if the Democrats take full control\nOf the state Senate of the state of the state assembly which they already have and then you've got a democratic governor does that bode well for a while it certainly thoughts faults at the Democratic party but to your point does it shift too far\nTo the left to wear Cuomo and he is looking at that twenty twenty potential for a presidential race doesn't hurt 'em or or help\nOn how it's a good question I I really don't know the answer I think um I think he let's put it this way well first of all think about this is Andrew Andrew Stewart cousins now no longer will be three men in a room no yeah we got a woman that fine line right so so it'll be it'll be a two man\n[laughter] and I wanted to finally finally right exact 'cause I looked at that than an Eighteen are actually two thousand and Nineteen right happen if right\nNow I don't want to stereotype you know a a ... a woman might legislator Atlanta legislator rights as only being interested in in women's issues although although it is interesting\nThe Cuomo has bent over backwards to um play to the so called women's vote I'm going to record\nAnd so she might have some things that actually uh some insights and things that are unique to her that he hasn't really thought of or something like that so maybe that actually will help you know I don't know\nAnd what at some of us tend to overlook that but it's very important to the minority community Andreas ... cuts in Cincinnati writing Americana too and she has represented her district and and you know so well for it and she has such respect among minority communities throughout not just her own district but throughout the state right\nThere there are we all know that there are issues particularly\nLooking at a Trump Administration and the concern for you know um and I've had I'm Lawrence ... on the show many tied up and he's expressed such major concerns you know with the Trump Administration regarding their treatment of minorities and perhaps that will see a change their\nYeah and also would say that she is um of the um is that I shouldn't say establishment I I guess that's for better or lack of better she played the game along ... she's she's a she's part of the Democratic team that\nWas not is not necessarily\nThe a ... a Casio Cortez a wing of the part now she's not she's not would not be considered far less so ... says she's not going to radicalize the legislature nor\nWas she put a Andrew Cuomo if he is interested in running and twenty twenty which I doubt at this point for a lot of reasons one is I don't think this guy plays on a national level as it could get his\nBetter lack of better she played the game along ... she's she's a she's part of the Democratic team that\nWas not is not necessarily\nThe a ... a Casio Cortez a wing of the part now she's not she's not would not be considered far left so ... so she's not going to radicalize the legislature nor\nWas she put a Andrew Cuomo if he is interested in running and twenty twenty which I doubt at this point for a lot of reasons one is I don't think this guy plays on a national level as it could get his\nAre battling with yeah with with the hour yeah the double desk despotic\nFigures and this is you know a not a Republican thing to or democratic thing it's whoever's in the White House kind of a thing right and\nUm however I think what what surprised people singer Marco Rubio coming out you know basically saying that we have to punish thing to do something you know and that may include his mind Congress in general\nWith the idea of mixing banks in Iraq but I think what makes what you just said a Janine was that what makes us different is that Trump doesn't talking in terms of human rights and he's talking in terms of the bottom line and uh even though in the past we've done deals with with people like\nYou know the ... the prince the crown prince of Saudi Arabia including Saudi Arabia and um we've always said that this was um we always put in the context of national security that that it that we're weighing two\nThings here national security versus human rights and in this case we're going to have to take the national security and and that is palatable that's acceptable to some people who might pledge at something that Trump says when you know this has to do with the bottom line they are ...\nIdeal for us right and and again as we as journalists we know that journalists around the world had been murdered this is not the first journalist ... and we should mention that even though he was a Saudi national he had been very outspoken on what the crown prince with Iran's right and and picked off but\nHe just ... and now ironically I'm not talking about Mother Teresa now directly play that's important you\nKnow this guy was it was a\nPlayer on both sides yeah so anyway and at the same time what's ironic here is the president just really brokered a deal with turkey free a pastor and I want to get his name right there right then yeah who was in a Turkish prison for two years now they say that was completely coincidental that\nGot out but we speak to you know I pictured sprints and within the oval office with a family I Believe it was on Saturday you know\nWe as journalists we know that journalists around the world had been murdered this is not the first journalists but and and we should mention that even though he was a Saudi national he had been very outspoken on what the crown prince was their range right and and kicked off the but he just ... and now ironically\nAnd we're not talking to my Mother Teresa now directly that play that's important you know this guy was it was a\nA a player on both sides yeah so anyway and at the same time what's ironic here is the president just really brokered a deal with turkey to free pastor ... I'm a I Want to get his name right after ... who was in a Turkish prison for two years now they say that was completely coincidental that\nYou want to send that out but we speak to you know I pictured sprints than with any Oval Office with his family I Believe it was on Saturday you know got down on his knee how the president's hand I referred to it in like kissing the ring of the pope and\nPrayed with with you know I'm the president and the oval office it was certainly a pictorial event\nAnd then you got Kanye West in the oval office with the president only off on every tangent in the world yeah and I remember thinking to myself watching both of them were supposed to be separation of church and state yet that this looks very much like the kissing of the ring\nYeah well you know in the case of the pastor I mean that just up to his approval rating with the religious right by X amount [laughter] Kanye West I mean is it the same with Trump is you know the kind of a west reminded me of The Apprentice show but it also reminded me of the world wide wrestling federation and understand Trump\nYou know you have to look at how he got involved with Vince McMahon did ask all of that yeah I really think back right my gosh so how do you explain his popularity well you know I remember when I was in college I went to a uh some friends to a wrestling spectacle in Hamburg, Pennsylvania\nAnd there's a crowd you've got the impression that uh the crowd believed this stuff yes they all they all think wrestling Israel Israel but some of them really don't think it's it's almost like they have a a kid and cognitive greatness the cognitive dissonance other\nThey they know which was a joke but they still believe that the right time and that's\nWhat Trump has recognized about a certain segment of of the American population and they like wrestling I like entertain they liked the form of stuff and they like in your face and Trump to them it's like Trump's got a costume which the blue suit and the red red tide and it's like he's up against\nThe Democrats or wherever the enemy\nRight on any given day right the enemy\nAnd they're the hulk Hogan or whatever or good killer Kowalski you know whatever the villain in the ring is and they love it yeah and you know you mentioned before you know I I don't know if you put on the air or during the break you know he's insults people was part of a whole lot of it that's part of the whole ...\nThe fighting and he said as you mentioned the CBS interview he said I'm the president and you're not basically rodeo in other words I'm I'm here and I tried to ensure our\nMembers are treated and you're not exactly but yeah you know uh so and that's what he does I mean that's the that's the whole\nThat's the whole strength and interestingly enough you know who's on his cabinet that Linda McMahon man's life although I like her I think I mean of course all yes I actually met her she was pretty smart but you know what I'm saying it's just so he's it's the whole culture\nAntics yeah antics are all part of it the ... and we're going to talk a little bit more in the next thing that but let's go to Brett Kavanaugh now yeah I mean\nIt literally about polarizing place that we are in in America and this man got on the Supreme Court the Washington Post for an ABC News poll the majority of Americans did not want to see Brett Kavanaugh on the Supreme Court just too many quite yeah\nYou're not basically rodeo in other words it I'm I'm here and I tried to to our number ... ... and you're not exactly\nBut yeah you know or so and but that's what he does but I mean that's the that's the whole\nThat's the whole trend and interestingly enough you know who's on his cabinet but when the man's man's retire life although I like her I mean personally I I actually got her she's pretty smart but you know what I'm saying it's just so he's it's the whole culture\nAnd ... yeah the antics are all part of it yeah go back and we're going to talk a little bit more in the next thing but let's go to Brett Kavanaugh now yeah I mean\nIt literally about all the right thing by that we are in in America and they got on the Supreme Court the Washington Post for an ABC News poll\nThe majority of Americans did not want to be Brett Kavanaugh on the Supreme Court just too many quite All right well which many questions there or do we have a

W. W. dot ... B. C. W. dot org\nOr always feel free to give us a call at nine one for nine for eight to one one zero so we can tell you how we can help your businesses grow in Westchester County or I guess this afternoon just to have your brown he's the CEO of broke our system is located in the Hudson Valley uh we're talking about the\nUh the areas of work that he couldn't go into and help a business grow by putting their website together and putting it on on on on the Internet and getting the most productivity out of that or to help the bottom line for that business\nI guess one of the questions that people see now because everyone can learn how to do something on YouTube or anything else is\nWhy not just build a website on my own or why not go to a square space or a wick that can actually just do it and I don't have to really have to have an interview or anything like that what separates you from uh from those type of companies if well the first thing is\nIf we're talking about a business owner and we're talking about somebody who is\nAsking his clients or his clients are asking why should I use you and and the biggest the answer is because I have a particular type of expertise where I can help you so if you're saying why should I not do this on my own do you have the expertise\nTo be a copy writer to be a designer and to be a developer to understand Google to be as CEO expert at the age of course the answer is\nLikely not unless you take it as a full time job to do that\nSo what a agency can provide is that expertise that is what we do full time just like if you're a printer or if you're whoever you do whatever you do full time and that's a while ago to you for my printing and not try to go to the copy shop and an end to myself\nAnd I guess one of a business has their website up and going ah they're always looking for what their return on investment is how are they seeing that that Web site it's making a difference I into their businesses how do you help them age that uh and I guess uh\nNot raise expectations but really be responsible in terms of what business should expect maybe the first six months to a year out with creating Web site\nRight so it starts from the beginning so when the beginning you decide what it is one of the metrics that you're looking for I have a a trendy guys what he wants as he gets a\nA text message instantly when somebody goes on his website for something I have a printer and what he wants to do is to have people submit their jobs right away so it's a website set up to solve the business problem that you have\nFirst of all of what everybody wants to know when somebody visits do I have to Google has to be set up on your website and there are certainly Youtube videos and all that to to do that and then the next question is are you getting monthly stats\nHow many visitors how many there are all kinds of technicality is how what's the balance right and so on and so forth but to get monthly stats about what's going on is that going up or down\nAnd if there is not it's it's not matching expectation what's in the way an odd way to fix it and sat last part that's the one that's most important and that's where the expertise comes in\nAnd and sticking with that last voice obviously one can get a a piece of paper with well budget numbers in terms of that how do you drill down to give your clients really a better understanding of what those numbers really mean\n[noise] I have a conversation or at least once a month a literally on the phone or or through email with them too\nOr certainly Youtube videos and all that to to do that and then the next question is are you getting monthly stats\nHow many visitors how many there are all kinds of technicality is how what's the bounce right and so on and so forth but to get monthly stats about what's going on is going up or down\nAnd if there is not as it is not matching expectation what's in the way and how do we fix it and sat last part that's the one that's most important and that's where the expertise comes in\nAnd and sticking with that that last voice obviously one can get a a piece of paper with well budget numbers in terms of that how do you drill down to give your clients really a better understanding of what those numbers really mean\nI have a conversation or at least once a month or literally on the phone or or through email with them\nTo explain what's going on for anybody to have a question all of my clients on my cell phone number so they can call me and we can resolve whatever it is that they are confused about or don't understand or whatever needs to be communicated to them about what's in the next thing for them to do\nAnd when you're looking at the mostly reports and what are you looking at to be able to either say to your call at you know what this is working or in some cases saying you know what maybe we need to revisit this and take it into a different direction\nA again I'll go back to those first two things what what what where are our metrics at the at the beginning that we're we're looking for and or is it growing so are we getting more visits are we getting more phone calls are we getting more people coming through the door\nAnd if that's not happening then how do we how do we\nHow do we make that work\nAnd also if there is some are monitoring an additional monitoring has to get so for example a lot of time somebody will call but they don't ask where did that come from so you can't directly attributed to the website so a lot some of it is the training for people that are answering the phone or the standing of the counter saying how did you find out about it [noise]\nThat's great I guess this afternoon as have you brown who is to see 'em over ... systems I Want to do it right now without the the music for the break coming in at least give our listeners your phone number and the best email that they can reach if\nOK phone number is eight four or five seven to seven one zero one zero\nAnd the email is info I N F at ... dot com B. R. O. V. as in Victor E R a dot com and we also have another website or it's fast website launch dot com take\nGreat uh you know again as I said at the beginning of the show to me it's just mind boggling when I just that I'm the least icy savvy person in in in our shop at the business out Westchester but I but I see the all the different emerging trends that are occurring on all the different platforms are\nAnd it's not just the website now which sweater it's linked in it's a Facebook or again what do you what is your company do to keep your clients updated on on again the emergence friends that are happening\nHonestly most clients aren't interested in the minute detail of that what they're interested in is\nAm I getting traction right so it's my job to either personally or what the people that I work with to keep up with those things and to make sure that we have food in the mix of\nPinch or is this is great today if Google has an update and they're looking for something different\nAnd it's a day to day job what I tell people if my if my mother told me that if I did this kind of work that every day I'd have to learn something new I'm not sure I Would have done it but it's exciting and it's interesting and it does require your fulltime attention and that's why\nAgain what do you what does your company do to keep your clients updated on on again the emergence rights that are happening honestly most clients aren't interested in the minute detail of what they're interested in is\nAm I getting traction right so it's my job to either personally or with the people that I work with to keep up with those things and to make sure that we have food in the mix of\n... great today if Google has an update and they're looking for something different\nAnd it's a day to day job what I told some people as much as my mother told me\nBut the other side of the coin is uh they've also announced a device in technology that allows them uh to shoot down drunk\nAnd it's a very important capability they're using lasers now to uh be able to identify drones in the sky even very small ones the size of a bird or you know we've heard that they're insect level sized drones on the way up there on out there already guide and I\nI had seen some of these are the the jamming devices that basically was able to take control of it and to bring it down but you had to constantly focused on it to bring it all the way down\nSo that's the technology and uh and as they say it's good there are guys habit and our our uh our men and women a lot for a crack at being able to use these things very important for the navy also uh this laser technology\nUh it's really going to be changing warfare and it's really who's got the best uh capability and then who can use that the most effectively when push comes to shove I mean that stuff and I mean ... and drones\nAnd then cyber defense or the two big front that we see all the time in a military defense mhm\nUh one other quick thing we're talking about this morning it was a discussion that the United states may pull out of the INS treaty mhm uh that was signed between President Reagan and president Gorbachev orbits job

lot of attention doing well and Sonia we'll hear from was like ... like in the United States Navy on next week jak you got a few things for us\nYeah or the weekend there were a couple of Virginia

I Love tower tower how their whole ABC group unbelievable\nWhat I was twelve years old or fourteen years old uh I grew up in Port Chester and they used to have a the men's club would have a yearly sports breakfast and one year we had Howard Cosell\nAnd being fourteen years old and the future reporter I stood up and I ask every question I didn't want anybody else to talk\nFor like an hour and if we changed [laughter]\nEnd of it how old are you young man that said I'm fourteen years old because you don't have the biggest now for a fourteen year old I ever heard of my life and to which I received a standing ovation or heat I think he did but I took it as my standing of it as a true story\nAnd you got infected by that forever right when once you get something like that it stays with you\nHe was many me I was not meeting on that one was not [laughter] no I was not that was nothing like Howard ... more like Howard Cosell than I Do not oh please no no no highly opinionated most everything come up\nAbout ... what what let let's talk about politics\nSo it was until a problem of the hour let's talk about sports who do you like in football this year I Will go to politics\nHave now they're about to say ... how politics ... have leaked into sport\nWell this is one of the reasons I think we're going to get into\nA the NFL ratings which took a beating last year now the ratings are upstairs and while the ratings are up first of all you know they're not showing people kneeling for the national\nAnthem the networks you know all these brilliant people with all the resources finally figured it out if you don't want to alienate people don't show them that and so they don't show they're not showing the national\nAnthem for what is Jerry Jerry appointment and not getting injured the protecting the quarterback sports is built on stars\nAnd superstars and they've had close game so it it's a comeback year\nFor the NFL because they're keeping the politics out of it as much as they can\nAbout I'll point out Jerry that for the games from London that they've shown they have gone out of their way to show the national anthems and and it had been I think significant that you did not see any players kneeling for any of those games\nNow that was pretty I watch that yesterday I was really keen on that same when you were doing like so it's good to see that\nI'm waiting for the first Muslim American to make the NFL and um when it comes time for prayer not just on their knees but on the ground and seeing what America does that\nObese person just celebrating their religion what\nWould I don't know about that when you're you know when I was thinking about when they were during the national anthem if they've done God Bless America or America the beautiful would have been the same thing but you guys think\nI think it would have been I think that uh I saw that there was a a presentation made or are you a request made to the NFL from a a fan and it made a lot of sense to me\nThat uh and it was a military veteran who who made it he said there's no reason to co opt the national anthem if they want to truly have some recognition of injustice out there they can ... asked for a moment of silence either before or after it and everybody can get a pizza pie\nWell remembered that though that the the the um the the the fastest got the who wrote the national anthem was a slave holder and there was a section of that anthem that was a minute because it called for slavery\nThe beautiful would have been the same thing but he goes back\nI think it would have been I think that I saw that there was a a presentation made or you pay request made to the NFL from a a fan and it made a lot of sense to me\nThat uh and it was a military veteran who who made it he said there's no reason to co opt the national anthem if they want to truly have some recognition of injustice out there they can ask for a moment of silence either before or after it and everybody can get a piece of the\nPie well remembered that though that the the the um the the the sweat Francis Scott Key who wrote the national anthem was a slave holder and\nThere was a section of the anthem was omitted because it all for slavery and it talked about the inferiority of black\nSo you know there Oh yes ... research or to remember\nOh I can see where you see I away from\nThe oh no no I'm not shying away I say well I think there's an accepted it in a way you look at this ... the former addict part of all broadcast to guys\nYou except for Jessica Mendoza doing baseball to guys in both women on the sidelines one woman on one side in line and other woman on the other side line so they they're such such a part of it now that whether or not they want to accept that they are accepted everyone keep their prejudices to themselves\nThat anybody who ... I forget which protest that was just today whether it was the four twenty\nFive game was the uh NBC game but the referee once a woman and um I didn't think anything of it so later and they gave us a wait a minute\nAnd and the referee at the army Miami game was also as to what his wrestling with the Miami games the first time ever there was a woman referee ... at at West point\nAnd I didn't see any of the players giving her any grief beyond which they would give any other effort they do not army wouldn't do it because the referees the referee I'm In my college there's a very conservative place so I'm not\nPaying your scene NBA teams hire female assistance yeah oh for the main team and for the um the lower teams would they usually your guinea more women involved\nIt's not it's not surprising though I mean the world is changing the politics of going backwards it and I think you know I I'm I'm representing I I'm working with someone running for public office in Westchester County\nAnd we were sitting there last night and they were decrying the politics of today\nHave led them to think that\nWe've gone back fifty years and\nWest Point and I didn't see any of the players giving her any grief beyond which they would give any other effort they do not army wouldn't do it because the referees the referee I'm at my college there's a very conservative place ... knots\nAnd you're seeing NBA teams hire female assistance yeah oh for the main team and for the um the lower teams would they usually are getting more women involved\nIt it's not it's not surprising though I mean the world is changing the politics of going backwards it and I I think you know I I'm I'm representing I'm working with someone running for public office in Westchester County\nAnd we were sitting there last night and they were decrying at the politics of today\nHave led them to think that\nWe've gone back fifty years and\nYou know I'm the only guy at this meeting and I I\nSaid to myself do I say something to like give perspective or do I just keep my mouth shut I I'm not going to keep my mouth shut so I said you know what the politics of the national politics that's going on today at some of the state politics where Republicans are trying to roll back\nSome of the um liberal advancements that have taken place I think women have been collateral damage very major collateral damage I don't think it was set out to go after women and I think that women have\nMade great strides I don't think there's full equality yet and they may not be\nWait until the mid term so you're going to see quality no no no you are grumbling you are going to see a ... a woman elected office in terms\nOf party to both both parties have more can you know I I understand that but but\nReally the way it is going to come up before the Supreme Court before too long\nAnd the conservatives that the Supreme Court may take away a woman's right to choose that is a huge step backward I don't understand why men believe they should be able to tell women what they can and cannot do based on a religious idea that they may or may not share\nYou say it's only man that feel that way\nWhat no I I'm not saying it's only been in the field and why shouldn't tell women as I say it's only in the U.S and there's no women who have\nNo they do I I that's not what I said but all men believe they have many men believe they have the right\nTo create um that kind of law\nI'm not saying there are women who wouldn't do the same thing but I don't know where men feel they have the right ... and ... with that in that instance of what's the sense of what's going on based solely on that\nI Would say that they're right but I think based on everything else in society now I don't see that although there isn't isn't equality in the workplace or did you work at ABC News for thirty some odd years yeah did you make the same ... you didn't make the same amount of money you know the camera people\nRan out because I hold on to the union and and that was a a union was a godsend or I was fortunate that I could get equal pay but I think that if I were not in a union if\nI if I were if I were in a non union shop like like what what about what I Would not have had that opportunity to fight talent\nDoes not unionized they each have an individual contract\nThey had already know the ... and in some ways and in some ways yes it was different for the female reporters than it was for the field personnel for the union people because the most important in some ways did they were discriminated against I\nMake less money they didn't do they made little stories about people like Marcia Kramer\nThirty some odd years yeah did you make the same about it you didn't make the amount of money you know the camera people because\nI Belong to a union and and that was out of the union was a godsend uh I was fortunate that I could get equal pay but I think that if I were not in a union if\nI if I were if I were in a I'm a non union shop what what what what about what I Would not have had that opportunity and how do I ought to fight how\nDoes not unionized they each have an individual contracts\nThey had already know that they have it in the ... and in some ways and in some ways yes it was different for the female reporters than it was for the field personnel for the union people because the more reporters and so what did they were discriminated against it doesn't make\nMuch money they didn't do they made money about people like Marcia Kramer and and people I mean I witnessed moons ago you did a lot of you guys did a lot of crazy things that weren't consider hard news but the women participate in the same as well\nOr they had the time but but but but you had to become more aggressive I mean there was the a thing that you never came in you never entered the business of left the business says the same person I I I think that there is some\nTruth to that because it's\nYou have to really you have to really push yourself you have to really be able to hold your own in order to get the respect in order to be able to do the job [noise] it's unfortunate but that's how it is that's the that's the

against you but it seems to me the odds are exactly the same weather is five million dollar\nA jackpot or one point six billion record levels jackpots where you might as well play it now it's amazing and nobody's wanted so far since with so many more people playing a one would normally think that there should be some more winters but the odds of winning are still the same\nNo matter how many people are playing it\nJust got to get the right number so I played my lucky number should happen to be lucky so far but I Wish me luck and I wish you all have you like if you play as well as much as

luck and I wish all if you like if you play as well as mine as well\nDo it that the gunman in a discussion on the weekend of course debates debates debates I call them out when the Democrats hiding out it's obviously a tactic Andrew Cuomo white Mario Cuomo I Would note and his race against the annual Rourke really initiated this style\nMario Cuomo's the great figure for so many liberals out that I thought he was the embodiment of all that was pure and good\nHe was a nasty inside or political player at times and humiliated or the already very weak\nOr ... way back when when he was a Republican candidate for governor and at least do Rourke hit back with a clever theme you went around the state with a photographic life size photographic cut out\nOf Andrew ... of Mariel Congress you Andrew Cuomo in that race was behind the scenes are pulling some strings Mario Cuomo was the governor of course an annual recording around the state with this cut out image that he would set it up for a press conference has been debated\nWhich seems to kind of contradict the forty eight percent and want to Republican control of the house and forty nine percent disapprove forty six percent approved\nAnd um there is that a slight difference in the regions of the district I Would also mentioned that um if the poll is accurate there's quite a difference in attitude towards a Delgado and fast so amongst those with um\nA bachelor's degrees\nOr or more and higher education or less than a bachelor's degree I don't quite figure it out except maybe working class people who are in college graduates are more comfortable with faster and may know him but fifty three percent of those was less than a bachelor's degree and only thirty four percent\nOf those were the bachelor's degree or more back faster on the flip side of it as a dental fifty four percent with a bachelor's degree in more back Delgado in thirty four percent back faster they also have to do with the fact that down said where Delgado support is are a lot of\nPresumably a half their affluence and a well educated people from New York City you moved up into the district and a lot of those people as we talked about before our voting um\nAre are being encouraged to register as Democrats and to vote or a Democrat obviously let me just quickly see if I can send a note here to someone from\nA ... office asking where the congressman is because he was supposed to have joined us by now um someone's writing me invite Delgado\nA well the only God Knows how to standing invitation\nSo that's a dead ethical fifty four percent with a bachelor's degree or more back Delgado and thirty four percent back faster they also have to do with the fact that down and say where Delgado support is are a lot of\nPresumably a half their affluence and a well educated people from New York City you moved up into the district and a lot of those people as we talked about before our voting um\nAh are being encouraged to register as Democrats and to vote or a Democrat obviously let me just quickly see if I can send a note here to someone from\nA John ... office asking where the congressman is because he was supposed to have joined us by now um someone is riding means I got into\nA world God has had a standing invitation to come on the show I'm sure as people know that uh let me just right they'll just see what the rest of it is a C I Wonder if you know what it could be\nYou know get in and I just occurred to me I think I got I gave him the right number because they called it the other day it looks like we do have John faster with us maybe it was just reading through the cross paths and forgot it was supposed to be ten Fifteen that he called on good morning Congress and thanks for being with us\nGood morning Fred nothing so complicated as reading any polling it was just simply um I forgot that it was ten fifty\n[laughter] well that's fair enough let's talk about the polar quickly it's mainly razor thin lead that you have one point it really is in the margin of error is so it really doesn't count how do you read this poll what do you make of the gender gap send education gap says claimed in the findings are the poll\nUm these are similar to what we're seeing around the country as we know that this was a close race but I have to tell you Fred I'm encouraged by this uh survey because if you think the Democrat candidate spent eight million in the primary much of that beating up on me\nAnd then uh between Delgado and below sea in the Democratic or money coming in from around the country I think they've spent about\nEight million dollars already in the general election uh falsely attacking me so I I think there's a pretty good I think we're going to win\nWell I think there's no question that that money does have an impact the last I saw um Delgado versus you he's raised um six million or more to your three million or is that right and what is this money come from mainly\nIt's coming from a liberal activists from all over the country are very little from our congressional district I'm\nJust as he parachuted into this district last year having never lived here or worked here um the money is coming in from all over the country from the far left and\nUh you know that's just the reality we're seeing this around across the country the left has mobilized but I think of the Republican conservative side has mobilized as well and I was outspent two years ago Fred ... Teachout or I knew going into this that I was going to be outspent this year as well but I feel that\nWe have enough resources are to win and\nObviously people who want to help me can go to John Faso dot com and and help me\nIs any of the money coming from the sort of ... billionaires who are backing the Democrats George Soros Tom's dire and my ... as far as you know\nOr nothing from Bloomberg I don't know about those other guys I'm frankly I I haven't had time to leave and look at it as a report and frankly I don't even care about it at this age I just know most of it is coming from a way outside of the district most of it outside of New York state\nAnd um that's what you'd expect for a candidate that has very little local roots in this district\nWas explains that big gender gap a twenty points spread or so and also the education gap assuming twenty points for it is so it was well assuming that the polling findings are accurate well in your view\nSays to win and obviously people that want to help me can go to John Faso dot com and and help me\nIs any of the money coming from the sort of ... billionaires who are backing a Democrat George Soros Tom Sawyer and my ... as far as you know\nA nothing from Bloomberg I don't know about those other guys I'm frankly I I haven't had time to leave and look at it as a report and frankly I don't even care about it at this age I just know most of it is coming from a way outside of the district most of it outside of New York state\nAnd um that's what you'd expect for a candidate that has very little local roots in this district\nWas explains the big gender gap a twenty points spread or so and also the education gap assuming it's ... point spread is so it was well assuming that the polling findings are accurate or in your view what explains that\nUm I think this is a a a reaction to the polarization that exists in the country and the gender gap that exist broadly in the country and much of it is a\nA much of what's on the Democratic side has mobilized against a President Trump and much on the Republican side has mobilized for him so it's\nIt really is are the kind of thing where I'm just hopeful that enough voters and I believe they will or take a look at my record of being bipartisan of getting things done like on this opioid crisis\nI'm for farmers et cetera because those are the issues that at the end of the day are going to be the most important I think for our district\nI understand that but it's funny to me that a lot of the people on the left who would argue for ah that that the genders male and female or basically equal\nAre are seeing in or will see in a poll like this dramatic differences in attitude and we see it I think the President Trump's writing as well I Know that's the case\nBetween men and women ... says you one more time if you have a sense is it that women are maybe more open to the argument says Democrats are making on health care for instance in or maybe less comfortable with some of the more aggressive policies of Republicans on foreign affairs where is this some other explanation that you could think of that would account for this why gender gap\nI think that it's a combination of things for it I think certainly the attacks that I've uh endured with the false negative tax on\nThings like a pre existing conditions and this false attack or a where they argue that I didn't tell the truth to a constituent et cetera about pre existing conditions I think that that's certainly had an impact\nOn but I think most people now that they're seeing a the pushback on that and realize that these are false charges I think that the truth is winning out and that's why I Believe we're going to win two weeks from tomorrow\nThe other day when we spoke to said stay tuned when I asked you about a Andrew Cuomo and whether a Cuomo's unpopularity in your district was going to be playing a role you're still saying stay tuned or you're rolling something out today or tomorrow\nI'm I'm I'm saying or stay tuned still Fred\nI Know you're debated your opponent Antonio Delgado repeatedly or what do you make just quickly you have this um ongoing saga was reached the apex over the weekend between ... mile an arrow your party's candidate for governor in Colombo over Cuomo try once again to duck out on debate to minimize their significant\nI thought the uh New York post or a cover headed really appropriate ... you're going to go to a you know they look almost playing the game of uh the incumbent too feels he's comfortably ahead\nAnd we know that a mark mall and arrows going to do pretty well upstate downstate having run for governor I can tell you it's a very difficult to get known there unless you've got massive amounts of money and Cuomo doesn't want to give him any ability to have ...\nToday or tomorrow I'm I'm I'm saying or stay tuned still Fred\nI Know you've debated your opponent Antonio Delgado repeatedly or what do you make just quickly you have this ongoing saga was reached the apex over the weekend between ... narrow your party's candidate for governor in Colombo overqualified try once again to duck out on debate to minimize their significance\nI thought the uh New York post or a cover had it really appropriate formal or you're going to go to a you know they look almost playing the game of ah the incumbent too feels he's comfortably ahead\nAnd we know that a mark mall and arrows kind of do pretty well upstate downstate having run for governor I can tell you it's a very difficult to get known there unless you've got massive amounts of money and Cuomo doesn't want to give him any ability to have people see him\nOr have them see mile an arrow but that's not fair to the people and it's not right I mean I'm debating my opponent or numerous times are going to do one on WAMC today we're going to do one on spectrum tomorrow um and in fact uh this new CNN spectrum poll has dying and Neal at five percent and that's the threshold\nFor getting in the debate so I presume that they're going to abide by their agreement and put her in that debate\nI think you'd agree with me that one of the really ugly things about New York or negative things about New York politics putting their corruption aside is that going back to marry oh Cuomo the tradition has been established not to debate\nAnd there's really no strong expectation of debate strong enough to force the candidates pay for statewide office to engage in debate that we have the phenomenon of\nCourse in ... and ... having a half hour debate how ridiculous is that\nIt's completely ridiculous and um you know Jill a brand and ... I think they're both running for president apparently they only recommendation I Would make to fill a brand is that uh if if they both moved forward she get a food taste or\nJust a last question for me on a serious substantive ... where do you think should be done which President Trump to what should the nation do with this army of five or six thousand so called a migrants marching towards the United states border are originating I guess in Guatemala\nWell obviously um if they reach the border the United states they should not be allowed to pass I mean this is obviously being orchestrated\nA buy a some group or groups are attempting to bring attention to this issue uh but I think that it is a definitely going to redound against them the American public is going to see through this they're not going to like this\nAnd um what we need to fix our immigration system and I'm One of those Republicans that it's been out there I'm saying making recommendations on what we should do but uh having a mob come across the border is not the way to do it\nAnd the military should use including ... could involve violence of course it may very well be what the demonstrators and the people who are behind them wanting to see happen but violence is necessary force should abuse\nAll the violence of course it may very well be what the vetting demonstrators and the people who are behind them wanting to see happen but violence is necessary force they should've used\nAlong with their big money allies mainly in unions who would be a candidate who knew it wouldn't be whereas before that time\nIt was grassroots organizations counties committees that could decide who from maybe organically from the community was the best person to run it\nRepresents a profound change there's not a change for the veteran my view it as one that we just have to accept if you want to get us about five on eight for seven six Thirteen hundred five when eight for seven six Thirteen hundred or heard from one of our listeners Fred last time fast it was on your show you didn't invite Delgado on is usually do\nA well he's certainly invite a lot as I noted earlier I think when I got that first got this I had to be happy to have them I don't think he's going to come on\nI'm for the reasons that he doesn't want to be on the receiving end of what would be some trench in respect of ... respectfully ask the treasury and\nQuestions and someone to raise the question about fashion apparently had mentioned that God will never lived in the district or never lives here he never lived in a commercial district he was born and spent years as they used in Schenectady but it's basically a New York city guy\nWho moved into the district just a year and a half ago or so two years ago apparently with the intention of running for office that this is a carefully\nCalculated plan\nWith the commitment of money behind it\nAlso hearing from a regular listener who goes by the name ... party a\nHe cites the business councils decision to back Andrew Cuomo even though New York ranks ... in many rankings the worst in the nation for a business climate after eight years of Andrew Cuomo and California knows how embarrassing is this organization\nHas ms ... left to Albany and seen the rest of upstate it is why this organization continues to be irrelevant\nAnd that's a reference to

Churchill had a very good column in the Albany Times Union over the weekend\nBut those are rare voices there was an interesting editorial over the weekend on endorsement actually from the Glen is false post star which is a liberal oriented paper\nBut ah they sometimes do unexpected things for the better several years ago they actually won a Pulitzer Prize for their editorial writing much to their great credit\nA headline endorsement colon Marlon arrow would bring needed change let me read a little bit is\nLet me just checked in guinea and we've got to read a little bit and then we'll go to the phones are highly hawking let's see um how we Hawkins Green Party candidate in Marc Mauer narrow Republican have a surprising amount and common in their quest to be elected governor\nBoth considered political corruption one of the biggest problems facing the state and they offer similar fixes both wants to change the way New York handles economic development spending and ... much of that money into infrastructure\nBoth unlike Andrew Cuomo may time for an hour long meeting with the post our editorial board we\nDon't hold it against candidates who can't make it to go out in this fall's for a meeting but it does fit with the general arrogance and lack of transparency of the Cuomo administration that our call to request to sit down with the governor was never returned\nOne of the worst aspects of the Cuomo administration has been in secrecy the governor has micromanage state agencies interactions with the press in the public and twisted the purpose of states spokespeople from informing the public so making the governor look good\nLet me say I've are just as an aside I've been talking about this for years we saw it happening after ... promise who's going to be just the opposite remember the most transparent that dentist rationing vowed in New York history\nWell it is trans parents that's for sure but the transparency is about it's\nOpaque this I mean it's a disgrace what has been done to the idea of public information and openness in government by this administration the or post are no sour optimism about what Cuomo was going to be turned to disillusionment when\nAre we without justification with its its work I'm finished he just spans of the moral and commission after just ten months our disillusionment has grown since then especially in the last two years\nWith the bribery and big rigging scandals associated with the buffalo billion in other states that projects is once promising administration has collapsed\nUnder its own ambition an arrogance

national races in New York um the the one I'm\nIt's work I'm finished he just spans of the moral and commission after just ten months our disillusionment has grown since then especially in the last two years with the bribery and the rigging scandals associated with the buffalo billion in other states that projects is once promising administration has collapsed\nUnder its own ambition an arrogance and New York cannot now move forward without a change at the top\nIt'll be trumped exploring let's go to the family that Steve from Albany on the line about voter guys drink a state what's on your mind\nUh I have a comment about a voter guide that I'm aware of and also a question about whether you're aware of any other voter guide that would talk about the um the state the state the races and the national races in New York\nUm the the one I'm aware of is from New Yorkers Family Research foundation if you go to New York families that are wild\nEither huh okay I mean you're giving an ad for them what about what about it\nI I'm just saying there the voter guide there\nHe okay plenty of other guys out there appreciate that will save you know I mean even in the legal women voters they have what they call a voter guide and there are some others various groups a liberal groups working families party conservative party a conservative group\nDo ratings on various people in offer voter guides I just didn't along the lines are going to go back to the post our editorial in Sacramento along the lines of that\nAnd I give the post our credit for I'm\nFollowing up with an editorial what their conclusion is about the nature of what happened to New York uh and I saw a choice though that was addressed as in the uh kind of hypocritical side of it that came out from somebody who calls himself and obviously that's not a real name it's a play on\nA scandal involving the buffalo actually asked about civilian but Joe ... this is how many calls himself Joey ... coke or not\nBut he tweeted out yesterday or she did whoever this person is I'm getting ready for the times union and the New York times to say that Cuomo was a corrupt arrogant bully with a complete lack of transparency but we're there we're seeing them anyway because Donald Trump\nAnd that and that kind of hypocrisy which we see all almost everywhere in the state we see it with the Buffalo News too they weigh in on the decay and\nDisintegration really of what used to be the greatness of a New York's government and the prestige of is associated with New York's government they light at the doorstep\nIn this case of Andrew Cuomo and they'll do it in various editorials and then in the end Illinois Andrew Cuomo\nI've mentioned before a lot of times these endorsements are not editorial decision really their corporate decisions and whether it's um\nUh the Buffalo News and it's with his hand out for the buffalo billion and other money is being sought by Warren Buffett who owns the Buffalo News\nOr the
