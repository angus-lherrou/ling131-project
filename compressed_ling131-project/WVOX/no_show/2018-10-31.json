couldn't\nThe government didn't like that so they moved into West Virginia they flew him there and a day later after arriving in West Virginia he was found dead beat the debt that an ice nearly gouged out they said it was personal alleged mafia hit man who knows\nBut I'm sure they will find out and it was alleged appropriation why he was killed was that because he was an informal a rat\nWho knows again I don't know but it's a fascinating story it's a story that leads itself to filming and I'm sure there'll be successive films on this particular issue Whitey Bolger\nEverybody they asked what he

here and people close and they get asked for more information\nAnd it's something that we have to you know so much is been involved with the constitutional right now but no one ever mention is one of the most important constitutional provisions\nAnd that's the right to remain silent ... the Fifth Amendment to the constitution states a person cannot be forced to testify\nHe cannot be forced to say things against himself\nAs it was I was watching TV here the last ... and there was a case in which a MCS type person was interviewing a purported to criminal and he invoked his right to counsel which means after you got to stop at that point\nAnd the agent said well if you do that I'm going to arrest your father and I said my God that's such a misstatement of what the law is as soon as to invoke your right to counsel everything's hereafter must cease and desist stop\nThat's your right under the law\nThey say well that's the rice criminals get away with it too much a couple of years ago I was with a group of judges to Cuba and we met with judges in Cooper in as lawyers in Cuba and I raise the question there I says\nYou guys you got the right to remain silent duty judge chief judge of Cuba said Oh absolutely not if a person is charged with a crime he better explain what he was doing and what his rights ... how he was involved\nI said then you don't have a right to the main style is

C. R. P. C. R. every you're alive constantly so it's a constant watch an edit and you do have that rush but not as much\nAnd you get to learn more things and edit such it addresses and um [noise]\nA another editing software\nAna Marie ... received her bachelor's degree in may have come in twenty Thirteen she's lived with us on the eye on a college radio hour here on WBFO asked so obviously ESPN so many people are viewing\nI'm the program that they're streaming yet you're you're responsible for editing were you when it's humid eat it at first knowing how many people you're you're reaching on a on a daily basis [noise]\nI'm not really a good job they kind of train you to be your best and half the best work out there so you you don't get intimidated\nWhat are some of the projects I worked on that you could share or that you're most\nProud of recently ah we worked on a whole bunch of flights for us the so that's a place where you have different camera angles and you turn to see and be able to analyze the play better so that is definitely something that I'm very proud because it took me about\nWhat two months to finally be able to be on the chair on my own for access\nAnd I mean some highlights where you have to play them life from your room so that's pretty interesting and fun\nThat sounds like a lot of fun and it sounds like a rush because it's definitely something that they didn't exist then you really helped push that and\nIt happen right yeah for a view of the we didn't have a um like we don't have that because we have to calibrate them feel for every ah we have different sports so before we even add something to illustrate that we have to calibrate the field there is no such fields for to calibrate for us\nSo we came with the idea of calibrate in it with the AMA will be a calibration so it worked out how difficult was that at first it was really difficult because you have to angle so you have to match the calibration exactly for the two angles and taking into account that you're using and Emma will be\nField to re magazine right [laughter] so you're using something huge to calibrate like little ... and it has to match on both singles\nIt sounds like a rush because it's definitely something that they didn't exist then you really helped push that and make it happen\nRight yeah for a view of the we didn't have a place we don't have it 'cause we have to calibrate them feel for every ah we have different sports so before we even add something to tell us that we have to calibrate the field there's no such fields for to calibrate for us\nSo we came with the idea of calibrate in it with the end will be a calibration so it worked out how difficult was that at first it was really difficult because you have to angle so you have to match the calibration exactly for the two angles and taken into account that you're using and Emma will be\nField to re magazine right [laughter] so you're using something huge to calibrate like a little octagon and it has to match on both ankles\nSo with the rise in social media how has that changed your job or affected your job in any way are you creating more content or video for social or you're doing a mix of both are that's just now an added responsibility\nRight ah no we had more uh we share more content with our digital peers and there's actually a whole production of dedicate it for our digital ... now let's\nGo back to your your college days here at at I own a what are some things you did at I own it I think help prepare you to work in the industry inland this job\nRight um the TV production class was very helpful and you know the basics of ins and outs and how to use a basic software editor and even though we used a different about self worth at ESPN what software you guys using ESPN clientele\nOkay and even know it wasn't the same as what you learned that I don't know where you still able to apply the basic knowledge ...\nFrom what you learned at I own a to be able to excel at ESPN right yeah so what before we let you go what would be the biggest piece of advice that you give students that are looking to really break into the industry and whether it's sports or entertainment news just in general what advice would you leave students\nUm you know politeness goes a long way [laughter] believe it or not and you never know who you're gonna meet down the street so always to your best to be your best out there you never know who you're inspiring and\nHotel be respectful and little thing to be an odd time uh looking people in the eye things like that take you a

Love entertaining and you know when I went to college to study fine arts um I loved it I worked in that field\nBut it didn't fulfill me and it made it reminded me and it should remind others who are

out their chest all they want Boston congratulations and it's\nWell deserved absolutely and the Yankees look a broadcaster and built this team with a veteran a starting pitchers that didn't get the job done and what if it had a lot of hold and much set it and I'm getting repetitive about it but you can have on your team\nFilled with the ages and that's where the Yankees really habit and it's an all or nothing team really ... and the red Sox played bass to base a little ball and look the viewership is down twenty three percent for the world series\nBaseball is boring the fan the games for too long and you can't have this or you don't people don't want to see seven eight pitch at bats either they don't want to see twenty something strike out to the game that we've we've said\nIt numerous times here already the Yankees are awaiting boom or bust when they were hitting home runs when they're hitting the long ball they're going to be great and they're going to be hard to be but when that's not happening\nThey don't play small ball they don't advance runners they don't sacrifice they don't bunt they don't you know hit and run that doesn't exist there and what's really frustrating

too there you go to home runs okay so it's all about getting basis with runners and scoring position and getting the out you can with your pitching and that's what it's all about ...\nAnd the pitching exactly something they didn't have and you go you know and credit to David Price who was criticized early on and criticized by some of the media members in New York thing that he can't picture and the big game and he was like that is less there start you know I'm Glad you brought up David Price I mean an\nOlder respected David Price he needed to be called on and on his post on his postseason play

V. O. X. rayed towers captured Miller attorney to collaborative divorce at Miller law group a New Rochelle spends a half hour advice and you\nAbbott dialogue on divorce [noise]\nMiller on hand or it's a group and director of the center for understanding in conflict and I'm On a mission to change how people divorced and helping divorce with dignity and respect and my guest today is shared Goldfarb shared Goldfarb is\nAlso an attorney with another law group and she's been working with a with families and children for how many years now sure about Eighteen year Eighteen years and uh she has worked as an attorney for the child and having witnessed the devastating impact that parental conflicts have on children\nShe shifted our practice towards mediation collaborative law what parents agree to refrain from exposing their children to the conflict stresses the negativity inherent in the litigation process welcome shared the pleasure to have you on the show thanks Catherine [noise]\nSo I thought the only good idea today we talk a little bit about your role as attorney for the child because it really I think in that role allows you to see the child's perspective for us on the divorce process and and really impacted you professionally as well personally made a shift in your career toward a more out of court a\nCollaborative kinds of resolutions is that right that is right\nSo why don't you tell us a little bit about what the attorney for the child is and what that person does in the litigation process\nOkay so in a contested a custody matter\nOften and attorney for the child is appointed by the court or\nWith one parent or the other or you know or something like that where you might think you know it's really in the kids' best interest to have a relationship with both parents but that's not your role to say to the courts\nThat is what's in your best interests uh\nSo how do you handle that sort of conflict between what you might think and what the kid wants [noise]\nWell a lot of being an attorney is counseling\nI'm really getting to know the child and to be um to speak to that child and talk about what is it about a foot in the example that you mentioned for a child who doesn't want to see one parent for example\nYou know what the reasons are\nYou know sometimes it could be for\nReason you know as simple as you know I hate going to that parents' house\nAnd then as an attorney you could just may be other alternative twelve what if you visited with your father somewhere else or you know what do you like to do with him and\nWhat comes out often is that the child doesn't have such a strong position that\nChild never wants to see that parent but there are certain things that child might not have lights about that with that parent so I'm In and counseling and and really on spending time with your client child um\nCustody you know and and really I mean it's really mostly about time right we'll all the kids live and who will make decisions about them and going forward right so how\nDoes the court make that decision and lord of the ground for that how do they make a determination what are they trying to accomplish in in the custody case [noise]\nWell the the standard for the court is to um to act in the best interest of the child\nIn a custody case\nSo there are a lot of pieces to the puzzle to figure out what would be in the child's best interest\n'em when they're an allegation of a mental health or\nSubstance abuse or something like that for rent at the value later I'm a trained psychiatrist or psychologist\nIt's and the best position to evaluate the mental health of the parties [noise]\nSo that is one piece of the ... though\nAfter the report comes and conduct forensic evaluate\nWell the the standard for the court is to um to act in the best interest of the child in a custody case\nSo there are a lot of pieces to the puzzle to figure out what would be in the child's best interest [noise]\nWhen there is an allegation of a mental health or\nSubstance abuse or something like that for rent check a value later I'm a trained psychiatrist or psychologist\nIs and the best position to evaluate the mental health the parties [noise]\nSo that is one piece of the ... though\nAfter the report comes in from the forensic evaluate our all of the attorneys but he ended up a port and have a chance to um two\nPoints out what's correct in the report and let's incorrect in the report [noise]\nAnd then that one piece of the hospital and the child position\nIt's another piece of the puzzle\nAnd the parents attorneys make their arguments about the parents who should be in a ... who who who are in a in a good position to assess what they think it's in their child's best interest [noise]\nSo their positions are taken into account as well so all of these pieces together form the basis for a judge to form a decision on what it's really and the child's best interest and do you think that\nThe judges are influenced by their own personal biases or their own research that they're doing what's right for children kind of in a more generic why or is it really specific to each particular family in front of the court\nIt's really that's a very difficult question to answer you know to get into a judge's mind is not\nEasy um I Know judges tried not to let their personal biases um uh inform their decision on what's in a particular child's best interest or what's best for that family [noise]\nAnd it's hard to say [noise]\nThere's a dialogue on divorce I'm Catherine Miller I'm speaking today will share a Goldfarb about the role of the attorney for their child and share of anybody any of our listeners have any questions about the roar or any questions about cuts that in general how could they reach you to ask those questions [noise]\nAh they could reach me by email is probably best and my email is ... S. H. A. R. A. at West Chester family law dot com\nThat's great and you know and in the end when we buy ... at the beginning of the show\nHow we talked about the the your experiences in court sort of leading you away from the litigation or leading you away from really wanting to participate that much in the litigation experience because of the difficulties that you name there and he talked a little bit more about that\nWell I ah in representing children for a year it's often in one particular case or another um I've really come to see the changes in these children\nWhen they when I first meet them until the cases are resolved\nAnd it the\nThe drama\nThe conflict between the parents really really affect them [noise]\nSo I\nI Do think for children um it it for children\nAway from the litigation or leading you away from really wanting to participate that much in the litigation experience because of the difficulties that you've seen there and they tell us a little bit more about that\nWell I ah in representing children for a year it's often in one particular case for another um I've really come to see the changes and the children\nWhen they when I first meet them until their cases resolved\nAnd at the\nThe drama\nThe conflict between the parents really really affect them [noise]\nSo I\nI Do think for children um it it for children a court is really a just\nAn awful place um for them to be answered that parents to be on because it's almost inevitable that their parents kind of take that home with them and they um the way they the parents at each other\nLet the kids over here it's a really does impact them [noise] so I was looking for other alternatives to court to 'em and looking to uh\nTo do more work and mediation and collaborate as law for that very leads and\nIn ... and and collaborative law\nReally agreed before they even start the process that they're going to put their children the best interests first\nUm and there are also a professionals or to support the parents through the process so they continue to their children first [noise]\nYou know you know I remember um when I was a litigator it occurred to me which is one of the reasons why I stopped personally litigating is that\nEven with everybody genuinely genuinely wanting to put the best interests at the children first in the litigation setting it was impossible to do that\nBecause the way the system is set up and just because it's not really set up to deal with families it's set up to deal with a much more sort of commercial kinds of litigation but because of the way it's set up\nIn laws to use the pressure points that you can use to get the best result for your client at as an attorney and that\nOften means putting pressure on the ... and the parenting relationship and and and\nAnd it it's really difficult not to do that someone is going to do it because it's the way if often done and I I don't remember [noise] I'm\nThinking that this was just incredibly terrible and when I got divorced my job I was so afraid of it that was after that experience but I decided that I could no longer working that model but that said\nSome people some children find themselves in that model and through no fault of their own right it's not the children's fall right and they need they need a boys and they need protection\nAnd and it sounds like what you're saying is that the role of the attorney for the child has to give them that voice in the process but they don't always have that not every custody case has an attorney for the child is that right that is right\n[noise] some uh judges and some courts appoint attorneys for the child more frequently than other [noise]\n[noise] so [noise]\nWhat what makes it what do you think makes a difference between a judge who does do that\nAnd when I got divorced myself I was so afraid of it that was after that experience but I decided that I could no longer work in that model but that said\nSome people some children find themselves in that model and through no fault of their own right it's not the children of All right and they need they need a boys and they need protection\nAnd it sounds like what you're saying is that the role of the attorney for the child is to give them that voice in the process but they don't always have that not every custody case has an attorney for the child is that right that is right\n[noise] some uh judges and some courts appoint attorneys for the child more frequently than other [noise]\n[noise] so [noise]\nWhat what what makes it what do you think makes a difference between a judge who does do that or doesn't do it and who pays for it [noise]\nWell in family court in New York\nIs the parents have retained attorneys\nThe attorney for the child is usually private and the parents [noise]\nI'd say private it privately paid um the attorney for a child it's still appointed by the court not the you know the parents can choose exactly um but the parents do have to pay if the parents and family court\nCannot afford their own attorneys in that case um the court also appoints them attorneys are\nIn a in a custody case going a case involving children and also a point\nTo an attorney for the child is fair it's um [noise] a disputed issue with respect to the children where the the the family court feel that they um it would help to make a decision to lead to basically here that child's voice\nSo it is I'm pretty common in West Chester county for an attorney for the child to be appointed in family court and it's not\nAs common or in Supreme Court um where\nThe boy says are heard divorce cases are heard [noise]\nUm and a judge at the Supreme Court um they feel that the parents can resolve the custody issues [noise]\nUm but if there is a a real contested custody matter with allegations about you know allegations going back and forth about the parents are\nBanned the judge will likely appointed attorney for the child foreigners requested\nHow do you think and I know you can't put yourself in their in their head but how do you think judges feel about resolving cuts of the shows do you think that it's something that you and your impression do they the judge just try to get people to find their own resolution or they would like to make the decision themselves\nI definitely think they feel that it is best for parents to be about to make a to come to their own agreement resolution on their own and they definitely I think in my experience um I mean the judges say it uh they said that they really should not be making these types of decisions\nNow I heard a judge say once that passed the fact that it will against the parents or do you love your children you know do you love your children mother or do you love your children father and for some courses because then the judge said well I don't know why would you want to make decisions for them you know\nBack for parents to be about to make that come to their own agreement retribution on their own and they definitely I think in my experience um I mean the day at a they say that they had not been making these types of decision\nNow I heard a judge say one that fast but at the lead against the parents\nOr do you love your children you know do you love your children mother or do you love your children's father and each person course that'd be and then the judge said well I don't know why would you want to make decisions for them you know\nWhich can block you from reaching your troop potential and keep you backwards while the rest of the world continues to move forward\nHere say bail when I was young I remember that raised a story away from my father I think I was in grade\nSix or seven yeah this is a long time ago I did not remember I sat there which grade but\nI was young and I came from school and I had at ... yeah and I was happy okay because before I see ours is the study and I had been mine it and I was happy and I came I was so happy and I rushed to my dad\nAnd I told him that I got beat you know what happened what happened to my dad or look at me he smiling and he did not it did not release this word I was expecting this word is ... ...\nIt

whatever it is that you think is going to keep you satisfied and that's going to be enough for you but now I'm asking you to picture on the world would be like\nWithout ambition without without a drive for more now I'm willing to bet that there would be no America\nThat the world would be in a very primitive state because rather than keep moving forward rather than pushing toward something better or rather than wanting to be better than we are\nWe would have decided that where we are is the most that humanity can every evolve we would have decided that right where we are is where we should be\nAnd things would be dire today but something something as deep as and passionate\nAs the American dream is built on the foundation that one day people came from everywhere from all across the world to this land a promise a land flowing with milk and honey and decided that they wanted more\nTo be like just wants to stop the on the top of what you say absolutely they came from France they can find anger\nThey came from across Europe at that time Europe was a beautiful place it is today yes but I don't tell was does it big field\nPlantations oh no\nThey weren't a there was

in an Arab crucial team because we are the product of people who decided that they were going to keep pushing forward\nBecause imagine that people will never decided to keep pushing for me probably wouldn't even be born today so we owe it to ourselves we owe it to the human race we old to America to keep pushing forward and tonight to never give up and then never ever think of ourselves in being
