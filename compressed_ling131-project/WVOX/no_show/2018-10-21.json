once again it's an honor and pleasure thanks for having me we're delighted to have you and we're going to be a little bit about you and especially about\nThe experience of being a deacon and all the um the tour juggle activities and parish activities that I'm filled that experience that part of your life first off a little bit about yourself\nUm first you are a family man I Believe correct I've been married to my wonderful\nWife laureen now for middle be twenty seven years next week and uh we have two wonderful children I've been blessed us far and\nMy daughter is twenty two and she's a recent college grad from a manual in Boston [noise] and she was very fortunate she taught some summer class up in Norwalk and they liked her a lot and they offered her a full time teaching position\nAnd humbled than happy to be involved in the church and the Catholic faith or I'd like to some day if a\nIf God has it in his plan and obviously his timetable to be a chaplain either in a hospital or in a school or universe\nAnd humbled than happy to be involved in the church and the Catholic faith for I'd like to someday if ah\nIf God has it in his plan and obviously his timetable to be a chaplain either in a hospital or in a school or a university setting\nIt's interesting because they were brought up two things I did but without the kind of training that now that would be able to provide 'em but the two very different realities there to uh and that's the fascinating\nAh as you spoke about the sci fi program but it's pretty intense program for preparing to enter into the hospital\nA ministry the and you also mentioned for for university which are the lights went up when you mentioned the high school\nIn a or a university level that ministry they that I Know they have a a Center for spiritual our mission spiritual correct now I and I know they I Believe they have a program for training spiritual directors or spiritual direction and areas virtual direction\nYeah now that might be something to look into\nThat that's interesting you say that because I have done my homework and I do I did notice that they do offer that um and\nI Am obviously going to look into that because obviously that's something I can take with me forever I'm currently though I'm I'm looking into the ah program they have it Bridgeport Hospital that BP program they have there which like you said it's [noise]\nIt's gotten very intense and obviously it should be but I think my time at St Vincent and volunteer aspect will helped me immensely there but uh the classes start immediately and then they run through the end of April every Thursday at a four hour clip\nBesides all the class time you have to do nine hours a week a visitation an hour's worth of supervisory I'm with a chaplain so it's a program that is extremely detail but\nAgain I'm being a deacon I'd love to\nYou know some day one again I've had my last fails pipeline going to that type of ministry where you know I could maybe possibly get a per diem role at various\nHospitals and balance that with my ministry at whatever parish Manhattan you know hopefully still St James but again nowadays one never knows [noise]\nUm so yeah it's it's something that\nEverything has been so all encompassing since I've gotten ordained I'm smart enough to realize I don't want to do too much too fast but again I I I Want to prepare for the future and I know that that's being involved in working for God is definitely the path that I had laid out for me\nThat path is one that you certainly have completed bring your to the accident and the brand new path begins toward\nA that ministry and all those years maybe a little a backtrack a little bit and I always have in particular sense of maybe there's someone listening to the program who might uh\nBalance that with my ministry at whatever parish Manhattan you know hopefully still St James but again nowadays one never knows [noise] um so yeah it's it's something that\nEverything has been so all encompassing since I've gotten ordained I'm smart enough to realize I don't want to do too much too fast but again I I I Want to prepare for the future and I know that that's\nBeing involved in working for God is definitely the path that I had laid out for me that path\nAnd it's one that you certainly have completed bring you to be accurate and a brand new path begins a that ministry and all those years maybe ... backtrack a little bit and I always have in particular sense of maybe there's someone listening to the program\nWho might or maybe I have an inkling of of a ... for learning more about it or what should a person do let's say you know something I like to learn more about that yeah\nWell it's interesting that you should ask 'em father right because they've just put together a program spearheaded by deacon Templeton who's the chapel at St Vincent's hospital and he's in charge of membership and finding new recruits that might be interested in the program\nAnd they're offering a couple of sessions but unfortunately has scraping me what the locations are\nBut if you go on to the diet seats the Bridgeport website there it's a top down for the ... and all the basic information is there um the goal is to start a new class of deacons every year\nObviously the number of participants will very you know because it is it's a it's a very in depth program and\nAlthough you discern on it and your heart might be one hundred percent there it takes your spouse and if you have any children everyone has to be on the same page as a major undertaking and once you start at you obviously want to complete it um but it's something that\nI Will be speaking about prospective\nStudents and and I'll tell them and this is from the heart that there might have been some nervous trepidation when I started the program and trying to balance your job with all the homework\nAnd you know I've taken tests like\nKingly talk to my kids and said I had to write a term paper it was the first one I had written since I use a typewriter and they're like little dad what's a typewriter I might never either by you know graduating college in the early eighties things have changed but it brought me back to my college time you know a lot of fun [laughter]\nI shouldn't say that but you know or I'm going it was a very demanding schedule that are\nObviously prepared for ... prepared me for a you know my current undertaking um but yeah I I'm going to do anything I can because there's a lot of gentleman out there that expressed initial interest and they have to weigh if it's right for them or not but uh\nThe rewards are incalculable I you know I I Can't I Can't say enough about\nBeing able to serve\nAt a Catholic Mass and be a part of a parish I'm off I'll find some gentleman that are worthy and want to do it that's for sure [laughter] I Know that\nThere is the meat quality to the discernment process death but what ... what\nMight be able to share in regard to\nSay what what area do you really have to ...\nObviously prepared for ... prepared me for a you know my current undertaking um but yeah I I'm going to do anything I can because there's a lot of gentleman out there that expressed initial interest and they have to weigh if it's right for them or not but uh\nThe rewards are incalculable I you know like I Can't I Can't say enough about\nBeing able to serve\nAt a Catholic Mass and be a part of a parish I'm off I'll find some gentleman that are worthy and want to do it that's for sure [laughter] I Know that\nThere is the meat quality to that discernment process death but what ... what might be able to share in regard to say\nWhat what area do you really have to weigh as far as saying am I in my own spiritual life obviously I'm interested enough to be involved in in church but maybe I'm Better off just doing what I Do in a parish ah rather than to go after actually become ordained\nAs deacon now without a doubt I mean like you know sure and uh [noise]\nThe first thing I'll tell 'em a prospect her anyone that shows initial interest is it's important and I was told the same thing as to prey on it\nBecause you know everyone no matter how involved we are in a parish we go through spiritual dark periods and everyone you know as much as you fight it you go to a couple of days maybe where\nYou know you're you know irked about something and you need to get back to the solid footing and you know\nRealize everything about the cross but uh [noise]\nYou have to deliberate a lot because as I mentioned\nThe class time you know there's some employers that might not be as forgiving about letting one leave a little early to take um particular class [noise]\nUm [noise] most people I've talked to an anyone that I've dealt with they're very you know they're like if you're called to\nYou know being involved and clergy then we're not gonna do anything to block it pass you know I mean it's not like I'm going to play basketball and a three on three tournament on a Wednesday night and I ask if I can leave early [noise] um but you know\nThe people need to talk to their pastor they need to talk to their friends they need to talk about their employer and their kids and then just factor and all of those variables to make that decision on whether or not they're ready to start because once they do start the program again the work is is difficult [noise]\nUm you know you mentioned Dr John Kelly she was my favorite professor and heard there was the ads on just spread rampant throughout the classroom and and the community and uh [noise]\nThere's so much to learn so much you think you are now but when you you know break it down to brass tacks there's just some spirituality I mean you know how many years\nYou know and the Old Testament are we talking about that a lot of time in a lot of different um a lot of different subject matter\nUrine during a as a deacon new deacon coming into the parish and and the church going through when it's going through right now and so many different uh\nVarious but if you are I'm sure if you went through the two thousand years the church existence or some as you made the lives of the St ... so many of them are devoted to reforming the poetry or were farming or helping those who have not getting proper training and all the rest but\nThere's so much to learn so much you think you are now but when you you know break it down to brass tacks there's just some spirituality I mean you know how many years [noise]\nYou know since the Old Testament are we talking about that a lot of time in a lot of different a lot of different subject matter\nAlso urine during a as a deacon new deacon coming into the parish and and the church going through what is going through right now in so many different uh\nVarious but if you are I'm sure if you went through the two thousand years the church existence are always as you made the lives of the St ... so many of them are devoted to reforming the clergy or were farming or helping those who have not getting proper training and all the rest\nBut you come here with with with yourself and your gifts and to me also could be a time of great St Louis presidents um does the notion of the you know crisis a user difficulties or have they what might be\nConsidered a reverse reaction of of giving a a\nKind of a renewed energy healing yourself do\nIn the ministry now it's interesting question and I know people have a different take on it probably but I and everything that's going on now that that actually believe my focus even more in that\n... isn't that power for which the compliment and prayer for someone they love it he says I\nWish above all the rules that to you may prosper and be in heroin even as yours so prosperous that spray oh God we\nWe we come into your presence and we come with the understanding that you are with God and that you are not only concerned about that so\nUh but but you also puts a about physical wellbeing and civil law minister to us and grant to Greece to please the short run city in cheats a snake we pray a man\nSo Johnny's care for here and ah he didn't he didn't you know as she writes this letter to the U.S and India at least two things\nJumps out there as he ... that means the braces had much of a deal one one\nAnd said come with the understanding that you are with God and that you are not only concerned about that so [laughter]\nBut but you also are about ... will be in civil law minister to us and granted to Greece to please put the short run city in Jesus' name we pray a man\nSo Johnny's care for the here and ah he's an attention as she writes this led to turkey and India at least two things\nJumps out of this or he called ... that means the braces him as a deal on one which precious and care for\nThat and when you care and love people your heart goes out to them ... there was a wish there was a\nExpect teach from God that you share for them and that gets put in you know the people around you love you and they treat you as a loved one up and left friends to be loved process uh\nThere was a sense in which should be but it didn't coverages you well he has a wish that he expresses and it comes into ... she says\nI Wish above bone thing it was he sees this as a priority [noise] he has placed is on the\nShip it he's on the stand then it's a\n... expect to each other and to see each other which says above all the things that you may prosper see he wants him to sell it to a scene needed to do well\nAnd then I I like this and be in [noise]\nAnd be in health even as his business prospering so he sees to St Louis demands so and the man's body\nEase a new hearted friend he cares about spirituality and he cares about his coat suck up the stats he deals with the man and the ...\nIt's the proper in fact this is what pastor does the past all the church\nHas to be here for a day so and even if it goes well being of speak to his community this is very important that we understand some children is expressing this type of a\nPassion and this kind of a sign that he's looking out for the man so he is looking out for his physical whether it be now he does\nFor a fact that it's so let's do it which means used to but I didn't ask a cruise ship you tell it as a prescription it's a Christian he's prospering he's going\nAbove and beyond [laughter] he's prosperity\nGetting his soul is with with the things of God he's dying\nUh they sold and\nEven if it goes well being of speak to his community this is very important that we understand some insurance expressing this\nType of a passion and this kind of a sign that he's looking out for the man so he is looking out for his physical away will be now he\nDoes for a fact that has so let's do it which means used to but I didn't ask for ... years till it as a crisp and as a Christian he's prosper and he is going\nAbove and beyond [laughter] he's prospering\nAre getting so ... is with with the things of God the kids with the grace of God and he presses settled in his piece that goes\nA a a demonstration of being honest to God\nAnd an exemplary way is not being hidden that doesn't have but he's not\nBeing tossed doesn't want to confuse the he is he's pressing on the up what way this this is unique and and this is what all Christians should a spy it to we we should all the spice to chew off to not be back with with with the\nUh circumstances but a second stances should should come to help us cry\nBut he also is expressing concern about the man's hand he says I Want you to\nHealth beat in health would it be that the U.S was a\n... could be that there was physical disease\nCould be that there was a matter of grave a medical concern and
