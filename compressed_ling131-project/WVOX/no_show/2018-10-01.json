not at all since the election and the union and created didn't leftist oriented proudly show working families party and it's just really finally issue not only is that party deciding the Bob in the

where he of course Cuomo very strong on ... on our on not doing very well but number two it is the poll was accurate it shows that have sent me an extended stays on the word family parties on\nShe'll get at least ten percent of the vote and a lot of that vote comes out of Cuomo's democratic hide\nAnd that's going to be tempting to the ... or ... or ... or families party because under the New York state all the parties legally recognized parties and working families is one of them get their place on the ballot based on how many votes they get in the governor's race\nSo they get ten percent of the vote working families party that's four hundred thousand votes or more or less that means they're working families party would be number three row seat\nAndrew Cuomo was filming he'll take it\nBut

them on the line running up their numbers Colombo gets only fifty percent of the state wide voted for they fall if Cynthia Nixon remains on the ballot but if she gets off the ballot\nHe gets fifty six

o'clock here on nobody works good morning how are\nYou good morning Bob how're you doing now another Monday thrown out on Monday and I do Monday and another Monday following all kinds of drama in my goodness we what would you be talking about today\nWell obviously we're going to begin our conversation with the focus on the latest regarding this what I call it the same battle in Washington DC the battle over Brett Kavanaugh's nomination to the Supreme Court you can't write the stuff you just\nYou know I I I've seen this country polarized it was polarized even before the twenty sixteen election but since the twenty sixteen election clearly it's been polarized but I think this\nParticular battle and seeing how everything played out last week has really just divided this country it is amazing to me how people have you know dug in their heels and taking five and um you know this latest investigation now is probably the best thing\nFor both sides only because uh if if Brett Kavanaugh had been confirmed last week\nI think his confirmation and his um time on the on the court would have been always tainted by these allegations at least now there's going to be some investigation to determine if there's any validity to them most people have taken sides\nHaving listened to a doctor Christine glossy forward as well as Brett Kavanaugh but it's it's just so unfortunate that it's all come to this I I've watched and they spent last week at\nAt everything that went down and um again I as I said earlier you just can't write the stuff that just seems that our country is is uh just on a very rocky path right now\nIt is on a ... a very rocky ... unfortunately our senators on both parties they lose credibility every time they open their mouths whatever yeah I'd Granger what's that what are we going to do in the future with such a situation where all the ... the outcome and not the problem now\nI I think you know Bob that is I think the issue and and I just you know and again and watching\nAll the political pundits and I've tried to be fair and and and look at Fox News coverage as well as looking at CNN as well as MSNBC and I haven't been able to take it all and I I totally understand the concerns on both sides with this issue the allegations against Brett Kavanaugh go\nBack to his high school and college years and and some people would say\nBut just on a very rocky path right now\nIt is on a ... very rocky ... unfortunately our senators on both parties they lose credibility every time they open their mouths whatever yeah I agree ... what's that what are we going to do in the future with such a situation where all the chairs the outcome and not the pro now\nI think now Bob that is I think the issue and and I just you know and again and watching all\nThe political pundits and I've tried to be fair and and and look at\nFox News coverage as well as looking at CNN as well as MSNBC and I haven't been able to take it all and I I totally understand the concerns on both sides of this issue the allegations against Brett Kavanaugh go back\nTo his high school and college years and and some people would say oh you can't you know judge a\nPerson when they're Seventeen or Eighteen you know they're not fully adults and then\nOf course you look at the women who had been sexually abused who are making their case neither side is wrong and\nWhat I think the big issue here is the drinking and I think that is probably what the FBI is going to be focused on you know it most of us know that when people drink excessively\nTheir their behavior changes I'm not accusing Brett Kavanaugh of anything but\nWhen a woman is is is sexually assaulted that sticks in the brain you remember that you know exactly where you were when you were for someone who might be drinking or someone who perhaps you know ... is not in full control of themselves\nIf these were Seventeen year old boys quote horsing around in a state of the ... they would not remember\nThat they might have you done this and I think that's the whole thing here I think people are you know taking sides but not realizing that may be both of them are telling their own\nTruth about you know and not Rosen that resonates a great deal we're talking with Janine rose the host of this week we've tribute ... and of course we'll be talking about the comment or a nomination and then there were issues are Janine of due process and when the ... and one of the garden and\nWe're ... what's the moral story what is legal story you didn't say twenty eight who you'd be talking with today about yes I'm\nI'm a welcoming a political analyst Loren so to spray and we haven't talked in quite a while but I Know he's got a you know a take on this and and he can speak to the Clarence Thomas a issue in Nineteen Ninety One Ninety two because he studied all of that and and there are definitely um you know similarities there are\nBig differences but there are similarities as well we're going to look at it you know there's so much to talk about because all\nOf this is going to impact the mid term elections and I think that's really when you talked about you know senators doing a specific things that might not be in the best interest of this country they're all looking at November in regard to this nobody can get beyond the fact\nAll looking at November in regard to that nobody can get beyond the fact that there's such a political play for power in place in Washington and I think that's one of the bigger issues here and I'm hoping Lawrence helps me dissect some of that\nNot an adult it's statistically it's sealed because you are at that age it well you say robbery it's it's I I Know you're where you're going there is a thing called youthful offender yes for your record is seal those wiped out now you can't have that for certain degrees of robbery put your point\nYour point is well taken out and he was asked not there anymore basically so is the person the ... the the purpose of that is to have that person protected by the statute by the law and not have that come up later on now having said that this is one of the top positions in the nation so\nThe da's office or a prosecutor's office whatever the venue is is going to have a record of that somewhere you know even if it's not on your criminal record you always have to remember it's gonna be in police department valuable ... the FBI shouldn't be that should be expunged\nBut if it's if it's a minor violation it should be expunged but going back to these type of ... there's going to be some records somewhere but in this case apparently there was no police report made\nA so you know what that they have to look for I think they have to look at it as\nA Georgetown Prep records which they probably did they probably got that uh that standard practice so um how does this man a skated through everything with this type of behavior it seems unlikely\nIf he was doing that in high school you would think Catholic high school and say hey wait a minute you can't do that you're out of here [noise]\nUm when he's a judge he's a judge for twelve years I think somebody would have detected an odor of alcohol on his breath or some type of behavior you don't seem to have any of that here Bob\nMisses now and that one man I mean to his credit George Bush right and we can problem and that's why they weren't yeah no no I I Know it isn't that concerned that we all are tap eight forty\nA because one my my concern if I were his let's say running his effort to get confirmed it never talk an absolute because they can make a liar out of you wonder if not your intent um but but having said that\nHow at what point do we say what someone did Thirty years ago doesn't matter now\nIt depends on the statute of limitations apparently Maryland has now and the statute of limitations on sexual assault\nAnd not to get too partisan and this but Cory Booker wrote a piece here in ... he admitted sexual assault so why is that okay I mean he is there is no question there that have happened the person who did it admitted it so why isn't he being taken to task and now with Kavanaugh we have\nA he said she said situation and I did find her credible but bill people's mall a memory gets faults\nForty a because what\nMy my concern if I were his let's say running his effort to get confirmed it never talk an absolute because they can make a liar out of you when it's not your intent uh but but having said that\nHow at what point do we say what someone did Thirty years ago doesn't matter now\nWell it depends on the statute of limitations apparently Marilyn has now and the statute of limitations on sexual assault\nAnd not to get too partisan and us but Cory Booker wrote a piece here and he admitted

not the best evidence usually especially one time has passed we\nDidn't want to get your take I think you've been very fair a fair and you are now now you've interrogated people all your life when we I once did you when you walked in here I said I didn't do it just when you have a bearing [noise]\nNow what you've observed these kinds of things your entire life why she credible and what was your uh

I think people need to calm down a little bit\nBut I I agree but I Do want us to do I think it was important it is a union because ... they will come to editors\nI don't think that the evidence you know there was an investigation or anything I I Will say that I Know I personally know people have been accused has wouldn't be alive and I knew they were not believe in one um\nThey were attacked were coming out against the person a part of what I tried to break\nIs coming from offering the sport I watch the entire proceedings right\nI mean one of the things that stuck up to ... of course Senator Feinstein should resign from office pouch he's handled this and I had all this information from the Senate committee for two months when we could have done an investigation and referred it to the FBI\nBut when Dr Ford was asked you offered the opportunity for investigators from our committee\nTo come to you would come to you and interview she was told they told me that it's what we told your turn age so somebody's playing games with this woman\nAnd then she says well I didn't come to Washington because I have a fear of flying\nAnd then it turns out evidence was presented that she flies over the world war\nTwo early so some do miss as they say I Would have joint we're I think I think\nAt the end of the day if we're going to be here\nSenate committee to when we could have done an investigation and refer to the FBI\nDr Ford was asked for the opportunity for investigators from work and ready\nTo go to you what would come to you know an interview you show was told he told me that it's what we told you return somebody's playing games with this woman\nAnd she says well I come to Washington because I have a floor it\nTurns out evidence was presented that shift flaws with the way we're totally so some of this as they say well I Would have joint where\nI think I think at the end of the day if we're going to be here\nUm it should be FBI investigation see because\nIt was but I tell you what happens\nIf there's a smoking gun whatever happens electric it'll happen again but Democrats will not be happy with drug testing\nAnd I respect him for that and I respect those um those those those sergeant would Raymond 'em up and why pay the uh for speaking up at and ... and being this from someone who was there\nBush was a show of force for black law enforcement who said because supposedly comic happened it was ... affecting the police\nAnd these were black officers who said no we don't feel disrespected and we support what he is doing and what do you stand in for because some people say that I think they've been brought up sometimes they are the victims sometimes their family members all the victim and sometimes they do things like that so when they take their uniform off\nThey can be the victim as well and they and they and they and they and they understood that so this is what this was about because people like to change the narrative stuff I was there I covered this a particular a press conference was officers showing black ... black and brown officers showing\nTheir support what he was what the point he was making you know it's\nNot all but a police officer against that I just want to live like this because it\nIs um I mean and we still support them absolutely we we all my cat just like the leaders are they still support cap a day in and recently\nWhen Nike um when Nike to produce the ad with cap and they can and and gave him on the sponsorship contract and and the federation of police came out I'm against Nike um\nVery uniform off\nThey can be the victim as well it may it may it may it may and they understood that so this is what this was about because people like to change the narrative stuff I was there I covered this uh particular a press conference and was officers showing black or black and brown officers showing\nTheir support what he was what the point he was making you know it's not all black police officers were against them but I just want to like him is\nBecause it is um I mean ... and we still support them absolutely we we all my cat just like the research that we still support capitalistic and and recently\nWhen Nike um when Nike to produce the ad with cap and they can and and gave him on the sponsorship contract and and the federation of police came out I'm against Ninety [noise] um but the black\n... black officers um organizations the national black Police Association blacks in law enforcement America\nBlacks and criminal justice we had a different view on it right because out because we understand\nThat in our birth communities that these issues happen even though\nThat that we are in law enforcement we understand these issues happen and it's good that cap and to use his platform\nTo have a conversation because they don't talk to black cops right they don't talk to the black cops that are outspoken like like ... like so like my brother um Edmund Raymond that has a moat Mullen uh\nOh it would rain every day I was going to say my favorite is why they\nThey don't they they don't talk to us you know be so you know it's good for him to bring a national conversation

maze and they're just chasing the cheese\nRight but the officers that speak up understand that they are in the maze did not just chasing the cheese\nAnd when I say chasing the cheese they're chasing the overtime they chase him to be promoted they're chasing to to be part of an institution that um since ... since the creation of police have been oppressive to black people I'm ... and we have to have that discussion\nAnd I and and I put a brother brother Raymond because you know he has been on the forefront I'm even exposing the NYPD even exposing the NYPD for the uh for the ticket quotas\nYou know and ... and I think this is just retaliation against him\nYou know because he's a good officer\nHe's he's he's just outspoken what that's what happens when you're outspoken and you're in law enforcement you become a target your family becomes a target\nSo ... and someone who knows about being a target um surf ago they actually showed up in his show his support and he doesn't come through the five boroughs one\nGuy do look I'm going to do with a\nGuy who still banned because it was that important right there and they represent and he can definitely speak on is that kind of

capital of your have had a good weekend for the news in Washington is going to be very significant by the end of the week with a completion presumably if the FBI reporting here in New York\nWhile there's not an exciting election when could easily say going on and there are a lot of focus and there is a lot of focus on the working families party which is expected to decide this week on whether or not it's going to dump or make a strategic move and getting rid of Cynthia Nixon artist ballot and give its nomination assuming I'm\nHe'll take it I'm sure it will to uh Andrew Cuomo and that's especially significant in light of this morning's Sienna college poll laser statewide polls to come out\nAnd if he had a college poll has a relatively weak fifty percent number for Andrew Cuomo in the general election and this is likely voters assuming the polish close to being correct a mirror fifty percent for an incumbent governor but that's the way the full field\nOf a candidates including minority party candidates including Cynthia Nixon\nAnd Nixon gets ten percent of the vote\nNow that may not seem like all that much for the working families party that could be very significant I think four years ago the vote turnout in the general election and maybe hire this time but four years ago I was around four million voters\nOh Avi to say ten percent is four hundred thousand if the working families party under the arcane or maybe maybe not so arcane unique nature of New York's election laws\nIf the working families party got ten percent of the vote and it might even be more than four hundred thousand votes because they may be a bigger return that as we just saw in the\nAction and this is likely voters assuming the poll is close to being correct a mirror fifty percent for an incumbent governor but that's the way the full field of a candidate's including minority party candidates including Cynthia Nixon and Nixon gets ten percent of the vote\nNow that may not seem like all that much for the working families party that could be very significant I think four years ago the vote turnout in a general election and maybe hire this time but four years ago it was around four million voters\nWell obviously ten percent is four hundred thousand if the working families party under the arcane or may maybe not so arcane but unique nature of New York's election laws\nIf the working families party got ten percent of the vote and it might even be more than four hundred thousand votes because they may be a bigger turnout as resist on the Democratic primary then there was four years ago so working families party got four hundred thousand votes it would be catapulted to line see on the ballot\nUm the Trump Administration last night an ounce a tentative deal with Canada for a new NAFTA agreement\nThey already reached a deal with Mexico it sounds like a very good thing I mean the idea is that the America rich nation of United States has been subsidizing\nCountries around the world for a long long time that there are a lot of unfair trade practices Bill Clinton used to talk about it for rock Obama needs to talk about it unfair trade practices even Andrew Cuomo\nTried to get Guam onto the act several months ago by claiming a candidate was being unfair to to some of the newer goods well obviously candidate is but in particular\nCandidate has been very unfair I mean they're protecting their own farmers protecting their own political butts to be precise about it because those farmers especially in fact have a lot of political power\nBut our American and New York in particular dairy farmers have been being shafted by the Canadians for a long long time and apparently this deal and you read a preliminary description of it a lot of the details and not get out there\nApparently this deal does provide an opening a year reduction in Paris of the Canadian market's\nMarket the borders for American dairy products I in New York dairy farmers were going to benefit has anybody heard the word from Andrew Cuomo\nOver the weeks and months about the unfair dairy tariffs\nThat Canada has imposed and how he supports\nPutting aside differences our support the Trump administration's efforts to improve the trade climate so American there in New York and American dairy farmers can benefit obviously that's a rhetorical question but then you've already heard this from this character Richard Ball who supposed to be the New York state\nDeal and you read a preliminary description of it a lot of the details and not get out there apparently this deal does provide an opening a year reduction in Paris of the Canadian market's\nMarket the borders for American dairy products I in New York dairy farmers are going to benefit has anybody heard the word from Andrew Cuomo\nOver the weeks and months about the unfair dairy tariffs\nThat Canada has imposed and how he supports\nPutting aside differences our support the Trump administration's efforts to improve the trade climate so American then New York and American dairy farmers can benefit obviously that's a rhetorical question\nBut then you've already heard this from this character Richard ... who supposed to be the New York state agriculture commissioner but never says her word publicly about the dying New York farms and the hostile treatment of farms bother Cuomo than straight and obviously again no not a word\nHow about other New York political figures Schumer Chuck Schumer he travels around the casually visits every county to his credit once a year goes to dairy farms has here ... brand anybody else said anything about how it's good that the Trump Administration is trying to help\nThe dairy industry obviously not but it doesn't have to be that way it's just an example of hypocrisy that's out there and otherwise just on that now before I get back to the poll I got a really um poignant payoff insanity poignant knows but I got to really yeah they are usually point you know very very sad\nFor a much John ... of Washington County dairy farmer and he's written me and I read is a emails over the years about issues affecting dairy farms concerns and\nOther things about the business in uh upstate New York the difficulties of it but he wrote they listen to this it was just dairy farmer I don't know what's going to happen to them I wrote him a note asking him when he was going to do he hasn't answered me and he writes made the American dairy industry is in total meltdown\nVery farming is big business in New York and many dairy farmers are trying to get out\nMost farmers own money on their dairy cows in cannot sell them without permission from the bank two years ago the cows were Fifteen hundreds of two thousand dollars per animal\nBut they are worse ... worth less than half that amount today some farmers will just walk away and leave the farm to the bank\nMany of these farmers out a lot of money to their suppliers and they're dead he's on secured\nLowering the cost of doing business in New York is not going to help the local dairy industry very farming is going to be done in New England and New York within a few years they used to be thousands of dairy farms in Massachusetts but now there are only one hundred and thirty four and they and they are in trouble\nThat's where my John that's a dairy farmer I guess most of his life it's not all his life and that's a\nLifestyle that gets passed on father to son and don't think that sex and so I don't think there are too many women running large dairy farms but if there are and they got them from their dads your mom is okay and then their moms and dads but it's generally\nSons who is a dairy farms are going to continue take it on and unless you're out west and then or maybe down south in some places where you have big corporate farming going on and then it's neither fall farther north on\nFoot thick factory type operations which so far we haven't had really in New York but it's a very sad situation here right here anybody Andrew Cuomo talk about this anybody ever see Andrew Cuomo visited a dairy farm spend a few hours talking to the farmers and answering questions from the press this goes on in other states all the time\nHad been visiting a manufacturing\n[noise] lifestyle that gets passed on father to son and don't think that sex and so I don't think there are too many women running large dairy farms but if there are and they got them from their dad or mom is okay and then their moms and dads but it's generally\nSons who is a very farms are going to continue taking on unless you're out west and then or maybe down south in some places where you have big corporate farming going on and it's not that far farther north on\nFoot thick factory type operations which so far we haven't had really in New York but it's a very sad situation here right here at anybody Andrew Cuomo talk about this anybody ever see Andrew Cuomo visited a dairy farm spend a few hours talking to the farmers and answering questions from the press this goes on in other states all the time\nI've been visiting a manufacturing\nCenter a factory talk to people maybe solar city out in Buffalo how 'bout that buffalo billion you must cars in big trouble right what does that say about the operations in solar city was going to produce more solar panels that any other factor in the world right back to that\nFree seven hundred and fifty million dollars of our money that could have gone to tax reductions or fixing roads so many other things tax reduction is of course would bring in more business would encourage businesses come and people\nBut in New York politicians have demonized businesses to such a degree that is just the jets the private sector ought to get tax reductions you've got this um huge cars out there screaming give away to the rich\nWho provides the jobs to the people that provide the taxes that keep all these programs going it's not the government\nAnd she of them have enough time to uh wanted to go back to the poll just a couple of observations from the poll\nCuomo winds up with this lowest up um or I should say is highest\nJob disapproval number that he's ever had in the ... college poll of likely voters as I mentioned it has a criminal leading a bow and arrow Fifteen to twenty eight and a six person feels with Cynthia Nixon getting a ten percent\nOther minor party can they can and virtually nothing I hear from um\nThe Libertarian Party candidate Larry sharks are supporters all the time for Larry on the show for Larry on the show while he was on one\nUh I haven't heard from Larry in self recently but he has no chance of getting like two percent of the voters this ridiculous or Green Party candidate ... ... what is you get four percent two percent and I think it gets four percent\nUm and then in the other statewide Gillette branch around saying Shelley ... nobody knows who she is sixty one to twenty nine tons and apple you\nKnow are traveling saying ah Jonathan trick their fifty eight to twenty six percent of the race for controller [noise] excuse me attorney general is closer to shame to Democrats leading Keith whopper fifty to thirty six percent that's interesting but there's no reason to think that offered um\nWho's not well known and and um to change is not known statewide no reason to think that was offered a chance of defeating a um\nTo shame because all the calling the money's going to be flowing to the ticket\nOr let me just see if there was and there were some other highlights Cuomo ... a leading in New York City sixty one is twenty four points I'm In New York city excuse me in the suburbs out say voters closely divided thirty eight percent supporting Cuomo thirty six percent mount airy mowing aerobics\nTrounce saying ah Jonathan trick their fifty eight to twenty six percent of the race for controller [noise] excuse me attorney general is closer to shame to Democrats leading Keith whopper fifty to thirty six percent that's interesting but there's no reason to think that\nWas offered um who's not well known and and um to change is not known statewide no reason to think that was offered a chance of defeating a um to shame because all the calling the money's going to be flowing to the ticket\nOr let me just see if there was and there were some other highlights Cuomo ... a leading in New York City sixty wants to twenty four points\nI'm In New York city excuse me in the suburbs out say voters closely divided thirty eight percent supporting Cuomo thirty six percent mount airy mowing arrow excuse me\nIn the city a coma is even much greater gender gap Cuomo leads amongst men by twelve points and thirty one points among swimming\nAnd\nSome of the other breakdown well let me go to the editorial on and so it was a very good one there's nothing that's positive for the Republicans in the fall and the idea that a\n... mile an arrow won't endorse Brett Kavanaugh Kavanaugh in the battle battle that's dividing the nation and uh it has so much to do with fairness as well for so many people we Brits Kevin having this stellar record as a judge\nA prominent attorney as a Republican frankly as a father as a\nAs a husband I mean the whole issue is over his behavior one incident in high school which is contested and not corroborated and he may have been a drinker for a while in college\nAnd that's what the Democrats are hanging their hat on and mark Mulligan arrow still owns savory stands he usually some are really mild statement about what both both he and the doctor for a make a compelling cases coverage\nLots of courage to write this is from the Glenn ... post star I give them credit for being\nA good voice especially for upstate there and on his voice I think I don't think there is sophisticated when it comes to understanding New York city politics as they should be but then again there up in control so maybe they can be forgiven for that editorial titled New York has problems the weather isn't one of them\nOh boy only a couple of minutes remaining ... believes the sun and signed on Miami Beach has New Yorker New Yorkers packing their bags he says upstate or want more than sunshine he believes they may want to fish\nHe ... he mostly believes it is not because New York's economies are burned and the governor is convinced happy days are here again and his his ministry ... just the reason\nBut he didn't interact vote that's out there\nYeah I'm an education and I wouldn't call it a protest vote and she just there yeah so he's not even match human that Saddam and then maybe you shouldn't be next shy shutdown that that that off\nI don't know I'm Wondering who and and that translates into the ... you know move in families and found that line I'm going to think so I'm\nThinking what it means for the working families party is they consider the opportunism of what Cuomo can offer them and versus the possibility that they got ten percent of the vote which I was pointing out before you joined us would be at least four hundred thousand votes which would make them roast the they knocked the conservative party off\nRoad city and that kind of be tempting to them I Would think\nIntentional Sharon\nHow are you going to say about it in a in a one on one according to the polls loan arrow picks up ten percent he goes up I think the thirty eight percent which shows the impact of getting Cynthia Nixon added there and Cuomo picks up six percent I'm sure those six points come out of Cynthia Nixon's\nTen but it looked like four of Nixon's ten went to mowing their lawn arrow against corner\nWell he's not the most popular guy and you know and then next thing we're going to be [noise] right [noise] I'm surprised by that um [noise]\nBut right before you joined us I also mentioned that there was a certain irony here that the conservative party today my long put out a state wide or announced the statewide radio by and they put out a script for the radio buying that script\nHas the conservative party strong and supporting Donald Trump in ... and what Trump does for New York\nIs a conservative party is backing a bow and arrow who did not vote for Trump who won't endorsed Trump and late last week said he won't he won't he doesn't support Brett Kavanaugh he won't take up position on the confirmation of Brett Kavanaugh I mean how does one ever expect to get any ... any excitement whatsoever amongst his Republican base with positions like that\nWell I don't think he's a serious candidate they come from the I think you should go into the emotions\nWell he's enjoying the celebrity nature of it I Would think and he is a fronting for many of the protect the people who are involved in the race\nAnd I'm actually in my view that's basically what I'm doing is just under ... you know I'm Wondering I'm [noise] not related to campaign you know you can buy incident and share them\nFor so many very high on the payroll\nAnd right now I don't I don't see any effort to\nPosition on the confirmation of Brett Kavanaugh I mean how does one ever expect to get any ... any excitement whatsoever amongst his Republican base where positions like that\nBut I don't think he's a serious candidate to somebody I think you should go on to the emotions\nWell he's enjoying the celebrity nature of it I Would think and he is a fronting for many of the ... tacky people who are involved in the race\nAnd I am and I'm actually in my view that's basically what I'm doing is just under any um you know I'm Wondering I'm\nNot going to be ready to campaign you know you can find some nights short term for somebody very high on the payroll\nAnd right now I don't I don't see any cheering shepherd remains in through any kind of ... I\nKnow he's out there and traveling there said he's taken some physicians but he has not been able to land the single meaningful blow it seems to me on a quote our whereas I think John de Francisco the upstate state senator who was hoping Iran I think would have been able to at least do that\nEither way it should come because you issue\nYeah there's no indication whatsoever that a Republican has a chance of winning here in New York in any race or come November notwithstanding the fact that say a\nA a curse in ... and I think has been correctly randomly mocked across the nation for her embarrassing or comments and behavior and the whole Brett Kavanaugh fair and that Chuck Schumer himself has been leading to run but he's not up for election she is\nPrank\nBut let's talk about Kevin ... you know I can imagine how you must feel about it I mean it seems to me both you and I\nWere looking at the very least for just some sort of balance fair consideration but it's anything but where do you make of\nAll that's unfolding including the most recent developments friday with them or Jeff Flake the Republican senator from Arizona forcing the center for his fellow Republicans hand and the president's hand who are our weeklong FBI investigation our Brett Kavanaugh\nFlank his flight ... name I might see if he's from ... in um it's pretty clear to me I mean China right now I'm I'm going to see new show and shoot somebody at at the steps of six I think\nUm [noise] the long term implications of what's going on right now are truly Detroit hospital yeah\nMy only have we have a situation where I'm a guy who has lived in an exemplary in Long Beach\nI'm only when it's on your gone more six previous ... confirmation\nElation investigations side the FBI\nLightly I I'm I'm ... I'm On this guy um [noise] we um [noise]\nLong I mean it's not embed who runs the fine the accusations totally on the co-op ... mind on on the one ... oh man\n[noise] you know an inch and suddenly some even stronger now we can talk forever about how this came to be\nOn social you know I'm just drink Democrats left\n... confirmation\nValuations and investigations side the FBI\nEnlighten me as I I'm ...

I mean just to blame for the moment that confirmed I'm not willing to predict that but just assume for our never say that he gets confirmed [laughter] we have\nAnd I'm\nIn better justifiably so I'll look at me and the Supreme Court justice if you have um\n... rule on facts of this process which used to tell people whom who have lived up to me why shouldn't it and come over qualified on any Sean each much more but\nI'm leaving the rest of their lives should be placed hair all his name I'm understanding and replaced it you know I mean if they miss I'm Tim ... who formed in sharing of St ... my name's shore and I'm from\nFor office you know we constantly complain about the quality of the people in public life for you said well this is how you got to where we are\n[laughter] but oh I had the same as you listened some young and things like that I can recall on Trump's you mentioned the tension unions unwillingness to put his new major when you think he's been traveling which children are\nNot the hypocrisy of it from the Democrats [noise] this is the party of John F. Kennedy of Bill Clinton\nOf Ted Kennedy and so many other high profile Democrats who have been involved in\nYou know a horrifying ugly or sexual encounters another\nA behavior that sort of a representative from here than Democrats it there is is like the slightest war maybe he was drunk in college or\nYou know misbehave with a woman a at a party didn't rape her and I like to apologize if he did what he is alleged to have done it was wrong but he was Fifteen Years old and that is enough to stop someone in the view of these people who champion and celebrate individuals who have done far more far far worse um\nWell I'm ... the word for it but I'm I'm just looking I mean she she knew she didn't seem to be such\nToday and you know either way by the way he left Eliot Spitzer LA's just there but he wasn't a national figure but sure\nWhile he caught a man credit I'm In my mind your point yeah I'm One on\nConcerns me right now is sleep these factors who's going to have on on bringing quality people into public life first of all the second line um the the basic assumptions and we\nHe did what he is alleged to have done it was wrong but he was Fifteen Years old and that is enough to stop someone in their view of these people who champion and celebrate individuals who've done so far we're far far worse um\nWell I'm ... the word for it but um [noise] I'm just wondering 'cause she knew she didn't seem to be searched today\nAnd you know either way by the way he left it splits LA's just there but he wasn't a national figure but sure\nWell he caught a man critical I'm In my mind trying to your point yeah I'm One\nOne concerns me right now is is the biggest factors who's going to have on on bringing quality people in the ... first of all\nThe second one I I'm ... and some ... and we um uh but we use can govern ourselves you know I understand this would be a court of law and I'm using the presumption in his shoe ...\nI'm kind of an acid or something and and that a lot more than the game but there are um\nIn in the common law ...

voted Graham and noted attorney\nAnd author an expert on race class in politics we are talking right now about of course the new FBI investigation regarding the Supreme Court nomination of a just a judge Brett Kavanaugh\nA Lawrence before the break we were getting into some of the nitty gritty but let's focus a little bit specifically on the investigation even President Trump said\nThe new FBI investigation could be a blessing in disguise the president didn't want it\nHappened or didn't want it but if it clears Kavanaugh was named that of course could only be a good thing but what if it doesn't what if the FBI determined that having a lot was an excessive drinker in high school and college\nThat he lied to the Judiciary Committee regarding the term than it's yearbook and what they actually meant and what he took part in will that automatically disqualify him as a justice of the Supreme Court\n[noise] well I don't know that will automatically qualify and that was the question is not enough people will have to go in with a with a with a new style of a doubt the problem is that many people have pointed out it's really a job promotion ... with\nThat we're in hand recruit ... ... a club that could be considered for was not we're going to vigil or the one of the Reagan squad cars from this\nKavanaugh was named that of course could only be a good thing but what if it doesn't what if the FBI determines that\nHaving a lot was an excessive drinker in high school and college that he lied to the Judiciary Committee regarding the terms and is your book and what they actually meant and what he took part in well that automatically disqualify him as a justice of the Supreme Court\n[noise] well I don't know that will automatically disqualified image for sure it is the question is not in his or people say well one has to be proven with a with a a little subtle the out of the problem is that just as many people have pointed out it's really a job promotion if there are many more people on the shortlist\nThat we're in hand to president ... I'm from that could be considered for this\nOne's not look at some of those individuals I think one of the reasons why President Trump is so steadfastly holding on to um I'm Brett Kavanaugh as the candidate is because he's one of those who is it specifically said\nThat the president's powers or a clue in the sense that a president standing president could not being guided\nThat some things that would be good news for President Trump wearing looking at this rush from court for pro again well start oh goodness sake if he was indicted then then I'm the only people that could say you can would be the Supreme Court\nYou know I'm just as that goes on that he's got someone on his side in but having all that is the thing that's going to say who come for any kind of Lawrence the FBI lying under oath certainly disqualifies him\nFrom any kind of the the ... not just the Supreme Court for the federal church\nYeah and listening to senator Coons and I'm ... and Senator Flake over the weekend they did on one of the Sunday Morning shows to talk about the\nIf they determined that he was lying in other words when he was asked about terms like what is the devil's triangle means you know what is a boosting and other other things that we're not going to get into but you know he tried to play them off and it's just the antics and and and you know the uh\nThe behavior of you know high school kids may be in college kids who didn't know better but there might be a deeper meaning they're correct\nCertainly there's a deeper meaning and the thing about it is that they were to find that these things were to be ... ... people were presuming them more than what the first thing that I was ... certainly should dismiss him as being considered what people are waiting for is\nOur actual MCI um investigations actually take place\nWe ... we assume that once it was ... what was once it was requested by the president on friday that it would take place people found it very strange\nThat the FBI do rock contacted 'em Dr Ford or or um or going for at least one of the other women who have come forth with allegations against the\nYeah the attorney for Deborah Ramirez who in the individual who said that there were drinking parties that email where people were gang raped she mentioned that she had been gang raped I Do not believe that she said capital was involved in that but that he went there\nAnd that was part of this kind of um a million were atmosphere at yeah that is that it you know that would that it was concerning and reportedly the attorney for Deborah Ramirez says that she has been contacted by the FBI that the third individual us Julie sweating it\nOr has not been called but her own credibility has been attacked she is the woman who's a you know being a represented\nA by the attorney or ... and\nWhat I mean sure her credibility to cross from just a cause for turning out to be some one of the house has local um ambitions or to be questioned because of the stock\nSue in the individual who said that there were drinking parties that yeah where people were gang raped she mentioned that she had been gang raped I Do not believe that she said capital was involved in that but that he went there\nAnd that was part of this kind of um\nA million were atmosphere at yeah that is that it you know that would that it was concerning and reportedly the attorney for Deborah Ramirez says that she has been contacted by the FBI that the third individual us Julie sweating it\nAh has not been called but her own credibility has been attacked she is the woman who's a you know being a represented a by the attorney or ... and what\nI mean sure her credibility to cross from just a cause for turning out to be someone ... um ambitions or to be questioned because of the stock\nIs nothing in her facts that should be the our question because she's the providing those witnesses to offer but on the issue is that there was a ... very important witness that should have been called the sibling and that was mark you're\nSomeone who's written a very specifically an as an as as the Koreas for someone who was very close to ... law is very close friend and he was busy hiding out or ... and the only thing we got from him with a letter\nAnd my feeling is if judge Kavanaugh's knew he was innocent then why didn't you know as close for everyone was asking to come forth and speak an unjustified but they didn't want that\nAnd also there's a his college roommate at a gentleman by the name of child lending ten did come out this weekend not to the FBI and I don't believe he's in scope of the FBI investigation but he said that Kavanaugh was a bigger drinker then he'd to pick some south and when he got drunk he was often belligerent and aggressive\nAnd the one thing I have to ask you Lawrence and and I'm certainly not a drinker myself and I'm not trying to um you know cast aspersions on anyone who drinks but\nHidden away judge Kavanaugh presented his own drinking before the Judiciary Committee and kept saying I like beer I drink beer et cetera\nCan that be a potential red flag in regard to nominating him as a justice of the Supreme Court we don't know whether he has a drinking problem that has not been established but given what he was saying about his drinking patterns should there be concern um you know by the the senators\nIn regard to is this someone who is\nAn individual we do want to see on the court\nWell certainly something that people should discuss it costs to them because I learned about because it's perfectly fine for him to the knowledge yes\nI have a problem in high school at ... college in my early twenties but that is no longer an issue now the problem is that he will knowledge but that passes the Christmas at all was what's wonder okay well you're lying about it then because all acknowledge it now what goes on\nWith the drinking now um has it ever going to a problem but if he just protests as though it was ... and everything that people are saying roommate college friends know these women that have gone on television of course I'm sort of school to be friends of his who still loves it he ... to ... an excess of blocking out\nUm but he was a floppy drunk and they quote the Washington Post and you know it and told workers were not people were hiding in the in the background [laughter]\nBut no drinking now um has it ever going to a problem but at this protest has ever an issue and everything that he or thank roommate college friends know these women that are going on television who I'm going to be friends of his who loves it he went to X. X. block now\nAnd that he was a floppy drunk and they went on with the Washington Post and you know and they work or not people were hiding in the in the background [laughter]\nAs you may know also an attorney and have had a lot of experience with people who were victims and people who've been accused of a fully some times of\nOf these kind of a fence\nAnd I'm very troubled by not not only the process by how this happened but by the testimony of that support herself\nI you know I tried to pride myself on being\nA rooster from the attorney shot and for me anyway\nUh the law is the window of the survey say except for people who is psychotic and that's why lie detector tests are not really valuable in many ways but\nI was really troubled by some of her testimony that she could she was apparently unaware of the world for the Senate committee to come to see her and her testify at her home she said she was never told of the offer\nAnd then when they ask for ... come to ash and she says well I'm afraid of flying\nBut then the record revealed she flies over the world\nSo troubled by that ad her voice and demeanor was not convincing to me\nWell I don't I don't know if she's white lying about what occurred maybe something did happen to her and she believes you know heart which is why she would also pass a lie detector test that she actually believe it was Mr Cavanaugh\nI don't know what's your courage here what would I Do know is that several of the things we're talking about with Mr Kavanaugh incredibly we did kill us things when you look at this gentleman's\nThirty or more you professional career when he was Seventeen or something in high school so I understand the Democrats delayed dish to the last minute\nSome demeanor was not convincing to me\nWell I don't I don't know if she is white lie about what occurred maybe something did happen to her and shame heart which is why I should also pass alive you factor test\nThat she actually believe it was Mr Cavanaugh I don't know what's your courage here what would I Do know is that some of the things we're talking about with Mr Kavanaugh incredibly we kill us things when you look at this gentleman's\nThirty or more special career when he was Seventeen or something in high school\nSo I understand with Democrats delayed the age limit for political reasons I understand that\nBut having a lot of issues or mental accused falsely\nWake up cash or the Dallas Cowboys was falsely accused and many others hope wish to grow when all those cutting edge or making them much of the last ... the accuser\nWe need to get that do I\nYeah I learned a your take on that I go ahead I'll let you go ahead Martin\nLong well thanks for the car called pushing the ledger you know how close and I appreciate is common in question but I don't I don't I ... I always believe the accuser\n... I was gonna say I don't either and and but and not only that I think\nI'm a person's professional career is irrelevant when it comes to accusations I mean one can be extremely successful as as an attorney or as an investment banker or whatever their career might happen to be\nAnd not having anything to do with what their personal life is outside their their drinking their um you know their treatment towards women I mean there's nothing that that that I feel why one is mutually exclusive\nAnd I'm sure but just as many cases as you can present of of people that have made false claims false allegations\nI can you know there's there's as we as we know so many cases go unreported there would be three to five times more of those where there were allegations that actually have them come forth of rapes are tempted rapes of taking place so\nAnd I used to so nothing frankly in um Dr Ford demeanor that suggested that she was lying in anything\nI mean the the person who's least likely to um to embrace or a um agree with her demeanor would have been President Trump and even he said that she was credible so I actually come out on a different item appreciate the caller's comments but I actually disagree with some\nYeah Lawrence is what I said earlier you know as of last week it was definitely a he said she said\nAnd it seemed to break down pretty much a long political line that people believed um although you know all the political pundit from this weekend both and not only CNN and Fox and MSNBC but\nOn the morning shows I crossed the networks and and there are a lot of people even Republicans who did say she has a credible witness I Believe that if something happened to her the big question is whether or not it would catch Kavanaugh\nWho did or didn't and when you're talking about something that happened done more than Thirty years ago memories are going to be weak on both sides of the\nA lot of this we have to learn a little further and I want to ask you again we'll talk about how it plays out come November ... as well as long\nSo I actually cut out a different item appreciate the caller's comment but I actually just a great with\n... what I said earlier you know ... adds up last week it was definitely a he said she said\nAnd it seemed to break down pretty much a long political lines that people believed um although you know all the political pundits from this weekend both not only CNN and Fox than MSNBC but\nOn the the morning shows across the networks and and there are a lot of people even Republicans who did say she has a credible witness I Believe that something happened to her the big question is whether or not it with judge Kavanaugh\nWho did or didn't and when you're talking about something that happened done more than Thirty years ago\nMemories are going to be weak on both sides of the\nA lot of that we have to learn a little further and I wanted to ask you again we'll talk about how it plays out\nCome November sex as well as long term in this country\nAnd will be the changes so that something like that can be prevented from happening again there are no easy answers here that much we know\nBut Lawrence so it's ... it's helping a kind of get through the ... so to speak um at this point and we've got lots more to talk about with him with me with Janine rather continues right after a very short break with ...

I'm not I I'm not um [noise]\nScolding you [noise] but uh this is part of the stigma that we're trying to change you just said to me is similar to commit suicide we're trying to change that language that they're committed committing suicide\nAnd you get to a point where you just feel as if your life is worthless\nAs that you don't mean anything to anybody or you'll never make a significant\nAh significance in the world he won't be significant to anybody and when you're thinking though that way and you you feel that pain um you just wanted to add mhm so that is one way to make it in for sure is to\nTake your life [noise] um and and ... I'm not I I'm not um [noise]\nScolding you [noise] but uh this is part of the stigma that we're trying to change you just said to me is similar to commit suicide we're trying to change that language\nThat they're committed committing suicide it makes it sound like it's a crime and that makes it sound like it's less than\nYou know you're a lesser person that you've done something wrong and and that's not true leader so we're trying to do is get away from commit ... died by suicide or they took their life\nOr something in like that because you wouldn't say somebody committed cancer who dies from from cancer for you know um you commit homicide you don't commit suicide and so really strongly trying to to to get\nThat language away\nFrom the mainstream and the media ... and ... and believe me it's everywhere at because it's been around for for forever because he ... the history of it ... suicide was a crime in back in the Eighteen hundreds I think even in this country it was a crime if you took your life [noise] um\nSo that's part of the stigma we're trying to break through but the good news is the stigma is is lifting its its opening up a start people are starting to become aware more and more people\nAre starting to accept what's going on because it's their loved ones is that affecting now\nIt's their loved ones it's their children it's their uncles and aunts and brothers and spouses and everybody and it's the ripple effects would I called the ripple effect years ago is just that the one that\nCan end up affecting a hundred thousand people and that's just [noise] nature\nKnow uh and and and I appreciate the the uh\nThe terminology or that should be used in in in discussing this as well and that's something a mail carrier with me as as as I Move forward

suicide prevention or at the Hudson Valley Westchester chapter a part of a national organization\nOr we've talked about stigma and you've said that the stigma is rising a little bit for people to really get more engaged [noise] I Would think and again correct me if I'm wrong one of the biggest obstacles that you and your fellow board members and volunteers in Westchester County in Hudson Valley has to deal with the denial\nThat some people might think that that they're never going to be touched by suicide by either a family member or a colleague I at work how do you also chip away as you've chipped away at the stigma how do you chip away of denial as well\nA ... it's very hard that's that's typical that's that's really difficult and um [noise] uh you know some people just don't accept it and uh\nSome people like you said some people just feel they'll never be affected and you know what there's really nothing we can do about that and we can't change their minds and hearts or you know and and if that's what they're going to believe that's what they're going to\nFor people to really get more engaged I Would think and again correct me if I'm wrong one of the biggest obstacles that you and your fellow board members and volunteers in Westchester County in Hudson Valley have to deal with the denial\nThat some people might think that that they're never going to be

don't want to get involved in anything or you know\nThat that's fine but I I think you're talking about people in the ... is correct me if I'm wrong in denial that have experienced something but they don't want to talk about it yeah [noise]\nUm that happened we deal with that we deal with a residence in\nWestchester or some in Connecticut are and they're\nMostly I mostly see it when a child takes their life and the parents are just so destroyed and they just can't talk and they just don't want to talk\nAbout it and they don't want to talk to anybody about it and um [noise]\nThat's understandable to a more ... most of the time eventually they do come around\n'em as time you know time heals all wounds sure and not that it they will materials from this but they start to accept it and understand and and that that's the whole thing about us we can ... people\nTheir support groups to educate people you know that yeah it ... the main thing of denial was killed some people feel guilty they feel it's their fault\nThat that person took their life and there's nothing father from the truth you know again it's not your fault you didn't you didn't harm them okay they did this or an and they did it themselves and they chose to do it for whatever reason they chose to do it\nAnd so it's nobody's fault so\n... and and I have a very good friend of mine and she lost her child\nTo

guest today is Rick Alan ...\nWho is calling in from Phoenix in ... is a cult expert and also a cult deep program a\nWeek I one of the reasons why I ask you to be on the show today um besides talking about culture in general is the parallel between certain aspects of the Trump movement and\nKoch now that isn't the paint a broad brush meant to say that everybody who supports Trump\nIs a whole worshiper with you and I both know it's not the case and you also a registered Republican so you know that I don't want to imply by a guide us through it guided through the parallels\nOkay the parallels are are interesting and then we'd have to do with the with something called cognitive dissonance which is when someone sees\nAn experience for this or you know they become ... they're confronted with information that it that that directly contradicts what they believe\nThat there can be a spin provided by the leader of the group and then the group itself reinforces fit through a kind of environment control or above all around the group\nAnd there is no other frame of reference and the person ex saps whatever spin is given a I have I have seen a what I consider a very unsettling cognitive dissonance\nThat is going on with many people that support Donald Trump\nThat is that when they see a news coverage when they come across facts\nThat this confirms what President Trump says ah that contradict what they wish to believe about him they go into a kind of\nA spin that is provided by a President Trump and also perpetuated by a kind of media bubble a combination of a\nA social media website\nA broadcast that reinforce whatever the spin is from the top and in this way people can knock believe what they see not believe ah the news reports even from established news sources like Associated Press Reuters\nWho have no skin and the getting politically at all\nAnd uh and just simply go with the spin that is provided that is very similar to a destructive called in the sense that there is a kind of information control there is a kind of bubble or cocoon around the people\nAnd we see this even though we live in the information age where there is just incredible flow of information\nThrough the through the Web through the net and yet with all that\nFor whatever the spin is from the top and in this way people can knock believe what they see not believe ah the news reports even from established news sources like Associated Press Reuters\nWho have no skin and the getting politically at all\nAnd uh and just simply go with the spin that has provided that is very similar to a destructive called in the sense that there is a kind of information control there is a kind of bubble or cocoon around the people\nAnd we see this even though we live in the information age where there is just incredible flow of information\nThrough the through the Web through the net\nAnd yet with all that information people can choose to very selectively uh relegate their little a kind of bubble populated by their friends on Facebook following certain people on Twitter\nWatching their kind of alternate reality on YouTube\nAnd through various websites\nAnd they can choose a television network if if their to their rights Fox if there to the left MSNBC or and they can kind of cocoon themselves and create a kind of false\nWhat we would call social proof that no matter what their rights and uh that is very unsettling aspect of colds and it's something that you can see\nTo some extent with the kind of personality driven and and self confirming nature of of of the Trump phenomenon\nHow how do we see that in terms of the cabinet nominations because they think that\nThat was floating around that says forty liters forty forty five percent of of evangelicals say that they would support Kavanaugh even if the accusations was true now\nYeah there there was a mirror pole and it was forty eight percent of white evangelicals would support judge Kavanaugh regardless of whether the allegations are true uh and that is it's it's it's just kinda disconcerting to see it that\nI mean particularly from people who I'm really really have repeatedly said that what they are all about his family values\n... so where does that road lead us\nWell I mean the good news is that we vote and so unlike Jones town unlike a a neck see 'em a lead by Keith for in the area or some other totalitarian a cult\nOr we can vote to change things are and so people who didn't vote in the last election cycle I say to them shut up don't complain and people who are maybe a voted for someone that didn't even have a chance of winning\nIn a state like maybe Michigan or Wisconsin or Pennsylvania\nI say to them wow you're really blew it or if you thought that you are if you now feel like you're uncomfortable with Donald Trump\nSo we have a self correcting a kind of situation that we can go through where we can vote and we can change things in the next election cycle and then the next two cycles completely changed the government that is something called members cannot do\nYou can vote to change things are and so people who didn't vote in the last election cycle I say to them shut up don't complain and people who are maybe a voted for someone that didn't even have a chance of winning\nIn a state like maybe Michigan or Wisconsin or Pennsylvania\nI said to them wow you're really blew it or if you thought that you are if you now feel like you're uncomfortable with Donald Trump\nSo we have a self correcting a kind of situation that we can go through where we can vote and we can change things in the next election cycle\nAnd then the next two cycles completely changed the government that is something called members cannot do they can only vote with their feet they leave the group or if they don't like it because we group is totalitarian and there is no voting\nNow in terms of of what is the personality profile of someone who is involved in that kind of group think\nHit somebody out there had a family member who is involved with the cult what can be done to rescue the\nWell I think the best thing you can do is educate yourself and that's why the database called education dot com exists\nAnd that's why I wrote the book called inside out how people get and can get out which is kind of a ... or a manual if you will or that includes chapters on assessment coping strategies preparation for an intervention intervention\nAnd then there's a chapter on defining a destructive called and explaining cold what is called coal brainwashing and just so your listeners understand when\nWhen the war expert is used I think sometimes it can be loosely used in my case\nI have been qualified accepted and testified as an expert on what we're discussing in eleventh states including the United states federal court so this has been my work now since Nineteen eighty two\nI started because it affected my family and I just quite frankly was pissed off that they are grouped infiltrated a nursing home where my grandmother was a resident and they targeted the elderly by coal vertically\nInfiltrating the paid professional staff of a nursing home so that's the kind of a nonsense that goes on and when these groups or do something criminal\nSo your listeners understand when when the war expert is used I think sometimes that can

can be arrested like Keith remarried\nBut there is no law against I'm gaining undue influence over people by manipulation and coercion\nClinton in what is that when and if they if they have a chance toward violence I mean the concern is\nThat there's a fanatical friends that has developed in the United states as a result of this past election and now a lot of questions about how to keep them away from the path to violence or an increase in the violence that we've already seen\nSo how ... how how do you convince somebody not to go down that road not to take that political not not not to buy into the political height\nHow do you do well I I I guess you can just simply say Timothy McVeigh a was executed that is the man responsible for the Oklahoma bombing which she believed was soon was retribution for\nThe government a raid on a cult group called the branch to video and in Waco, Texas led by a a psychopath by the name of David ... children but uh McVeigh was so caught up in conspiracy theories in a in a sub culture of\nMilitias and and and extreme as\nAs a lot of friends\nPart yeah yeah and he ended up killing a hundred and sixty eight people are in the murder of federal building in Oklahoma but it was a terrible tragedy\nAll you can do is inform inform inform the public and uh if you observe someone who's been radicalized\nAnd you think that they're they are pose a danger to the public it sure it really is your duty and your obligation to report to law enforcement and many terrorists have been stopped uh in in the midst of their plans because of the people who\nWho called in and kept the FBI or local law enforcement\nAnd uh I think that's our obligation\nOf many of these people are cannot be dissuaded uh but they certainly can be stopped up before they do something terrible\nAnd I would remind listeners that you know most of the terrorism in the United states or a good deal of it has been done by hate groups white supremacist groups rather than Islamic groups\nAnd so even though we should be vigilant about Islamic extremist we should keep in mind that white supremacist groups have a very very dark history of violence says well\nWe have a situation I think we're a lot of people are out there that thanks to the Internet they isolate themselves from a lot of the situations in and they don't feel that they're that they interact\nUh I think that's our obligation of many of these people are cannot be dissuaded uh but I certainly can be stopped up before they do something terrible\nAnd I would remind listeners that you know most of

there how do we reach them and try to make sure that they don't fall prey to things like this\nWell all you can do is put the information on line I mean for example the cult Education Institute\nA has a a video ... at that that is made available through YouTube so that's saying a medium that is being used by coach to recruit and exploit people can be used by the people that are\nIn jeopardy or they can check out they can Google a group they can Google the name of the leader and find the database information that is on line about that particular leader and I would urge anyone\nWho is considering getting involved in something that might even seem controversial to take the time to do a Google Search and find out what you may not know about that group or leader [noise]\nWell we're speaking with

the state capital of your have had a good weekend or the news in Washington is going to be very significant by the end of the week with a completion presumably if the FBI reporting here in New York\nWhile there's not an exciting election when could easily say going on around me a lot of focus and there is a lot of focus on the working families party which is expected to decide this week on whether or not it's going to dump or make a strategic move and getting rid of Cynthia Nixon artists ballot and give its nomination assuming I'm\nHe'll take it I'm sure they will to uh Andrew Cuomo and that's especially significant in light of this morning's Sienna college ball a little later statewide poll to come out and if he had a college poll has a relatively weak fifty percent number for Andrew Cuomo\nIn the general election and this is likely voters assuming the poll is close to being correct a mirror fifty percent for an incumbent governor but that's the way the full field\nOf a candidate's including minority party candidates including Cynthia Nixon\nAnd Nixon gets ten percent of the vote\nNow that may not seem like all that much for the working families party that could be very significant I think four years ago the vote turnout in the general election and maybe hire this time but four years ago I was around for a million voters\nObvious they ten percent is four hundred thousand if the working families party under the arcane or maybe maybe not so arcane but the unique nature of New York's election laws\nIf the working families party got ten percent of the vote and it might even be more than four hundred thousand votes because they may be a bigger return that as we just saw on the\nAction initiatives would likely voters assuming the poll is close to being correct a mirror fifty percent for an incumbent governor but that's where the full field of a candidates including minority party candidates including Cynthia Nixon\nAnd Nixon gets ten percent of the vote now that may not seem like all that much for the working families party that could be very significant\nI think four years ago the vote turnout in the general election they may be higher this time but four years ago I was around four million voters\nWell obviously ten percent is four hundred thousand if the working families party under the arcane or may maybe not so arcane but unique nature of New York's election laws\nIf the working families party got ten percent of the vote and it might even be more than four hundred thousand votes because they may be a bigger turned out it was just on the Democratic primary than it was four years ago and so working families party got four hundred thousand votes it would be catapulted to line see on the ballot\nThey already reached a deal with Mexico\nIt sounds like a very good thing I mean the idea is that the America rich nation of United States has been subsidizing\nCountries around the world for a long long time that there are a lot of unfair trade practices Bill Clinton used to talk about it for Obama used to talk about it unfair trade practices even Andrew Cuomo\nTried to climb onto the act several months ago by claiming a candidate was being unfair to to some of the newer goods well obviously candidate is but in particular\nCandidate has been very unfair I mean they're protecting their own\nFarmers protecting their own political butts to be precise about it because those farmers especially in kickback have a lot of political power\nBut our American and New York in particular dairy farmers have been being shafted by the Canadians for a long long time and apparently this deal and you read a preliminary description of it a lot of the details or not it out there\nApparently this deal does provide an opening a year reduction in Paris as a Canadian market's\nMarket the borders for American dairy products I in New York dairy farmers were going to benefit has anybody heard a word from Andrew Cuomo\nOver the weeks and months about the unfair dairy tariffs that Canada has imposed and how he supports putting aside differences our support\nThe Trump administration's efforts to improve the trade climate so American there in New York and American dairy farmers can benefit\nObviously that's a rhetorical question isn't it\nAnd New York in particular dairy farmers have been being shafted by the Canadians for a long long time and apparently this deal and you read the preliminary description of it a lot of the details or not it out there apparently this deal does provide an opening a year reduction in Paris as\nA Canadian market's market the borders for American dairy products I in New York dairy farmers are going to benefit has anybody heard a word from Andrew Cuomo\nOver the weeks and months about the unfair dairy tariffs\nThat Canada has imposed and how he supports\nPutting aside differences our support the Trump administration's efforts to improve the trade climate so American there in New York and American dairy farmers can benefit obviously that's a rhetorical question\nBut then you've already heard this from this character Richard Ball who supposed to be the New York state agriculture commissioner but never says a word publicly about the dying New York farms and the hostile treatment of farms bother Cuomo than inspiration obviously again no not a word\nHow about other New York political figures Schumer Chuck Schumer he travels around the cage when he visits every county to his credit once a year goes to dairy farms has here ... brand anybody else said anything about how it's good that the Trump Administration is trying to help\nThe dairy industry obviously not\nBut it doesn't have to be that way it's just an example of hypocrisy that's out there and by the right just on that now before I get back to the poll I got a really um poignancy often send to the point you know so then I got to really yeah they are usually point you know very very sad\nFrom John ... is a Washington County dairy farmer and he's written me and I read is a emails over the years about issues affecting dairy farms concerns and\nOther things about um business in uh upstate New York the difficulties of it pretty roping listen to this this is dairy farmer I don't know what's going to happen to them I wrote him a note asking him when he was going to do he hasn't answered me yet he writes made the American dairy industry is in total meltdown\nVery farming is big business in New York and many dairy farmers are trying to get out\nMost farmers own money on their dairy cows in cannot sell them without permission from the bank two years ago the cows were Fifteen hundred to two thousand dollars per animal but they are worse ... worth less than half that amount today some farmers will just walk away and leave the farm to the bank\nMany of these farmers out a lot of money to their suppliers and they're dead he's secured\nLowering the cost of doing business in New York is not going to help the local dairy industry dairy farming is going to be done in New England and New York within a few years they used to be thousands of dairy farms in Massachusetts but now there are only one hundred and thirty four and they and they are in trouble\nThat's where my John vets a dairy farmer I guess most of his life it's not all his life and that's a lifestyle that gets passed on father to son and\nDon't think that sex and it's I don't think there are too many women running large dairy farms but if there are and they got them from their dads your mom is okay and then their moms and dads but it's generally\nSons who is a very farms are going to continue take it on and unless you're out west and then or maybe down south in some places where you have big corporate farming going on and then it's neither fall farther north on\nFoot thick factory type operations which so far we haven't had really in New York but it's a very sad situation here right here at anybody Andrew Cuomo talk about this anybody ever see Andrew Cuomo visited a dairy farm spend a few hours talking to\nFour and they and they are in trouble that's where my John vets a dairy farmer I guess most of his life it's not all his life and that's a lifestyle that gets passed on father to son and don't think that sex and\nSettled things aren't too many women are running large dairy farms but if there are and they got them from their dads your mom is okay and then their moms and dads but it's generally\nSons who is a dairy farms are going to continue taking on unless you're out west and then or maybe down south in some places where you have big corporate farming going on and then it's neither far farther north on\nFoot thick factory type operations which so far we haven't had really in New York but it's a very sad situation here right here at anybody Andrew Cuomo talk about this anybody ever see Andrew Cuomo visited a dairy farm spend a few hours talking to the farmers and answering questions from the\nPress this goes on in other states all the time\nHaven't visiting a manufacturing\nCenter a factory talk to people maybe solar city out in Buffalo how 'bout that buffalo billion you know the mosquitoes in big trouble right what does that say about the operations in solar city is going to produce more solar panels that any other factor in the world right down to that\nFree seven hundred and fifty million dollars of our money that could have gone to tax reductions or fixing roads so many of the tax reduction is of course would bring in more business would encourage businesses to come and people\nBut in New York politicians have demonized businesses to such a degree that are just the private sector or get tax reductions you've got this um huge chorus out there screaming give away to the rich\nWill provide the jobs to the people that provide the taxes that keep all these programs going it's not the government\nWhen she of them have enough time to uh wanted to go back to the poll just a couple of observation shouldn't a poll\nCuomo winds up with this lowest up um or I should say is highest job disapproval number that he's ever had in the ... college poll of likely voters\nAs I mentioned it has a criminal leading a bow and arrow Fifteen to twenty eight and a six person feels with Cynthia Nixon getting a ten percent of their minor party candidate getting virtually nothing I hear from um\nThe Libertarian Party candidate Larry sharks are supporters all the time put Larry on the shelf and Larry on the show while he was on one\nUh I haven't heard from Larry himself recently but he has no chance of getting like two percent of the voters this ridiculous or Green Party candidate ... ... what is you get four percent two percent and I think it gets four percent\nUm and then and the other state wide Gillette branch around saying Shelley cheers archery Farley and nobody knows who she is sixty one to twenty nine\nTime than actually know a trial and saying uh Jonathon tricked their fifty eight\nTwenty six percent of the race for controller [noise] excuse me attorney general is closer to shame to Democrats leading teeth wa from fifty to thirty six percent that's interesting but there's no reason to think that was offered um\nWho's not well known and and um to change is not known statewide no reason to think that was offered to has a chance of defeating a um to shame because all the money's going to be flowing to the ticket\nOr let me just see if it was and there were some other highlights Cuomo ... a leading in New York City sixty wants to twenty four points I'm In New York city excuse me in the suburbs\nFarley nobody knows who she is sixty one to twenty nine times in actually\nKnow a trial and saying uh Jonathon trick their fifty eight to twenty six percent of the race for controller [noise] excuse me attorney general is closer to shame that Democrats leading Keith wa from fifty to thirty six percent that's interesting but there's no reason to think that was offered um\nWho's not well known and and um to change is not known statewide no reason to think that was offered a chance of defeating a um to shame because all the corporate money is going to be flowing to the ticket\nUm let me just see if it was and there were some other highlights Cuomo ... a leading in New York City sixty wants to twenty four points\nI'm In New York city excuse me in the suburbs out said voters closely divided thirty eight percent supporting Cuomo thirty six percent mount airy mowing arrow excuse me\nIn the city a Cuomo's leaders even much greater gender gap Cuomo leads amongst men by twelve points and thirty one points amongst women\nAnd\nSome of the other breakdown well let me go to the editorial on and so it was a very good one there is nothing that's positive for the Republicans in this poll and the idea that a\nMosque mall an arrow won't endorse\nBritain Kevin Kevin ... in the battle battle that's dividing the nation and uh it has so much to do with fairness as well for so many people with Brett Kavanaugh having this stellar record as a judge\nHas a prominent attorney as a Republican frankly as a father as a\nAs a husband I mean the whole issue is over his behavior one incident in high school which is contested and not corroborated and he may have been a drinker for a while in college\nAnd that's what the Democrats are hanging their hat on an ... mile an hour still won't say where he stands here should some are really mild statement about what both both he and Dr Ford or make a compelling cases coverage\nLots of courage to write this is from the Glenn ... post star I give them credit for being\nA good voice especially for upstate they're an honors voice I think I don't think there is sophisticated when it comes to understanding New York city politics as they should be but then again there up in control so maybe they can be forgiven for that editorial titled New York has problems the weather isn't one of them\nOh boy only a couple of minutes remaining calm believes the sun and signed on Miami Beach has New Yorker New Yorkers packing their bags he says upstate is one more than sunshine he believes they may want to fish\nHe ... he mostly believes it is not because New York's economies are birds and the governor is convinced happy days are here again and his administration is the reason\nFish he ... he mostly believes it is not because New York's economies are birds and the governor is convinced happy days are here again and his administration is the reason\nAnd your other signs of a a vulnerability in it's in fact it remains a crowded field this poll shows Cynthia Nixon and working families party line should stay get ten percent of the vote that really a lot of that it's coming out of Cuomo's hide\nA you had a chance to look at the polls didn't you in and if so what did you make of it\n[noise] well um some Heinz mowing you love\n'em into something called on this issue loyal opposition to the phones then Republican some practical matter channeling home exodus which I'm not much more than ...\nI'm kind of a ... vote that's out there yeah I'm an education and I wouldn't call it a protest vote insurgents there yeah so he's not even match you had some and then maybe you shouldn't be next shy shut that\nOff I don't know what I'm Wondering who and that translates into ... moved in families earning about ... I'm good thanks so much for\nSingle what it means for the working families party is they consider the opportunism of what Cuomo can offer them\nAnd versus the possibility that they got ten percent of the vote which I was pointing out before you joined us would be at least four hundred thousand votes which would make them roast the they knocked the conservative party off road say and that kind of be tempting for them I Would think\nIntentional only three percent\nNow my ... I was just going to say about the in a in a one on one according to the polls law narrow picks up ten percent\nHe goes up I think the thirty eight percent which shows the impact of getting Cynthia Nixon added there and Cuomo picks up six percent I'm sure those six points come out of Cynthia Nixon's ten but it looked like four of Nixon's ten went to mowing their lawn arrow against caught up\nOn me it's not the most popular guy in the state [noise] right [noise] actually prime spot\nBefore you joined us they also mentioned that there was a certain irony here that the conservative party today my long put out a state wide or announced the statewide radio by and they put out a script for the radio buying that script\nHas the conservative party strong and supporting Donald Trump from and what Trump does for New York is a conservative party is backing a bow and arrow who did not vote for Trump who won't endorsed Trump and late last week said he won't he won't he doesn't support Brett Kavanaugh he won't take up position on the confirmation of Brett Kavanaugh\nThose six points come out of Cynthia Nixon's ten but it looked like four of Nixon's ten went to mowing their lawn arrow against caught up on\nMe is not the most popular guy you know and and the state because [noise] not cheaper price but I I'm\nAll right before you joined us I also mentioned that there was a certain irony here that the conservative party today my long put out a state wide or announced the statewide radio by and they put out a script for the radio buying that script\nHas the conservative party strong and supporting Donald Trump in ... and what Trump does for New York\nYou have the conservative party is backing a bow and arrow who did not vote for Trump who won't endorse Trump and late last week said he won't he won't he doesn't support Brett Kavanaugh he won't take that position on the confirmation of Brett Kavanaugh I mean how does one ever expect to get any ... any excitement whatsoever amongst his Republican base where positions like that\nBut I don't think is a serious candidate they shouldn't be I think you should go on to the emotions\nWell he's enjoying the celebrity nature of it I Would think and he is a fronting for many of the protect the people who are involved in the race\nAnd I'm actually in my view that's basically what I'm One of these new me is just under ... you know I'm Wondering I'm [noise]\nNot related to campaign you know you can buy you should make sure to check for somebody very high on the payroll\nYeah I mean I don't I don't see any ... each other for a man to turn on the clinical care and I\nKnow he's out there and traveling there said he's taken some physicians but he has not been able to land the single meaningful blow it seems to me on a koala whereas I think John de Francisco the upstate state senator who was hoping to run so I think would have been able to at least do that\nEither way it should come because you issue\nYeah there's no indication whatsoever that a Republican has a chance of winning here in New York in any race or come November not within the fact that say\nA a curse than jeweler brand and I think has been correctly randomly mocked across the nation for her embarrassing or comments and behavior and the whole Brett Kavanaugh fair and that I'm Chuck Schumer himself as a leading to run but he's not up for election she is\nFine\nBut let's talk about Kevin or you know I can imagine how you must feel about it I mean it seems to me both you and I\nWere looking at the very least for just some sort of balance fair consideration but it's anything but what do you make of\nAll that's unfolding including the most recent developments friday with um a Jeff Flake the Republican senator from Arizona

nicer thing to do\nInstead he did what he wanted to do and didn't think of her feelings which is what I find a lot of men today whether they're teenagers in their twenties or thirties or in their fifties\nThat's what they do it's their way or the highway and they think nothing of it\nBut my mother was furious and I know that she was upset because that day we were driving out to a place with about forty five minutes from LA to start looking\nAt the boxes that were packed up by the company that\nSo that wouldn't be fun and he agreed I said\nLike going to the Caribbean because there you get so hard to just think a lot of water all during tropical to anything you can stream water but nonetheless I change the subject quite a lot here but I have a lot to talk about in my mind is racing a hundred miles a minute because tomorrow night I'm going back to New York and of course\nI have no idea about it because I've been with my mother for the whole summer actually since her birthday in June and\nSo I really am apprehensive about meeting and leaving her but I'll be back [noise] thinking of eating coming back for my birthday not that she knows that\nAre one caregiver who was with my father before he passed away gotten married and the party is literally on my birthday so I thought what a great idea\nI Do have to go back to New York I've been away too long I've gone to check on things like that to discover new restaurants for you people and in fact I Can't wait to go see the new four seasons and\nI Will be doing my interview most probably from their next Monday that you have to be sure to tune in\nI've been with my mother for the whole summer actually since her birthday in June and so I really am apprehensive about meeting and leaving her but I'll be back [noise] thinking of eating coming back for my birthday not that she knows it but\nAre one caregiver who was with my father before he passed away about Mary on the party is literally on my birthday so I thought what a great idea\nI Do have to go back to New York I've been away too long I've gotten a check on things like that to discover new restaurants for you people and in fact I Can't wait to go see the new four seasons and\nI Will be doing my interview most probably from their next Monday that you have to be sure to tune in and\nOut in June and Micheline he's on my show on Columbus Day\nSo don't forget about that next week five PM\nYou'll hear me talking to a June ... on location\nIn the four seasons which just reopened on forty nine just off Park Avenue and hopefully I'll have his partner who he keeps in the basement because the book but he's also a terrific by our\nSunday there so hopefully the two of them will be that now if I can manage to do it before that ban I'll be able to pre record it and do a lunchtime there because that's lunch time you see every famous person in New York whether it's a politician\nAnd by the way right and left so they're not just Democrats not just Republicans and I'm dying to see what kind of food they have evidently the shop into really good but I Want to feel the atmosphere because of the four seasons was one of my favorite people watching restaurants in New York City\nBut I Am anxious to get back to New York for that\nBecause in LA I'm getting kind of tired of the restaurants here I\nGo to so lonely and only a few that I really really like otherwise I think cooking a lot\nAnd let me tell you when you don't have a dishwasher in this room although they're remodeling some of the rooms and since my mom decided to stay up the Beverly Hills hotel across on Fox and I highly recommend it because it's like being in your own home [noise] and they treat you so well here [noise] um [noise]\nWe could have used that dishwasher and the army mumbling rooms and I saw one of them and it was\nReally beautiful inside the couch with they had in the living room looks like the restoration hardware of beautiful women and looked like actually my couch in my living room so it'd be nice to move into that have the dishwasher [laughter]\n[laughter] but also I'm a double loving because I'm already thinking about Thanksgiving and how I'm going to cook is Thanksgiving dinner with just one out and we always had chew at home\nAnd that was my big mistake in my apartment in New York I asked when yellow knew what was the most important thing in a kitchen and he said counter space\nSo I gave myself a lot of counter space but the other and I did get a Viking now than any stove could've been a lot larger than I could've used to more burners only help for for most people that's normal but not for me when you're cooking you need all the burners you can get\nAnd by the way the pasta cooked last week my mother once it again and it's so much word all the slicing tomatoes and the cleaning up the garlic I'm thinking you know I've got so much pack leaning organizing to do it again and I that I don't know if I Want to do that cost\nCook Thanksgiving dinner with just one out and we always had chew at home and that was my big mistake in my apartment in New York I asked when yellow knew what was the most important thing in a kitchen and he said counter space\nSo I gave myself a lot of counter space but the other and I did get a Viking now than any stove could've been a lot larger than I could've used to more burners only help for for most people that's normal but not for me when you're cooking you need all the burners yet\nAnd by the way the pasta we could last week\nMy mother once it again and it's so much worse all the slicing tomatoes and the cleaning up the garlic I'm thinking you know I've got so much packing and organizing to do again tonight that I don't know if I Want to do that pasta I might do my simple pasta\nJust the southern slice close the garlic and then you pay\nA painter carton of homey tomatoes and you\nGet the ... on me and you pour that in and out a little bit of sea salt\nPepper some red hot chili peppers when he goes in right after the garlic drops into your hot olive oil and you cook it for about twenty minutes on ... and you as your base so that's the end like\nI always do because I Will never do that mistake I made\nWhen I went and tried out for master chef and the judge said to me why did you on the base all before and not at the last minute I said I like the flavor of the bagel\nSo I never got a master chess but frankly I think they knew I knew too much so I should have been the judge and that's another thing on the food network I was hired to be a judge\nTwice twice dropped the ball which pissed me off because I thought that the judges they had were getting really tired when it was time for some new blood and so if you're listening Food Network W. V. O. X. everybody eats better and I think I'll send you some shows\nI think that it's tiny bringing new blood to any of your show\nWell anyway enough with the politics although I Will tell you that again every dinner party I go to every time you sit down to dinner in a restaurant politics comes up\nAnd this cat and off thing has really gotten people talking\nYou know it's something I just more than Trump and all the idea of secrecy sticky does Bush has\nMade people talk so I went to dinner and some good friends of mine and their Belgian\nAnd they always came to dinner at my house and they were privy to the last great dinner I did in our home before it burned [noise] but I had no idea that can Hoover was such an amazing cook he was going to do I yeah\nBecause they do it outside and they have this lovely house very Mexican style but he said no it has to be done earlier it takes three hours\nBut I was not denied good food you started with seared salad\nOn a bed of wild rice with\nCory sauce which I think I'm going to have to steal from him and have him put on the website it was phenomenal and I thought that was dinner\nYou know so I was eating it very slowly while we were talking politics of course and they were talking to me about politics in Europe which was very interesting for me\nAnd I didn't know a lot of things about how their economies work in Belgium in Switzerland and it was very interesting\nIt was such an amazing cook he was going to do by a U.S because they do it outside and they have this lovely house very Mexican style but he said no it has to be done earlier it takes three hours\nBut I was not denied good food you started with seared salad\nOn a bed of wild rice with\nCory sauce which I think I'm going to have to steal from him and have him put on the website it was phenomenal and I thought that was dinner\nYou know so I was eating a very slowly while we were talking politics of course and they were talking to me about politics in Europe which was very interesting for me\nAnd I didn't know a lot of things about how\nThe economy's working Belgium and Switzerland and it was very interesting I also have to tell you is a man said to me that was sitting next to us in the restaurant after my mom and I saw Fahrenheit eleven nine\nAnd he said I like Michael Moore but do you ever really learn anything new and I said yes I learned a lot of things who knew I learned that at the convention\nBernie Sanders didn't win more states and the super delegate that came in and the Republicans don't have superdelegates\nWhen the name of each state was called they gave it to Hillary so brain was a big guy he didn't didn't make a scene didn't make a fuss like Calvin I would've done if it was him or Trump would have done it with him\nHe accepted it\nSo I also learned that when Obama went to Michigan and I liked Obama very much he just went to speak but he did nothing about the problem with the water I advise you all to see this movie because it's scary it's scary if we don't participate in our system\nIf it if you don't vote and you don't let yourself get out there and make your voice heard history will continue to repeat itself over and over and over and you're going to need a lot of wine and a lot of cocktails to get yourself through it\nSo that's what Steven ... says not to but I say [noise] anyway the second course by the way the gym club was\nA ragu of lamb but he didn't puree the lam he had chunks of it as if he was having a lamp to\nLike with sauce was filled with carrots and onions and freshmen since age and he poured it over a ... which was perfectly cook and ... and the\nOvercooked to the point it's mushy this was not the most delicious dinner I couldn't finish it so I brought it home to my mother and she finished it last night for dinner and she said who is this was fabulous [noise]\nI don't think you could get a dish like that in a restaurant so house off do you Tim I think that dinner was amazing and I can't wait to come back and have another dinner at your house [noise] and I think that you should give me the recipes so I can put it on my website on WB oh\nAnd by the way if you've ever missed one of my shows which you do if you go to the home page a WTO acts\nAnd then you press on on demand\nWithin my name and you will find it and other easier way would be to Google ... again and you will see right up on the top Mari gets everybody each there on WB Iraq's\nLike that in a restaurant so hats off to you can I think that dinner was amazing and I can't wait to come back and have another dinner at your house and I think that you should give me the recipe so I can put it on my website on WBAL\nAnd by the way if you've ever been asked one of my show what you do if you go to the home page a WTO act\nAnd then you press on on demand\nWithin my name and you find that another easier way would be to Google ... again and you will see right up on the stock market everybody eats there on WB Iraq\nKnow where it back from them but perhaps before the election will get a call back and an opportunity to meet you here from and you have an introduction from ms ... Cortez Ocasio Cortez but tonight\nWe have the G O P nominee Mr Anthony ... good date you Anthony goodnight how're you doing\nA yes good evening Steve are thank you for inviting me to the program\nGreat to have you and uh you're talking to us from your headquarters I suppose in Queens you're palatial headquarters no doubt right Anthony it's a\nA doesn't seem like a palace it was for like a apartment a partner\nOr very well and good just tell you all very briefly their audience\nW. V. O. X. audience nine one for six three six zero one one zero please perhaps after a Fifteen or twenty minutes of introductions and talk call in with your questions whether you're a constituent of a Mr pompous um\nFor potentially a Mr pompous or ms Ocasio Cortez or not we welcome your questions but they're pretty general and relevant all congressional districts\nOr what I Know about Mr poppa says as he's a professor in good standing at St john's university St Johns I Know very well know many people who went there I Know some professors there I don't know it's an excellent institution and a about that much I Know I Know you are a registered Republican I Know you are\nA somewhat in the middle is not to the left so if you don't mind Anthony and please don't mind my interrupting you if the commands of the a commercial or set up or the clock interfere don't mind my interruption it's it's meant to just to move things along but please tell us very briefly about yourself [noise]\nAh yes uh I'm a ... as you say a a moderate Republican I characterize myself as a Teddy Roosevelt Republican after a ... or ... [noise] uh who was a New Yorker and became president of the United states [laughter]\nOr his slogan was that he wanted everyone to have a square deal or if he wanted the labor unions have square deal corporations to have a ...\nNo I Know you are a registered Republican I Know you are\nA somewhat in the middle is not to the left so if you don't mind Anthony and please don't mind my interrupting you if the commands of the a commercial or set up or the clock interfere don't mind my interruption it's it's meant to just to move things along but please tell us very briefly about yourself\n[noise] Ah yes I'm a ... as you say a a moderate Republican I characterize myself as a Teddy Roosevelt Republican after a ... or ... or who was a New Yorker and became president of the United states\nOr his slogan was that he wanted everyone to have a square deal or he wanted the labor unions to have a square deal corporations to have a square deal\nAnd you know the citizens to have a square deal [noise] and uh I think that's inappropriate a slogan [noise]\nUh so uh you know recognize that there are problems that need to be dealt with [noise] but ah I Want to have you know sensible solutions are for the problems rather than extreme Russ or idea logically driven a solution\nI I like your approach though I Would consider myself somewhat to the right of you I like I think it would be called the ... approach or a collector ... approach because that used to be the nature of the parties there were right wings and left wings to both parties\nThere were a conservative Democrats and left wing Republicans and nobody offended the principles of either party by doing to those lines because the parties were brought enough\nAnd our intellectual capital I think was rich enough\nTo consider such approaches and Teddy Roosevelt as you say was somewhat or perhaps in the middle certainly independent minded he unless my history serves me wrong he was probably our first conservation is president or the first one in in in reputation and\nIn other ways he sounded a bit Democrat at the time but he was also of course quite pro business in his own way and let me just how your reference to the present time I would consider President Trump to be something of a an eclectic figure\nHaving been a Democrat or Republican most of his life nobody really knew\nHe wasn't a partisan player at any time but I think anybody who thinks he ideology dribbling\nProbably has not been looking at some of his public statements and some of his proposed legislation certainly pro business but certainly also a he is by no means a strict free marketer or on a social issues or he is certainly what you might say rather liberal\nOr on the matter of divorce or having been a veteran of such a practices so again or a brief interlude I I like the reference to Roosevelt because there is they present exponential of that\nBecause other than that Anthony I think the Democrats tend to be left Republicans tend to be right with little in between\nUh yeah well again another term would be the big tent approach that the [noise]\nAnd under the Big Ten but you have a different view points or you know Franklin Delano Roosevelt or and or the new deal [noise] uh she put together a northern labor union the liberals and the southern Democrats were segregation is from the south\nAt that time and you know he's regarded as a successful president so again a viewpoint is a you know a political party\nPractices so again a brief interlude I I liked the reference to roast both because there is a president exponential of that because other than that Anthony I think the Democrats tend to be left Republicans tend to be right with little in between\nUh yeah well again another term would be the big tent approach that the\nAnd under the big time but you have a different view points\nUh you know Franklin Delano Roosevelt or in the new deal\nShe put together a north or labor union the liberals and the southern Democrats were segregationist from the south\nAt that time and you know he's regarded as a successful president so again a viewpoint is you know a political party should not be viewed as a religion where there's a you know an archbishop or somebody that lays down what the gospel\nIs and that everybody has to follow that\nI don't know I like I like I like your point of analysis only again because you don't hear much of this in the Republican Party never mind the Democratic party which are far fewer connections with\nBut I I think your approach from maybe a historical standpoint a time when the parties were themselves broader based\nUh I think made for much more interesting contest where neither side take a variety of different opinions without offending their religion as you say this is the man show were interviewing New York congressional districts fourteen candidate\nAnthony pompous of the Republican Party will be back right after this summer and I\nWorld national news here is the latest
