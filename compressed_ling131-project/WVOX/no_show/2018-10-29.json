violence about the terrible\nI mean it's really tough I think we are starting to see some green that among prognosticators a neat thing I'm of course these are you know probabilities we're talking about it or not or indeed\nBut I think that most people you talked to who are looking at data agree that there's about a Seventy five percent chance\nThat Democrats do pick up the seats they need to take a house they need twenty three they likely get in the thirties\nIf they get anywhere close closing in on the high thirties forties or above that would be what we would call it the nominee I I I Am convinced you are going to see that but I Do think they get the twenty three I think they're gonna probably get no twenty or thirty eight that they need to take the house\nBut as you look at the Senate it's almost a completely different picture I think that most people agree looking now post Cavanaugh I'm you know post the carrot and coming up which the president and it made so much hotter about\nI think we're likely looking at Republicans keeping the Senate and probably eat and picking up a seat or to at some of the uh Democrats in the Israeli red state typed the real challenges\nDemocrats do pick up the seats they need to take a house they need twenty three they likely get in the thirties\nIf they get anywhere close you know closing in on the high thirties forties or above that would be what we would call it's a nominee I I I Am convinced we're going to see that but I Do think they get the twenty three I think there could probably get no high twenties low thirties that they need to take the house\nBut as you look at the sun and it's almost a completely different picture I think that most people agree looking now post Cavanaugh I'm you know post the carrot and coming up which the president and it's made so much harder though\nI think we're likely looking at Republicans keeping the Senate and probably eat and picking up a seat or to at some of these are Democrats in the Israeli red state type speak real challenges\nAs it is hard to predict I ...\nAnd some ... you know a year and a half\nEven the Senate would term but\nI think with the economy doing this while at us as it is almost\nQuestioning him despite what concerns\nThey seem to start school behind them but it's interesting Dr saying well because some\nCampaigning with Donald Trump you know they\nAs I heard on the Republicans are staying as far away from home also possibly tell him during the campaign\nYeah Republicans are in a real bind here on the one hand as you get closer and closer to election day it's gonna be an idle as it always is a turn out so you need to get the voters out and for Republicans indeed that Trump's base to get out\nSo on the one hand they need to hug Donald Trump to get the base out on the other hand if you want to win you also have to have some independence some moderate even in some of the gerrymandered districts and so you need to distance yourself from the Donald Trump\nThat is you know so divisive particularly as we've been looking at these polls are so many ... women so Republicans are in a real bind do you know they\nOn the one hand you have to get out the base they need the president to do that certainly and on the other hand they're cautious because of course the press is a divisive figure and you know how\nThat turns out for them I think it's gonna be a big question\nBut I Do think as you look at the Senate and you look at some of those red states\nIt's gonna be awfully tough for the Democrats to maintain and some of those states North Dakota right sample where they have these you know\nThere is you know Donald Trump winning by double digits and there is no real low last for the Democratic party in those states even if they like the senator personally and\nYou know the Democrats themselves they haven't\nCome up with a definitive platform and you've got the progressive left will just doing quite well and a lot of these races like in New York is cetera but you know it doesn't really play nationally the progressive movement and could that hurt the Democrats in mid term if not looking ahead to twenty twenty\nYeah absolutely I mean the Democrats and Republicans are divided and we saw that in twenty sixteen the Democrats are equally divided and we see that in particular here in New York state where we see a little bit of tore a level and you and I have talked about that you know a more moderate a governor\nAnd and and the candidates certainly Andrew Cuomo facing a challenge from his left in the in the lakes and Cynthia Nixon and separate Teachout four years ago and that sort of the hidden minds as the Democratic party nationally which it is is\nCome up with a definitive platform and you've got the progressive left which is doing quite well in a lot of this racist like in New York as such but you know it doesn't really play nationally progressive movement and could that hurt the Democrats in the mid term if not looking ahead to twenty twenty\nYeah absolutely I mean the Democrats where the Republicans are divided and we saw that in twenty sixteen the Democrats are equally divided and we see that in particular here in New York state where we see it that tore a level of you and I have talked about that you know a more moderate a governor\nAnd and and the candidates certainly Andrew Cuomo facing a challenge from his left in the in the lakes and Cynthia Nixon and separate Teachout four years ago and\nThat sort of hidden minds as the Democratic party nationally which is designed it between a very energized progressive left in a more moderate centrist Democratic Party and\nYou know the progressive left the ways in certain sectors here in New York state not all of them but in certain areas\nDoesn't play as well in other parts of the country so the Democrats are equally divided and I think you know the day after the midterm we're going to be talking about twenty twenty shockingly enough I and I think we're going to see an equal number\nOf democratic candidates out there as we saw Republicans in twenty sixteen and all of them are going to be representing various aspects of this very fractured Democratic Party and so they are going to have\nTo get a message and the leader if they had any hope of taking the White House from an incumbent president which is always tough to do doctors\nThey may you lead me exactly where I was headed because I was going to say what does it portend for twenty twenty but you just made the point that the\nTo be themselves so fractured right now that there was no one voice to get behind\nAnd that could be dangerous if they're taking on a personnel of personality like Donald Trump again we don't know where the mother investigation going but we're going to assume that Donald Trump triple word will run again in twenty twenty of that is the plan unless something happens\nIn between them\nThe Democrats certainly need a personality and they don't seem to be coalescing around one\nIt absolutely and another wrinkle share is that from a political standpoint and\nFrom the twenty twenty perspective for Donald Trump the best thing that could happen to him if Democrats taking the house which there like me to do because that is going to get him a ... in the same way that Bill Clinton had won in his second election in his second campaign to run against um you know if the Republicans own all\nOf Washington DC as we get into twenty twenty it's harder for the for us to say he\nCan't be responsible for not fulfilling his agenda right the minute the house has led by the Democrats and Nancy Pelosi he is going to have a ... so in an odd way this works to the president's personal advantage although not to the party's advantage as you think about twenty twenty\nThe way this works to the president's personal advantage all they're not already and it just you think about twenty twenty\nIt would be a major major major news not just deliver button winners cycle to be followed by killing people because of the religion they practice and just say August on the line\nThings well

dares patient\nIt's okay well we have to buy all this other stuff that just doesn't\nSeem to be okay to hate and look we have to we have to point the finger at social media as well because these individuals are out there and I believe they feed on hatred which clearly social Web sites I mean if one particular gaffe dot\nWhich I say it's either say awkward\nYou know if it's out there\nBecause there is concern about leadership in this country Donald Trump for all the positives and I said everybody whether you loved him or you hate him you\nIs negative rhetoric he does go on Twitter he as I mentioned earlier\nI you know he's made questionable remarks\nHe made the marks last year during the Charlottesville\nWhere he said there are good people on both sides referring\nBecause he didn't say it that way to answer to that I\nAnswer for very clearly the president makes his own state and then someone he says there are good people on both sides he's referring to Miami\nThink as well and I think he even went a step further this week when he proudly declared himself in a national list and again\nI understand that a lotta people\nThere's a lot of good that's come out of this

state there's no question about it John Paso in the capital district is one of them\nFor the attorney in your area is another in the Syracuse area for some time I think people thought that the incumbent Republican John Katko might be in a tough race but a new state college poll that came out over the weekend indicated that their cat goes in pretty strong shape fifty three percent of the vote\nUm his opponent a data Walter ... and joining us right now is the Onondaga County Republican chairman to talk about some of the very hotly contested races in central New York some of which are really being influenced by big spending by the teachers' unions he's of course that's on day to work I'm going to have you with us again\nHey Fred great to be on thanks for having me\nIs it your sense that in fact that CNN poll he's right that John Katko he's in good shape and there's a efforts to win\n[noise] I'm In the past I read a lot of confidence of some of the Seattle polling I think we're waiting to see what happens but I'm at the end of the day the only poll that matters is the one on election day I Do believe that John Katko is leading opponent is the lead that large I don't know I mean when you all the polls come out\nI'm definitely\nYou know sway the electorate or or electric one way or another\nI mean they had a poll that came out early on in the governor's race a bit I think just about Mike Moen era with is fundraising and\nYou know I guess they want to do polling and all that um\nYou know I kept us going to win a third term there's no doubt in my mind about that he's running from somebody who was not even from here when I was sure where the lady waves to be honest with you the state of Walter whether she lived in Connecticut or Florida\nOr North Carolina or God Knows where on John cat goes bad here born and raised here raised his family\nWhat matters is the one on election day I Do believe John Katko is leading his opponent is the lead that large I don't know I mean when these public polls come out [noise] um they tend to definitely\nYou know sway the electorate or or electric one way or another\nI mean they had a poll that came out early on in the governor's race a bit I think just about my own era with his fundraising and\nYou know I get they want to do polling and all that um\nYou know I ... I was going to win a third term there's no doubt in my mind about that he's running from somebody who was not even from here we're not even sure where the lady wins to be honest with you the state of author [noise] whether she lived in Connecticut or Florida or North Carolina or God Knows where bond John cat goes bend you're born and raised here\nRaised as family here gave up his career as a federal prosecutor to run for Congress and has done what he said that he would do which would be represent the district and he's gotten results which the prior Congress folks did not so\nA junkie I was going to get reelected on election day I don't want our supporters to take anything for granted I Do not believe there is a blue wave and as I talk to other folks in fact I talked to one of your frequent a gas John offline last\nYesterday you know he he like in the ... green wave we're getting way outspent\nUh by the other side by the Democrat Party and of course the surrogate a group including\nThe New York state teachers' union they set up a election account called fighting for our future and right before a primary they dumped a half a million dollars a union dues money into that\nSubsequently they've put two plus million more dollars into that account God Knows what the putting it this week uh but we'll we'll see\n'cause they're now in the disclosure where every twenty four hours anything over a thousand bucks you got to disclose so they have just just to give you an indication frat they allocated five hundred in one thousand dollars\nFive hundred and one thousand dollars for the teacher who is a nice ... number\nAgainst Bobby in tonight she on October twenty second\nIs the current Iranian restaurant menu yes yes\nI mean that's that's one of the key races in the state obviously in the ad a issues control the Senate or you know ... control the Senate what do you think this whole spending the Democrats will have aided by a tax like this one uh when the raises done a week from tomorrow how much money is being really into the\nMillions I mean the two candidates themselves in the fifty a Senate district have raised and spent over a million dollars combined and with the teachers union I mean\nI mean they're they're going to spend close to a million dollars on this race if not more right ah in their spending money in the Hudson Valley in the seat down there and I know they're spending money on Long Island so they really targeted a three four maybe five seats to try to gain control of the Senate which you know in my\nHad the challenge is trying to come\nOwn independent packs and others to find money to to help offset it [noise]\nIt is in it and that's unfortunate I mean we we don't as of yet we have not seen that type of air support so to speak that the teachers union is giving one of her own for their chosen candidate and the central New York Senate race\nYou know we're out here we're grinding it out we believe we have a much better candidate I mean Bobby tonight she's been elected the county government wide three times he's only been in politics\nThis race if not more right in the spending money in the Hudson Valley in the seat down there and I know they're spending money on Long Island so they really targeted a three four maybe five seats to try to gain control of the seven which you know in my\nHad the challenge of trying to come\nOwn independent packs and others to find money to to offset it [noise]\nIt is and it's unfortunate I mean we we do as of yet we have not seen that type of air support so to speak that the teachers union is giving one of her own for their chosen candidate in the central New York Senate race you know we're out\nHere we're grinding it out we believe we have a much better candidate I mean Bobby and panache she's been elected the county government wide three times he's only been in politics eleven years even though his opponent is say he's a career politician I mean prior to that Bob on his own small business\nHe's a CPA he's a an attorney [noise] um most of the thought that the lives that go on with with these campaigns is truly unbelievable and I got to give Bob a lot of credit because Bob's taken the high road for the most part you know we've reevaluated that strategy over the weekend [noise]\nI'm very positive you ran an ad with his mother um you know he's taken the high road but I mean the the manual campaign and their cronies put out literature that is not even accurate\nThey they put a quota for Bob sets by somebody else and the tools papers the Auburn citizen in the Syracuse post standard that a fact check out at the same corps not even something pops and somebody else said you know this is on top of a guy who made it in court\nOr that he committed fraud during the petition process I'm a replacement so if this guy was elected to the Senate it probably fit right in with the Democrats in Albany because he's already a corrupt and lives in it and it's unbelievable how I was going to say it sounds the\nWay you describe the campaigning that's going on in central New York with the dominance of the great influence of the public employee unions teachers it sounds like a New York city election and more\nThan New York city style\nElection has come to upstate New York I think it used to be as you well\nInfluential unions in upstate New York actually supported the\nThe upstate private sector and the loss of so many private sector jobs up state to public employee\nUnions have become more powerful and there isn't a counterpoint to where they're ones wars against them from private\nThat used to fund pro business candidates\nYou're you're absolutely correct I mean we've seen an exodus of people leave New York state particularly upstate a million people since Obama was elected governor [noise] the big money is coming from New York City\nUm you know which is unfortunate because upstate gets lost we've seen it with the state wide elections this year the upstate has been forgotten when except some of my ... I Will say mark is running around upstate he's been all over the place\nOr has not\nGrammar has refused to debate him a particularly and talk about upstate New York\nAnd upstate kind of gets forgotten if the Democrats take control of New York Senate We're going to go right back from what happened in two thousand and nine and two thousand and it will be ... for the state of New York particularly upstate will be forgotten\nOr having one party rule there will be no check and balance that's why it's critical that the Republicans are Republican voters come to the polls support our congressional candidate supporter state white candidates\nParticularly support our Senate Republican candidates because we need to have some check and balance\nIt's unfortunate because upstate gets lost we've seen it with the state wide elections this year the upstate has been forgotten when except some of my ... I Will say mark is running around upstate he's been all over the place\nUh as not grammar has refused to debate him a particularly and talk about upstate New York\nAnd upstate kind of gets forgotten if the Democrats take control of New York Senate We're going to go right back from what happened in two thousand and nine and two thousand and it will be peace asked dress for the state of New York particularly upstate will be forgotten\nWill have one party rule there will be no check and balance that's why it's critical that the Republicans are Republican voters come to the polls support our congressional candidate support our state white candidates\nParticularly support our Senate Republican candidates because we need to have some check and balance in the state of New York now\nEven talk about up said he won't debate upstate issues and yet the I think today the Buffalo News indoors is almost reelection I mean I think that's about Warren Buffett residents handout for stages distance and the buffalo vision money that's been put in there so then arguably on down the drain but what'd you make\nOf the Buffalo News endorsing Andrew Cuomo\nMay give me a break I ...
