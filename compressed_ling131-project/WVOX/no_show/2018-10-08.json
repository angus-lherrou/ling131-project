enjoy yourself and drive safely as you come home\nI was talking to the first quarter hour about the tribal nature of our society at this particular point\nOf it would be nice if we were the American tribe and we all were on the same page together but we have\nA a an intra a country battle and there are two tribes two distinctly different tribes in terms of how they feel about the other as I told you each side feels the other is a bad drive [noise] um\nI could spend as I Do sometimes try to show why he's a tribe that I Believe in\nIs the ah is a tribe that we all should believe then\nUh but I I don't think I could make the argument that he's stronger than I have in the past and it it's still the way it is obviously that I don't have that kind of influence broadly\nAnd even some of the callers who belong to the other tribe or not so willing to entertain my conclusions as to why they should think about\nModifying the tribe that they're loyal to or coming over to uh my side of thinking\nI I Do know parents ethically that there are many a prominent Republicans\nWho have left the Republican Party and and gone on not to the other tribe but gone out to be independent which means they they don't want to pick one or the other but they certainly are leaving the one that they have historically belong to\nYou don't hear too much of a any Democrats leaving the Democratic party to become Republicans or they may be one that a person could point out but not the hundreds of Republicans who will be the Republican Party so are\nThere there might be something to that I'm ... and ... and I'll Try to outline again in purely a discussion thing I mean everybody knows my feeling so you might think if you belong to the other is a tribe that their self serving but they're just a as I've tried to do many times assistance from an academic point of view\nFrom a sociological point of view and and just point out that it exists\nAnd uh I I guess I Can't protect myself from having my opinion show but still\nLike to think if they did something that might be explained or understood from your academic intellectual pursuit rather than a polarized opinion being subjective or so so let's start out with with uh\nWhat what I perceive a one the other tribe trying to do I feel by virtue of its\nActions [noise] and by virtue of the people who are poor those actions that these are some of the goals the goals would be to prevent immigration from coming into our country [noise] um this is done by ...\nI Can't prevent myself from having my opinion show but still\nLike to think if they did something that might be explained or understood from your academic intellectual pursuit rather than a polarized opinion being subjective [noise] uh so so let's start out with with uh\nWhat what I perceive a one the other tribe trying to do I feel by virtue of its\nActions and by virtue of the people who are poor those actions\nThat these are some of the goals\nThe goals would be to prevent immigration from coming into our country [noise] uh this is done by action an attitude in speeches labeling immigrants as people that should be feared\nTrying to a a line are seeking with immigration as a willful allowing gangs [noise]\nMade up of the ethnicity of those immigrants to come into our country and hurt our children and hurt us that's one way immigration has been portrayed especially immigration that doesn't resemble us and that would be or people of color\nThe other thing that is being used in job security there's such a a\nPoint of view saying that the immigrants are coming after our jobs and we'll take our jobs therefore if we cut down the amount to zero or most of the immigration\nOr jobs will be more secure and everybody wants more secure jobs everybody goes to watch the fear of somebody taking his job that that exist already in this country to let people it\nWould increase the numbers of people try to take our jobs that's a scary thought so so far you've got job security fears and you got physical the use of these other people of color coming in and hurting us and hurting our children\nThat there might be the unstated actuality that exists but you have to say that this is an underlying thing\nI mean looking at it by by actions not by philosophy because it's not expressed in philosophy except by some truly extreme people on the on the other tribes side the extreme right [noise]\nI I think that\nThey want to preserve these are the words they want to preserve their culture and they don't want people of color coming in and diluting or changing our color\nOur culture they they color to maybe that's forty in but it's the same thing they don't want to turn the country tan they want to keep it resembling what they are which is white\nAnd so there is an underlying unstated desire to keep the you know the white majority that exists in our country\nAs a majority and and the census and the demographics showed that there is an increasing amount of people of color being Hispanic or black\nIn this country rising by birth rate and by immigration migration and there is a decreasing amount of white\nRace members not anywhere close to a loss of majority but still a loss of the numbers and them they amount to\nThey they color to maybe ... but it's the same thing they do want to turn the country tan they want to keep it resembling what they are which is white\nAnd so there's an underlying stated desire to keep the you know the white majority that exists in our country\nAs a majority [noise] and and the census and the demographics showed that there is an increasing amount of people of color being an Hispanic or black\nIn this country writing by birth rate and by immigration migration and there is a decreasing amount of white\nRace members not anywhere close to a loss of majority but still a loss of the numbers and the the amount of majority so\nA college college or ... people or children or or adults that are in college or isn't very poor that they get out and vote because it is their future\nThat's on the on the line here now you know and we're going to have to see you know we have a particular form of democracy okay ah whether or not that that that particular form that we have a is survivable up that remains to be seen\nYou you you're absolutely right Chris and uh [noise]\nI I'm you when you mentioned the youth I just reminded it yesterday I think I found out that in Tennessee yo Taylor Swift tell us when the very popular young singer adored by her female than than in also male is good mostly female fans\nCame out because she lives in Nashville which is a tendency [noise] and she came out against ah\nThe the Republican candidate per se presented her name's why me for a second I remember it so well but she is saying as much as I can tell us what to say that Marsha Blackburn who's ... who's the congresswoman from Tennessee who's now trying to become senator from Tennessee\nAnd tell us as much as I Want to promote women in government I cannot endorse the attitude and boating direction of Marsha Blackburn is she is not poor women\nAnd that's a pretty strong statement and you would hope that we we don't want to celebrities can make our democracy good sustainable\nBut if they have the the hero of the young people then and and hopefully that that you know young people will listen to that because I don't think there are many famous young people celebrity status and whatever who are seeking any differently than it was with the terms of direction to this country I Hope they that they can produce\nTell us what to say that Marsha Blackburn is the is the is the congresswoman from Tennessee who's now trying to become senator from Tennessee\nAnd tell us which said as much as I Want to promote women in government I cannot endorse the attitude and boating a direction Marsha Blackburn is she is not for women\nAnd that's a pretty strong statement and you would hope that we we we don't want to last celebrities to make our democracy good sustainable\nBut if they have the the ear of the young people then and and hopefully that that young people will listen to that because I don't think there are many famous young people celebrity status and whatever\nWho are seeking any differently than Taylor Swift in terms of direction this country I Hope they that they can persuade you rather than have used to be annoyed by it but don't go to the polls and vote\nShe has she people have to ... they have to understand you know part of the strategy ear is to keep it like the Democrats against Republicans you know Republicans against that that that's that's the strategy but this is much more\nThan a party issues are left why all these phrases that go on this is about the future of our country and what we want our country to be typed with democracy we need to have\nA going forward now it it was a an argument that was made 'em or that I I even said that maybe we've had too much progress and it's come too fast\nAnd you know we have to slow the progress down or even stop it to understand uh you know where we're going but uh the question in that regard as how fought back too weak golf okay before we stop the progress that our country has achieved for multiple generations\nSo I think that's that's really what I'm the dialogue is about you know I mean ah you remember Trump talked about torture and things and other things and with immigrants and ah you know all of that stuff so you know I mean\nTrump I remember I think you put those in the audience who don't remember Trump actually said he wanted to go farther yes there and then water one or two and one [laughter] and and you know and and we know that there was Seventeen other a\nDecent men are for the most part are vying for the president you nomination in the Republican Party and he beat them all and he still has a following that in the primaries has more clout than any of those sort of moderate Republicans have so\nEverybody in the Republican Party who wants to hold onto their incumbency has to sort of line up with Trump rather than going down the road because you do they know the consequences you go out on your own you're gone well\nIt's shaped aged politics that we were talking about we're talking about the fear of immigrants the fear of the empowerment of minorities okay\nAh terrorism so you know this is the underlying thing that's a another driving force in what's going on it's fear and unfortunately when things are driven by fear\nOkay um it leads to anger and a ... and ... and it does not usually have a good result when things off the base and and that's the concern that I\nAnd and what you pointed out to about chaos I don't think people would really be able to pick up on that because it seems when you said it and you continue to say it uh\nThat uh that would be so far fetched how could anybody make this democracy with all the it's built in controls be get written by the pound he's pointed how can you be so vulnerable to somebody like a TV entertainment host\nOf minorities okay a terrorism so you know this is the underlying thing that ... the driving force in what's going on it's fear and unfortunately what things are driven by fear\nOkay um it leads to anger and a ... and ... and it does not usually a good result when things off the base and and that's the concern that I\nAnd and what you pointed out to about chaos I don't think people would really be able to pick up on that because it seems when you said it and you continue to say it uh\nThat uh that would be some farfetched how could anybody make this democracy with all the it's built in controls be get written by the pound he pointed how can you be so vulnerable to somebody like a TV entertainment host of apprentice how could that happen to\nMe that they are I don't think that uh that historically our forefathers and Akash ... and the creator ever anticipated that someone of the\nCharacter let's just you know I should say the character in general with the business model that he has okay at my age I'm Tyler towards private life and everything that goes on but I don't think it was in ... in our history that we would have some one of the nature of Donald Trump as president\nSo [noise] you know this is a show you have to see how it plays out and\nYou know you're absolutely right Chris thanks so much for your input and and I'm unhappy as you are that you are right that a lot of these predictions but let's see if the country are smart enough to stop it before it gets much worse because again thanks for the call Chris [noise] stay tuned everybody will be back\nTo last quarter hour take on the issues on your host don't last liquor and you're listening to W. ... fourteen

council and for those of you listen to the show before where we've had a non for profit executive on his I guess I always say how important a for profit ...\nPlay the role they play in the fabric of our county\nWe create jobs they create revenue for the meanest code but they also deliver such important essential services or to our community and our guest is afternoon or as is the founder and president of an organization that just does that\nI'd like to introduce Marjorie Memphis who is the founder and president and executive director of yes you can drink\nAnd you're going to be able to have an issue that touches all of our lives whether it's through a family member or a neighbor a colleague a and that's the issue of autism and autism spectrum disorder\nMarjorie welcome to the tough man Frank and told us a little bit about your self talk a little bit about how and why he founded yes you can make\nSure I had a thirty year career in marketing and in fact the last Seventeen years I was at IBM i retired\nIn Nineteen excuse me twenty Thirteen [noise] um I also have a daughter with artists up as a and while she was going to school I did not feel to it as a developing the scales that are really necessary for employment so school of teaching her how to do tasks but at work\nDeviations or areas um it's something that they tend to have a great skill that they also are very good at uh like structure structured environment than they like rules and routines\nUm they're very reliable and uh and very honest and I think that um there's a place for people with autism in most organizations one of the challenges that we have is that typically um\nMany jobs are very broad nature\nAnd they tend to want to work on a much more specific or or focus component of a job so businesses oftentimes might want to [noise]\nUh do what's called customized employment means that they're going to look at\nWhere they might have some inefficiencies so if somebody is particularly good at data entry on and they can fulfill that role and be able to awful low that from somebody else who might be able to do a job that has more discretion at for example\nAnd so the idea of customized employment um it really should be appealing to small and medium business that particular who don't have some rigidity that larger businesses have with you know HR coats and so forth um I Would say that we we have one individual right now we're very excited about who was\nBeing made a being offered a position where the financial services company\nWho they need to scan all of their tax dollars documents and before they shreds\nAnd of course if you read something and then realize it's missing from your scan to add to digitize that the problem\nI'm so this is something that our training some of them are very interested in and I'm going to accept a position doing this kind of work and it may seem retain a mundane but it is so important to the if the efficiency of the business\nWorld and I wanted to ask you a question because I was referred earlier you're providing a woman who are working a true story or the school for the opportunity to learn those uh communication skills to vote if we do move to a job in the world for profit for two of the wisdom of\nDrugs for a story yes um which was very rude for the ... year about ... and also the most um [noise] the real source of comfort for ... for those\nParticles progression ...\nTalk to me a little boat if you will ... of of of Rio women that work and organization or be involved in in assisting he was ... a hands off to help spread the word about what will ... will vote\nYes so are there are you know it's our network who helps recruit people we serve so far thirty seven women in the past four and a half year it's a\nWe had some parents who are very active in fundraising we are a nonprofit about sixty percent of our revenue does come from stow store sales but the rest of it comes from individual donations and grants and um so they're involved with that\nIn terms of uh their perception of their daughter they they feel that this has been a life changing for their daughter partly because not only to developing a skilled but they've been so socially isolated and\nUm this gives them an opportunity to demonstrate success and one of the things that we hear is that they come home and our uh take more initiative and doing things at home which helps build their independence so I'm\nBeing able to take public transportation being able to handle their checkbook being able to take some responsibility for family activities in the household and these are important thing goes to be able to limit independent life\nFor [noise] for the important or just as often as more dream about\nIf it comes from individual donations and grants and um so they're involved with that in terms of uh their perception of their daughter they they feel that this has been a life changing for their daughter partly because not only to developing the scale but they've been so socially isolated and\nUm this gives them an opportunity to ah demonstrate success and one of the things that we hear is that they come home and our uh take more initiative and doing things at home which helps build their independence so I'm\nBeing able to take public transportation being able to handle their checkbook being able to take some responsibility for family activities and the household and these are important thing goes to be able to limit independent life\nFor [noise] for the important or just as often as more dreamers who's before over and president and the director of your future\nWe're we're we're we're the show's earring in early October or were you know October is a very busy routes also report and more of\nA four and a woman who you were river and also a others who are dealing with the whole issue of the autism spectrum disorder can your toes little remote what's going on in October and the roll your visual for\nYes ah October is national disability employment awareness amount\nSo odd to them it's just one of many disability other disabilities of course include people with physical disability of hearing impairment and so forth um a positive it's considered a developmental disability and so we're part of a campaign to draw attention and awareness to\nThe value that people can bring to employers to for employers to have a more diverse a workforce\nOr people who have autism can bring a unique perspective and value to a business so we'll be I'm blogging about that and um and sharing some of our success stories\nApril is autism awareness month and we have our\nUm campaigns in April to help people focus on the fact that people with autism are also are diverse group of people yes there are people who have significant impairments and I think that's what the majority of people think of when they think of autism [laughter] I don't think it was until the big bang theory of some of these other TV shows that people thought of autism it's\nActually people who have a average or above average intellect and are capable but have some\nChallenges in communication and social areas\nFor ... group pulled over for over ... ... people who suffer from\nA real issue is through drove a because\nEr during its important for a roof but we're ... we're in the business community could also put a real pivotal role river or are some doctors part of what your opening up your place of business for ... for future\nEmployment or but also by spreading the word for their employees are doing their employees who are you ... remember we're know someone who is a ... who you could be regardless of river [noise]\nThat's true even though we said eighty percent of adults with autism are unemployed twenty percent are and they chances are that they might be working for you are a lot of people don't disclose their autism and yet you might notice that they're having certain kinds of challenges felt\nUm there are people who are possibly have autism in our our employees of our listeners I'm One of the things that people with autism like to think of themselves as a ... nerve narrow diversity that it is a disease that needs to be eradicated it say it is a disability that's a challenge but that\nA whiz and inclusive mindset of society and the work place that people who have\nAgain their employees who might either have a family member or know someone who is a food ... who you can be a diagnosis of will say is the [noise]\nThat's true even though he said eighty percent of adults with autism are finally employed twenty percent are and they chances are that they might be working for you are a lot of people don't disclose their audits I mean yeah you might notice that they're having certain kinds of challenges felt\nOut of there are people who are possibly have autism in our our employees asked our listeners out and one of the things that people with autism like to think of themselves and you know near narrow diversity that it is a disease that needs to be eradicated it say it in a disability and it's a challenge but that\nA whiz and inclusive mindset of society and the work place that people who have the ability of any type can be successful\nIs great and we are almost out of time so I Want to just do two things I Want to make sure people know what a\nWhere they can come to see the work that you're doing and also to donate 'em as well as if there are a professionals who feel that they have a the right qualifications for volunteering so if you could get their phone number a website against\nSure yes she can she can ask dot or\nThe ... the ... phone number nine one four four to eight one two five eight that store is called girl again it's at four martini avenue where in store to be and were there when states Saturday\nSuch great and again it what what what I find so inspirational about the work that you're doing is that you're touching people's lives are giving them a pathway for Ventura employment ah you're working obviously with their families to to to give them a sense of\nA comfort level that uh there is a future for not only a future employment for their for their a child or sibling or family member a but an opportunity for them to really learn skills\nOr that will help them in in in that endeavor\nAnd and you're right when you think about autism um there are some of the more visible things that we look out for people that have autism whether you can see it or hear it in somebody when you're meeting them\nBut then there are as as you said oh there are people who are that high\nA functioning level that unless you really dig down and and really get to know that person you might not have an understanding of what they're going through other hilly basis so\nThe fact that we have an organization like yes you can in Westchester County the fact that we have leaders like Marjorie mad first who's the founder and president and executive director of your cats it's so important for Westchester County and it's important for the business community to stay engaged and stay involved on the in this issue so I urge all of our listeners and all of our members\nAh to to reach out to Marjory but more importantly to learn more about this issue I have\nOne more thing we're always looking for a board member and we would love to have board members and the business community joining us because we'd like their insight into how to develop a better skills for our trainees an opportunity to in Westchester\nAnd and that's one of the other missions that we have four are not for profit just a business called the Westchester we want them to attend or events we'd have over eighty plus we'll go to a year but it gives those executives of those not for profit opportunity to engage and meet with members of the business community and you write those relationships can be developed\nAnd out of those relationships can be future board members and and future leaders not just the people who want to write a check for people who really want to roll up your sleeves and and get to work to help or within an organization ... to move forward so hopefully as a member of the BBC W as you've been for the last few years uh your those relationships will continue to come your way so\nHank we're always looking for more than ... lack that white man and the community China because it's like air insight into how ... ... ... an opportunity to end\nAnd and that's one of the other missions that we have four are not for profits of the business concept Westchester we want them to attend or events we have over eighty plus events a year but it gets those executives of those nonprofits an opportunity to engage and meet with members of the business community and you're right those relationships can be developed\nAnd out of those relationships can be future board members\nAnd and future leaders not just the people who want to write a check for people who really want to grow up their sleeves and and get to work to help our within an organization that you need to move forward so hopefully as a member of the BBC W as you've been for the last few years uh your those relationships will continue to come your way so\nYou wonder how that's going to transition to the air force army game which is just under a month from now\nYou do and and the fact is that it's so see a play the the play that put a Airforce up by fourteen to seven and a decade and the lead they would never give up\nThat also was involved with a broken play there was a a socio broke through the line and it'd be gone past the line backers there was a lunge made a and this was on the right side and uh it it did navy defender did not ... I mean he went through his hands\nAnd by then he was up to full speed and nobody was going to take him down and I mean that was forty a yard run\nThe Cleveland pass and catch our inception which for sixty one yard that was a very very very significant came and the statistics really ... really bear it out in that game too I mean you look at the way the numbers were\nThis was a game that a ... air force came into the game with his to single when they were one in three coming into this game day became into the game optimistically attuned to uh put you look at the wrong numbers the numbers really are very telling on this one\nIn terms of first down neither team really was able to get anything going until the last two or three minutes of the of the first half was amazing\nAh every ... every single one of them were throwing it out but maybe wound up with nine for its downs for the game Airforce would Seventeen\nNavy had a hundred and Seventy eight total yards for the game air force had three hundred and Ninety nine yards a that was a hundred and forty two yards passing in a hundred and fifty seven yards rushing and most significantly they were so successful that uh they didn't even dominate the game in terms of in terms of scoring they were content\nOr to allow uh you know basically air force base to I mean to navy tell our navy to to have its ball control situations when they could and the second half because navy wind up with a controlling the ball for twenty seven minutes in three seconds maybe ... airport\nIn terms of first down neither team really was able to get anything going until the last two or three minutes of the of the first half was amazing\nAh every ... every single one of them which three it out but navy wound up with nine first down to the game Airforce with Seventeen navy had a hundred and Seventy eight totally yard for the game air force had three hundred and Ninety nine yards wow\nThat was a hundred and forty two yards passing in a hundred and fifty seven yards rushing and most significantly they were so successful that uh they didn't even dominate the game in terms of in terms of scoring they were content\nOr to allow uh you know basically air force base to I mean to navy tell our navy to to have its ball control situations when they could and the second half because navy wind up with a controlling the ball for twenty seven minutes in three seconds\nMaybe ... Airforce controlled it for thirty to fifty seven so it's basically twenty seven minutes for navy thirty three minutes rare force and that was one of the situation where\nYou look at it and that's close enough but it was the big place and Hammond came back I mean that was a big thing about him and you know haven't got knocked out on the very first series and he uh he left the game and only came back after we've cleared by medical personnel because we've got knocked down and got a got basically almost knocked unconscious\nBut they determined he he did not have a concussion they came back and he played exceptionally well she clearly going to be there started moving forward because there was some concerts concerned going into this as to what was going to be the Airforce charter\nHe's going to be an interesting player to watch as time goes forward\nAbsolutely and you're you mentioned the numbers on total often three hundred Ninety nine versus a hundred and Seventy eight yard mhm uh shows how the uh the Airforce differences really strong on Saturday I'll vote and the navy defense against had some hope there\nThey did and uh you know clearly you saw that in terms in terms of the the artist that they gave up but they gave a big place and they may they gave a play on mistakes I mean a coach and the amount of low after the game made some comments about it and and he basically said that uh you know that that that they stuck I mean for lack of his praise I mean the\nUh I'll quote him there we got our ... our butts walked said go out and the amount of oil\nSo it's hard to put into words we've been playing these guys for a long time and this was one of the worst whooping we've gotten in a long time and he's right that this was one of those things where where they had to be concerned about that because\nBoth the navy and air force and army all play the ... the triple option often to the three of the maybe six teams in the nation that play this often anymore and and they know each other and know how to play these games are very well and that's a very very significant situation that they're going to have to do going forward\nYeah and uh we're forced to shut down and maybe triple a auction off and you wonder if uh the same thing will happen or less than a month for our stadium\nIndeed and uh you know that's a that's a big game for for army because\nHe each year they alternate with those games in air force because they don't have the uh the pedigree the long term reputation of\nArmy Navy they have to take it individually they have to be when each game against navy each game it gets army and treat that as their at their victory because they're just\nThey just don't get the respected as Rodney Dangerfield might say\nBecause they don't have the the tradition that the Army Navy game does back then but but that game's going to come up a army plays a navy on December ... in the Army Navy game\nAnd uh that that is going to be a very significant came Airforce plays army on November third at ... stadium and don't think he can get points for that I I mean plus tickets for that because that game is already sold out\nThat once I got very fast mhm mhm um so yeah Airforce coming on strong a from a game or heading onto a take on Sandy a penny\nIn air force because they don't have the uh the pedigree the the long term reputation of\nArmy Navy they have to take it individually they have to be when each game against navy it came it gets army and treat that as their at their victory because they're just they just don't get the respected Rodney Dangerfield might say\nA because they don't have to the tradition that the Army Navy game does and but but that case got to come up a army plays a navy on December ... in the Army Navy game\nAnd that that's going to be a very significant came Airforce plays army on November third at ... stadium and don't think he can get points for that I I mean plus tickets for that because that game is already sold out\nYeah that one got very fast mhm mhm um so yeah the air force coming on strong a firm that game are heading onto a take on Sandy a San Diego state and a navy hoping to rebound against temple on Saturday\nIndeed in the army gets back into action this week don't they ...\nThey do this Saturday going to be taking on San jose state out in California who uh San jose state Spartans they're struggling season I went five or their most recent losses forty two thirty or to Colorado State over the weekend\nAnd previously they actually had a tough forty four forty one ... that went into five

in the time leading up to the election and [noise] you know let's get right into some of the issues here I Know one of your position is that you want to try to restore\nThe state and local tax deduction that have been eliminated on the federal level ... what's your plan involving those short right\nNow there there is one lawsuit that's been brought by the executive branch of the state against the the tax law itself\nThere is another law a lawsuit that's being prepared by assemblywoman\nAppalling and assemblyman buck wild um that that goes to the standing of the charitable foundation that were set up under the new tax law\nSo that New Yorkers would have a workaround um as as deductions I'm In lieu of the last of the state and local deductions the IRS at prodding by New York state Senate Republicans mind do\nAh has has ruled that those are illegal what they're saying in the lawsuit is that the IRS doesn't have standing on this issue\nMy understanding is that there are other states around the nation they'd have instituted similar things I have not heard that they were ruled illegal the\nSituation that exactly I think that's one of the concerns that will be addressed in the lawsuit so in the Senate um I think we need to take strong look at getting behind that lawsuit as well that way we're on parallel track to to address the bill\nThinking of of taxes um Murphy has moved to repeal the star accent too he'll start Simpson and for people to have to reapply for this sense and\nHow will that do taxpayers who get reduce\nMeat they reduced bill based on their right to the starch meant it\nIt will be huge you know we have enough bureaucracy in our lives to begin with if you're a senior or if you qualify for star but especially the enhanced our as our seniors um property taxes are are crippling you know they're aggressive tax for people on fixed income so\nYou should uh once you're prove first start you should stay approved unless your economic situation changes or you move because nothing else is changing in your life the other thing that's going on in the forties Senate district is if you look at the Brennan report that just came out on school funding\nFor the ... district schools are underfunded by Seventy eight million dollars Seventy eight million dollars that and if you look at Long Island um they don't have that issue and that's because of the strong a power base of Senate Republicans from Long Island in the county board\nOur lives to begin with if you're a senior or if you qualify for star but especially the enhanced our is our seniors um property taxes are are crippling you know there are regressive tax for people on fixed income so\nYou should uh once you're approve first start you should stay approved unless your economic situation changes or do you move 'cause nothing else is changing in your life the other thing that's going on in the forties Senate district is if you look at the Brennan report that just came out on school funding\nFortieth district schools are underfunded by Seventy eight million dollars Seventy eight million dollars that and if you look at Long Island um they don't have that issue and that's because of the strong a power base of Senate Republicans from Long Island when I got on the county board\nLong Island bus service Nassau County bus service which is totally comparable to Westchester used to get ten to twelve million more state aid than we got here in West Chester that I hate I just as long as it's based\nOn what you just said that the argument terrorists mostly would make that I can bring home the bacon the Republicans have been home the bacon because we're in charge and I think that you more money than has been gotten before ... even though he's still you know he's he's been our senator from hasn't done that but it's not an argument that you might\nKnow he he can't because he hasn't and he's been a senator in the majority for four years and he likes to run around with checks\nOr you know the ceremonial checks for for ... items that are normally in the budget anyhow and take credit for these you know items like like basketball parks and things like that which are nice\nBut I think people would much rather have Seventy million dollars worth of equality in school funding uh and that goes a long way to holding the line of property taxes\nThat that that's even beginning it correct me if I'm wrong but that seems to also be impacting towns\nSuch as Bedford and mount Kisco because of the influx of new immigrants in those areas reports yesterday it will probably just that but but but the anomaly is you don't you you don't think that that Bedford residents they going to be screaming because\nNow they have to build more schools and they have to have ESL program because of the of the the the the influx there's an overflow apparently from mount Kisco the kids that are being funneled into the ... school system and you don't eat you know you're not going to have you don't have to speak the same crisis that they have in Yonkers\nBut this has been something that's been growing over a period of time since Murphy's tenure\nAnd and sleepy hollow and Brewster um and and it is an issue and it's one that we have to address and although it's\nA a an issue that is the making of the federal government as we remember immigration is strictly a federal issue and under this president and the Congress they have not addressed it in fact what was a bad system they've broken and made worse you know ripping children away from their parents at the border\nIs is just humane under under any definition that's that's not even Republican or Democrat but as as a parent I'm outraged\nThat that's happened on our soil in our name and those children were some of them were held in Lincoln Dale which is in Seoul immersed in Mr Murphy district and he remained silent so as the senator from this area he should have spoken out on that issue and as a parent he should've spoken out on that issue\nThat's another thing that I Am curious about it which is somewhat of a paradox that Murphy needs to have remained silent Murphy was endorsed by uh the PBA he was endorsed by the AFL CIA oh he was endorsed by a number of unions now as you\nThey have not addressed that in fact what was a bad system they've broken and made worse you know ripping children away from their parents at the border\nIs is just humane under under any definition that's that's not even Republican or Democrat but as as a parent I'm outraged\nThat that's happened on our soil in our name and those children were some of them were held in Lincoln Dale which is in so immersed in Mr Murphy district and he remained silent so as the senator from this area he should have spoken out on that issue and as a parent he should've spoken out on that issue\nThat's another thing that I Am curious about it which is somewhat of a paradox that Murphy's needs to remain silent Murphy was endorsed by uh the PBA he was endorsed by the AFL CIA oh he was endorsed by a number of union\nNow as you are aware that Janice decision was authored by was backed by the Republican Party so how does that work why endorsed the candidate whose party has basically authored legislation that it's working against them\nIf if I were a labor union I Would at in this climate I Would not endorse any Republicans\nThough these are all commonsense measures that a lot of people\nAgree with and senator Murphy and and the Senate Republican majority been blocking but in the face of cabin on um many many many Republican women are just as angry as democratic and independent women are and same when it comes to mass shootings in gun violence they've had ended up here\nUm so so they are open to this dialogue you know there's a certain excuse me a certain percentage of Republican males who are strongly in the president's camp and I'm sure strongly in industry Murphy's camp\nAnd we're not going to move those folks but there are a lot of persuadable people uh who who are at least open damning the conversation and that's all you can ask as a challenger\nBut the the the Kavanaugh issue has opened up an interesting divide it is that loyalty to the party a contrast it with women's rights contrast it with sexual harassment on this case it was beyond sexual harassment\nAnd I think that a lot of women are are conflicted\nAs to which side to believe because on one hand you want to empathize with Dr Ford but on the other hand to play devil's advocate there's been the the the cry of so much\nKavanaugh bashing so for a white Republican woman who's listening to this what would you tell her\nI think we need to stand with women we need to believe with\nConversation and that's all you can ask the\nChallenger but the the the cabin on it too had opened up an interesting divide it is that loyalty to the party a contrast it with women's rights contrast it with sexual harassment on this case it was beyond sexual harassment\nAnd I think that a lot of women are are conflicted\nAs to which side to believe because on one hand you want to empathize with Dr Ford but on the other hand to play devil's advocate there's been the the the cry of so much\nKavanaugh bashing so for a white Republican woman who's listening to this what would you tell her\nI think we need to stand with women we need to believe women\nUm I was a Planned Parenthood and and a lieutenant governor ... last week and and the the whole theme of the event was standing with women because women were so outrage it it was an event\nFor democratic women are independent women are Republican women it was for for women women and and when when there's a spectacle like there was um and I I think part of the outrage about Kavanaugh is not is not only just the sexual harassment but his whole demeanor\nI'm as someone who is supposed to sit on on the courts\nThe highest court of the land and be an even arbiter of justice viewing about\nI'm left wing conspiracy is from Hillary Clinton\nAnd and have senator you want to beer you like beer I mean that's not how I have in my lifetime have ever I'm viewed a U.S Supreme Court judge you know even even someone as controversial as as um Antonin Scalia\nUm and and was known for his conservative views and was not widely liked in in liberals circles he conducted himself in a math class where he was not personally\nAttacked and none of the none of the other people were personally attacked you go back to Clarence Thomas was the last person who was personally attacked\nAnd I totally understood where where justice ... cabin always coming from in the sense that there's not a case where you know people say well he doesn't have the demeanor of overture insurers will just reality is if you have personal interest in that case\nYou don't serve on that trial no judge is asked to do that sort of thing they generally recused themselves from situations\nBut how many how many instances in in recent modern history has has a Supreme Court justice recusing himself you know it it's one thing but in our local town or it's actually exactly you know I'm the point is when you look at the case that that he has tried has he done this before\nThe answer is no\nI mean the bottom line is that this was a personal attack on him had nothing to do with the with the decision in a case that he had done in his lower case decisions all the ones he's done before\nYou can ... theories are record out there that points out that he has not only stood for both sides I mean he represented them based upon how he saw the constitution but he never mistreated people in terms of the way that he did during this this hearing and he did so in this hearing because it was personal against him and he felt that way\nBut we can we can disagree on on what his motivations were I think if if if you're a candidate for the highest office in the land um you don't conduct yourself that way and and to me that that was that was the hallmark of somebody who is not stable\nAnd and that was the way I saw it and we're all entitled taught I didn't know what I thought the same way and and the fact\nHad nothing to do with the with the decision indicate that he had done in his lower case decisions all the ones he done before\nYou can ... theory they record out there that points out that he has not only stood for both sides I mean he represented them based upon how he saw the constitution but he never mistreated people in terms of the way that he did during the hearing and he did so in this hearing because with personal against him and he felt\nThat way about what can we can disagree on on what his motivations were I think if if if you're a candidate for the highest office in the land\nUm you don't conduct yourself that way and and to me that that was that was the hallmark of somebody who is not stable and and that was the way I saw it and we're all entitled taught I didn't know what\nI thought the same way and and the fact is that John your cat always predict future behavior on past performance you know that as well as I\nSaid well then what's to stop any nominee from being criticized and saying I don't think he's stable\nBut this particular person Brett Kavanaugh seems to have\nIssues in his personal background that people found extremely uncomfortable um there have been there have been Democrats move going before the Supreme Court why was Robert Bork turn down\nRobert Bork was racist [noise]\n\nI thought the only reason why is that enough [laughter] I don't I don't know I don't know\nI mean do you guys you remember the the Bork hearings was just raised there was also his demeanor and made decisions\nHe made as a judge and his compartment\nAnd the fact that he was willing to do Nixon's betting and we didn't want to Supreme Court justice who just did the president wanted the that's the reason he did not become a Supreme Court just he was willing to carry\nWater for the president in ... he was racist but but you can stick to that but the fact that the matter is that the reason why the Senate voted against him in part because of his close connection to Richard Nixon anyway we're going to be going to break that we come back we're going to have\nPaid ... there'll be ... dot com\nWestchester I on the radio\nWorld ... here is the latest

you I'm a newer airliners and [laughter] you know how I look for forty years\nWorkers or he went to the White House I was getting on the Mexican workers are very hard working very reliable but one thing many of them are supporting their family back home right before them it's a cause for as many people as they can back home now and really down to earth\nAnd they have a lot of humility and I you

was yeah and the Mexican workers are very hard working very reliable but one thing many of them are supporting their family back home right down at the ... the court as many people as they come back

which is all over\nWell her delivery which is about fifty minutes long um model or [laughter] you know I think she felt the need to do it I don't agree with her\nI always liked her and she used to be dependable as the ... carrying vote she and Murkowski and McCain the with the health care when they knock that down [noise]\nUm [noise] show I told her heart was in the right place I I think what happened was she she could easily said yes it was a definitive but oh Dr Ford was so I'm convinced scene and credible or that\nHe may or may not have happened I Can't make that decision but the one thing I Know his his demeanor harm to stand in those hearings\nWas not the demeanor I Want to see on the Supreme Court she could've gone that way she didn't have to you know make a cabin or into a sexual predator [noise] uh and she didn't have to worry about believing everything of ... or or\nTalk to your leaves dot that interrupt you but you believe that when he was pressing a war\nHe got a little red under the collar and being a Supreme Court judge you can't show that\nOr whatever and I think that I agree with you on that because because you're not supposed to it's like you know when when they when they have the president make a speech and you have the Supreme Court they are they're not supposed to clap\nIf there's a Republican feeling not close the clock on the Democratic if you were supposed to stay quiet and that's the best is supposed to keep a poker face in other words when when they are there and I think that uh I think that he did lose a school on that one but but then again he was\nTo us not to watch it but his family was tortured for over a month when I say\nI was only so much you can take it you know you're a little late last year old daughter you know have to hear about your father did this to a girl to death to a woman you know so that was a lot for him to swallow too but that's not making excuses not\nKnow where to put up with I but I also wanted to show you that before the hearing she had an interview on Fox News where Donald Trump felt he came on very weak\nLike you know when when they when they have the president make a speech and you have the Supreme Court they are they're not supposed to clap\nIf there's a Republican feeling not close the clock on the Democratic if you were supposed to stay quiet in us the best is supposed to keep a poker face in other words when they when they're there and I think that uh I think that he did lose a school on that one but but then again he was\nTo us not to watch it but his family was tortured for over a month with all the I I was only so much you can take it you know yellow lay your adult daughter you know have to hear about your father did this to a girl that that's a woman you know so that was a lot for him to swallow too but that's not making excuses not\nKnow where to put up with I but I also wanted to show you that before the hearing she had an interview on Fox News where Donald Trump felt he came on very weak\nHe ... he was seemingly reasonable anybody came one week and and the entire brief saying that Trump had with the garbage can and the White House for this guy\nYou know maybe three days before the the Senate hearings began\nHe was being brief for over thirty hours on how to respond to them and when it looked kind of ... and Christine food was now going to have a hearing so the hearings were extended to allow her to say her piece of him to say his ...\nHe was also in conference or at least a communication through indirect people possibly with Trump who said you got to go out strong you you can't be the worse or not you know in my my words that you can't be weak you got to ... you got to beat back to the ... the attack\nSo I think he could pose a very aggressive speech\nThat was what Trump wanted to respect and what may be the Senate Republicans wanted to hear but what ... what it exposed was how under the collar he can get\nWhen challenged are accused of anything a biased whatever it might be and he was willing to come out and and mentioned George Soros his name which is a a a dog whistle for Jewish you know millionaire Democrat\nHe he also said it was a revenge for the Hillary Clinton you know people [noise]\nFor a judge to say that Lou and and that's why they're over a few hundred law professors\nAlong with some the president is a bar association of America Says he doesn't have the temperament to be a judge and a former um Supreme Court justice says he doesn't have the temperament so they were beyond\nThe floored at the Georgetown Prep antics of a teenager\nBeyond that but that that twelve years and the court Washington he had a not a blemish on this record they were all of other judges pick them as one of the best judges around I mean it was like what it's like the babe Ruth of of judge then and the and the court systems and and er and er and er and why and what they\nAre absolutely right but here's what happened when he was now being challenged because nobody was ... he was he was a nominated to those lower courts\nBy Democrats you know in terms of their voting yes on him so yes why not stay the way you are but now when there was a chance he might not get the Supreme Court which was his goal probably everybody would love that you're on the highest court\nHe was now unleashing his entire are you know armory of weapons and that showed when push comes to shove he can be maybe unreasonable\nForward is this is what the law professors will tell us about going forward [noise] how do we know he's not going to seek revenge for those people who put it\nA judge and and the and the court systems and and er and er and er\nAnd why and what they had been rational you're right\nBut here's what happened when he was now being challenged because nobody was charging he was he was a nominated to those lower courts by Democrats you know in terms of their voting yes on here so we ask why not stay the way you are\nBut now when there was a chance he might not get the Supreme Court which was his goal probably everybody would love that you're on the highest court\nHe was now unleashing his entire or oh you know armory of weapons and that showed when push comes to shove he can be maybe unreasonable going\nForward this is what the law because they were talking about going forward [noise] how do we know he's not going to seek revenge for those people who put him and his family through what they put them through so he's he's now no longer a fair minded equal but uh\nYou know just call the balls and strikes yes he hates the Democrats that was evidence in his speech was actually going to wait until the Democrats could take over the Senate\nYou know we want to teach this guy you know the suicide thing where they may not be able to a teacher but I think he says he I think he set in motion but feeling that any democratic quake succumbs before the Supreme Court has to recuse themselves will get a\nVengeful decision against what was that for so long\n[noise]\n[noise]\n[noise]\nWorld at national news here is the latest updates from Fox News radio\nFox News I'm rich Dennison hurricane Michael expected to

lot in this country I mean I I Know you mentioned Taylor Swift and how she doesn't want to vote for women I mean that's her opinion\nBut I think they know that they have a lot of uh people hanging on every word that they say and I was wondering why they do tell young people\nYou know study the issues really studied them look at both sides and make up your own mind I Know it's a hard thing for a young person to do that you know sometimes they just want to follow the crowd\nAnd that it might you what you come your decision might be a really hard one to not live with but people might not accept you for what your decision is\nBut if you honestly think it's the right one and you've studied all the issues that go with it and stick to it and I don't see them saying those things to the young people\nKnow you know I agree with you on a matter of fact ray what they do do unless they get to such a billionaire status they don't have a good chance at all remember what happened to the Dixie

six hurtful those Taylor Swift is you might find a lot of teeny boppers out they're not being allowed to buy her records if she if they live in a conservative home so I got I got a different spin on

they not going to participate if he I don't know how you pick the people I don't know who picks the people might be Carolyn Kennedy ... now\nBut are they going to protest and not show up or not wanting to be a result we're going to miss out so\nI think that's totally disrespectful you don't have to like the man but respect the office or the arts my number one thing as for what you were

before about the Dixie Chicks\nThat's a hundred percent right but the Dixie Chicks at that time were country and western and basically get country in West was basically a Republican more Republican base a whole music which she's playing now are\nJust sorted out Taylor Swift as a country saw\nNow she wants to cross over to a bar whatever rock and roll your cold I don't know what they call it now

Trump\nBut but not only that in my day and age I never knew what the Beach Boys but clinically to tell you the truth is\nNobody did 'cause there was it kept that out a way wasn't\nThe thing that you know I mean I'm not saying\nAll right and you made a mistake I got to tell you this I thought she will pull revealing the raiders fan [laughter]\n\nBut I I I really think we you know young people have to be told or guided on really looking at both sides of this up the issue that we might both want the same things but we're going to go about it it's a different way and we should have respect for each other\nI totally agree with that I totally agree with that that's the word that's lacking today in vocabulary\nAnd ... in in all in all fairness I have to say that the goal of the Democrats\nUm was not to evaluate Kavanaugh as a wonderful potential Supreme Court justice they were trying to not allow that contributed to get a majority on the court\nRight they wanted a swing vote they they knew that it was a little bit left a little bit right but they wanted it to be somehow even as close to even if they were fearful of the takeover of the Supreme Court by a conservative majority\nThat was their initial goal and I can't fault them for it because we are so polarized that you don't want everybody to be anti immigrant or we're going with the party all coming for the party with anti immigrant\nAnti voting rights is if you're a progressive liberal\nAnd and I ended his conservatives don't want a lot of immigrants coming in or a whole lot of uh people of color voting if you're a conservative so everybody had their vested interests to your wasn't exactly squeaky clean pure and idealistic there ... there were a desires on each party's part\nAnd the Republicans won at this point but but it it just further widened the gap between those old so it doesn't really serve the country very well\nAnd and when ... when was on today and he had he Godfrey we're speaking you have no more a staunch Democrat and no more staunch Republican and they were both civil to each other and all that wonderful accomplished they sell a saying maybe we should say you know a lesson from that\nThat's a great thing that's for sure and I don't think we can learn that from this particular president who says punch back quarter rather than see why the guy's punch you did the first place maybe you can resolve it\nWell I I think we have to respect the office as little headset\nAnd really I'm kind of make our own way and if we want to keep peace amongst all of us we have to really do what we think we you know it's white and I just want to know something has any what happened to Mr can he's not on the radio and it really is\nAnd and when ... when was on today enhanced heck he got great we're speaking you have no more a staunch Democrat and no more staunch Republican and they were both civil to each other and that that wonderful accomplish they sell a daily ... hot you know a lesson from that\nThat's a great thing that's for sure and I don't think we can learn that from this particular president too says punch back quarter rather than see why the guy's punch you did the first place
