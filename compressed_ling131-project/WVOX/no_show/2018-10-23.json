is Democrats will still seem likely to win the house because Trump is so effective but driving away boaters but Democrats are blowing the political opportunity up a lifetime they seem to be getting a little traction in red states and now may end up losing ground in the Senate\nInstead of drawing disaffected voters away from the G O P they seem to be pushing Republicans back to Trump absolute that were like that when I met\nWell you know that there's there's a lot I don't know Mr Brooks personally but I have seen this columns over the years obviously don't personally but I I think the whole episode with the judge with the confirmation which that they thought I think what's going to galvanize their base that exactly the opposite I think you have\nRepublicans weren't sort of interested in this election we're much more interested in the election and I think another thing that's going to happen as Mr Soros says mogul ward that's coming up from\nA South Africa south and Central America is going to create an eye towards the St be on what may turn out to be a very serious confrontation and that is going to be cast by the Republicans as\nThe Democrats than their friends invading the nation and it's going to be cast by the Democrats\nAs Republicans being quote listen turning away he's forty five thousand or whoever but now he's fourteen thousand over many as an as of midnight last night at family makes a great point she said there are these people or or refugees what are they carrying flags from the countries that they come from I mean I wouldn't that your your legs\nOf El Salvador Honduras Guatemala and they're waving these big flags which I brought with them you know big things\nWell why wouldn't you be sort of hiding sneaking in entering kind of thing but it's just not a sneaking in a certain kind of thing right this obviously is way out it's got a lot of newspaper coverage that the whole point of it I assume\nIt's going to have a lot of newspaper coverage and it's got to be financed by somebody because you can't feed their polling will tell you when he went in to Russia\nAnd the same thing will be true for the Germans came on the day when Russia cold yes supply lines ... who is providing fourteen thousand people with hamburgers and bread and butter\nAnd they're handing out protein bars and they are out houses in front of them are on buses so most of them seem to work\nHard to believe this is not organized and finance at I don't know who it is but George Soros there's always the name that comes to mind when I was like about left wing waged\nDairy for last night they said they had eleven hundred miles left now if you go to Brownsville, Texas that's one place if they some of them say they want to go to California but he said many many of the people have friends and relatives already\nGraduated oh I see what they do way the world you know it makes a difference in the world and anybody who has the front of the United states should be entitled to bring themselves to twenty five members of their family rigidly it's just it's a new way which I Am proposing right now in the hopes that\nIt will be adopted very quickly but then if you\nFigure if they let the people and then there'll be another twenty thousand next week to say I mean it's very difficult because you're civilians you don't want to start doing military action against the billionaire that's going on the other hand you can't let the border has to be the border you don't have sovereign thing if you don't have\nA board a border and maybe sometimes just keep our country together language eventually you know\nI Know but the Democrats do think that way they're not interested in border today\nIt's an relatives already yeah yeah oh I see what that meant they way the world you know it makes a difference in the world and anybody who has the front of the United states should be entitled to bring themselves to twenty five members of their family immediately it's just it's a new way which I Am proposing right now in the hopes that\nIt will be adopted very quickly but you know they they\nFigure if they let the people and then there'll be another twenty thousand next week see I mean it's very difficult because you're civilians you don't want to start doing military action against the billion absolutely on the other hand you can't let the border has to be the border you don't have sovereign thing if you don't have\nA border a border and maybe sometimes you see the country together language eventually you know\nI Know but the Democrats don't think that way they're not interested in border today that these people become Democrat a liberal Democrat welded whether they become citizens or not they vote because in some states or you have to do is we're supposed to and you get to vote and that's you know you're qualified what's your issue\nFor a vote come on come on down here that's very small split guide while I'm getting I'm thinking like eight years old yeah you could devote your vote Democrat you come in here right now you know anything just accept them or we're going to give you a check later on for whatever and it'll be foot\nBible speaking of corruption\nState makes me crazy this one was making you crazy to newspapers have left his campaign [laughter] you know people\nIn power the I'm Out there and Nassau County one of governor Cuomo's biggest donors is landed a one billion dollar contracts that ballot the land around ... am infuriating other bidders his proposals were solicited than discarded\nYeah just like corruption I told you behind the Illinois in my view we're number two behind the Illinois as a special waiting until the British than for governor we know and like these little things very\nBad in Rhode Island it might have gotten better well Maryland was never too good a metal\nChooses no Marilyn was never too good but this is crazy so why is it I don't understand the New York times will scream about this this this poor fellow who was murdered by the Saudis yeah but it doesn't scream\nThat we're about to real backed corruption the guy who pulled down by more than commission after creating which was supposed to look into corruption too close to him\nAnd it was like boom no more and more lean commissions and his best friend gets convicted the best friend from what from the third son the best friend from queens convicted of corruption the sons to six years boom corruption then we then we have we have this article him I was on the TV show\nWas an article in political ... in the world was seven years or eight years in Albany there have been we talked about this for Allison complaints of sexually harassed and that's an all out thousands complaints\nWere hello all the ... to people a thousand complaints of sexual harassment by boys\nAnd girls as well as by women and but I met a thousand\nFor which they did the great populist if this great state has paid some six and a half million dollars of taxpayer money which is you don't find it in the budget line by like they don't say sex harassment settlements no line for hidden to what this is just so\nWe talked about this for Allison complaints of sexually harassed and that's an all out thousands complain of whale oh all the meat to people a thousand complaints of sexual harassment by boys\nAnd girls as well as by women and but I met a thousand\nFor which they did the great populist if this great state has paid some six and a half million dollars of taxpayer money which is you don't find that in the budget learn by little safe sex harassment settlement line for hidden to what this is just so\nOr it's a bunch of like army shapes that are going to Fort Drum or something you know in a line\nCarrying thing you can get a lot of good but there's there's not a good use of the work how are they in which you can ... yeah we should go to update it you're going to go up and go up to Saratoga and those records right could you know loaded up was that that's not what walkers\nWalker walking him and you're walking around people are walking that's not a caravan explosive devices for George Soros is yes but I thought oh yeah but I don't it up in bed for that is one of his many\nAh yeah they may say home I don't know what their main source looks a little bit but mostly Europe right yeah I don't know where that's a well around but many of the state they should have the name of their sponsor a\nPipe bomb but the employee decided to move to the ... to a wooded area and he called the police the police bomb squad de activated the device by detonating Mr ... was not home at the time and the FBI continues to investigate\nOkay so now here's my question is just read in the same thing that you read and look at the screen\nSo what's the device plan to buy a Soros person for a lot so rose person because of the stores person you get your trust a lot of sympathy oh my God\nThere's violence out there it's the same thing that people being attacked in restaurants which would cuddle with his wife [laughter] somebody attacked him and said your terrible person what was the person paid by the public as to what they can\nDoggy bag and threw it out the door of the restaurant Mitch McConnell's doggy bag or whatever\nOkay so was that person if that person is supported by the Republican side or the Democrat we hate this guy Republicans we have to create some simply say let's do something that I mean how would you know this Washington with an opening\nBut then there was Ted Cruz sitting with his wife had a Washington restaurant as people screened at hand\nFrom the written look at the screen so\nWhat's the device planted by Soros person for the last person because of its stores person you get your truck a lot of sympathy oh my God\nThere's violence at the same thing but people being attacked in restaurants cuddle with his wife [laughter] somebody attacked him and said your total person what was the person pray but that's why they can\nDoggy bag and threw it out the door of the restaurant Mitch McConnell's doggy bag or whatever\nOkay so was that person because that person is supported by the Republican side [laughter] Democrat we hate this guy Republicans we have to create some simply say let's do something that I mean how would you know this Washington or opening\nWell then there was Ted Cruz sitting with his wife and a Washington restaurant that as people screened at hand but uh what you might call it McConnell was in a Mexican restaurant looked like a diner and Louisville\n\nSo they took his doggy bag and threw it out the door oh man do one hundred a month\nIf they don't really know tacos or whatever [laughter] we'll talk of could be a joke [laughter] anyway\nA pretty soon the election will be here and we'll see what are you expecting surprised some expected low yeah gross I'm expecting a care Claire McCaskill may get bitten yeah\nI think that now Cruz who was weighed the underdog may win and take over that he will with yeah what was\nThat Beto O'Rourke one of the joint I read today the Hispanic congressional caucus even though he's got Irish extraction\nBut he's been living in El Paso for for generations in speaking both languages and uh but she doesn't have the right blood line see it seemed like one one thousand above ... well they don't ... you can't find DNA from North American Indians they won't give it because they're tribal things\nSo when they did Elizabeth Warren they had to use DNA from Mexico Columbia and I think it was\nA Ecuador Peru because there is no a DNA because the un American Native American or North American Indians will not go and give DNA to those places they want to protect their tribal rights by\nAncestry not by you know DNA that we don't know she does we still don't know she's got any\nUh American and where did where did where did that come from I Believe that there are professors and researchers filter that did a little better than that but there are that from homes where my sources that are sources of DNA and the ... for for\nDifferent tribes I'm not saying everybody there all\nThe charities what she claimed she was ... where she was a Delaware ... but the thing is when she went and ... it was a law professor at the University of Pennsylvania she put down Caucasian and she didn't say American indian [noise] ah\nShe got to Harvard and after three months or something this is what I read should there's an American circulated a questionnaire and then in the academic journal up the professors at Harvard said American indian and they took credit for having a Native American professor at Harvard and she was it\nLike as soon as we talked about this let's say somebody from ministry and called yeah and some basis and said you know that'd be great because we could use the checkbook hero we could use the account you know head coach your\nYou know it'd be great at how the how the chain of communication when

as well as mine as well\nDo it now the dominant a discussion on the weekend of course debates debates debates I call them out when the Democrats hiding out it's obviously a tactic Andrew Cuomo like Mario Cuomo I Would note and his race against the annual Rourke really initiated this style\nMario Cuomo's the great figure for so many liberals out that he thought he was the environment of all that was pure and good\nHe was a nasty inside or political player at times and humiliated or the already very weak\nOr in the wrong way back when when he was a Republican candidate for governor and at least O'Rourke hit back with a clever theme you went around the state where they photographic life size photographic cut out\nOf Andrew ... of Mario Cuomo Andrew Cuomo in that race was behind the scenes are pulling some strings Mario Cuomo was the governor of course an annual recording around the state with this cut out image and they would set it up for a press conference debated\nWhich seems to kind of contradicted forty eight percent and want to Republican control of the house and the forty nine percent disapprove forty six percent approve\nAnd um there is that a slight difference in the regions of the district I Would also mentioned that um if the poll is accurate there's quite a difference in attitude towards a Delgado and fast so amongst those wisdom\nA bachelor's degrees\nOr or more and higher education or less than a bachelor's degree I don't quite figure it out except maybe working class people who are in college graduates are more comfortable with faster and may know him but fifty three percent of those was less than a bachelor's degree and only thirty four percent\nOf those were the bachelor's degree or more back faster on the flip side of it as a dental fifty four

Would also mentioned that um if the poll is accurate there's quite a difference in attitude towards a Delgado and fast so amongst those wisdom\nA bachelor's degrees\nOr or more in higher education or

was less than a bachelor's degree and only thirty four percent\nOf those with a bachelor's degree or more back faster when the flip side of it that's a ... fifty four percent with a bachelor's degree or more back Delgado in thirty four percent back faster they also have to do with the fact that down and say we're still gotta support is are a lot of\nPresumably a half their affluence and a well educated people from New York City you moved up into the district and a lot of those people as we talked about before our voting um\nAre are being encouraged to register as Democrats and to vote or a Democrat obviously let me just quickly see if I can send a note here to someone from\nA ... office asking where the congressman is because he was supposed to have joined us by now um some of his writing me invite Delgado\nA well God Knows how to standing invitation to come on the show I'm sure his people know that uh let me just right they'll just see what the rest of that is a C I Wonder if you know whether it could be you know getting I just occurred to me I think I got I gave them the right number because he called as the other day\nOh it looks like we do have John faster with us maybe it was just reading through the cross tabs in forgot it was supposed to be ten Fifteen that he called in good morning Congress and thanks for being with us\nGood morning Fred nothing so complicated as reading any polling it was just simply um I forgot it that it was ten Fifteen [laughter]\nWell that's fair enough let's talk about the polar quickly it's amazingly razor thin lead that you have one points it really is in the margin of error so it really doesn't count how do you read this whole what do you make of the gender gap send education gap says claimed in the findings of the poll\nUm these are similar to what we're seeing around the country as we know that this was a close race but I have to tell you Fred I'm encouraged by this uh survey because if you think the Democrat candidate spend eight million in the primary much of that beating up on me\nAnd then uh between Delgado and pillow see in the Democratic or money coming in from around the country I think they've spent about\nEight million dollars already in the general election uh falsely attacking me so I I think there's a pretty good I think we're going to win\nWell I think there's no question that that money does have an impact the last I saw um they'll got over as soon as you he's raised um six million or more to your three million is that right and what is this money come from mainly\nIt's coming from a liberal activists from all over the country are very little from our congressional district I'm just as he parachuted into this district last year having never lived here or worked here um the money is coming in from all over the country from the far left and\nUh you know that's just the reality we're seeing this around across the country the left has mobilized but I think uh the Republican conservative side has mobilized as well and I was outspent two years ago Fred ... Teachout or I knew going into this that I was going to be outspent this year as well but I feel that\nWe have enough resources are to win and obviously people that want to help make and go to John Faso dot com and and help me\nIs any of that money coming from\nHe's raised um six million or more to your three million is that right and what is this money come from mainly\nIt's coming from a liberal activists from all over the country are very little from our congressional district I'm just as he parachuted into this district last year having never lived here worked here um the money is coming in from all over the country from the far left and\nUh you know that's just the reality we're seeing this around across the country the left has mobilized but I think uh the Republican conservative side has mobilized as well and I was outspent two years ago Fred ... Teachout or I knew going into this that I was going to be outspent this year as well but I feel that\nWe have enough resources to win and obviously people that want to help make and go to John Faso dot com and and help me\nIs any of the money coming from the sort of big ... billionaires who are backing the Democrats George Soros Tom's dire ... as far as you know\nA nothing from Bloomberg I don't know about those other guys I'm frankly I I haven't had time to leave and look at it as a report and frankly I don't even care about it at this age I just know most of it is coming from a way outside of the district most of it outside of New York state\nAnd um that's what you'd expect for candidate that has very little local roots in this district\nWas explains that big gender gap or twenty points spread or so and also the education gap assuming twenty points prior to the show as well assuming that the polling findings are accurate ... in your view what explains that\nUm I think this is a a a reaction to the polarization that exists in the country and the gender gap that exists a broadly in the country and much of it is a\nA much of what's on the Democratic side has mobilized against a President Trump and much on the Republican side is mobilized for him so it's\nIt really is the kind of thing where I'm just hopeful that enough voters and I believe they will take a look at my record of being bipartisan of getting things done like on this opioid crisis\nI'm a former farmers et cetera because those are the issues that at the end of the day are going to be the most important I think for our district\nI understand that but it's funny to me that a lot of the people on the left who would argue for ah that that the genders male and female or basically equal\nAre seeing in or will see in a poll like this dramatic differences and attitude and we see it I think with President Trump's rating as well I Know that's the case\nBetween men and women so I was just as you one more time if you have a sense is it that women are maybe more open to the argument that Democrats are making on health care for instance in or maybe less comfortable with some of the more aggressive policies of Republicans on foreign affairs or is this some other explanation that you could think of that would account for this why gender gap\nI I think that it's a combination of things for it I think certainly the attacks that I've the endured with the false negative tax on\nThings like a pre existing conditions than this false attack or a where they argue that I didn't tell the truth to a constituent et cetera about pre existing conditions I think that that's certainly had an impact\nOn but I think most people now that they're seeing a the pushback on that and realized that these are false charges I think that the truth is winning out and that's why I Believe we are going to win two weeks from tomorrow\nThe other day when we spoke to said stay tuned when I ask you about a Andrew Cuomo and whether a Cuomo's unpopularity in your district was going to be playing a role you're still saying stay tuned or you're rolling something out today or tomorrow\nI'm I'm I'm saying or stay tuned still Fred\nI Know you've debated your opponent Antonio Delgado\nCertainly the attacks that I've the endured with the false negative tax on\nThings like a pre existing conditions and this false

rolling something out today or tomorrow\nI'm I'm I'm saying or stay tuned still ...\nI Know you've debated your opponent Antonio Delgado repeatedly oh what do you make just quickly of this ongoing saga was reached the apex over the weekend between ... mile an arrow your party's candidate for governor in Colombo overqualified try once again to duck out on debates and minimize their significance\nI thought the uh New York post or a cover headed really appropriate formal or you're going to go to\nA you know they look almost playing the game of ah the incumbent too feels he's comfortably ahead\nAnd we know that a mark mall and arrows going to do pretty well upstate downstate having run for governor I can tell you it's a very difficult to get known there unless you've got massive amounts of money and Cuomo doesn't want to give him any ability to have people see him\nOr have them see mile an arrow but that's not fair to the people and it's not right I mean I'm debating my opponent or numerous times are going to do one\nOn WAMC today we're going to do one on spectrum tomorrow um and in fact uh this new CNN spectrum poll has dying and Neal at five percent and that's the threshold\nFor getting in the debate so I presume that they're going to abide by their agreement and put her in that debate\nI think you'd agree with that one of the really ugly things about New York or negative things about New York politics putting their corruption the side is that going back to marry oh Cuomo the tradition has been established not to debate and there's really no\nStrong expectation of debate strong enough to force the candidates say for statewide office to engage in debate that we have the phenomenon of\nCourse in ... Brennan Shelley Farley having a half hour debate how ridiculous is that\nIt's completely ridiculous and um you know Jill a brand and ... I think they're both running for president apparently they only recommendation I Would make to fill a brand is that uh if if they both move forward she get food taste or\nJust the last question for me on a serious substantive ... where do you think should be done which President Trump to what should the nation do with this army of five or six thousand so called a migrants marching towards the United states border originating I guess in Guatemala\nWell obviously um if they reach the border the United states they should not be allowed to pass I mean this is obviously being orchestrated\nA buy a some group or groups are attempting to bring attention to this issue uh but I think that it is a definitely going to redound against them the American public is going to see through this they're not going to like this\nAnd um look we need to fix our immigration system and I'm One of those Republicans that it's been out there I'm saying making recommendations on what we should do but uh having a mob come across the border is not the way to do it\nAnd the military should use it ... it could involve violence of course it may very well be what the demonstrators and the people who are behind them want to see happen but violence is ...\n... well obviously um if they reach the border the United states they should not be allowed to pass I mean this is obviously being orchestrated\nA by or

behind them want to see happen but violence is necessary force should abuse\nWay back when it was probably thirty forty years ago\nA politics of New York started to change and and and and change dramatically when county organizations were no longer important and raising money\nTo fund raisers safe for the assembly or the Senate or other races and the campaign committees of the assembly Democrats the assembly Republicans the Senate Republicans the Senate Democrats became the vehicle\nTo raise money to run people and local races and they started on both sides shaking down various business interests that labor unions and others to get money and they became the siders\nAlong with their big money allies mainly in unions who would be a candidate who knew it wouldn't be whereas before that time\nIt was grassroots organizations counties committees that could decide who from maybe organically from the community was the best person to run it represents a profound change there's not a change for the better in my view of it as one\nThat we just have to accept if you want to get just about every five on eight for seven six Thirteen hundred five when eight for seven six Thirteen

carefully\nCalculated plan\nWith the commitment of money behind it\nAlso hearing from a regular listener who goes by the name ... uh\nHe cites the business councils decision to back Andrew Cuomo even though New York ranks ... in many rankings the worst in the nation for a business climate after eight years of Andrew Cuomo and California knows how embarrassing is this organization\nHas ms ... left to Albany and seeing the rest of upstate it is why this organization continues to be irrelevant\nAnd that's a reference to have their ... who is the executive director\nThe business council lots of unhappiness out there I don't think there's any question about it about just the general course direction of the state but the fact that we lack\nPeople who would like to see a two party system we lack a strong voice to challenge the status quo it's just not there I mean you can read a few columnists like good when in the post course Churchill had a very good column in the Albany Times Union over the weekend\nBut those are rare voices there was an interesting editorial over the weekend on endorsement actually from the gluttonous falls post star which is a liberal oriented paper\nBut ah

shells great community radio station\nI'm hearing the queen city of this town yes I'm here I'm here every Tuesday happy to be here so I think I mentioned to begin to show that I had a rough white plains nine o'clock for each section had meeting a for Westchester County government\nSo I thought I Would share with you I'm I report I just gave to the county executive staff so once a month all the commissioners and directors of the county government meet\nWith the county that 'cause they have to kind of get an update what's going on in their department and I had to give the update a for a my department which is um what the consumer protection department right\nSo um one thing I talked about was a that a week recently updated the home improvement contractor licensing law\nHas been updated in decades one thing I'm finding it my new job as director of protection department is that a lot of the laws that were asked to enforce or dated um\nThey were passed yeah back in the um [noise]\nA seventies or eighties Nineteen seventies or eighties and those laws need to be tweaked so some of them don't even watch the word database or Internet right those words didn't even exist back then right\nWhole different world so um we have laws that tell us that we have to keep records by hand matching that\nAre in a world where the Internet has changed everything right and computers have changed everything so ah one thing we working was kind of updating some of our laws the or the first one was the home improvement contractor will you know what we do with that law is we license home improvement contractors\nAnd that includes all the people that come to your house to do different kinds of jobs\nPicture patio build back pick your bathroom all kinds of things are of home improvement work right paint painters that sort of thing are included there uh there's also separate laws relating to plumbers electricians of it all the other workers are covered of that law\nUm for instance the application fee has been barely been updated for twenty Thirty years so a home improvement contractor in Westchester play pay a lower fee that may do in stay NASCAR Suffolk or Rockland or a similar type county\nUh which means protect taxpayers have to subsidize that\nI'm also we do a pretty detailed background check and it's gotten more a vigorous over the years and yet the ...\nImprovement contractors or that includes all the people that come to your house to do different kinds of jobs\nFixture patio build back to your bathroom all kinds of things are of home improvement work right paint painters that sort of thing or are included there uh there's also separate laws relating to plumbers electricians of it all the other workers are covered of that law\nUm for instance the application fee has been barely been updated for twenty Thirty years so a home improvement contractor in Westchester play pay a lower than than they do in stay Nassau and Suffolk or Rockland on a similar type county\nUh which means protect taxpayers have to subsidize that\nI'm also we do a pretty detailed background check and it's gotten more a vigorous over the years and yet the the fear of what else we raised the the we made some tweaks to the lord and make it easier to on force the law and that passed the board of legislators on Monday that was good news for the consumer protection department\nUm with the change in weather we're stepping up inspections of home heating oil companies and their trucks\nAre checking meter accuracy and for the illegal diversion typing on the truck right so\nAh Westchester County consumer protection department checked every home heating oil truck every year to make sure you're not getting ripped off by them to protect consumers that's going on right now with the heating season are coming online\nUh sharing services I think it's very important in this day and age the governmental agencies and different government shares services or if Westchester County could do something to help\nNew or shall or the school district for instance we should be helping them rather than force them to go out and spend money on that services government should be helping each other to save tax dollars that we can all agree on that right that's not debatable or so for instance the\nOur way to measure people at the consumer protection department assisted the department of public works for the county by helping them way out the amount of salt spreaders will ... will will will lay out and send out over a given distance when we get bad weather or the salt trucks\nThat we help them with our awaits the measure systems to weigh the amount to spread will spit out this will help avoid oversold thing ah which of course costs money and harms the environment that is to agencies in the county government working together to do the right thing\nAnd lastly uh we've been assisting local police departments with their measures of the amount of tent allowable on car windows\nA device being used to measure the tent had to be certified back to a national standard we help them with that and we have the police enforce that law related to the theme of windows we were able to explain the process and get them the certification information so there we were helping local police\nOr with the services we could provide at the county some protection department with weights and measures so\nThat's what we want government doing working together or to help each other and to protect tax dollars so they go a couple of different ways of consumer protection department was sharing services are very important concept you read about it a lot are they I I Do notice that in the new administration\nUnder county executive a lot of them are they are working harder at sharing of services saying if there are cost\nSavings by governments working together a I think that's important really important frankly as we move forward because the cost of government in New York state is so expensive and we can debate all show why it's so expensive but it is um and not changing anytime soon so that we have\nA heavy burden to run government you wish that they should be working together\nThe county some protection department with weights at measures so\nThat's where we want government doing working together or help each other and to protect tax dollars so there you go a couple of different ways to consumer protection department was sharing services are very important to be read about it a lot are they I I Do notice that in the new administration\nUnder county executive a lot of them are they are working harder at sharing of services being if there are cost\nSavings by governments working together a I think that's important really important frankly as we move forward because the cost of government New York state is so expensive and we can debate will show why it's so expensive but it is um and not changing anytime soon so that we have\nA heavy burden to run government you wish that it should be working together\nAs much as possible All right\nSo we're bumping up against the halfway mark up this radio show or John gas you know are a deputy director of the consumer protection department feeling would be calling in a after this break a I don't know if anyone else is calling today sometimes we get another caller hope we get some calls at night more than four\nFixed three six zero one one zero that nine one for fixed three six zero one one there I'm Jim ... this is the question to consume report or W. U. X. fourteen sixty eight him I'm here every Tuesday\nBypassing the hoses the delivery hoses and sending it back so people could be\nAs the example I use is supposed to get two hundred gallons you only get a hundred and eighty well that truck might make Fifteen or twenty deliveries a day do the math and you can see how that can be profitable on the side\nNow when we caught that person had a very big truck um did you catch down on a routine regular ... when they come over somebody report them to have\nOne or two of them we caught when they came\nTo have their meters tests that\nThey didn't think we were going to be thorough enough we when we go on to the truck we're looking for fresh paint we're looking for new wells them when they're metal is welded together we're looking for different things that'll give us a you know and to what's going on one truck we found making a delivery to county facility or we saw that its meter wasn't recently tested\nWe are told me had to come to our test site right now he didn't want to come are finally\n... uh we know why because the truck was altered and in that particular case we just call county police they confiscated the truck good between county police DOT our office the truck wasn't\nBeing used or does or as it was designed and it was altered so became fraud case for the da\n... great work or by our team at the time a it's a it's a great example of people listening to the show today about why consumer protection department is so important that people are Westchester I mean here's something I mean we're always looking for people to kind of\nTogether we're looking for different things that'll give us a you know into what's going on one truck we found making a delivery to accounting facility or we saw that its meter wasn't recently tested we are told me had to come to our test site right now he didn't want to come are finally\n... uh we know why because the truck was altered and in that particular case we just call county police they confiscated the truck good between county police DOT our office the truck wasn't\nBeing used or does or as it was designed and it was altered so it became a fraud case for the da\n... great work or by our team at the time or it's a it's a great example people listening to the show today about why tumor protection department is so important that people uh Westchester I mean here's something I mean we're always looking for people to kind of a well being things together and everybody can say\nThat it the right thing to do to check the truck to make ripping off consumers don't matter if you're liberal conservative Democrat or Republican we can all agree right that I'm having a tumor protects department checked home heating all trucks that people don't get ripped off if the right thing to do\nYeah we've had this discussion you know about the need for these types of inspections not just heating oil but gas pumps and and other devices a it ensures or equity in the marketplace and that people could have faith in the products that they are buying and that they're getting the right amount\nAnd then depending on what it is that the quality is there to certainly petroleum you don't wanna get pull into a gas station not get what you're paying for and then have your car breakdown if you're pulled away 'cause it doesn't\nBecause it has water or there's not enough ethanol in it or you know whatever the occasion so yeah it's sort of behind the scenes and it's not flashy necessarily in the news and all that kind of stuff but it's more important than a lot of other things\nAbsolutely great works and what are your ... your ... report they write to\nYeah some of them you had mentioned that you know we're kind of going into winter mode on the next week or so we're going to start looking at the some of the supermarkets because now we start to see the holiday items availability of\nCertain products produce a Turkey's those types of things were going to go in with start looking at their ads will also look at the weight to some of the products if you're buying a turkey and it's\nYou know a sticker on and it's X amount or the you know we'll make sure that uh we usually over the years don't find problems and that's because we're out there doing it\nBut you never know you may run into a place where you know they're short waiting or the ruling them out a charge and wrong amount for a particular item so and then people have to just be aware now some of these advertise specials come up\nBy one get one or X amount of pound for your turkey or free depending on the chain and the particular supermarket you know if you buy X amount of dollars over time so we kind of get into that a little bit to\nWrite well going on\nUh we are are pretty much wrapping up or what we do in our and gas station inspections are and then next month or so the prices have been pretty stable a station operators you know usually cooperate we did have a couple of complaints about the two tier tiered pricing which I think again we mentioned last week you know cash credit\nOr we're finding some of the stations are going to just one price more I'm more of them that we thought in the past which I think\nYou know is good for the consumer because when you pull in matter how you're paying your only paying one price you're not paying more or less for cash\nVersus a if you use your debit or your credit card so\nRight I noticed that too I ah there are a more gas and you'd think they are charged same price for credit or in a but then again the parents are getting a roll and go to reinstate they all have a two tiered pricing\nYeah there's there's always going to be a couple and then that's a business decision they make based on what they charge by their processing company\nIt's been pretty stable a station operators you know usually cooperate we did have a couple of complaints about the two tier tiered pricing which I think again we mentioned last week you know cash credit or we're finding some of the stations are going to just one price more I'm more of them that we thought in the past which I think\nYou know is good for the consumer because when you pull in matter how you're paying your only paying the price up paying more or less for cash\nVersus a if you use your debit or your credit card so\nRight I noticed that too I uh there are a more gas station and you think they are charged same price for credit or get a but then again the parents are getting a roll and go to reinstate they all have a two tiered pricing\nYeah yeah there's there's always going to be a couple and then that's a business decision they make based on what their charge by their processing company and the cards that are involved certain cards have a higher\nPercentage fee than other card so it's all different\nSo and the other thing I was just looking through and getting some information on Jim as a you know we we haven't talked much in maybe for the next a show where he talked about credit scores and fight going all those kinds of things and how\nThe credit card companies determine whether you're creditable I guess is the word whether you're entitled to to credit worker and they're going to change going into next year how they determine your cycles score that'd be laws experimental program\nWell that sounds great I think you just decided what our show was about next week\nYeah so it's it's kind of interesting in that think about the kids\nComing out of college that maybe have very small college loans or have no college loans that all they were fortunate fortunate enough to get out without very little [noise] now they get into the workplace and the working six or eight months but they don't have any credit and now how do you make the next leap\nTo credit or an R U creditable yes yes steady income but he never had anything in the past so how do we know what your payment record is or something like that so they're

Y. S. U. T. dot org\nIt's the capital connection in my I'm Alan charge talk joining us this week is Larry sharp the libertarian candidate for governor very sharp described himself as a businessman who started a trucking business isn't sold a successful distribution company\nA strategic consultant for thought leaders in government finance law technology media and health care the teacher and guest instructor who taught English management and business at universities such as ... Columbian John Jay college and a native New Yorker\nMarine Corps veteran husband to Georgia and father of two daughters Barbara and Josephine welcome Larry shop\nHow're you doing I'm Glad to be here\nOkay so Larry let me ask you first of all your the libertarian candidate running for governor so I Need to know true yes I got to be eighty and political science I go to John J. to love it but I'm not exactly sure what a libertarian is so maybe you can tell\nThe bitterness someone who believes that you should be as conservative or as liberal as you want to be as long as you are not trying to force yourself on others we understand that law is a very serious thing\nThat at the end of almost every laws a guide or a guy with a gun who's going to put you in a cage if you don't want to go in a cage\nThat person is going to shoot you and that means you should be using law what it really matters things like loss of life or freedom or property or help of a threat to any of those things but we shouldn't be using law for things like I don't like what you're doing or how you're acting or things of that sort\nSo give us the example ... examples of that of a you know forcing yourself on somebody with specific examples of what we're doing wrong in this society\nSo many of them they give you one that affects New York state directly the way we regulate hemp and candidates we should be regulating ... like onions why if we do it like I guess we will help the small farmers in this state\nSmall farmers would love to have another cash crop to sell\nAnd to grow and to crate craft grows we're not doing that we're deciding that have been categorized as bad because you don't like people doing it that is exactly the wrong reason it hurts our small farmers not just that it hurts small businesses\nNot just that it does lead to use come back to their shake do cool things of that crash grows and and had Clinton had plastic and ... closet heavy rope not just that it hurts the average the Yorker who as chronic pain who now is getting stuck with added opioid or not even that\nAnd now they have to either a you know take some of that and they get addicted to or have their family and friends go off and try to buy it maybe go to jail why in the world but we let someone use of cannabis product and have a better life we didn't do that for those people who have chronic pain but\nLike onions why if we do it like onions we will help us small farmers in this state how\nSmall farmers would love to have another cash crop to sell\nAnd to grow and to crate craft grows we're not doing that we're deciding that haven't been kind of miss is bad because you don't like people doing it that is exactly the wrong reason it hurts our small farmers not just that it hurts small businesses\nNot just that it does lead the youth come back to the state and do cool things that have crashed grows and and had ... plastic in hemp clause that heavy rope not just that it hurts the average the Yorker who as chronic pain who now is getting stuck with added opioid or not even that\nAnd now they have to either a you know take some of that and they gave it to or\nHave their family and friends go off and try to buy it maybe go to jail why in the world but we let someone use cannabis product and have a better life we didn't do that for those people who have chronic pain but not just that those people who are addicted there are people who are addicted to heart horrible drugs\nThat could use a cannabis product to get them off of those drugs that can be done so that's a good example that affects the workers right now\nTerrible that we say that it's completely wrong and we should be supporting schools like like the ... programs and they don't uh trades would eat we desperately needs trade we need tradesmen in this state the average trays of New York state is over fifty\nThat's bad I let my six year old I'm fifty but we need more people to be in the trades need the average to be thirty thirty five now with a rock and roll it we should change that\nHas changed that wants to sixteen he or she takes a test they pass the test to get high school diploma than they have five options option number one you think colleges right interview awesome go to a prep school go\nTo prep schools that are you ready for that college with a history or biology or liberal arts or whatever it is go off do that\nWhen you didn't have to that college you are ready to rock and roll they'd be graduating three years take advantage of ... to take advantage of internships you get a good college experience a fast cause it spreads you ready to rock and roll but let's say you're not a kid your so super smart that you'd be bored in that you'd be totally bored no worries take your expertise now\nCan associates degree that's market there'll be bored go do it awesome do you mean scientists anyway good luck [noise]\nLet's see do any of those things but worries instead go to a trade school two year trade school become a plumber a technician eight track guy mechanic whatever you want to do all good two years of that depending on what you do need to have a license to Eighteen or you're ready for the partnership\nWhatever the case may be go off and do that and be happy you don't like that great go get a job\nGo work go get a job go work if the work ethic learned that when your boss show up at eight you show up\nThat when you didn't have to that college you are ready to rock and roll they'd be graduating three years take advantage of ... to take advantage of internships you get a good college experience a fast cause experience you ready to rock and roll but let's say you're not a kid your so super smart that you'd be bored in that you'd be totally bored no worries take your expertise now\nCan associates degree you're not smart kid there'll be bored go do it awesome do you mean scientists anyway good luck [noise]\nLet's see do any of those things but worries instead go to a trade school to your trade school become a plumber a technician eight track guy mechanic whatever you want to do all good two years of that depending on what you do need a license to Eighteen or you're ready for the partnership whatever the case may be go off and do that to be happy\nYou don't like that great go get a job go work go get a job go work for work ethic learned that when your boss show up at eight you show up at eight nine nine thirty there isn't it actually means seven forty five get that work ethic\nI don't know how many people tell me all the time Larry I Would hire anybody with a work ethic why start a business they might say wait a minute they're sixteen are you kidding me no I'm dead serious we have a whole situation right now where if you ask twenty year olds if they feel like adults over half will tell you know\nThat's bad I Can't change parenting but I can change the environment I Want us to be making those mistakes at sixteen not twenty six now they are a lot of twenty six year olds coming back home to mom and dad making mistakes let's make those mistakes at sixteen learn lessons get better by the time with twenty six we can lock her all the next question I get it how do you pay for their worries\nI was ... when I got a Marine Corps I got the GI Bill the GI Bill gave me a lot of money and there's so many years to spend it with the same thing on a six year old\nThey get twenty thousand dollars they can use it and we'll we'll set it off to school they want they have seven years to use twenty thousand dollars Seventy years will not happen here's what I promise you never want there'll be a bunch of prep schools that will pop up and get so much that costs for two years twenty thousand dollars there'll be a bunch of a trade school for the pop up and they'll cost twenty thousand dollars\nHow do I know that because it's guaranteed money from the government and banks love that they will give loans this will pop up this will happen everywhere now what am I saying I'm saying for those tend to love the greatest now instead of paying twenty two thousand dollars per year were paying ten thousand dollars per year we're saving twelve thousand dollars per kid but not just that\nThere's about four hundred thousand eleven twelfth graders do the math that's over four billion dollars which means we said we we make up that federal funds right away still have no strings attached a lot of teachers that teach get rid of a bunch of administrators have better results for kids\nHappier kids happier parrots happier teachers\nKnowing if you are in a way I Want to ask you a question like you are there are those people who think that our educational still after all these ... ah you know the black kids get less than minimum wage can do what do you do about that\nYeah absolutely hundred percent the first thing is if you notice my whole plan and the er the twelfth grade\nYou can go to school you want to go to so kids will pick schools\nSo you'll find that kids will begin to integrate naturally that will tend\nTo happen if you can pick the school you want to go to now will be perfect and of course not we're never gonna have to be fifty that's not fat but we'll integrate better\nYes you will have better integration if the parents can pick any school the kids can pick any school that is based upon dollars that everybody gets so you will have nationally more integration at eleventh and twelfth grade that part is built in\nNow before the twelfth grade yeah this is a big deal\nMost of this goes to reward schools now because of charter schools there that sort I Want to change how we actually even pay for the schools\nFirst things first right now as I said we're paying about twenty two thousand dollars per kid I have to pay a whole lot less I think we can go to the ideas I talked about I Would like to state to pay strict the state has to pay by a constitution for grades one through twelve that's required and I get that will do that but I don't want to be paid at all by local communities I don't want\nThat kids will begin to integrate naturally that will tend to happen if you could pick the school you want to go to now will that be perfect but of course not we're never gonna have to be fifty\nThat's not ... but we'll integrate better yes you will have better integration if the parents can pick any school the kids can pick any school and it's based upon dollars that everybody gets so you will have naturally more integration eleventh and twelfth grade that part is built in\nNow before the twelfth grade yeah this is a big deal\nMost of this goes to reward schools and I'll be great charter schools there that sort I Want to change how we actually even pay for the schools\nFirst things first right now as I said we're paying about twenty two thousand dollars per kid I watch pay a whole lot less I think we can go to the ideas I talked about I Would like to state to pay strict state has to pay by a constitution\nFor grades one through twelve that's required and I get that and will do that but I don't want to be paid at all by local communities I don't want\nAny school tax at the local level now that sounds crazy I Know but if we start to do that everything's comes in staff mistake\nThe state will play pay a flat fee to all school districts\nA flat fee to all school districts you have X. amount of kids multiply that by a number I'm not sure what that number it's exactly yet\nMy gut tells me about Fifteen K but I'm not sure yet here's your back good luck no more grant writing no more begging money from the state they're more Becky money from the federal government here is your money could lock the number of kill ya that you\nGot it but what if the administrators in that district or you know from one of a better word um you know jerks and decide okay that was one group we when we favor one group we don't favor because you know if they rule group thing you say well spending anywhere you want\nAbsolutely here the issue the only thing I require as transparency that as my only issue you must be transparent any bad behavior\nWhether that is racial or gender or sexual orientation or religious any of that whatever that might happen I Will shine a light on I Will let everyone know what is happening okay you're you're not like they're right\nThere but what have you got like curious Joelle and you know you got a group of people who get themselves elected and they want the religious kids to be treated in different ways and didn't want to hold them the same standards that's okay\nI didn't say was okay when I literally said was any bad behavior I Will shine a light\nOkay so there is a lightning so there is like being shined on those guys I read about it all the time but it hadn't changed the bad behavior\nKnow there there isn't a shine first there's the shine a light shining or from the government from the governor that's number one and that that's the first day\nAnd they still are able to do whatever they want because the average person that doesn't help the local people now but the local people aren't enough the whole state you know someone's going to shine a light on their behavior so it was like come on TV like I Will and say look at what's happening in this community you start shining a light on that and you will see action being taken\nHere because they want but but but Larry they want to what they want the boats Andrew Cuomo wants to vote so you don't have too much from Andrew Cuomo about it a lot of them and I don't\nCare about those votes guess you're correct he does that's not me I actually have balls and ethics I care about that that's I'm not him okay so I Wish and on and I'm telling you right now on radio I'm telling you I Will shine a light on all of\nThe game okay Larry we've got three minutes left I got to ask you real quickly ... around health care\nThe health care and health insurance or not the same thing this is our biggest problem we've confused them and we worry about fixing healthcare\nInsurance when we should be wary about fixing health care we have to fix health care first the biggest piece is transparency is making it no longer a cartel system make it no longer so hard to put people in the actual feel itself we fix health care first then we can fix health care shorts OK the MTA\nMTA's an absolute disaster\nA lot of them and I don't care about\nThose votes guess you're correct he does that's not me I actually have balls and ethics I care about that that's I'm not him okay I Will turn on and I'm telling you right now on radio I'm telling you I Will shine a light on all of\nThe game okay Larry look out the minute they got to ask you a real quickly ... lightning round healthcare\nWe health care and health insurance or not the same thing this is our biggest problem we've confused them and we worry about fixing health care\nInsurance when we should be wary about fixing health care we have to fix health care first the biggest piece is transparency is making it no longer a cartel system make it no longer so hard to put people in the actual feel itself we fix health care first then we can fix health care shorts OK the MTA\nMTA's an absolute disaster the ...\nSixteen billion dollars enough of that about six billion come straight from New York state goes right to them because they're bad have to fix it three ways clay number one we have to start using on infrastructure raising money through that through marketing at least you got any rights day writes the bridges and tunnels that were raised billions of dollars to help support\nThe actual empty a second we have to use it that the lives right now at night that aren't being used the rail lines in another city freight lines to use those freight lines to raise money both for marketing purposes and for bringing Frank to the city\nLess wear and tear on the city less wearing shorts infrastructure more money coming in next the empty as a board has to completely change because no one is accountable the board has to go away with people and put people on it who are accountable to the local people in addition\nWe have to copy all of the good ways that people are doing this in other large cities\nIn the world those pictures like Berlin in London and copy the ideas are working because the empty chair someone efficient\nTo fix one mile of track they are four times more expensive than other cities in this world that both have unions and have safety copy that global save money and raise money to ways other than more taxes will make it more efficient okay tax reform\nBiggest thing your tax reform as getting rid of unfair advantage unfunded mandate the county level crushing local counties that what you can talk about that if you start getting rave unfunded mandate you will find county is a lot less desire to raise property taxes\nAre ever thought or taxes we have a problem with that you property taxes right now we're not voted on by the actual people in the ... down there voted on by the legislators which we didn't go behind closed doors and race Bach attacks\nOkay hold on hold on because we're running out of time here really seriously um what examples can you just a tax reform yes\nI'm Sorry\nOkay than up would you samples can give us unfunded mandate you would do it with\nI Would wear but none of them I Will not do it I Would not do away with them when I Would say is they're not required let the county's decide what they want to deal with I Would let county start their budgets at zero that's what I Would do I don't have to know all these things that's the point my entire campaign is about decentralization here's what I Know from business from family from life\nIf you have personal freedom plots accountability plus transparency you will have innovation right now our state is it a death spiral with over a hundred thousand people every year and a rise of suicide struck all different parts of our state so that has to change which means many innovation I'm going to foster innovation that's what I'm trying to achieve\nDo you have personal freedom plots accountability plus transparency you will have innovation right now are they is it a death spiral with over a hundred thousand people every year and a rise of suicide struck all different parts of our state so that as a change which was ... I'm going to foster innovation that's what I'm trying to achieve\nAnd um everyone listening for about an hour and then we all chimed in and I was very very proud of some of the questions that students are actually asked they accused him of being played your wrist\nAnd he denied that saying that he felt that um it's his work and they said no you're taking other people's work and just modifying it not even identifying them as the original owner of a of the work\nAnd then he also stole the identity of this or this other rock singer he took the exact same name or you know this guy and\nSo he he was a controversial to say the least\nSo I if anyone is out there listening and cares to interject their ideas about how we counter something like this I don't think the argument is so much that he doesn't have the legal right to display what he believes is um you know his message\nBut is it morally right and um how do we counted by showing that in this county in Westchester County uh many people believe we have a very very proud heritage of patriotism\nAnd a display such as this or not only engenders a anger controversy um I Know it invokes a lot of dialogue but at the same time it really is hurtful to a lot of people\nWho believe that um that flag should be protected for what it really stands for and um these people that never got a loved one back from or\nAny of the war's never got the body back they might have been a\nBlown up or not found a they have a display in a case of a flag that represents their loved one or it may be displayed in a on a wall or so on so I asked the question why would you do something\nThat is so disrespectful to so many people\nAnd so hurtful to other people and he really didn't have a satisfactory answer other than that it's just right\nAnd I suggested it may be legally right but it's not morally right and um there was a lot of talk about how do you count or something like this county executive was very upset he did not want the message to go out there\nStands for and um these people that never got a loved one back from or\nAny of the war's never got the body back they might have been a\nBlown up or not found a they have a display in a case of a flag that represents their loved one or it may be displayed in a on a wall or so on so I asked the question why would you do something\nThat is so disrespectful to so many people\nAnd so hurtful to other people and he really didn't have a satisfactory answer other than that it's just right\nAnd I suggested it may be legally right but it's not morally right\nAnd um there was a lot of talk about how do you count or something like this county executive was very upset he did not want the message to go out that in Westchester County we believe we should just respect the flag or he himself personally ah feels very very um\nA angered that this could happen he does not have the authority since the colleges are independent\nOf the the county government so to speak or to ask that it'd be taken down but he did ask 'em or other things that we could do to show or that we do have a many many people who feel that the flag should be respected\nAnd basically what's gonna happen is that uh we're going to have a flag display and it's going to\nReally reach site the history of the American flag from the revolutionary days up to the present time the Girl Scouts and the boy scouts will the participate there'll be a narration of each flag when it was displayed out came about and so on\nAnd then they will also be uh people are young people asked to do essays as to why I respect the American flag or what it means to me and I'm sure it'll be interesting to see some of the response\nBut at the same time um I Believe that this is wrong and um I I'm a firm believer in the first amendment right to freedom of speech but I don't believe this has anything to do with the your freedom of speech\nIn no way are you prohibited or in any way restricted in what you want to preach on the radio on TV\nUh placard or write a book um and do a TV series or anything else that you might think is part of speech\nBut when you are in the um the realm of a desk job creating the American flag that to me is uh conduct just plain bad conduct\nAnd on a daily basis federal state and locally our legislature all of them are regulate conduct\nA for instance uh you can't blow horn in

if they always look back on was quite directly following this as a form of the time I was just one of what lessons you've got well\nUh fortunately I got a lot of them before and after the navy ships have that one of the significant times in my life came was when I [noise] advanced aviation base meteorologist for the command seat in the Mediterranean\nAnd a high learned that you had to be able to project and [noise] and forecasts 'cause I was the leader of a logical officer\nAlways kind of a thing that you you could not be an actor you have to know what to do is be positive and you have to be

isn't that interesting you would never think that ah somebody in the navy would be a a trained a meteorologist and that's a very interesting\nI'm very interesting a field of study I'm a bit of a a meteorological a buff myself I Love the weather I I'm always interested in it\nIt affects every part of our lives and it affects everything we do our plans always revolve around the weather well how cold is it going to be is that going to rain is Wendy all these things we have to know these things because they affect everything that we do\nWell in addition are so many entities that we don't directly interact with\nFunction and their primary won the primary need for information is in fact weather conditions temperature I used to have to forecast the high seas three or four hundred miles out from my when I worked at in Rhode Island it costs to point a you needed to in those eight\nA four cats how where ... where a squadrons flu so they could avoid making condensation trails are and in our daily life\nOr many of the things that we take for granted a set up because the entity that we're dealing with has gotten a reliable type of uh weather forecasting that allowed them to prepare in advance for their customers and the\nClientele yeah and in the navy of course you would you would really need to know a lot about the weather because uh\nThe ship says they're sailing around the submarines of course the the airplanes that are flying in the air or is are going to affect\nA all of the activity of of those pilots and those sailors a how they're going to travel where they're going to go how they're going to get to their next destination and all of that is very very important\nAnd in many a day I Would have to do a three or four different forecasts for the same time period but also different areas of concern\nNow so it's it's something that we take for granted but it's very very important in our lives and even with all the knocks than meter all just get you only know about them because of the times they miss but think of all the times they don't\nThat's right and you know meteorology has come a long way to because I remember back when I was a kid um\nThey would just have a a a map of the United states drawn map of the United states and they had these\nSort of magnetic things they would put onto the the map to indicate well where the the weather was going to be and if it was going to be sunny and they're all these they put his son mayor and if it was going to be rainy in the south they put a cloud with some rain coming out of it down there it was really quite primitive wasn't that much but it's come a long way over the years\nWell this probably invest in the last ten years more to\nPeriod but also different areas of concern you know so it's it's something that we take for granted but it's very very important in our lives and even with all the knocks the meteorologist get you only know about them because of the time they miss but think of all the time they do\n... and you know meteorology has come a long way to because I remember back when I was a kid um\nThey would just have a a a map of the United states a drawn map of the United states

in the big debate that all of New Yorkers waiting for Andrew Cuomo against mark mowing arrow will take place in New York City behind closed doors so that a live debate is being recorded it will be broadcast tonight\nAnd of course I'm being somewhat facetious because unfortunately for the Republicans remark mowing arrow not too many people out there are holding their breaths if only because there's no chance that mowing arrow who has no resources\nReally know energize his base know key issues that he's been able to establish effectively against his opponent\nA mom and I was just my position to win whatever happened in debate but it'll be interesting to see well of course\nBe following closely um you're talking about it tomorrow and it was Cuomo tactics obviously that is the latest debate to last minute\nReduce any chance that mowing arrow might gain some name recognition score sending a significant blows it's really too late now zooming anything could have been changed any way to change anything if there had been a candidate Harry Wilson say Republican who actually had some money\nOr if Ed Koch couldn't the so called leadership of the New York Republican Party were able to come up with someone who could bankroll or campaign\nThat was done when George protecting many years ago ran against a well known governor named Mario Cuomo and he Pataki was virtually unknown is that it happened if there is the money if there had been ideas\nThere have been creativity mowing arrow might have had a chance but as it stands right now and there's like the stand right to the election two weeks from today\nAre no chance at all how about the forecast for the Albany area and may be true I think in some of the um\nWestchester areas as well in the higher elevations this coming weekend both a Saturday afternoon and Saturday Night and maybe Sunday Morning a mix of snow and rain is forecast that could change\nIt might become old snow will wait to see what's gonna happen but

weekend both a Saturday afternoon and Saturday Night and maybe Sunday Morning a mix of snow and rain is forecast that could change it might become all snow\nWill allow for hate to see what's gonna

there's really no need to work\nIn a while that may see it through seem attractive than it is trapped in some ways in other ways it's a very bad thing and it can have a corrosive effect especially on young people that don't have to go out and make their way but\nRegistered very very low on the list the Democratic candidates they're gonna be the ones screaming to get on stage about two years from now as they're left on the beach team debating it like two in the afternoon when nobody's watching let\nMe tell you if it's a lot less than two years from now think about it until you're really a year from now where are you know metal Hampshire I'm ...\nAnd they will both be begging screaming at whining that they're not able to get a debate\nI think your advice somehow an hour to do something that's not predictable and say use is opening when he's asked the first question is an opportunity to make an opening statement is correct you've got to seize control of these things if you want to try to win\nAnd you know it's not really going to be a debate indications are it's just going to be a Q and a again a Marshall Kramer from CBS New York did the same thing I Believe with Cynthia Nixon and Cuomo for the primary and it wound up being all about New York city\nUpstate really is gonna relevancy although I'm sure mark bow and arrow will try to make it for bringing up front and center\nI'm sure he well and that's why we've offered many times will host one right here in Rochester county anytime you want to do it I'm sure we can get the venue for really quickly governor doesn't want any part of that but I'm sure mark wood for sure but I mean it's really so disrespectful\nWho everybody north of I Will call it the Tappan Zee bridge everybody north of that bridge doesn't get counted at all anymore by ah by our government uh and it's really unfortunate for those of us that are doing our best to make this place better there up here it's an unfortunate slap in the face that continues to happen so\nYou're a hundred percent right and they say they don't pay a price for it though if they paid a price they would change their behavior\nAnd and Cuomo for the primary and it wound up being all about New York city upstate really is going to relevancy although I'm sure mark bow and arrow will try to make it for bringing front and center\nI'm sure he well and that's why we've offered many times will host one right here in ... county anytime you want to do it I'm sure we can get the venue for really quickly governor doesn't want any part of that but I'm sure mark wood for sure but I mean it's really so disrespectful\nWho everybody north of I Will call it the Tappan Zee bridge everybody north of that bridge doesn't get counted at all anymore by our by our government uh and it's really unfortunate for those of us that are doing our best to make this place better up here it's an unfortunate slap in the face that continues to happen so\nYou're a hundred percent right and they say they don't pay a price for it though if they paid a price they would change their behavior somebody took it out I read the tweet on the air yesterday\nThat you've got the Albany Times Union and the Buffalo News and other papers that are going to New York times going to be critical of Cuomo in written some good stories about him and then again they'll just indoors and they'll say he's lucrative they'll say the administration is corrupt\nThey'll say upstate is dying but then there were some in the end\nYeah it it it's it's really almost comical but sadly comical or the business council same thing I mean we have the worst business climate or third worst whatever you want to call it worth the bottom that's for sure uh business friendliness and taxes and everything else or at the top of taxes but you know one of the business council do they endorse them anyway\nSo I wandered squandering credibility I mean that was one of the most ridiculous thing that anyone has ever seen the worst state in the nation for his business climate and they don't even have the courage to say that and to say you know remain neutral or the very least\nYeah you could have issued known doors minute right but they turn around and do some by the way this isn't like the first time out of the gate this is the third endorsement I think we know the pattern here what's gonna happen so I I just think what you can do as a voter\nDo not let this opportunity you pass you by and if everybody in upstate votes that's where our power comes in if every gun owner votes that's how you change the outcome but if people accept\nThe foregone conclusion that the press is trying to write out there then we're going to get what we deserve but if we get out there and say there's no way I Will let this go by and get out there and vote make sure you get all your friends to do the same\nThat's really that's that's how we show respect to the process\nWas talking to save a glass and the rents are kind of executive a Republican or some have suggested might be a good new Republican state chairman depending on the outcome in two weeks in the outcomes out looking too hopeful for a lot of Republicans but summer doing reasonably well let me ask just even if I could about the poll that came out yesterday from Sienna\nUh the congressional race that's so tight apparently in the nineteenth congressional district John fast so against Antonio Delgado what'd you think of at one point race you think it's accurate to what's your sense of how that's going\nYeah not sure that it's accurate no disrespect to see and that's a great institution but the polling leaves a lot to be desired very often and look at the polling for the for the presidency a couple of years ago so so far off it was it was incredible there's a lot of folks that are willing to answer those questions or or just give false answers\nA and then or lots of just sit quietly\nWaiting to go vote and I think we saw that when President Trump got elected uh I Would say that the race is tight for shore ah and again that's why we need to get our folks out there to vote uh but I think John fast so it's going to be successful in the end\nAnd I mean she looked at what Delgado just said about Israel I mean this guy to describe the sketches should nonstarter you ... and ... where is the press pounding him on that saying how dare you say that Israel is not a democracy you know what I mean he did what his statement was was just so off the wall and he gets away with that as well\nThe ocean but the polling leaves a lot to be desired very often and looked at the polling for the for the presidency a couple of years ago so so far off it was it was incredible there's a lot of folks that are willing to answer those questions or or just give false answers\nAre and then or lots of just sit quietly waiting to go vote and I think we saw that when President Trump got elected uh I Would say that the race is tight for sure uh and again that's why we need to get our folks out there to vote or but I think John's house was going to be successful in the end\nAnd I mean she looked at what Delgado just said about Israel I mean this guy describes the sketches should nonstarter you ... and ... where is the price pounding him on that saying how dare you say that Israel is not a democracy you know what I mean he did what his statement was was just so off the wall and he gets away with that as well\nYou know during the call yesterday I was just sitting in during a debate you know ... I'm Sorry I'm Sorry I talked to over your head\nYou know I'm just saying he'd parachute into this district no connection and I've even seen the far left his how whacked out they are John south lived here what thirty forty years raised his family here served in the assembly as minority leader statewide candidate a couple of times\nThey're calling him a carpetbagger in Columbia county the guys lived here for decades\nDelgado has never ever even voted in this district and it's really an empty suit I think the more people take a look at what he stands for the more empty he becomes\nAnd now we're sending all of that that I think it's a hundred percent accurate and I would also add to it that fast it was known as one of the most substantive\nPublic figures out there really knowledgeable whether you agree with him and our new shoes he knows issues I'll bet you in the end most of the newspapers and the district wind up endorsing Delgado because they're all liberal and they just want to Democrats and when they want an anti Trump statement\nYeah that's true but that's why so many of our folks are just turning away\nFrom the mainstream media saying I I'm not dealing with this nonsense I Know I'm being lied to and John fast so I think would admit this willingly and an openly\nEven policy walk that means you're very studious he understands issues he knows what he's talking about isn't that what you want a congressman as opposed to somebody that doesn't support Israel one of our main allies in the ... the main ally in the middle east probably are only real ally over there\nOr somebody that has carpet bag is weighing parachuted in has zero connection and want to say he was born and raised in Schenectady\nHe was born in Schenectady he lived there for a while\nHe's in he's a product of New York city being put in here to try to steal this election we're not going to let that happen\nWell hey there you know the things that we used to take for granted that the voters would weigh the merits of individuals would look to see what experience I had with knowledge they possess\nA you know the uh commitment they've given to their communities no longer really hold true for a lot of voters it's are you for anti Trump you for anti abortion maybe one or two other issues and that's it\nI mean that the fish reality of the assessment now in politics has to be disturbing to people who believe in an informed electorate to have a vital democracy\nAbsolutely and it's sad ... you know it's so amazing to me to see the amount of information literally at our fingertips but yet people seem more uninformed than ever there are about politics and about so many other things they get these snippets and soundbites\nAnd there'd be in the letter round by a precedent far too often as not honest with them not honest brokers they're trying to dictate outcomes\nAnd be more editorialists than than reporters so it it's it's us trading for some of us but\nWe just keep going and going in and making our case out there and I do think that silent majority is going to speak I have never believed in this blue wave I think it's nonsense and I think that well we'll see pretty quickly whether right or wrong but I think that\nI mean that the fish reality of the assessment now in politics has to be disturbing to people who believe in an informed electorate to have a vital democracy\nWell absolutely and it's sad ... you know it's so amazing to me to see the amount of information literally at our fingertips but yet people seem more uninformed than ever there are about politics and about so many other things they get these snippets and soundbites\nAnd there'd be an Len around by a precedent far too often as not honest with them not honest brokers they're trying to dictate outcomes and be more editorialists than than reporters so it it's it's us trading for some of us but\nWe just keep going and going in and making our case out there and I do think that silent majority is going to speak I have never believed in this blue wave I think it's nonsense and I think that well we'll see pretty quickly whether right or wrong but I think that our folks are going to show up and get their job done\nYou know I just have to as an aside or mentioned the headline in the New York times today in New York Times has become I think a national embarrassment even though it keeps enjoying the prestigious position of being supposedly the greatest newspaper in America this is a headline see even I don't know if you saw an ad in today's New York\nTimes on the front page dealing with this massive army of five or eight thousand Central Americans marching towards our border this is on a news story that headline here's the headline\nTrump intensifies intensifies GOP effort to use race and immigration to sway the election\nI mean at the very least at or divorced it's a good story oh I'm a headline but for a news story to be headlined Trump intensified GOP effort to use race and immigration to sway elections have you seen Trump doing that\nNo not at all in any sane world what's coming at us from the border will be called an invasion but what it is\nAnd the threat to the nation\nIf people think that those folks are marching along they are not they are being trucked they get out and walk for photo ops George Soros and his\nI mean probably the worst person in this country may be George Soros he's funding this nonsense and you know what if you don't have borders you don't have a countryside support the president on this I don't see any indication that what the times what the times is saying is true but I Would say the grey lady has gone senile because they are ah they're out of control\nCould live just quickly you have a very interesting it's a district attorneys race in our rents are county Joel label awful was indicted but then the second was thrown out Cuomo was behind it there's no question about it the Democrats would love to get rid of your DNA Mary pat Donnelly the Democrat how's that going\nNuts height you know I I think very pat Donnelly nice enough person but zero prosecutorial experience has never tried a case here in New York state is not from what we can tell a supporter of the second amendment will not even answer the question of whether she'll enforce the safe astronaut which\nTells you that she's going to enforce it all your gun owners out there make no mistake she's going to try to enforce this and you notice how she runs from the governor you don't see the government anywhere near that raised no endorsements no support none of that because they know how popular he is over here\nMake no mistake she's going to try to enforce this and you notice how she runs from the governor you don't see the government anywhere near that raised no endorsements no support none of that because they know how popular he is over here\nRight now I work on our states prevention agenda so it's a series of about a hundred different health indicators that we have targets for over the next five to six years you know smoking rates drinking rates a mental health screening ... violence in the community things like that targets which we feel um experts in public health across the state\nAt our local health departments are hospitals should be working on along with their community to try to address um it lower overtime to ... help our community so it's very important work that we do your own people healthy um it saves money on the healthcare side Medicaid side things like that\nUm studies are very clear that every dollar you invest in public health and save money on the back in the treatment so somebody that's very important to meet all\nPersonally professionally I'm clinically\nWas a PHD in epidemiology let me ask you to put on your politicians had an answer a question of policy as a candidate for office dealing with marijuana I Do you feel about the possible is likely legalization of recreational pot and the implications epidemiological early that\nBomb so there's a few things there first there's the medicinal side of things um I did have the pleasure of working early on here at the state health department and the medical marijuana team back\nFrom governor Cuomo's actually called for clinical trials of medical marijuana or just something that's kind of outside the purview of an executive agency that's something that's more in the private sector so I got to read up a\nLot of literature and really see the benefits of um you know the CBD components of uh of marijuana\nAnd how can benefit things like epilepsy\nPain management Parkinson's and the data was pretty clear that there's definitely a positive benefit to marijuana for medical leave something that I definitely supported now\nTurning to the recreational side of things in outlook marijuana's been outlawed for a long time for the day it is very clear that you know tobacco smoke is more unhealthy than marijuana I think it's very clear that alcohol\nWas much more dangerous than marijuana and we're also see states around the country now legalized when you've got Canada which is just legalized I'm I'm personally in favor of legalization and taxation look at the economy in Colorado right now it's\nAbsolutely booming I Know people love ... New York to move out there not because of the marijuana but just in general a sense of marijuana become legalized out in the Colorado\nReal estate market jobs it's absolutely booming you know the death and\nThere's no connection as far as I Know and if you look there's no connection as far as I Know and if you look at death rates from automobile accidents there up significantly and oh there's every reason to believe or it's likely to be believed fault are based on those statistics\nNow turning to the recreational side of things in outlook marijuana's been outlawed for a long time for the day it is very clear that you know tobacco smoke is more unhealthy than marijuana I think is very clear that alcohol\nWas much more dangerous than marijuana and we're also see states around the country now legalized when you've got Canada which is just legalized I'm I'm personally in favor of legalization and taxation look at the economy in Colorado right now it's\nAbsolutely booming I Know people who have left New York to move out there not because of the marijuana but just in general a sense of marijuana become legalized out in the Colorado\nReal estate market jobs it's absolutely booming you know the ...\nThere's no connection as far as I Know and if you look there's no connection as far as I Know and if you look at that phrase from automobile accidents there up significantly and oh there's every reason to believe or it's likely to be believed fault are based on those statistics that it's related\nWell that was going to be my next point is we have to also set up the side of the worst myths so we have to look and see just like with\nDrinking we need to be able to check and see if people on at the airports are how there so that is one of the downsides of their ... products like this is it opens up the opportunity for people to be under the influence operating heavy machinery just like they would under prescription opiates\nOr alcohol so there does need to be the enforcement side on that side of the the equation\nWell let me ask you if you would and we're talking to Chris Davis who's a Republican candidate uphill fight of course we're a state Senate\nIn um a district that's represented by New Brunswick and it's a part of Albany county and part of the city of Troy view it give us a summary of what is your campaigns about and why you think you'll resident after more than Twenty years in office should be defeated\nWell here's the thing this is my second time through Iran and twenty sixteen as well and we're running his campaign more like you would run for a city council or county legislature race really grassroots really door to door really rely on volunteers the reason I'm running as I've lived here my entire life and\nI've lost for the last two three decades this area go downhill all one needs to do\nIs walk down the street from the city Albany and see all the red access on the buildings that vacant storefronts it's a mess small businesses are getting crushed homeowners are taxed to death\nThe roads are falling apart beneath our feet it's a joke to the taxpayers of this state so I decided to step up and run because I have a family be some tired of seeing people leave the state for opportunities elsewhere and then this government's answers to turn around and say gee\nWhy are people leaving we should raise taxes on the people that have stayed here that is absolutely the wrong formula\nClimate he pulled his well then the governor says the climate\nFiled the governor has been known to make false since before and so this is a sad excuse to say that people leave for better weather sure there is a better weather by their down south and it's one of the bonuses to leaving New York state but make no mistake people are doing it for better opportunities outside of New York state and that's why we need to work to address the corruption issues that we have\nI think we need term limits and one of the things that I'm going to do to help address corruption is exploiting every single vote I make tea on social media no one else is doing this there's going to be logical styles and the people deserve to know what the representatives are doing and what they're voting on and I'm going to be the first representative to explain to every single vote I make so you could hold me accountable no one else is doing this\nBecause already mentioned that used to be I probably still around an old joke in New York City and political circles that the difference between the New York city council in a rubber stamp is that at least the rubber stamp left an impression\nAnd I would say the same thing about Neal Breslin that's the difference between the president a rubber stamp is at least a rubber stamp leaves an impression is there anything that Neal Breslin is done to address the problems that you just outlined which I think are a hundred percent accurate that people in your district that this is the communities in your district face\nAnything positive to be said about Neal Breslin\nWell I'm Neal is a pretty nice guy to people who show up to your ribbon cutting still show up to the Democratic that next but that's\nThere's going to be logical thousands of people deserve to know what the representatives are doing and what they're voting on and I'm going to be the first representative to explain every single vote I make sure you can hold me accountable no one else is doing this\nIt was already mentioned that used to be as probably still around an old joke in New York City and political circles that the difference between the New York city council and a rubber stamp is that at least a rubber stamp left an impression\nAnd I would say the same thing about Neal Breslin that the difference between new president a rubber stamp is at least a rubber stamp leaves an impression ... think of anything then you'll Breslin has done to address the problems that you just outlined which I think are a hundred percent accurate that people in your district that this is the communities in your district face\nAnything positive to be talking about Neal Breslin\nWell I'm Neal is a pretty nice guy that people will show up to your ribbon cutting still show up to the Democratic that next but that's not what being represented that there's about being a representative as being a fighter for the people of your district for the third year in a row New York state has set out more money the federal government that has gotten back yet\nIf I'm elected I'm going to fight every single day to work with our federal representatives Schumer Jill a branch Tom go I'll even go to Washington if I have to testify and said we needed investment in this area the water lines are falling apart in our district Fred I mean there's actually Ross seeping into our drinking or Russian that's [noise] that's awful we can't\nBut that's the fault of Albany more than the federal government because they don't get ... they don't get applause when they fix our sewers or our roads but they do when they started a new project or give some you know some corporation that come into the state to create a hundred jobs one hundred million dollars or the like\nBut this circles back to why we need term on CCD need people who are going to get in there do some good and get the heck out I don't want to do this with my life I Want to get in to\nDo some good and get out that's what representation should be you step up to the plate do the best you can for the people and you get out of town and that's what you know Brazil has not done using absentee representative and we need somebody\nThat's going to get in there and fight for the people and that's what I'm going to do we need not just a million dollar crap\nI mean we really need billions now that of course probably unrealistic but that's the kind of investment that we need this area is one of the oldest son structures in the nation and you need somebody who's going to step up and fight and that's one of the things that I'm going to do\nTo you know he would address the lack of support from the Republican Party both in terms of Albany county in terms of the state wide party I mean the Republican Party does raise some money but as I gather they're giving you virtually no support at all is that correct\nRight so here's here's well say about about the party's locally we're very strong in the town of colonies of the town of Bethlehem we've got a great committee there and there have been behind me they helped me get on the ballot they helped me with the door to door and things however when you turn to the cities\nYou know the city a co host I'm the chairman in the city of hoses just me and a couple of commuting people we unfortunately don't have anyone in the city water of elite no one in green island in the city Albany we only have a handful committee member so there's not\nThat kind of support there unfortunately now it's one of the reasons I'm running for office has to help build the party back up to get people motivated to get involved so I think that's a very positive thing from the ... side of things unfortunately the s R C seat you know they\nHave a Republican campaign committee for the Senate has millions of dollars I mean they're running a lot of desperate races but they have a lot of money or they've had a lot it's\nRight we have we have sixty three seats I'm pretty sure we're having a lecture and all them I may be mistaken if there's ... out there but I understand that they have to fight for the seats that they need to keep we cannot let the state Senate fall to the Democrats hands or else all bets\nAre off more apt to point out more taxes all bets are off so I understand why they're investing\nHeavily in those areas however I Do think that as the Republican candidate for my second time around it would be great if they could just send you know a couple of ... something like that you know just to say we support you\nUnfortunately now it's one of the reasons I'm running for office has to help build the party backup get people motivated to get involved so I think that's a very positive thing from the ... side of things unfortunately the s R C seat you know they\nHave a Republican campaign committee for the Senate has millions of dollars I mean they're running a lot of desperate races but they have a lot of money or they've had a lot of us\nRight we have we have sixty three seats I'm pretty sure we're having a lecture and all them I may be mistaken if there's non Shashi it out there but I understand that they have to fight for the seats but they need to keep we cannot let the state Senate falls to the Democrats hands or else all bets\nAre off more so to point out more taxes all bets are off so I understand why they're investing\nHeavily in those areas however I Do think that as the Republican candidate for my second time around it would be great if they could just send you know a couple of ... something like that you know just to say we support you and be out there so you know ... when the seasons\nYes actually layer now adult Chris I mean if they offered you know health have you called them in the past or I mean they reached out to you and said look we can give you research materials we've got Frank and now we've got posted discounts opportunity for you have offered any kind of help at all\nSo we've gotten that through the county jail the I mean we've gotten the postage discounts for the ball marriage malice they've helped me with that on walks are cc there hasn't been financial support unfortunately however they connected me with volunteers but when you're running such a sizable campaign\nHe need as much help as you can get and so as we move forward in the future I'm hopeful that you know the the Koran pains are going to bring more attention to this district ... eventually the lines and get redrawn but this is the worst district outside of New York city enrollment rises three and a half the wrong\nIt's just basically a toss away district botched up because we need Republican candidates need Republican leadership all levels\nAnd that's what I'm bringing to the table we need to fight for these small businesses we got her dress the out of control energy bills no one's taking on national grid that something that I'm very passionate about\nThe constitution has been completely trashed in this area you know no one's defending the second amendment I'm defending it understanding entire constitution because I took an oath before God to decide it and I think that's what a representative is supposed to do and that's why I'm fighting\nChris what's that if any enthused level of enthusiasm or you're encountering for your state wide ticket especially mark mowing arrow do you get a sense of Republicans being happy and excited about 'em or do you find that they're not\nThat excuse me that George Pataki we're spending at a higher level of the Mariel combo infuriated Mario Cuomo butter to turned out to be absolutely correct\nWhat am I ... I guess this morning Chris Davis was going to read a quick note from John that's the Washington County dairy farmer on the monopolies that now dominates the farming industry and make it even more hard even harder for small dairy farms operator I don't have time to read the note I may do it another time\n... excuse me that George Pataki we're spending at a higher level in Mariel combo infuriated Mario Cuomo but it turned out to be absolutely correct\nWell my next guest this morning Chris Davis who's going to read a quick note from John that's the Washington County dairy farmer on the monopolies that now dominates or farming industry and make it even more hard even harder for small dairy farms operator I don't have time to read the\nNote I may do it another time but I can certainly point out what he was saying and he knows that the farm lobby one strong is no longer a strong enough to address this issue for much else out there I Would say certainly the small farmers farm lobby\nThanks I noted to our Chris Davis do the McLaughlin or as a kind of executives all of your this is Frederick are saying I have a great day until tomorrow and good luck on the lottery by by

way with the weather\n[noise] yeah so lots of driving lots of rain lots of closure as the flooding all that stuff so hey we are going to talk about the ... the three most important hormones\nThat are regulated with our three H ... program leptin ghrelin and cortisol so you want to add started off with that Dr Kelly\nSure yes I'm so leptin\nPositive thoughts of the week yes yes\nThank you okay so what are we talking about today Lisa Chabot on how are you how was your week there's a lot of neat exciting rain out there\nOh yeah tons of rain soccer's castle for the kids so yeah exactly you know driving [laughter]\nWe're we're we're all going to market and and I write with the weather\n[noise] yeah so lots of driving lots of rain lots of closure about the flooding all that stuff mhm so stay we are going to talk about the ... the three most important hormones\nThat are regulated where are these three age plus program leptin ghrelin and cortisol so you want to add started off with that Dr Kelly\nSure yes I'm so leptin ghrelin cortisol three very important hormones and that is one of the\nI I Would say our program is really focused around the balancing of the three because when they're out of balance losing weight is just an uphill battle yes so I swim\nIn half hour of cortisol but it's the other two that are\nReally coming to the forefront and this is what women need to know we need to learn about our bodies and our naturally occurring hormones can affect our appetite\nAnd our wheat exactly and so I Hope to sing on those really takes a huge obstacles away from dying right yes I mean here\nIt really does leptin ghrelin those it you're right a lot of women out there you guys know cortisol as cortisol stress hormones and when it is they're created and old high amounts\nIt is actually in short amount in short bursts it's a great hormone it helps us act under pressure complete deadlines but in a high amounts when the surge doesn't turn off is detrimental to our health and so that\nIn combination with these other two would be a perfect storm leptin\nIs an interesting one so it is created by fat\nIt tells it signaled our brain a particularly the hype is telling us which is a center of our brain that there is enough fat and our bodies and it's time to turn down the appetite so it's essentially it's like a Fox reporter\nReporting live from your fat cells skating lean about I'm hungry [laughter] with you because you're ...\nAnd so that ... and ... is a completely\nDifferent but on the same the same lines it secrete\nIt from our stomach cells very specialized stomach ... cells and our stomach and it created in response to hunger and it increases our appetite\nSo those two are leptin ghrelin and in combination with cortisol it's like the three ... three legs of the stool and if they are out of balance it topples over and its diets that as as we always said diets don't work and it's because\nThey really do throw off these hormones\nLike especially if you're not eating enough on a diet right if your if your calories are too low your ghrelin is going to elevate and that's why you're going to be hungry all day\nExactly their role in as it is if you're if you're yo yo dieting going through see no starvation mode the body is it the grill and just pumps out and it's it's almost impossible to to resist it's really difficult\nAnd you know it's really interesting about the growing is that it elevates as were sleeping but they're not eating some elements would wake up in the morning it it's\nThe court is all it's like the three ... three legged stool and if they are out of balance it topples over and its diets that as as they always said diets don't work and it's because they really do throw off these hormones\nEspecially if you're not eating enough on a diet right if your if your calories are too low your ghrelin is going to elevate and that's why you're going to be hungry all day\nExactly their role in as it is if you're if you're yo yo dieting going through see no starvation mode the body is it the grill and just pumps out and it's it's almost impossible to to resist it's really difficult\nExactly and you know what's really interesting about the growing is that it elevates\nAs were sleeping but they're not eating some elements we wake up in the morning and it's pretty much sky high so if we get them yeah like you know most people looking to lose weight what do they think\nOh I just won't eat boy that may have been really good today I didn't eat but meanwhile yeah so the topic right you don't eat breakfast or you just have coffee\nUm or you might have like a little carbohydrate for breakfast all of those things make role and\nEven to creep higher and so will make you even more hungry more hungry it's a day goes on but if you have like a nice approaching rich meal and that's why we started ... H program out with a nice a protein rich a protein drink in the morning super easy is it reflected\nAnd they had a sensitivity to chase scene or way those are the proteins that are in dairy um we would add it back in ... when you add something in you edited all day long so maybe you have um some Greek yogurt for breakfast and\nI'm I'm choosing your salad for lunch and\nUm maybe also sending

being a minus yeah and I was happy okay because before I\nSee the sea ... and I had been ... and I was happy and I came I was so happy and I rushed to my dad\nAnd I told him that I got beat you know what happened what happens I better look at me he smiled and he did not it did not bring needed this word I was expecting this word eight ... ...\nIt did not say congratulations and that was wasting

thinking you know bill I don't really get what you're saying because my only drive is to be happy to be right where I wanted to be to have everything that I ever wanted and that\nThen and only then I'm going to be happy just being a right where I've always wanted to be I have my iron a God Forbid your car and your kids and whatever it is that you think is going to keep you satisfied and that's going to be enough for you\nBut now I'm asking you to picture won the world would be like\nWithout ambition without without a drive for more now I'm willing to bet that there would be no America\nThe world would be in a very primitive state because rather than keep moving forward rather than\nPushing toward something better or rather than wanting to be better than we are now we would have decided that where we are is the most that humanity can every evolve we would have decided that right where we are is where we should be\nAnd things would be dire today\nBut something something as deep and and passionate as the American dream is built on the foundation that one day people came from everywhere from all across the world to this land a promise a land flowing with milk and honey\nAnd decided that they wanted more just\nBe light just want to add something on the top of what you say absolutely they came from friends they can find anger they came from across Europe\nAt that time you
