wanted to do something\nTo increase the relationship between the church and the school meet and work with the children so that's that's part of the ministry I definitely want to develop their\nCourse just started for you or with the school year within the last week and a half ago correct\nWell when you think about the [noise] I'm sure there are and you'll find\nCertain challenges and and and as you already mentioned getting to know everything with a pastor is getting to know everything right um what do what do you think will be some of the challenges that you'll have to face with a brand new deacon a brand new situation\nFor first of all it's it's interesting that you should ask that because\nI just did my first baptism recent oh and uh obviously I was prepared for it and a beautiful family I obviously went through and met with the family met the daughter met the ... got parents went to the process of getting them up to speed with their responsibilities\nBut until you do your actual first baptism you know there were some nerves there and you know I I might have even over doused the poor little girl with water and that's it you know a little something I struggle with with the mom and dad because uh\nI might have over port a little bit but it's again it's a learning curve but everything's new I mean I did a benediction an aberration ceremony at St Mark's just recently for the ... because I taught them in religious said back in the spring when I was still a parishioner at St Mark's\nSo I got to do that for the first time so there's a lot of first but the biggest toughest um\nOption that I find I'm struggling with a little bit and I'm getting better and time will obviously make it easier learning the parishioners names uh fortunately at St James a lot of them were name tags it's easy for them to remember deacon gel but for me to remember a lot of the names of the children that's something that I I Want to try to develop\nWhen I Would ever ... and please don't get a throne 'cause you measure methane or McMahon and he was phenomenal correct that\nI mean I I was never much [laughter] that break everybody's that he's ... yeah they'll come it'll come and

that you'll have there but it's interesting when you take on a one of the sacrament of when people come up I mean nothing's going to happen unless you know core he'll comfortable enough with\nWith that I never did practice back baptisms when I was ordained in Nineteen Seventy three did you learn more about\nThat it's interesting that you should say that father raped many years they did not but then they made it part of the program because they wanted the deacons to obviously be assigned to a parachute step right in so there were countless hours we practice with an actual dial that Saudi as it sounds yeah but I Know I Know you learn to process and\nYou learn how to use the oils and it's\nYou know the candle at I mean it's a process that obviously we've witnessed over the years or I have obviously being a\nA God parent but until you actually do it you know alive and and the day I did it was one family but it was quite a crowd there were probably thirty people on each side so there was a buzz in there and ah I knew the Holy Spirit would get me through it [laughter] I remember one sided baptized fourteen now and they said to me that's outlandish\n... [laughter] but uh you know they think that you will find through and I I I doubt the done one of these yet but when you first wedding or not only the I the whole reality of the wedding\nBut you have an advantage over me of course because you took part in one yourself of it but you know I I mean just the just the thought of I'm signing a marriage license and sending humans as you know vital statistics and all that and your signature on this has that kind of\nWeight they have to do it and it's got to be in and um but I think the idea of of ah one of the great things in the back and it will be the Sacramento about preaching you feel comfortable in that area\nWhat's funny I may have always maybe been a little over confident as a prospective preacher you know I've\nI've always enjoyed public speaking and I was onstage in high school and college and I and I thought it kind of readied me for it um but obviously I took three years I'm of\nPutting together ... you know during my formation and there were times that I thought I had a good homily written and my instructors might have said it was sub par and that kind of work the other way around where I thought maybe it was the one of my best efforts\nBut it's interesting when I got to say James one of the first things father art said was Ben he's reiterated this a few times\nThat homily should not be read from a script and I've gone with that sense and then three months I've done it I write down a few bullet points and I ... myself with it obviously the few days leading up\nAnd then once I get up you know to the pulpit ... um I take off and [noise]\nI rehearsed said enough the few days leading up but I make some minor changes and my mom's always been a stickler kidding ally\nTogether ... you know during my formation and there were times that I thought I had a good homily written and my instructors might have said it was sub par and that kind of work the other way around where I thought maybe it was the one of my best efforts\nBut it's interesting when I got to say James one of the first things father art said was Ben he's reiterated this a few times\nThat homily should not be read from a script and I've gone with that sense and then three months I've done it I write down a few bullet points and I ... myself with it obviously the few days leading up\nAnd then once I get up to the pulpit ... um I take off and [noise]\nI rehearsed said enough the few days leading up but I make some minor changes and my mom's always been a stickler kidding ally that she wants me to keep it within ten minutes and I was told you know when I was going to the process really to try to keep it seven eight nine minutes and uh\nSo far I fluctuate a little bit I topped out at twelve but the last one I had was nine so I'm trying to remain consistent but as far as\nHow I prepare so far because I'm kind of a neophyte I just concentrate on that Sunday's gospel and I try to you know bring my thoughts and keep the light or you know I'm not skilled enough to blow when he went away with scripture ready to anything like that so I Try to\nYou know work off some familiarity and some stories that I utilize myself and I think it's been successful do ... I think\nFrom what I've heard this parishioners seem very pleased and my delivery and and what I've had to say\nWell that's again going back to your experience or background of your life and and and it's wonderful when you could do that I think sometimes in preaching you may find the gospel of a sudden there's a lot of things and you have to pick and choose and it's like ... and other times I'm you might be struggling and I I I Know it's really\nI Wish they would do something with some of the ... the selections during the time of year where you have the gospels with the same theme three or four weeks in a row and like oh my God [laughter] but but but you've that make to get a little more introspective and then to become so people but it's true though what you said\nSometimes you you you walk out the approach something you gave it\nHe said you know this like lord I think served you well I think it does I cook gospel you may hear nothing other times you may be oh my gosh ... or ... you got to ... ... uh and um all of a sudden here achieved what a great ...\nSo the Holy Spirit or some some words of ever without\nA doubt and I was told that right from the beginning and there was a couple of weekday masses obviously my job doesn't allow me to do that often like I'll Try to do it on Saturday morning if I can wear initially I was unprepared and father I Would say I think you're going to preach today and you get up there and\nYou figure it out you know you pray on it and uh [noise] you know obviously weekday masses are more of a quip reflection anyway and and I like to touch on the saint of the day if there is on it yourself you know it's a learning process just like everything else\nYeah then become comfortable with as a venture where I think and then um\nThey becomes even more joy for for you and um my very best wishes but my father or the other area is [noise] I don't know if you've uh thought a lot about this because when you become a deacon ... as I became a breach of definitions of\nImages of what you think you know what to expect and what\nYour your rover function is going to be but uh did you have any or develop any real\nWas unprepared and father I Would say I think you're going to preach today and you get up there and\nYou figure it out you know you pray on it and uh you know obviously weekday masses are more of a quip reflection anyway and and I'd like to touch on the saint of the day if there is he on it yourself you know it's a learning process just like everything else [laughter]\nYeah then become comfortable with his eventual a I think and and um\nThey becomes even more joy for for you and um my very best wishes about my father or the other area is [noise] and I don't know if you've uh thought a lot about this because when you become a deacon as it became preached you have different versions of\nImages of what you think you know what to expect and what\nYour your rover function is going to be but uh did you have any or develop any real personal goals of ... I Would like to uh Saturday hacking at your lifetime as a deacon unfold\nSure first and foremost I was hoping to be\nAs I mentioned sent to a parish where the school and not only was fortunate there but St James is a very diverse parish and so I've tried to get involved initially as much as I can um you know being on the parish advisory council\nThat you may can you're not able to go through with
