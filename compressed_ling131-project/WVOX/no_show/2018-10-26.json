real world on the real life\nIt's not too far from the truth\nToo far indeed\nI was walking the other day it's going for a little walk [noise] um I don't know if you know the Fleetwood neighborhood but uh\nIt was written up in the New Yorker recently I think it was called a win of Westchester Islam best kept secrets or something like that so lovely little area\nUh they've got a couple of pizza places fantastic pizza places they got a couple of ah age in restaurants you know he got sushi usually corner they got a the the watering hole on the corners Maggie's planes that in the fleet what section of Mount Vernon it's the northern part about it now you go over there\nAnd you are you keep going down a what's the main road there is a gram it and you go down grandmothers and you keep going down graviton and you come up to that teenager section which is over by Bronx bill now if you stop before that intersection at you stop the car and you look up to your right there is a little lovely staircase that leads down to a path through the woods\nOr the woods [laughter] this is the euphemistic name we give it because it's really just a strip of land in between two ... a suburban housing developments but it's the woods\nSo if you go and you go for a walk through there that is the words that I was going for a walk through it's a lovely place it really is it get a nice way to get away from the whole life of Westchester or just to take a moment to go out in nature and uh I was going for the spark the other day [noise]\nAnd uh\nThere was a [laughter] well let's say there are there was a group of um I was a group of teenagers\nNot much unlike myself several years ago not even\nWho were doing um something that\nIs a not acceptable\nYou know it's becoming more acceptable\nBut right now it's still not not cool and you could smell it from a mile away sucking through the woods and and you you know you get that smell it hit you right in the face just pro and you're walking and you go okay some these guys are doing it over here and ah you walk in\nAnd uh you know I'm going for walks I didn't have my dog at the time you see this is a place where many people take their dogs for a walk but I was just going for just a regular type walk I already walk the dog she was pretty tired and are going to go for a longer walk anyway anyway\nWhich just walking on my own and that these kids over there and uh I just got this terrible large and I guess if you're out there listening to the radio which I guarantee you they are not uh the next time I see you see I was wearing that's great suit uh 'cause I was coming back from from a meeting with somebody that I needed to look for and uh\nYou know it's becoming more acceptable but right now it's still not not cool and you could smell it from a mile away sucking through the woods and and you you know you get that smell it hit you right in the face just pro and you're walking and you're all okay some of these guys are doing it over here and ah you walk in\nAnd uh you know I'm going for walks I didn't have my dog at the time you see this is a place where many people take their dogs for a walk but I was just going for just a regular type walk I had already walk the dog she was pretty tired and are going to go for a longer walk anyway anyway\nJust walking on my own and then these kids over there and uh I just got this terrible large and I could if you're out there listening to the radio which I guarantee you they are not uh the next time I see you see I was wearing this great suit\nUh 'cause I was coming back from from a meeting with somebody that I needed to look for and quite frankly I enjoy wearing suits anyway so I was wearing gray suit and uh I was walking through the woods\nAnd I see these kids and they see me ...\nAnd you know they got that unmistakable look that you get when you're doing this thing that you're not supposed to be doing it and that this guy's gotta catch you because here I Am looking like a undercover federal agents or something great suit and a black tie\nI'm walking through the woods and there they are the other side of the other is there and I say I'm you know they're very casual [laughter] I'm sure you've done this to now don't be saying oh this is terrible these kids were maybe not the specific thing but they've done the ... this is a universal human experience I'm sure\nIt's when you're doing something that you know you're not quite supposed to be doing and somebody comes along\nSo what'd you do you uh you don't want to be all you know you don't immediately do that you know you don't do that you you want to be cool about it you want to pretend like\nNothing's happening here but uh I'm going to leave [laughter] and so you are you look\nAnd you look away and you start walking in your act real cool you know look back and you just start walking and this is the thing is everybody up and so I ah came walking up to these kids and I saw him and I saw the turn and walk away and I've got to have a mind to just go [laughter]\nOh it's terrible the way you want to mess with people who can you imagine now because\nObviously they saw me they've ... the cool turn and walk away and so they're starting to walk if I double my pace and you have a foot coming out which they would start to like ... because you're not you can't look back you know you're not you're walking away you have to be not a ... we were just walking\nSo they could put that come in and start to look at look back you just let out a lot [laughter] I'm off they go out [laughter] [laughter]\nOh gee isn't it great to live in America [laughter]\n[noise] oh lay in\nThis country no no I'm sure it's all over the world\nAll over the world these kids doing things and they're not supposed to be doing it's like when you come across kids drinking in the woods but uh they usually that's at night and usually that's a bit more dangerous because of drunk kid is more liable to rich in the mouth and then the kid doing something else so\nI Try to keep my wife said to them to the mid afternoon when it's nice and light out\nNobody can jumped me from behind and I can't see [laughter] I'm gonna do it next time I'm going to do it I was just going to let out a ... yellow and and maybe I'll chase after him a little bit [laughter] uh gee\nI only say this because I did their position many times okay I've been doing in the woods come across by other people okay I'm just going to say that I wasn't doing anything nasty I just you don't want to\n[noise] oh lay in this country no no I'm sure it's all over the world\nAll over the world these kids doing things I Know they're not supposed to be doing it's like when you come across kids drinking in the woods but ah they usually that's at night and usually that's a bit more dangerous because of junk kid is more liable to rich in the mouth than the kid doing something else so\nI Try to keep my wife said to them to the mid afternoon when it's nice and the light out\nNobody can jumped me from behind and I can't see [laughter] I'm gonna do it next time I'm going to do it I'm just going to let out a ... yell and and maybe I'll chase after him a little bit [laughter] uh gee\nI only say this because I did their position many times okay I've been doing in the woods come across by other people okay I'm just going to say that I wasn't doing anything that they I just you don't want to be caught by people when you're with your friends in the woods you want to be in your friends in the woods you know that's how it goes without going to say\n[laughter] oh my goodness well\nThe other thing the teachers that the woods can teach you teach me a ... there there was a very good at showing me that I don't really know very much at all\nBecause uh if if you've ever did you ever approach the world\nWith an inquisitive mind\nI ask is a serious question\nDo you\nWith the intent\nTo ask questions to look around and wonder\nUh I suspect\nThat this is not a very common thing I Would suspect\nBut I Can't speak for every one [noise]\nBut I like to um to step out into a place and a and a shore myself that I Will be going someplace where I'm not going to know something and I want to formulate into words the thing that I Would like to know\nAnd the woods is a very good at that I don't know if you've ever given this a shot but if you go for a walk in the woods in the daytime preferably when there were no kids doing anything and or you can find\nJust something that you've never seen before like a like an interesting shaped thing on the ground or or a particular leave\nAnd you could pick it up and you could look at it and right away you can come up with all kinds of questions how does this work what the purpose of this what why did this ... color differently from this like you know you can have all kinds of questions\nAnd a right away right away when I started saying these things are going to get people that go out what do you mean what I mean why why why you can look it up you can look come on you can look it up that's what the Internet it's great for this magic day of the age of the Internet you can look it up\nAnd or the the the other thing this is um I find two classes of thought that come around for for for this or that\nAnd then or the the the other thing this is um I find two classes of thought that come around\n\nIt just in casual conversation you've ever stopped someone on the street and just said what do you think gravity works [laughter]\nAnd the lesson I may not be qualified to answer these questions I Know people study for years to try and answer some of these things but it's still fun to think about\nAnd uh it's still fun to just sit and think I think anyway I think what do you think I don't know who ... who is fair it's Mr Thing look out [laughter] a what a some people some people put out a suit and tie in the morning and they go into their work\nAnd everything they do is very serious [noise]\nI'm not one of those people [noise]\nBecause I spend too much time asking stupid question but I should just go look it up [noise]\nDo you ever look at a dog who was really curious about something [noise]\nThat same one that I Walk through I saw those kids [noise]\nAnd I get all my questions\nI bring my dog over there\nAnd this one time we came across a low ball\nMaybe two feet high looked like it was part of something many years ago but now at nothing to do with anything\nThere's a little low wall little manmade thing and it was a small hole in the wall\nAnd uh the the dog she sniffed around like dogs do and\nNormal course of being out and she came across this little hole\nIn our whole demeanor changed her whole demeanor [noise]\nShe became fascinated with the small hole in the war\nYears were up [noise] nipping into it she was hauling at it\nVery curious to what was happening\nInside the tools and so I became curious\nIsn't that curious [noise]\nThe curiosity of some other animals some other\nThing I don't know ... those species that's my dog the curiosity of my dog barks within me a form of curiosity [noise]\nAn energy transfer from one thing that that ...\nThat sounds stupid to put it like that but it felt like this I was not at all curious about what was in the wall there until I saw my dog paddling added and added with her\nShe became fascinated with the small hole in the wall\nOr years were up [noise] nipping into it she was hauling at it\nVery curious to what was happening\nInside this little hole and so I became curious\nIsn't that curious [noise]\nThe curiosity of some other animals some other\nThing I don't know ... those receiving that's my dog the curiosity of my dog barked within me a form of curiosity [noise]\nIt was like an energy transfer from one thing that acts that sounds stupid to put it like that but it felt like this\nI was not at all curious about what was in the wall there until I saw my dog pong at it and forget it with their ears up and going at it and thinking what is that what did that and I got I got to thinking that too is that that I sit down over there and of course I got my little tricks and clever schemes I mean she's just piling up the outside [laughter]\nOut of the way dog here is how it's really done I bought my flashlight I gotta stick and I've started poking around in there [laughter]\nBut all of the sudden here's the two of us me and the dog sitting at this low wall trying to get in the little hole in the wall trying to think what it is and we're both fascinated by what's in there I'm sure there was another animal or maybe the droppings what other animal or something like that\nBut I never found it I never found anything I never saw anything else alive we left that wall both still unsure of what was in there\nBut the point I I take away from this is the the curious ness of the fact that the curiosity was transferred from her to me\nJustin by the way she acted\nAnd the same is true going in the other way\nIf I expressed tremendous curiosity towards something have you ever started digging in the snow\nAnd the dog comes over and start we'll dig with you that's the same kind of thing they want to know what you're trying to get at it must be good because they're really working hard at it so I Want a piece of that don't don't you know don't keep all the buried treasure to yourself I'm going to come and get part of that [noise]\nAnd it's a curious thing a curiosity moves around\nI think I've mentioned this on the show before if you stand out on the street right and you get a friend [noise]\nAnd uh if you're both start looking up this is Beth of course in Manhattan where the buildings are very tall you stand in the street and you both look up\nJust anything really just the corner of the building of a break on a building and you just stand there and look you're going to get other people who are passing you eventually there'll be focused on whatever it is they're focused on they'll pass you and your friends standing there looking up at this thing and they too will look up\nHis infectious\nCuriosity is infectious how curious is that\nThe common answer to a question as to look it up\nI suppose we it's hard to say\nIf I were to put myself in the position of the millennial telling somebody else to look it up because I\nDo [noise] it's hard to admit you don't know\nWithout\nAlso kind of subtly implying that you know how to find out so when you say look it up what you're admitting is I don't know but\nClearly I'm smart because I Know how to find the answer but you by asking that question to me obviously don't because you're asking the question so look it up [laughter] or by saying look it up\nBecome an answer to a question as to look it up\nI suppose we it's hard to say\nIf I were to put myself in the position of the millennial calling somebody else to look it up because I\nDo [noise] it's hard to admit you don't know\nWithout\nAlso kind of subtly implying that you know how to find out so when you say look it up what you're admitting is I don't know but\nClearly I'm smart because I Know how to find the

to the solution\nBut I Wonder if there were no way to look it up what Ben\nI must ask my elders what was it like before the Internet\nHow did you ask questions or look things up I suppose the the

Party wasting its crime in Yonkers\nWell I don't think they're wasting their time but I think that there's doubts as to whether a Republican\nAnd when a city wide election in Yonkers anymore and I think that's playing into the the uh the problem because this mayor span are ones for a third term next year as a Democrat which he is then a Republican should put up a candidate\nAnd they should use this term limits issue but again there is not a there is not a big um farm team\nFor the Republican Party in Yonkers you have McLaughlin some of the other council members are current and former\nDon't

we behave [noise]\nIs there a tipping point when does it lead to violence how much is predisposition how much is frustration\nClinton the most frustrated people in the world with those who feel they can't at time to express themselves will react circumstances but say you [noise]\nI say that we're I Believe that we are here to constantly observed of thoughts\nAnd that it's best done of course as you know I indicate medicate meditation is one of the best way to do that\nAnd so I Believe that if we are constantly reflecting on our emotional responses and what they feel like and what they look like [noise]\nUm what will happen is we will ask us ... what is angering me why I Am I upset and not be afraid to look at that\nAnd when we are actively involved in the process of our own thoughts we can monitor more deeply the emotional currents\nThat occur as we look at our thoughts and try to understand what it is\nThe tipping point is to me when we refused to look at our own thoughts we are leading us sounds ultimately to more no more suppressed upset meant um let me\nGo go ahead I'm Sorry which can\nThen make us more vulnerable to spontaneous reactions that can appear as trial and\nSo if we hear you correctly you're talking about examining wants for thoughts but in that also examining one's feelings and separating them from convictions because thoughts are they your convictions or are they just your emotional reactions to things [noise]\nI see that bottom line um our thoughts are both and very strongly connected to what we often don't really look at a belief systems\nMore and more suppressed upset meant um let me\nGo go ahead I'm Sorry which can\nThen make us more vulnerable to spontaneous reactions that can appear as violent\nSo if we hear you correctly you're talking

patterning the way we think in general I respond and it produces often without up being very conscious of it evidence of ourselves what we have colored in life\nWill cancel conviction themselves lead to violence the world the history of the world is filled with religious fanatics killing people because they thought their Supreme Being was smarter than yours [noise]\nYes those are their belief systems could lead lead to violence the real the understanding is that if you can come to a point where you simply say I don't know and very few of us get there we convinced that we now\nAnd we can interpret everything based upon what is set in ... outwardly by the world and often we cat\nBut doesn't the phrase I don't know where the emotion I don't know lead to the search for certainty uh and then hearing to believe however wacky sometimes\nHowever I'm sorry however wacky sometimes\nYeah it can be wacky um hey we are very imperfect beans and to understand that is to look at the human part of ourselves and face the emotional current\nI mean just think about a group we can we are men fly planes into buildings thinking that they would have a wonderful time in the after night life was Seventy two virtual\nWacky it's wacky to you but not to those who participate in\nThe point that is correct and will we ever overcome that they use the a period a thousand years from now when people won't have those kinds of wacky things that make them feel better about uncertainty\nI Believe it and change and I do believe that as long as managed reflecting on himself and his thoughts and\nAllowing himself to reflect on his world that change will come because we're made to change the one thing that doesn't change is changed but we have to be active participants in that change\nAnd just managed reflecting on himself and his thoughts and allowing himself to reflect on his world that change will come because we're made to change the one thing that doesn't change is change but we have to be active participants in that\nWhat the country was panic by this and it took years to recover the bureau of investigation was set up and there have been twenty five year old ... Hofer\nAnd tens of thousands of Americans were arrested based on the Espionage Act in Nineteen Seventeen and tens of thousands were deported without due process the country was panic absolutely panicked\nAnd people need to go back and take a look at that what's interesting um\nHad perhaps the same number of pipe bombs so far there hasn't been panic and it's a new state of differentiation between Nineteen Ninety and and and twenty eight to him in the fact that the reaction so far has not been what a panic my guess is that we had been steel buyer events like September\nEleventh yeah and a whole host of terrorist activities a mall shootings and so forth when we had become more to this type of stuff that have you but it's quite interesting to cast of the differences between that and now\n... I guess we're talking about the pipe bombs and some of the comparisons between what happened back in the early part of the twentieth century uh speaking of these kinds of things to show me if I may go there\nYou talked with CIA people you talk with John rules [noise] quite frankly aren't you supposed to get away with these kinds of black ops and avoid this kind of revelation of what is who we missed view Saudi Arabia really is which is a malevolent existence\nAs you know if my column last week um [noise] I posed to three possibilities with Saudi Arabia first they would deny which they did second king Solomon was authorized to investigation what she's done and Kurd and this is obviously sarcastic\nThat that law that bin Laden would come out and say of course I did it\nAnd I was taking

jam in Vietnam in Nineteen sixty three\nYou guys tortured people look what you did in the war on terror you rent dish and you know I'm just following your league so what's the big deal obviously that

would deny which they did second king Solomon with authorizing investigation what she's done and Kurd and this is obviously sarcastic\nThat that law that bin ... would come out and say of course I did it and I was taking it from your book look what you guys did after World War two you assassinated Patrice Lumumba in the early Nineteen sixties in the Congo you tried to kill Castro with the mafia you'll feel those then jam in Vietnam in Nineteen sixty three\nYou guys tortured people look what you did in the war on terror you rent dish and you know I'm just following your lead so what's the big deal obviously that with sarcastic\nOr the incompetence on the part of the Saudis is is hard to imagine\nBut in many ways what countries do turkey is [laughter] not example not a lot a shining example of human rights and quite frankly the Israelis use assassination they knocked off a number of Iranian scientists\nTo wrap my mind which which is which is a question for you [noise] really the kinds of things that we care about liberal democracy and sort of at the borders to a certain degree\nHow what Charles defies the country are doing these kinds of things in all countries do with the best the worst she doesn't it really relegate the discussion to what kind of a country Saudi Arabia's and why we friends with them about\nThat because as Trump said rightly for people to but the sheer ... of how this was handled if people are just as to how that country is being governor what\nA fundamental contradiction in problem in Saudi Arabia was that there has to be reform and if there was not sufficient for them they would be a revolution or knew me or who or an assassination but if reform like too quickly it could obviously\nFor secretary the same outcome and so how do you navigate those boundaries is extremely difficult and if the operation of the secret services in Saudi Arabia are any representation of the ability of the government we should be very worried\nNow what about the role and the ... as you know the the old acts are my enemies enemy is my friend we have an obligation and a relationship with the Israelis we have the jokes to position between Iran\nOr Persians and the

provide you with it\nNow getting to more the the reality of a health care\nAnd America this days the president gave a speech the other day yesterday\nDiscussing the loading of drug costs you pick the expensive drugs it's a good speech while these drugs are drugs that are high end drugs mainly chemotherapy and he was comparing the fact that American plays play multiple multiple times\nDon't know if you imagine what how does this impact research you know isn't a big part of the cost of of drugs in this country to to the fact that the research is conducted here\nUm that's a good question um I just tell you I'm just going to move a little bit to the other side of it last week I talked about a drug that now used to treat leukemia and lymphoma that was developed by Florida [noise] and\nUh the cost of treatment is about four hundred thousand dollars a year the company recoup the entire research program in one year ha ha because they charge enough money to the first twenty seven hundred patients\nYes the research is a big part of it but just remember the highest paid executives in the corporate world our pharmaceutical executives making twenty thirty forty million dollars a year [noise]\nUm I'm going to point out that I get that we should have incentives but when we have pharmaceutical industry spending the largest amount of money to lobby Congress the highest paid executives\nIt seems to me it's not about research it's about reward for the people in the business so it may be may be an executive with with with work is not going to make thirty million dollars a year and he's got to step Fifteen million dollars a year\nCame here in the form of that was developed by Florida [noise] and uh the cost of treatment is about four hundred thousand dollars a year the company recoup the entire research program in one year because they charge enough money to the first twenty seven hundred patients\nYes the research is a big part of it but just remember the highest paid executives in the corporate world our pharmaceutical executives making twenty thirty forty million dollars a year [noise] um I'm going to point out to you that I get that we should have incentives\nBut when we have pharmaceutical industry spending the largest amount of money to lobby Congress the highest paid executives\nIt seems to me it's not about research it's about reward for the people in the business so it may be that may be an executive with with with work is not going to make thirty million dollars a year he's got to step Fifteen million dollars a year or whatever it is\nBut I'm not there is a need for the cost them and that could be ... by getting rid of two things getting lawyers out of the business of toward and you know because many companies drug companies that soon after the fact\nThat the adverse effects and that drives up the cost of healthcare\nTalked to Chris so the insurance companies to act as an enabler of this though I mean no one would dance charging individual person four hundred thousand dollar yes that was the market\nYou know when it when it comes out of the individuals pocket there's a there's a there's a firestorm the there's a lot of nefarious stuffed between insurance companies middlemen and everybody else and unfortunately because we have this hyphenated system with so many so many fingers in the pot\nNobody's controlling the outcome of the costs Christian right and it died they need money but a lot of money is spent because the FTA in the drug companies are and the lawyers are involved\nChris thank you very much for the call we go next to Anthony Anthony you're almost Dr sundberg every morning in the morning\nGentleman ally upgrades that calm I I called about IEDs constantly year surface I lost my family physician\nAbout uh ten years ago because he went to that system I couldn't afford it\nAnd one thing I'd like to ask your friend out because this is this is what brought me out of it while they accept your insurance payments it doesn't affect you at the duck or really does is increase should it's optical by two thousand dollars that was that was the situation\nAnd interesting that's interesting that's an interesting way to put it yeah you know I think unfortunately this there's a new a new style of medicine and I don't I think it's going to have to be for those that can afford it and want access to a physician is not going to be something that the average individual is going to benefit from\nA there are people that can write a check out and ... and they want access to the doctor twenty four seven\nAnd they're going to get it and uh but it's not going to be a cost saving ... I think you're right about that Anthony that's a good point and I think it's going to something that's going to buy some people sign up for this if they don't get to some lending and figure out exactly what it's really going to cost them\nWell I've actually been to the doctor too because he didn't realize\nThat he had a over fifty percent of the space ... Medicare that automatically bump them out on it it really it's really a risk um and that's why Medicare for all will never work because this country will always have to tears tears up health care and those who can afford private ... cat\nAnd for Medicare for all the work everybody has to be in the ...\nNo I agree that's that's why I don't think Medicare for all it's going to be the outcome of the system I as I mentioned before I think that there should be an option to buy into Medicare\nBut it should not be required I think that we must maintain a of the ability to choose listen I don't want to be in the system I want to be in a private citizen woman and I want to have ... I Wonder if they'll call my doctor or be seen today if I'm really sick I don't wanna work waiting a clinic for nine hours\nThere's got to be a balance between the two and I am I'm very wary about this a Medicare for all I think\nFifty percent of the space on Medicare that automatically bump them out ... it really it's really a risk um and that's why Medicare for all will never work because it costs you will always have to appear as not being here some health care and those who can afford private ... ant\nAnd for Medicare for all to work everybody has to be in the ...\nNo I agree that's that's why I don't think Medicare for all is gonna be the outcome of the system I as I mentioned before I think that there should be an option to buy into Medicare\nBut it should not be required I think that we must maintain a lot of the ability to choose listen I don't want to be in the system I want to be in a private citizen woman and I want to have I Wonder if they'll call my doctor or be seen today if I'm really sick I don't want to work waiting the clinic for nine hours\nThere's got to be a balance between the two and I am I'm very weary about this a Medicare for all I think that's going to be a problem thank you\nAnthony thank you very much for the call it is nine twenty three you're listening to politics in your house starting Dr Victor Starbucks the phones are open six three six zero one one zero we go next to Eric Eric you're on TALK just turned ...\nGood morning America morning Dr one morning bought and how are ya oh younger\nOkay now I had an interesting thing happened I got a call from my pharmacy over the summer that a drug I was taking a\nWas removed from the market because it was found that the generic manufacture was not producing incorrectly and it's causing cancer [noise]\nJeeze that's interesting Eric I'm ... you know we\nAre ... are you at liberty we don't want you to ah and then again I mean well the the\nUm hey is the brand name is uh was dying man um but it's a generic as so a ... can ... is the generic name\nGood grief and I take a drug laws are often yeah\nDepending upon who the manufacturer was there's a a by product that comes out of the truck that needs to be and you know you read it before they actually do the the uh packaging of the truck\nYou know and that's interesting is that you know if that was in the process a process thing of it or if it was intent\nWas actually in the process and it's a no Marta struck originally Novartis had no problem in their own manufacturing ... when it went to a Chinese ah\nAh manufacture a about it and they were making the raw product and distributing the rock product to other\nA generic manufacture manufacturers actually yes they're actually just people really are imprinting the drug and uh that's who was getting out there so some of it bothered you haven't been notified possibly because you weren't exposed to those brand\nBut that that that makes a lot of sense that you bring up an interesting point because the the move to a generic drugs is a way to lower the cost\nThe question is whether the FDA is as diligent in monitoring the drugs that are produced by brand name companies when they go through all the research as opposed to a generic companies take over and start selling at a lower rate\nOddly doctor and Eric is what my daughter does for a living in Michael ... Michael biologist than examines clean rooms for companies like Jay and Jay and Merck and a big part of their job that hearing to the FDA requirements for how you keep it clean room and what what may be in there and testing is holiday so whatever brings up\nIn the in this process thing is a byproduct that's called and the M. A. which is a known carcinogens that they're supposed to\nYou weren't exposed to those brand\nBut that that that makes a lot of sense that you bring up an interesting point because the move to generic drugs is a way to lower the cost\nThe question is whether the FDA is as diligent in monitoring the drugs that are produced by brand name companies when I go through all the research as opposed to when generic companies take over and start selling at a lower rate\nOddly doctor and our guest is what my daughter does for a living room I couldn't my microbiology ... than examines clean rooms for companies like Jay and Jay and Merck and a big part of their job at that hearing to the FDA requirements for how you keep it clean room and what what may be in there and testing and followed I saw on earth brings up\nIn this process thing is a byproduct that's called N. D. N. A.\nWhich is a known carcinogen that they're supposed to remove before they make the right and the company in China was not removing it and you have to set the limit the company you know you know as I said no part is it's still on the market's doing the artist it's still on the market through\nYou know a bunch of other manufacturers\nHowever Chinese manufacture was not\nRemoving that uh and and then yeah may and you know nobody knew how much is what I was gonna say and that was one of the questions that want to pose was [noise]\nUm this can lead to liver cancer\nYeah so so the springs I have a good point Eric and I think it's something I don't want to I don't want to be a a an individual that's gonna mean China but this is not the first time that I've heard\nThat the Chinese and the reference to um make profits have by some of the rules that were necessary and I I think it's one of the dangers we have for exporting things to countries that don't have the standards we have\nAn China being a huge manufacture it has done other things that have caused a U.S to reach the I'm In the quality and even the safety of their products Hodgson example\nDr given the name of your show pollock they send you a health doesn't it bother you when politicians railed against a restrictions and\nControl regulate I'm I'm reading knows I'm reading a no Michael Lewis' book about that different I'll share with you but I'm going to tell you that we must have rules and regulations because if we don't\nPeople will abuse the system that life is it is it'll never change and yes there are good people that I always do the right thing but there are some of the ferries people that for profit or all the reasons will do the wrong thing to talk to the pressure put\nOn my daughter at different companies cannot\nLet stocks go that was slightly tainted she had to put a career on the line to others and a professor and I\nI it's very difficult to be an honest person when there's financial or other pressure on you Eric that's a good call Eric Craig calls start I'm Glad you're not taking it and I hope I don't call or second had that I'll lose your head [laughter] thank you so\nMuch it is nine twenty eight doctor we don't have any other calls but we do have you and there's always things on your mind doctor a lot of people are concerned about this new a virus\nOr whatever it is that oh you're asking the nervous system of these children yes when I was reading about it before we came in today they have not like isolated a virus it's seems to rear its ugly head episodic

evolutionary although the that will go on to win and the deer who bought out here to be ...\nBut you cannot even introduce a resolution shady keep eighty percent of the fossil fuels underground\nMark I wanted to ask you about the New York state for the ads as New York it deeply indebted potentially Seventeen point nine billion dollars\nNow that is true that I've had reservations about the gubernatorial actions of of a president governor\nIn New York actually I live in Massachusetts but of Andrew Cuomo and it seems to me very good in announcing few projects\nAnd they're going to cost a lot of money but I think it's fair to say he won't be around we have to pay off the bills well actually the is much higher if you throw in the public authorities and he runs about fifty six billion dollars or so now wait a second stop and explain the public authorities\nFor the few who may not understand how we do it in New York state well this was a creation of a Robert Moses ah in order to evade the state constitution requirement that wall\nUm public debt of the state be approved by the taxpayers so they created these KUAZ our government agencies called authorities\nWhich still pretty much pledged the full faith and credit of the state when they incur the debt but that they do not have to go out and and get permission now one of the things I did when I was one of the ...\nAnd as a law student for them I wrote a law that gave taxpayers the right to sue for illegal expenditure taxpayer funds\nThe first lawsuit was filed under that was a challenge to finance and all the Empire State pleasure because you're probably number ... right so he decided it was an interesting deal right what does that can stop and explain just how interesting it was it had to do with the county and city and the state correct\nSo risk one who's the mayor for what forty five years or something I got the county which ain't tech and we had nothing to do with to basically building empires de plaza got a few things he wanted like skating rink and the performance art center the egg [noise]\nUh and then he leaves it to the state and that way Nelson Rockefeller the governor that point could not I\nHave to go and get to publish permission to do the dead and corn and get to a point or the patron disposition for\nStudent for them I wrote a law that gave taxpayers the right to sue for illegal

and get to a point or the patronage positions for like the maintenance workers and the you know the low level staff that still you know twenty thirty forty thousand dollar job\nSo we suit on that are saying that it was an illegal sort of convention of the state constitution and unfortunately was\nBut let go back for one second because if a point you skipped over you said it but I Want everybody to understand that in order for the state to take on that kind of dead they would have had to go to the to the people and ask for a positive vote right that is correct and this way they got around that right\nAnd almost all the authority dead is designed to get around that public ... about the only thing I can recollect in recent years\nThat we voted on and pick me about it on one or two environmental bonds and maybe some labor you know dropped out the bonds I think all of that debt should in fact be put on the table I think the authorities should be required to follow the same\nFor cure meant was transparency laws open government was a that the uh other state agencies and actually that's something that Tom the Napoli agrees with\nA but unfortunately has not been able to get the legislature to to to pass the laws that he that he wants a I Do think he perhaps by a little bit harder for it but as you know a lot of the fiscal reforms\nYou know Tom and I you know pretty much agree as I said I had worked for\nTwenty five thirty years I'm with the hunger Action Network we were very involved with the fiscal policy Institute and so a lot of the reforms we put together say around carbon abuses in the economic development program were things that Tom over the years been willing to pick up and introduced and try to push on some success but not enough\nTo control the relationship to the legislature is one that is worthy of a little bit more discussion here\nNow these people in the legislature and it's certainly includes president governor Andrew Cuomo has been lows to give Tom than happily the auditing powers which she deserves that what you had one which they took away from what's that all about\nWell right before the governor went ahead with is buffalo billion deal which is chief economic development person somehow\nUnbeknownst to the governor rigged the bed and was convicted recently or seven hundred and fifty million dollars he got the legislature to remove the oversight or those particular contracts with Sunni and Kenny\nFrom the state controller so that was wrong and I do think one thing to control it should do is any contract being given to a donor that has made a donation to the governor the controller or any of the key political leaders should be subject to additional scrutiny now you probably remember that uh\nThe games that go on and Albany after the governor of got the id seat independent democratic conference to rejoin the Senate Democrats and Republicans decided to reward the governor for that action by passing a bill to restore the oversight or those contracts to the state comptroller\nEven though it was an assembly bill the speaker of the assembly would not allowed to build a come for a boat because he was trying to

thought time show to really raise Cain on on that one and said wait a moment this is a good government stuff which is an assembly bill why are we now you know holding\nOff on let me stop you there mark because it was interesting or they took away these powers from the control and the governor then wanted to give them basically went under intense criticism to somebody that worked for him\nYes I think we have a governor frankly who presides over corruption I think the u._s._a. today or you know put out a story about a hundred million dollars he has raised so far from donors and she was elected governor and uh you know fairly high percentage of them\nHave a receive state contracts because of the times union recently has been looking at the crystal run to ration\nWhere you know they got I think twenty five million dollars or so of state contract after they began the construction project which is quite unusual and they had plenty of say unusual what are you really mean\nWell as very clearly that it was to to most of us a reward for making four hundred thousand dollars a contributions I think a a series of people gave twenty five thousand dollars each\nI guess there's been some acknowledgement that what they did was was illegal and now the federal government the United states attorney any FBI apparently is investigating how corrupted when\nBut you mean you had your job of cocoa them in the governor's top paid a distracted money I'm related to CPB and some other development project what DVD bb is a a power plant it was built down in orange county\nActually pretty incredible this plan will account for ten percent of the state's carbon footprint and so it was a really massive emitter of various carbon greenhouse gas emissions\nSo when you had a governor for instance saying let's cut electricity emission fifty percent by twenty thirty or forty percent emissions and yet you didn't build and all these type of thoughts any case\nFor cocoa who's his top aide got convicted of that plus another development that took place from Syracuse I think the reality is it's ramping there have been fifty each state officials have been forced to resign urban indicted or since two thousand [noise]\nPretty much the entire leadership of the state assembly and the Senate\nProbably want it to his actions or had been convicted in ... and mission you're on the go or not but

V. O. L. dot com mission of the show is to look at those things that are going on in the world from my perspective and today we're going to be to be talking about encourage minute you know with all this going on\nAnd it's really been able to get the news then to look at the media and a dinner whether you're watching TV\nOr opening the newspaper or whether you're just showing up\nUm you know for life in in your home or in your situation it's really easy to become discouraged and so today we're going to spend some time talking about encouragement and things that you can do when you feel that you are discouraged and we always do start\nWith uh some meditative reading to to get going and today it's got about a prayer for strength is uh on the lord hype in prayer hype it all works dot com and then we're going to follow that up with an Irish was saying\nOh lord I give you my words and concerns and I asked for your guidance you see it all the outer circumstances the inner turmoil I Know that you understand my life it comes on my heart weighs heavy with trouble right now I lay all these things before you\nBreathe in the states and the knowledge that I Am held by grade I breathe out knowing that I Am help secure in your arms and wait on you for you we're all truth you are overflowing love you or a beacon of hope in the porch with the faith\nLord I Choose to be attentive to your voice me I'd be alert to your spirits guiding as I journey\nTo to get it going and today it's got I've got a prayer for strength that I found this ad lord heights in prayer hype and words dot com and then we're going to follow that up with an Irish blessing [noise]\nOh lord I give you my words and concerns and I asked for your guide and see it all the outer circumstances the inner turmoil I Know that you understand my life that sometimes my heart weighed heavy with trouble right now I lay all these things before you\nI Breathe in safe and the knowledge that I Am held by grace I Breathe out knowing that I Am helped secure in your arms and wait on you for you we're all truth you are overflowing love you or a beacon of hope into fortress of faith\nLord I Choose to be attentive to your voice me I'd be alert to your spirits guiding as I journey on words with you [noise]\nUm and and the Irish but then you get to me the road right up to meet you made the wind to be always a trip back made the sunshine warm up on your face made the rainfall sauce to put in your field and until we meet again make out hold you in the policy of hand and\nBecause I Know that we don't always have time to do that type of thing or before the show is over so I'm going to do it now and you know I I like a young love in that not sure how his show feel about the show you almost like my life\nUm but I ... I enjoy her books and I've got just a couple of of quotes\nHere and she said that she says releasing detached from every person every circumstance every conditioned to every situation that no longer served a divine purpose in your life all things have a season and all season must come to an end to the new season filled with purposeful thoughts and activities [noise]\nAnd so as you know I've been thinking about encouragement and I think it's we're coming into the the time of year when people often find themselves discouraging all the holidays are\nFor a lot of people and you know the Christmas stuff it's not already out in some places and I went into a Christmas shop myself about a week a week ago or two weeks ago when I was home they do there's this place back home it's called the Christmas shop and it's everything Christmas\nGuys live [noise]\n\n\n\nUh\nGo around\nSo\n\nGuys live a little\n\n\n\nDon't know\nAround a little\nSleepy why\nDon't we don't usually you know the product that you know what\nThey were saying well my mom\nMy mom's\nThought about what can we can lead\nTo more than one room in\nMy\nJob\n\nAnd\nThings\n\nLike that and they don't even\nHave a real live really very little\nMoney while you're trying to make a point to bring 'em up right in ... when the when he left\n\n\nHad a drag waiting to bring your money or you know the\nCommon man trying to get\n\n\nJob\nIn a way to keep your head up say from the hate me is a soundtrack but it's not new and somebody may have heard of before you know and I I like that though because\nOutlined some of the atrocities that we think you need ... with the encouragement to keep your head up and that's that Tupac road actually after he was challenged I'm for it\n\n\nSo\n[noise]\n\n\nIn that way to keep your head up from the hate you give a soundtrack but it's not new at some of you may have heard it before you know and I I like that though because it does outlined\nSome of the atrocities that we think communities but with the encouragement to keep your head up and it's\nA song that Tupac road actually after he was challenged\nUm for his views about women because you know I'm someone said to him you know will you know you've got all the negative stuff and your music about black women and don't you think that affects how black women are viewed by by black men and others who listen to your music and so this was a song pen if that he wrote in response to that and\nYou know lots of people say that to box not dead including should night son\nUm but that's beside the point but lots of conspiracy theories out there but you know when we talk about encouragement [noise]\nYou know I look at someone like my mother and I've been in and out of town if you're a regular listener to the show you know that in part of the reason I have been because my mom got really all over the summer and she spent five weeks in the hospital and during that time probably every doctor\nWho came into her hospital room I'm said that there wasn't anything else they could do and we just needed to take my mother home and put her on hospice and so so that happened in the summer and we decided we were like well\nYou know my mom's wishes were to be treated aggressively and so we'll go aggressive treatment and if it doesn't work you know then we accept that but you know but we would be remiss if we didn't\nFollow her wishes and she bounces back she bounce back from all of that she bounce back from her kidneys shut down she dumped back from\nBeing just didn't fall on heart failure hearts on a normal rhythm or kidneys or back functioning she told them long way to go with her physical therapy um she's essentially learning how to walk again but we didn't give up hope and I know that for every you know for every story like that where you know family doesn't give up hope and apartment survived her\nAs many stories if not more families who you know tried everything and still call you know their loved one pass away but I Want to say you know be encouraged that when we follow the wishes of our family members um when they're you know in the hospital or otherwise that\nWhatever the outcome is on the other side of that we can rest easy knowing that we have followed their wishes and so you know my mom's not completely out of the woods but she's not where the doctor said she was you know three months ago and so when I think about encouragement you know there's the Philippines for Thirteen and scripture says I can do all things\nThrough Christ who gives me strength and its remembering that we can do all things and not getting into the gloom and doom 'cause you know we all meet people who will you know they're they're only ever gloom and doom [laughter] I'm just like wow I never meet people like that I'm like his life that bad\nThat you know that there's never anything good you know I played this game and I shared it with his last week I was teaching at the Catholic girl retreat in in Brooklyn and we talked about encouragement and I told them you know what I'm discouraged or when I think it's situations that I play the how could it be worst game\nAnd I tried to come up with twenty way the situation could be worse and usually by the time you get five or ten in my house\nThe doctor said she was you know three months ago and so I think about encouraged me you know there's a Philippines for Thirteen and scripture says I can do all things\nThrough Christ who gives me strength and its remembering that we can do all things and not giving in to the gloom and doom 'cause you know we all meet people who will you know they're they're only ever gloom and doom [laughter] I'm just like wow I never meet people like that I'm like his life that bad\nThat you know that there's never anything good yeah I play this game and I shared it with I was last week I was teaching at the Catholic girls were treat in this in Brooklyn and we talked about encouragement and I told them you know what I'm discouraged or when I think it's situations that I play the how could it be worth game\nAnd I tried to come up with Tony Way the situation could be worse and usually by the time you get to five or ten in my hotel stopped how I'm this could be a worse situation than it is and I know that that helps me but you know I've I've found um towards things to do when you get discouraged at San life hack dot org and they just take the long view\nOn to try to try to get the bigger a prospect a picture and\nThink about like with the larger perspective and remember there was no such thing as a failure there was only education three it's stay true to your vision and try to see it and see it again and you know if you know you have a vision for something or if you know like in a family situation like the one I shared with my mother if you know that person's wishes\nYou know do your very best to to follow that without\nA minute don't let you go get in the way so often will let our ego get in the way that we can't hear what other people are staying in\nAnd we can't move forward and you know so you go is often the driver of our disappointment and this was a really important one number five is to stop comparing ourselves to others and each of us has on a unique path\nAnd our paths are different and you know one of the fastest way to become discouraged it to compare yourself to someone else\nThe next one is detached from rewards focus on our actions and giving our best work\nYou know do your best I always say do what's right because it's right and do it in the right spirit do your best because you can do your best and you know if you fall short that's okay but work on doing your best and don't focus on the reward because he may not get a reward for 'em that thing that that you're doing\nAnd you might need to reevaluate your rules for being happy\nNumber seven on their list is change the rules for being happy\nUm ages can send to consider who you're spending your time with you know are those people that you're spending your time with or they sucking the life fatty or the training you or are they speaking life into are they speaking life into your situation to your family situation are they like giving my affirming or they just training\nAnd then the next ... I'm number and I didn't get outside and move and breathe get outside moving breed\nTalked to a mentor um do a mind map they suggest and um\nYeah so and I say that a good one is um they also say go find someone that you can help 'em because that might be something to encourage you pray you know pray a wise counsel both of those things are scriptural big wide council\nPray and you don't have to be a follower of a ... a follower of Christ to seek wise counsel work because\nIf you're discouraged about something can guarantee you not the only person who's calling through that thing or who's been through that thing that someone else is going to a situation that you're going through you know there's on YouTube there are some videos cold it gets better\nAnd they're they are all I think they're all out ... plus folks who are encouraging\nI'm young people and others and saying you know\nThey suggest and um\nYeah so and I say that a good one is um they also say go find someone that you can help 'em because that might be something to encourage you pray you know pray a wise counsel both of those things are scriptural wide council\nPray and you don't have to be a follower of a ... a follower of credit to seek wise counsel work because\nIf you're discouraged about something can guarantee you not the only person who's going through that thing or who's been through that thing someone else is going to the situation that you're going through you know there's on YouTube there are some videos cold it gets better\nAnd they're they are all I think they're all out ... plus folks who are encouraging\nI'm young people and others\nAnd saying you know it gets better and telling a portion of their story\nSo I Want to remind you I don't know where are you are or what stage in life you're at if you're you know feeling discouraged or but we all know someone who's discouraged interim remind that person that it gets better you know let's say you know this too shall pass there's nothing that lasts forever in this lifetime\nIt all passes away and I want to remind you that you're always welcome to join us for Russia at the United Methodist Church in New Rochelle or worship services are\nUh whereas somebody else made it just made a drop ship we will go in and\nCustomize that program for them\nTo the size of a business does not matter can be a small size business it can be a medium sized entity it can be a large size business you guys do their votes businesses exactly that's great but it's really really great\nOkay let's get to the membership of the builders Institute and the building and realty Institute\nWhich is can more direct offer to a builder a developer ... products and services can you guys said with Google will develop or say that are really really unique and the ... more developer should pursue a communication with your company\nWell number one as I mentioned we carry the Ken we're appliances a from a award standpoint uh they show quality\nWe have one energy efficiency awards we were the first manufactured to ever win the Energy Star ward\nOff for nine years running we've wanted at Sears or being an EnergyStar partner\nUh we work to do that a from a standpoint of our clients we cannot only offer those appliances we can help them with service before and after a from selection making sure the items that making sure they meet\nSaid we'll build or a developer say that are really really unique and the ... more developer should pursue a communication with your company\nWell number one as I mentioned we carry the Ken we're appliances a from a awards standpoint or they show qualities\nWe have one energy efficiency awards we were the first manufactured to ever win the Energy Star award\nA for nine years running we've wanted at Sears ah being an Energy Star partner\nUh we work to do that or from a standpoint of our clients we cannot only offer those appliances we can help them with service before and after\nA firm selection making sure the items that making sure they meet their clients need a so we will look at what type of pricing they're offering their home in\nAnd then we will go in and work with them to help select the best products once the products are in the field we offer a national parks program a national service program to keep them running for many more years to come\nGreat news for builders and developers no question requested about that you're listening to building knowledge with building in realty Institute the official radio program of the building and realty Institute we thank you for joining us this morning on W.

WTO ex fourteen sixty am and we would welcome your questions\nEnergy efficiency products we hear a lot about energy efficiency we hear a lot about the products the appliances can we talk a little bit of ... on what Ken more directly involved with when it comes to energy efficiency products\nOkay that's great ah well one segment that some big in the industry is whether they show clients are these are clients that work with utilities to try to reduce the footprint of the usage by the public okay um so\nYou may have a twenty year old refrigerator out there or a dishwasher that was twenty Fifteen Years old\nUm and they use a high level of energy a kilowatt usage as we would call 'em from there but we'll do is work with the agencies that work with the utilities um come up with products we have Energy Star refrigerators so instead of maybe being a Seventy ... per year syllabus per year usage\nIt maybe fifty for walks\nDoesn't sound like a big difference but when you multiply that by thousands\nAt all of a sudden at the very quickly onto that grid ah so we try to reduce that footprint so what we'll do is come up with a list of the Energy Star products\nAnd it can be refrigerators laundry starting to become a big factor with not only at the electrical usage but the water usage dishwashers\nThe middle fires think of anything you plug into the wall a and\nHave the ability to possibly reduced the water and still be in a good working order and this is what we put forth to these different agencies to work with utilities and then they work depending upon the income level of the homeowner\nI'm at the end user sometimes with the builder they'll do a whole house package and they can get rebates and discount depending upon your market area but we'll work with them by supplying these products\nAs you mentioned working with builders is out of recruiting trend energy efficiency products for building that's something that's happening on a more and more consistent basis or builders leaning towards that or the consumers leaning toward the\nUs consumers and builders are both leaning towards that because they want to reduce their costs were of not only the initial

the\nDonald Trump right wing right wing saying guns do ... late in the middle of the night of course get all this incriminating stuff on the outside of his truck and make them look like a right wing nut yet he is\nYeah well it's very George Soros and all that money down without a doubt and I\nGot tired of it I really like my friends on on the right because I never knew it it might the Democrats it behind the the people the Taliban we're behind gas Kavanaugh yes we're behind in fact\nI think this whole this whole bouncing\nThe bomb saying wait a minute hold on where am I heard that we find that when the bomb thing what\nI'm saying guys at the President's Day the dumping I think you're only behind it ended up finding [noise]\nGod you know what Mitch you will you heard it here folks first folks sorry to hear from you if you heard here folks they\nYou know ... another thing that [noise] shaking years to uh to set up and that's one of the Democrats are really clever ... some odd usually looks pretty similar you know you brought it to all your mom's got Puerto Rican Marlboro got\nBut wait wait I'm American here I'm going to go from my point is like yeah [laughter] and all it all and I hope I got it right back Scott one here he's breaking you in order not to appear so homogeneous where you could say they're all like that\nThe Democrats took years to get people of color because brown skinned blacks\nYou have people wealth in a poor you you've got people educated not as ...\nYou know how much time they took to create a mob yeah that doesn't look alike doesn't sound alike and\nThen and they then yeah yeah they look like regular people talked about Clipper club or thinking those as Democrats yeah Mitch you're absolutely right document thanks for that call Mitch is right\nYou know what we we uh you know we really don't know how how really elaborate many of these conspiracy that are around us I mean take for example this caravan of ... that Republicans would like you to please take care of and then send it right back to hunt [laughter] like [laughter]\nTaking my care and please [laughter]\nUm but yeah ... that that that conspiracy theory was that the Democrats this is the Trump the before the trial I financed the whole thing ... so the finance the whole thing and they're marching up here just in time for to embarrass the president thank God that court bomb thing\nThat really you know what we're saying that bomb thing folks a President Trump actually referred to it you have that quote a dogs don't ever\nPull it up but it and he called it the Bob mom thing is taking everybody's mind off the election yes everybody to focus and get out and vote he wants his people not to be distracted by the bomb thing the bomb thing I mean there's there's there's somebody\nMaybe the suspect who was out there to kill people who are former president this would have been the worst crises worst the worst that maybe the thousand in the world Trade Center in the middle Easterners\nI mean there's there's a there's somebody maybe the suspect who was out there to kill people who are former president this would have been the worst crises worst the worst that maybe the thousand in the world Trade Center the\nThat the Iowa farmers get from immigrants the Iowa farmers would go under there aren't enough people staying on the farm they need immigration\nSo the idea of thinking well this guy could be a murderer and it uses an undocumented immigrant let's take them all out of the country and he would say no\nThey can't do that because we depend on them so we do know that there's enough land in America to take in a lot of people it's just that there's a close up the door by people who are fearful\nOf die Lucian of their culture especially Iowa a Congress\nSo yes there's a way of checking making sure on desirable criminals murderers people with a record can't shouldn't be allowed in but to close the door just because people are brown and not recognize that your closing the door because they are brown\nThat can be discrimination because we have plenty of room and plenty of me\nI Would just add to that events that are the people that are that are coming here let's let's really take a look at what's happening\nThey are walking the walking over well over a thousand miles and yes there is something between four and seven thousand of them I've lost track of the number of fence but\nThey are walking they are\nHumble people they are poor people they are people of all ages trying to make it to the United states to seek shelter to ask for help and they're trying to ask for what we what we use in our our country the legal path is asylum\nBut there isn't the limitation on asylum yes ah countries have thought in the past or in Europe most recently as I recall\nA country's trying to say listen we got to share this burden here of welcoming immigrants from these wars war torn countries of the middle east\nAnd a member of Germany famously took in a million and then ... Anglo Merkel is\nWith getting pounded a win the election came around saying that that these people had brought in you know crime and corruption and that was again five people on the far right and I will use that term people on the far right who were trying to foment fear\nUsing the example of a couple of people are ... that had committed crimes or who had who had gone a wry who had become antisocial to say that the entire group is I mean it's a painting with abroad\nIsn't the limitation on asylum yes ah countries have thought in the past uh in Europe most recently as I recall a country's trying to say listen we've got to share this burden here of welcoming immigrants in from these warrant war torn countries of the middle east\nAnd a member of Germany famously took in a million and among them ongoing Merkel was\nWith getting pounded or when the election came around saying that the these people had brought in you know crime and corruption and that was again ... ... people on the far right and I will use that term people on the far right who were trying to foment fear\nUsing the example of a couple of people ah that had committed crimes or who had who had gone a wry who had become antisocial to say that the entire group is I mean it's painting with a broad brush once again people of color people who are broke\nPeople who are are looking for help so I think that that this is part of the beauty this is part of what makes the United states um the United states or the fact that we are a nation of immigrants and a lot of the immigrants that came to this country came because their countries were war torn or there were starving to death\nA and and they needed a place to go and uh they need the United states would let them and they would have a chance here so I and as far as sending the buses and airplanes down I'm I'm sure you don't mean that I'm sure you mean that facetiously\nUm because obviously ... that it isn't the role it isn't it isn't it isn't for us to go bringing people in but it is our role once people come to our doors and have a legitimate claim of need\nA for us to do we do as Americans which is to welcome the men and by the way that last statement that you made a you know let 'em in and then they don't show up for the hearing that's really not the case uh you that that may be the case and it does happen in situations where people have been caught\nA illegally entering and they are then given an opportunity for a hearing before deportation sometimes they don't show up that is true but asylum seekers generally it's not in their interest not to show up this is a path toward the legal presence in the United states says so that that's just that's just not ... right there\nBut I you know I think thanks for the call and I do think you know events you know he's a he's a been a long time caller many shows here and uh Vince is\nUm you know I think Republican on the right but she is is the head is I think we've got to remember all the time uh that that are brothers and sisters Republicans Democrats all we do have we do share this common decency this common humanity\nOr this love of people in this understanding for uh the role compassion plays um in in the American way of life\nYou know you're still right through the and specifically for events because then science been quoted Marshall now are\nFor many years now he's interested that interested in I think she really has concerned absolutely but he also as you point out he's a decent person but I think there's a part of him and this is my truck protesting or Portland\nHas to embrace or these tests and vocalizing the far right a point of view either for the Cold War he hangs out with or because there's one single part of his that believes good as opposed to the other part that is very democratic an older inclusive so he's conflicted I said\nWell I ... you know my my point was the was really more to the the fact that I think that we all regard was us of political stripe share the same basic decent core values and um I think\nCoin maestro now are for many years now he's interested that interested in I think she really has concerned absolutely but he also is as you point out he's a decent person but I think there's a part of him and this is my interpretation appointed\nHas to embrace toward the tests the boat collide this ... this war right a point of view he goes with the Cold War that he hangs out with or because of his one single part of his that believes that as opposed to the other part that is very democratic and all the inclusive so he's conflicted I see\nWell I ... you know my my point was that was really more to the the fact that I think that we all the guard of the political stripe\nShare the same basic decent core values and um I think this is one of the things this is one of the things that I Love about doing a radio and call in show is that we hear perspective new perspective and from a lot of people and we see how much we really have in common that\nThat's the way to have public discourse I think if I Do\nIf I Do too they're always wondering if I Do\nAnyway let them are coming up on the last segment

when someone dies with the well and he told us about what happens then\nBut there were some people\nWho don't make a well and I'm going to tell you that everybody should have the will regardless of self to favor draw up will so that no one has to second guess like your wishes are\nBecause there are certain laws as judge still has said that reward a medically determine if you don't have a will to get whatever you have left up is that correct\nThat is correct [noise] so the state run into the sea and uh that will control if you don't have it will so it would be obviously best for you to decide where the bounty of your state as opposed to the state determining\nWhen someone died when the whale and he tells us about what happens then I think some people\nWho don't make a well and I'm going to tell you that everybody should have a well regardless to favor draw up will say that no one has to second guess like you wish you are\nBecause there are certain laws as judge still has said that will lead to medically determine if you don't have a will to get whatever you had left out is that correct\nThat is correct [noise] so the state has laws of intestine see and that will control if you don't have a well so it would be obviously best for you to decide where the bounty of your state goes as opposed to the state determining that\nRight you'd be in control ... point and what is the difference I hear some people saying that they they don't have a will they have a ... what is the difference between a will and attract well\nA will there's a document that you know you you also execute before you you pass away and they're very similar um many people think that it it may be that you can avoid having to go to\nThe surrogates court if you pass away um and or your assets are in a trust and that may be the case we still have to say over trustees and things like that but people think that it's an advantage because you will avoid probate\nBut in our court probate ... you know not that complex and I'm a matter so um\nYou know and I don't believe that there is any real significant delays in in our court or at this point in getting a will through the probate\nProcess while taking a bit longer than we hope um we're still I think with him reads and then and we hope to be even better\nIn terms of getting wheels probate it so I'm not sure what the if there was a clear advantage to probate in like the fact that I think that served its court um you know is acting in in an efficient manner [noise] mhm [noise]\nSo it's it's a good idea to have a well yeah and it's a good idea to when you look quaint and executive that you point someone who you trust and someone who\nYou know we'll have the the ability if you will to carry on the things that need to be done when you passed away and hopefully they're going to outlive you said that they can do that well\nThe most important thing obviously to pick someone that you do trust them you just said because they're going to be carrying out your\nWishes and you want someone who is responsible who's got ahead on the shoulders of 'em and can make good decisions if you pass away with the scripture can stock\nPortfolio are actually in insignificant on you want someone who's going to look at it and and make the right decisions in terms of whether to sell 'em\nBecause it may take some time or did the upstate is distributed so you need someone that's going to jump in and uh know what to do when the time comes\nSo I've heard some people say when I said you have a well oh I have a living well and I said well that's not the same as of well\nWhat is the weather is living whales versus a will\nFor and the life decisions or whether the plug should be pulled under what circumstances who's going to make the decisions are when that time comes if you're a I'm incapacitated um so that's different than our last will and\nThe way with the script for can stock portfolio are actually in insignificant one you want someone who's going to look at it and and make the right decisions in terms of whether to sell 'em\nBecause it may take some time [noise] what did the upstate is distributed so you knew someone that's going to jump in there and know what to do when the time comes\nSo I've heard some people say when I say you have a well oh I have a living well and I said well that's not the same as well\nWhat is what is living well versus a will\nFor him to life decisions or whether the plug should be pulled under what circumstances who's going to make the decisions are when that time comes if you're a I'm incapacitated um so that's different than a west will and testament that we deal with in sort of course\nThe one is dealing with your physical health and the other is dealing with basically your assets send you a determination of what you want to have happened to your assets after you've gone\nRight and the other important thing as long as we're talking about living will last will and testament to the other important a document that one should have its power of attorney because [noise] there was just um\nIt's a bit there's a significant chance in one's life that you become disabled and you would need somebody to do certain things you banking transactions to act on your behalf you can't do it yourself right and so people often forget that component but\nThat's a significant thing to have fro when are you become incapacitated in it and you cannot go on to run in years obviously still alive at that right\nOh you mean I Can't just send my son and my daughter over to the bank to do whatever needs to be done\nNow and uh you know banks even though they I don't believe we're legally able to do so they always seem to require you to use their powers of attorney they have specific ones that they like to thank you so even if you have the journal form a New York\nUm ah basically said this is okay it's still important to have that power of attorney reviewed by the bank to see if the bill honor it if not your your best suited to use their standard flights\nSo it's not only good to have one but you should actually as I just said the bank pass on it so that when it's needed or it can actually be used\nRight to make sure that you have all your clothes ducks and a lotta ... and that means you should have all well\nAnd you just have a living will will determine what happens to your assets the living will is determining what's happening with your body while you're alive and it traps even surgery perhaps drunk conscious you want your your desire to be known\nAnd as far as the attorney is concerned you want to make sure that it's\nPerhaps you you've lost the ability to speak your mind you're still going perhaps you lost your mind and and you don't have the ability to think for yourself you want someone to act\nYour desire to be known and as far as the attorney is concerned you want to make sure that it's perhaps you you've lost the ability to speak but your mind is still going or perhaps you lost your mind and and you don't have the ability to think for yourself you want someone to act\nThey tend to be a desire\nWho wants to know and there is something very correct your desire it efficiently [noise]\n...

since since John tell us how many years have you been enlightening\nI've been in the industry since Nineteen eighty six I've seen a lot happened since\nThen that's over thirty five years that they are who's counting right [laughter]\nAnd and tell us a little bit about metropolitan lighting\nMetropolitan lighting has been in business since Nineteen thirty nine\nIt's changed hands a couple of times over the years ah we're currently own corporate lead by the ... group and we're based at two hundred Lexington Avenue Schober I'm five one to uh we service all trade professionals and we have about one hundred different manufacturers on display in our show over\nA hundred different manufacturers that's that's incredible\nWe have a lot in here you've been in you've seen how busy I have\nHave been in you know the thing about lighting that I found as a designer because you have to really remain focus like focused on what it is I'm specifically looking for in my design concept or to just be totally overwhelmed\nAnd and so what do you find the design process is that you offer your clients when they come in to shop\nIt's my job to work with the client to make sure\nThat the items that they're selecting will on a practical level achieved the light levels that they're looking for for instance in the kitchen where you need really good practical like to see what's going on um you can pick up a really beautiful fixture but if it's not bright enough then you're not serving space\nSo if we can find a place as a if we can find a fixture that's going to provide enough light to be practical and still be beautiful that's really the goal\nUh-huh so you're starting with the functionality of a light source as opposed to ... of the ...\n[noise] yes now that said that design element is is crucial for space\nBut certainly having the light that you need is is equally important so particularly in a kitchen or saying a bathroom it it it's very important that we we keep that in mind when we're looking and and designers hopefully turn to us to to remind them that they might need a certain level of light in the spaces\nAnd when I when I when I was searching the functionality not just the light level but the way the light source works within the space\nSo that the light source that sells it either directing the light in a small way or I or directing the light in a very broad way so within ... ambient light\nOr illuminating in a focused way or it could just be just accepting the light fixture itself could be just a source of\nBut certainly having the light that you need is is equally important so particularly in a kitchen or say in a bathroom it it it's very important that we we keep that in mind when we're looking and and designers hopefully turn to us to to remind them that they might need a certain level of light in the spaces\nAnd when I when I when I was searching the functionality not just the light level but the way the light source works within the state\nSo that the light source that sells it either directing the light in a small way or ... or directing the light in a very broad way but with the ... and being late\nOr illuminating in a focused way or it could just be just accepting the light fixture itself could be just a source of an accent of light to help a illuminate the ceiling area adapt to the the guy\nOh absolutely it you know let's use a kitchen as an example and if a lot of New Yorkers have galley kitchens and they have a concrete ceiling where there might be an existing electrical box that they cannot move\nSo that technology right now is the hottest thing in our industry today there are good eh ladies there are bad Eli ... just like everything in this world\nAnd when people go shopping for that sort of product the most important thing to look for is a fixture that carries a strong manufacturing warranty if you were to go shopping for a dishwasher or refrigerator\nYou wouldn't want to make sure that you've got a really good warranty for it so when you go shopping for ... light emitting diodes fixtures ... they're they're supposed to last very long time you want to make sure that the manufacturers stands behind their product\nThat right there tells you you've got an LAPD fixture that you can rely on because they're if they go bad you get a new fixture [noise]\nUm [noise] we have different qualities of color in an alley D you can do a a warm white you can do some lesser yellow fixtures where they're they're more of a cool white so depending on the space that you're in if you need clarity of light you might not want a yellowish color\nWhereas many elite these in our home where we want to feel it's warming inviting in the house a warmer Tony ... is it so is the way to go in you know we we show all of that here in our show\nWhat what are some of the manufacturers that are carrying Eli, Eli like what would we what we find out there\nQuite a few I Would say for warranty and reliability the two leaders that we sell in LA the technology is W.

C. lighting which offers a wide range of ...\nWe have different qualities of color in an alley day you can do a a warm white you can do some lesser yellow fixtures where they're they're more of a cool white so depending on the space that you're in if you need clarity of light you might not want a yellowish color\nWhereas many of these in our home where we want to feel its Mormon inviting in the house a warmer Tony ... is is is the way to go and you know we we show all of that here in our show room\nAnd what what are some of the manufacturers that are carrying Eli, Eli like what would we what we find out there\nQuite a few I Would say for warranty and reliability the two leaders that we sell in L. A. D. technology is W. A. C. lighting which offers a wide range of products\nFrom decorative fixtures to more architectural hum lights where you're hiding them in there and cold and things like that and all of their Eli deep products carry a five year warranty\nThere's another company that carries more sophisticated decorative fixtures their name is modern forms also very very strong manufacturers are more in the end they stand behind their product\nWe also carry a company called ...\nWhich has a range of different products and they're elite the product is also um a five year warranty and is beautiful and it's interesting the company Murray size\nSpecializes in any type of LAPD that turns more yellow as you damage and I'll give you an example when you demo light fixture at home and the next but if you go to your ... and just emit down\nYou'll see that the regular light source when it's a full looks nice and bright but as you damage it becomes more yellow in amber like sunset right\nWhen you Tim in L. E. D. as a rule it maintains the integrity of that color as it dams\nSo it's going to be the same color at a lower light level as it is at a higher light level for some people they perceived that has a little cold ... when you ... some people prefer it if they have ... they don't want to lose the integrity of that color temperature so it's a good thing for them\nBut if your eye is used to seeing a more yellow cast as it comes down there are ... on the market to simulate that and I think that's a very very cool thing\nOnly do they make the same immerse which and every other ...\nIs a great question Jonathan not all ... take the same damn I'm most bulbs when you go to the home improvement store that are ... that you just screw in to replace the old bulbs\nThose who work with a regular Denver they'll also work with what's called a C. F. L. L. E. D. Denver which is um which is very similar to a regular incandescent now if you purchased something for over your medicine cabinet\nSometimes those types of fixtures where the LAPD is built into the fixture itself and there's no light bulb\nYou may require special Jimmer and it could be either a magnetic low voltage tumor or an electronic low voltage them or not in LA deep dimmer and even professionals make that mistake and they'll buy and Eli ... for a fixture that needs an electronic Denver\nAnd when they met the LA diesel flicker and that's that's a sure sign that you you just have the wrong Denver the manufacturers supplies instructions in those instructions are quite explicit has to what type of tumor to use but you're\nWhich is um which is very similar to a regular incandescent now if you purchased something for over your medicine cabinet\nSometimes those types of fixtures where the LAPD is built into the fixture itself and there's no light bulb\nYou may require special Jimmer and it could be either a magnetic low voltage tumor or an electronic low voltage dimmer not in L. A. D. dimmer and even professionals make that mistake and they'll buy an ... for a fixture that needs an electronic Denver\nAnd when they met the LA diesel flicker and that's that's a sure sign that you you just have the wrong camera manufacturer supplies instructions in those instructions are quite explicit has to what type of tumor to use\nBut you're absolutely right um some Eli D's use regular demars some Eli decent need special demars and the instructions on a fixture usually indicates which dimmer you should use\nIf our listeners wanted to comment to metropolitan lightning how\nWould that work and if they was shopping for lighting for themselves how would that work for you all\nWell I Will say we are a trade only showroom [noise] so if you're working with an interior designer a contractor and electrical contractor someone who's in the trade um we we sell to those folks\nUm if you're working with designing certainly come in with them and look but our business is to the trade only that said it's not to stop you from coming in and looking at all the great stuff we've got\nAnd um and a lot of times are our trade clientele will send a customer in to specifically look at some pieces with us and and we're always happy to help\nLike our customers I mean our our listeners may not have\nDesigners are there why as there at uh on on a you know hired they may just be doing it themselves that and I'm not surprised that many of our listeners that would listen to our show would be doing it themselves so but they're welcome to come at the metropolitan lighting you won't you let an additive and\nSurvey and look and take pictures and gather information but when it comes down to the ... that they would need to go which way stores which could be there or electrician and you know installing lighting is not so easy to do it yourself or the best way to start putting in ... which is\nBecause I've had experiences by putting in a dimmer switch not even myself but with the recession and they can pop the ... the the demos which they didn't do something right they didn't do the wire white and then you've got a a you know I Am Seventy five dollar a hundred and fifty dollar humor\nThat had been plus it because it was installed properly\nBut on the other thing too is a lot of clients living either co ops or condos where there are certain rules about this and how you should go about doing work in your home [noise] um it's always good to have a designer it's always good to have a professional guide you and I I I'm not saying that because I'm speaking to you\nKnow I figure I think that the\nPerson comes in and if\nThey haven't notion as to what they're looking for a designer will take it home for them and really explain to them why a might be better than the and even though we're lighting specialists we are not interior designers so to be working with an interior designer is it is is a\nYoung that's a great way to drop off the show John that's all I did that so the night and so great how clever up off the show like that they won't get in a metropolitan lighting a two hundred like they did avenue in New York City\nFor Congo's where there are certain about this and how you should go about doing work in your home [noise] it's always good to have it designer [noise] always good [laughter] rational guide you and I and I'm not saying that because I'm speaking you\nKnow I don't think the one\nComes in and if\nThey haven't notion as to what they're looking for a designer for them and really explain to them why they might be better than [noise] and even though we're lighting specialists we're not interior designers so to be working with an interior designer is busy\nAnd that's a great way to drop off the show John that's awesome\nI did not so nice of you and so great how clever up off the show like that they all get sent from metropolitan lighting at two hundred Lexington Avenue in New York City I Want to thank you John thank you for being with me today and for our listeners we got so much technical information\nAbout lighting and thank you all for joining us today and I want to now ask if anyone um\nAny questions call us and now I went for six three six zero one\nOne zero and ... days secret insiders sip\nIs aiding a lighting concept for your home I always use him murderers that's my secret and most of the pool light sources this create different qualities of light and\nWhen I was in the states that I design\nAnd it's not just one light fixture or remember when you would have a three way light bold today it's the cameras switch\nOr it's going to pull light sources it could be it can on the floor coming up from behind a plant or share in the room I could be a source of light from the ceiling it could be a track of light with multiple track head and one track had has a\nHas a spotlight on it on one track had has a flood light on it and I'm controlling all of those light sources from the embers which\nSo damning\nMultiple lights multiple light sources different types of light those are the secret of lighting designer and let me tell you something in the industry of interior design people will tell you\nLighting is everything lighting space and bringing out the beautiful white or highlights the shadows on the states or some of the some of the beauty of the space\nAnd some of the beauty of all of them share design so I Want to thank you again for joining me today I'm your host for Baron on design\nUm Jonathan Baron and this show is being brought you buy ... notes that ... the ... you can trust\nAnd joining next week I'm going to bring you another guess from my industry on interior design something that I'd a source of information that can provide some new ideas new concept new ways of doing things\nBring another guest from my industry on insure your design something that a source of information that can provide some new ideas new concept ways of doing things\nThat because they're X number and hundreds of thousands of Arabs who are under Israeli control and occupied territories who aren't able to vote in Israeli elections you make the claim that that means that Israel itself is not a democracy how do you respond to that\nWell this is again shows why he just doesn't even know the facts on the ground he reminds me of all kinds of deals Cortez with his just lack of knowledge [noise] the only Arab nation in the world the only nation in the world where Arabs can vote is Israel\nIsraeli Arabs have voted in Israel's democracy since Nineteen forty eight they don't have a vote across the river in Jordan they don't have a vote across the canal in Egypt they don't have a vote in Saudi Arabia\nThe only place in the world were Arabs Middle Eastern and Arabs have a vote is Israel\nWell hold on for a second I mean they have elections in Jordan they have elections in Egypt they may not for the man nothing the king okay certainly king Harlem in for the parliament and most Jordan and in Egypt or oh you know our elected cruel elections well chosen for lunch and\nJordan and it's an absolute monarchy there is a legislature there and it's not as much as a powerful legislature\nBut Israel is the only real democracy is really the only functioning western style democracy other nations around the world of always put on some type of window dressing to appear in some way democratic one much of them are still in especially in the middle east monarchies\nTraditional democracy and that is they have no tradition of democracy I mean I think the distinction is in Israel Israel\nDoes Israel's the shining light there and so to hear a Democrat congressional candidate take on Israel criticize Israel Israel is not a Jewish democracy this is what troubles me so much because it's such a left wing thinking about foreign policy\nAnd it suggests to me there's just a weakness in terms of America's foreign policy with our national defence should be like who our allies are and who are enemies are when you pick on Israel at a debate\nYeah have you met John ... do you know and then all of you know I Do know manure on well he's an impressive substantive guy and he's been a very strong supporter of Israel I don't know if you have any feel for how the election in the Nineteen congressional district is going when you're up in green county you may see some of the signs you have a feel for the polls are are you show very tight race\nYou know when I'm impressed with it at a time of polarization John Faso is just one of the most thoughtful people you can imagine he's a problem solver he's somebody who wants to get things done and he's always been like that he was like that when he was an Albany his like that then Washington\nAnd he he's a centrist you know he's a moderate right centrist and he fits New York he fits the district uh that's why I like him\nIn terms of America's foreign policy what our national defence should be like who our allies are and who are enemies are when you pick on Israel at a debate\nYeah have you met John ... do you know and then all of the ocean you know I Do know Monroe I'm well he's an impressive substantive guy and he's been a very strong supporter of Israel I don't know if you have any feel for how the election in Nineteen congressional district is going when you're up in green county you may see some of the signs you have a field towards the poles or are you show very tight race\nYou know when I'm impressed with it at a time of polarization John Faso is just one of the most thoughtful people you can imagine he's a problem solver he's somebody who wants to get things done and he's always been like that he was like that when he was an Albany his like that now in Washington\nAnd he he's a centrist you know he's a moderate right centrist and he fits New York he fits the district that is why I like him\nI don't know the New York but he certainly the district New York being the son or your day that's a city there's a couple of quick things for me what do you make of this swirling this is a serious matter about the ... and these devices that may or may not be bombs that have been sent to\nThan either high profile Democrats are news organizations that have been associated with sort of democratic advocacy\nWell it's terribly worrisome obviously I mean you know this is not how we conduct ourselves we should not conduct ourselves up I just urge everybody don't speculate no one knows who's behind it don't as ledge motive we don't know we will do I have total confidence that law enforcement will find whoever's behind this and probably in short order here\nAnd then we'll know a lot more but I I I think this is a time for pundits and politicians to to keep their mouth closed and their minds open yeah\nWhat's your sense if I could just ask you about it's our governor Andrew Cuomo who I had the pretensions apparently to the presidency and twenty twenty\nHe's spending most of his time these days are from the point of view of a lot of journalists trying to get his name out nationally and a couple of days ago he was claiming and disappointed when he turned it turned out not to be the case that he got one of those alleged\nBonds you see him as a real serious potential democratic candidate for president\nYou know when you can put Kirsten Gillibrand into that next to you just recently denied it I don't think that's a ... [noise] yeah I I think in the Democratic primary when you have twenty twenty five candidates\nIt ever catches on fire has a chance and that would include Governor Cuomo who's obviously covering very much on the far left he literally sounded much more of a pro business New Yorker he didn't turn out to be one\nUh but you can't rule out crumble you can't ... brand is just wide open field and the Democratic party\nYou have just finally a feel for what's happened to the Republican Party in New York a couple of decades ago it had George Pataki is governor Giuliani as mayor Al D'Amato as a senator we had other state wide elected in the Republican Party now it seems to be completely dead what do you think\n[noise] New York is a New York is so dominated by the island by the city my suburbs of the city which are overwhelmingly democratic and an upstate of course has lost population and that's the place where Republicans historically of lift\nNew York is a very tough state state

around every week for the last eight years really\nDowntown wind up as a beautiful place it's really coming back and they have some unique stores and restaurants that are very nice place to go

great to be with your friend\nTake care have fun in a window in a good luck with your business Ari Fleischer runs a a media companies and media consultant has many very top\nLevel is my expect from a former presidential press secretary clients and finally feel strong enough about John faster to weigh in and it is peculiar to listen to Delgado I only played a little extra because he just comes across as pretty naive he says that for instance he said that I'm moving\nThe United states embassy to Jerusalem should've involves several countries that there should be um a joint effort\nI'd rather than having the United states make its own decision on this especially since the Congress of the United states and previous presidents had vowed to move the embassy I mean it seems to me\nAt the very least ones that give a president Donald Trump credit for delivering on a promise I mean so often and we saw this previous presidents they would say that's the right thing to do and then not do it at least they did what he said but just as a final note before we take a break we have to take a break\nOnce that's all about ah in Israel\nWith the so called Palestinians on ice pay so called because there was never a Palestinian state as people know the history of the area no there was the Ottoman Empire that was the British mandate\nOr the construct of the Palestinian people with their own nation is a new idea relatively new\nAnd the bottom line is that the various groups of people who have been in the Ottoman Empire who are Muslim Arabs or whether they're on the west bank or in the Gaza Strip can't agree amongst themselves on a road to take a course neither side can ... rather they can both agree though\nOn their desire for the destruction of Israel\nWhich was created in Nineteen forty eight through a combination of\nAh armed uprising in the United nations mandate or not even a mandate it was the United nations is Asian which involve the creation of two states a Jewish state an Arab state so the Arabs would have had what could be considered a Palestinian state in Nineteen forty eight have they accepted it\nAnd of course in the negotiations that went on\nBetween the Israelis and the PLO and yes or Yasser Arafat they\nWere given a chance to Palestinians were the Arabs were to have a state yet again they had most of their requirements their demands met they would have had their own territory and they rejected it and the fundamental hatred on the part of the\nArabs in Gaza and in the west bank is at the heart of the inability to have peace there they will not accept the existence of Israel those settlements that stand in a way of peace supposedly could be easily done away with the issue could easily be resolved into it except piece\nThat's what happened in Gaza\nThe Israelis pulled their settlements out of there and they got in response is on the ending unrelenting war from a mosque or attacks from ... so what sales guy I mean anyone knows anything about the middle east at least be honest about what the reality\nWhere to have a state yet again they had most of their requirements their demands met they would have had their own territory and they rejected it and the fundamental hatred on the part of the\nArabs in Gaza and in the west bank is at the heart of the inability to have peace there they will not accept the existence of Israel those settlements that stand in a way of peace supposedly could be easily done away with the issue could easily be resolved through it except piece\nThat's what happened in Gaza\nThe Israelis pulled their settlements out of there and they got in response is on the ending unrelenting war from a mosque or attacks from um uh so what sales guy I mean anyone knows anything about the middle east at least to\nBe honest about what the reality is that the Palestinians won't accept Israel or they're not in the ones that want to have been assassinated\nOver many decades Palestinians who genuinely sought piece have been killed in the hundreds if not in the thousands and Israelis have an open to peace but there are a warrior society now because it's been forced on them the whole set of circumstances that very very tough\nAnd uh I think that that part of it is a good thing but just getting back to Antonio Delgado not to acknowledge that up front\nThat the basis of the war is there the ... on a hunger and seemingly insoluble tensions between the different people's really at its heart has to do with the unwillingness\nOf the Arabs to accept the Arabs in the west bank and Gaza Strip down in Jordan and Egypt\nAnd may in Saudi Arabia and other countries the Emirates to accept the existence of Israel as simple as that and when they don't when people politicians don't say it I think it's legitimate to be just a suspect of them because either there profoundly ignorance or they may be a on one level or another\nActually real\nAnd um that I mean that you could argue in that position I Would argue against it but at least be honest about where you stand we're going to take a break and we'll be right back\nOr they don't have any appreciation of what it's like to live in a rotting city in upstate New York that's rife with crime and decay\nMaybe they did Thirty years ago when I Lived in New York City and so it was happening to the Bronx I certainly saw that I grew

which me will be releasing soon but it has some great things and they're like innovative housing policies that include\nCreating a residential housing units were artists at eight hundred dollars a month and if they teach art that kids or members of the community seniors in in especially\nUm you know being an instructor for the community will um go toward their rent and that's a great great great progressive policy that we're putting in place to make sure Mount Vernon does not\nBecome gentrified by some other communities have\nAnd we don't lose our authentic um\nField and we don't lose ourselves to you know the improvements in the renaissance that's happening the people that are here to get to enjoy it and that's the type of stuff I'm going to continue to do to create you know in word an upward mobility within our community and and that's a welcome some great policy but again\nUm I Know we had David on line we're talking about um programs enriching\nUm educational learning\nIn the school district or David where the teacher and I just want to emphasize that David that\nUm he he asked a question about funding and what we can do without funding but I just want David I Want you to know if you didn't hear 'em everything that we've done over the past few years has been unfunded we found ways to work with businesses um partners in the community we found ways to use internal resources\nSuch as the credit card of our a commissioner recreation to fund some programs that are actually funded\nBut I'm the problem has been a gate reimbursed even when their money in the budget but but but David ... for you for your knowledge I don't even probably fall in Mount Vernon it's unfortunate when ordinary people get caught in the crosshairs of political war and and I'm I'm promoting policy piece\nFor example we did a drive in movie theater all summer it was a smash hit\nOn each movie cost 'em you know forced to pay the license couple of hundred bucks and and the commissioners\nCondition adapt and in particular put her on her credit card and and that's the discretionary experience we have the money in the budget but guess what she hasn't been reimbursed and you just ask yourself man that's a low cost high impact event we had a hunch\nWhat do you want me to do with the situation miss Myers of all people the mother of hip hop hip hop's you know a legend heavy has basically said she had enough she's tired of me the mayor not making enough noise on on some of these issues and she said you know what I'm going to go out and rally\nAnd and I'm going to make it clear that I'm urging the mayor to continue fighting\nAnd and I'm listening to what people some people say they say may or don't don't don't be so vocal and this and that and I'm like
