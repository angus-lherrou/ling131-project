state department of transportation and that's also the group that I'm isn't a contractual arrangements with 'em I spoke about this last week a a business entity named crown communications and they want to put\nA one hundred and thirty foot monopole across from our middle school high school complex them directly across from our\nFuse me ... town library monopole I sell a cell tower okay how their room or he'd been invaded by monopole\nIt's really a something you'll see along knowledge however parkway and along other you'll see them in on many lots in Westchester and it's all over I mean we all want or service but\nWe're working again my office a ... office Amy pollens office and a number of not for profit organizations now have weighed in\nAsking the New York state DOT and crown communications to find a more suitable location we're all for cell service and we know the federal government has largely preempted the field on this matter on you know they tell us without getting to legal on this program that they tell us we can't contemplate or argue safety\nBut it's really an inappropriate a site you know across literally the street from I'm a middle school complex where you have kids who are not even teenagers yet crossing so in any event that's where we are dealing with the state on on two levels there\nAnd then um we do have are regularly scheduled meeting at eight Fifteen this Monday Night we have several important things on the docket we're going to talk about um [noise]\nState and local income taxes and how that plays out with the federal government and we have a few other agenda items so anyone is always welcome and we take public comment at each meeting so we're happy to see people as well\nAs anything else going on [noise]\nUm I think that's about it for right now and I'll give you a ring next week can keep you posted on what we're doing here\nThank you very much Jennifer ... very fine mayor ... keep up the good work there but I didn't realize that paving only last ten years it\nDepends sometimes sometimes you can get two decades out of it\nIt's incredibly\nExpensive I I've spoken on this program in the past how we've had um a partnership agreement with many other municipalities in including New Rochelle I'm Chuck strong as one heck of a negotiator who said so if you're ever on a dark alley in three in the morning you want that gentleman next to you [noise]\nUm but he negotiates very good contracts and we try to you know we're a tiny little village we tried to piggy back where we can and and we have a very collaborative relationship are village manager John ... is a very good working relationship with him\nAnd uh we're we're very fortunate to be able to um at our names are ... and join in some of his cost saving measures\nThere's a lot to be said for that whole city manager dynamic Afghan politics completely but they focus on getting things done and fixing things they really do yeah thank you very much for being name where you ... take care\nDoes that whole city manager dynamic he can't evacuate politics completely but they focus on getting things done and fixing things they really do yeah thank you very much for like ... to take care\nAnd all and I think that's a major problem I don't think it's capital himself I think it's the way everything is being done today and that's the biggest criticism of ah of Trump\nYou know they they let me tell you we we have to live through conservative judges so in a liberal judges said ... and that you know I I can see I consider myself a centrist okay but you know I have some I I Know some very liberal blocs in terms of some issues\nAre but I I don't mind my Christian friends getting on the bench ... you know we've had that throughout history that's mine I don't particularly agree with what happens but you know we we lived through it this is something very different very very different\nThan a beach somewhere around two hundred a ultra conservative\nJudges on the bench that have been vetted over a period a long period of time uh and and you know they form the list they formed and that there's something there's something really wrong with that um\nAnd you know I hate to say this but I'm very concerned I I personally am very concerned is only my opinion\nBut you you looked at the parallels between what's happening in our country very subtly and what happened did other countries very subtly before they leave points where democracy has been diminished\nThat's what we I think we're headed to hear\nWhat the bottom line problem and let us get your response to this is\nBoth sides have taken extreme positions without they they've lost faith in return they only they become all totally totally cynical and we even debate now we political scientists who come on and say stop saying well that politics [noise] ah\nYeah well you know both sides curse on both the house is you know yeah that that's what's going on Saturday\nAnd you know I I I just wish someone uh some independent and ... you know a\nIndividual we're all individual rules were long that are not the major party were to be in some in some way um but that that's what all kinds of things you just totally just seen in parliamentary system throughout the world you know\nYeah I'm into anyone\nHave taken extreme positions without they they've lost faith in recent fame only they become all too totally cynical and we even debate now we political scientists who come on and say stop saying well that politics [noise] ah\nYeah well you know both sides a curse on both the house is you know yeah that that's what's going on Saturday and then I I\nI just wish someone uh some in ... and and you know a\nIndividual we're all individuals were long that another major party were to be in some in some way um but that that's what all kinds of dangerous to as just seen in parliamentary system throughout the world you know\nYeah I'm a goatee one\nI just want to reach out here we're talking with Andy ... is a former county executive now political hunted a tough question for you perhaps Mr spinal you've run for office in one many times last the last one [noise]\nI'm In a conversation with political scientist yesterday we got the standard answer well Bob these people can't be independent because then they lose their jobs and response was published should be more secret role\nOf the examples are John McCain was time so he could be independent and Jeff Flake is resigning so he could be reasonably independent neglecting wants to run for president is not the only way we're ever going to get principle anymore\nWay up from time immemorial people want her to keep their jobs but they've always been those who are out and do the right thing loaded their conscience and show off um and ... and every airline that we've had we've had people like that\nOr this could be a little strange you oh I I just I just don't know and it is this is this is really a strength high people trying to keep the draft and the rationale becomes well if I don't do this and stay\nIn on the voice of Greece in the ... they need a voice of reason and they give themselves too much of port um I never used to be for for term limits but I now I Am you know\nI think we should have term limits and I think that it should that should affect everybody ... can't become a career in the constitution does not\nIntend for these to be Korea's\nPrints well we do have these careers and it it really is a sad thing indeed you know how many Americans do you think truly understand the concept of a Republican form of government and I don't mean to party [noise]\nHow many do you think really understand the reason they did that in the founding fathers with the new the public would not have time to know the issues and that we needed these men and women to vote their conscience is not necessarily even what constituency\nYeah I mean that you know I I don't think people understand that that means you and you know these guys who are constitutional scholars you know they want to you know a a ear to the word ... that's not what they intended it's purposely limited to such and such short document\nIf you're if you're matched up against constitutions it's documented other countries it's it's nothing\nAnd by the way it's the longest lasting constitution and history of the world\nWell I you know so so do you know ... you'll have ... you don't remember march used to be president actually just take off the march but it took so long to travel any of that guy like\nI you know ... ... people like that which comes to Congress from various ... and ... and and they they would ask this fight in August I mean you know people that this is that going back in history as the some of the stuff that went on\nThe crucial scholars you know they want to you know a a ear to the word that's ... that's not what they intended it's ... limited to such a it's a short document\nIf you if your match that up against constitutions and documents from other countries it's nothing and by the way it's the longest lasting constitution in history to work\nWell I you know so so do you know ... you had ... you don't\nRemember yeah march used to be the president actually just take off the march but it took so long to travel any that guy like I I you know ... ... people like that which comes to

a manager of the\nOf the opening I like him and he wants to form a bench coach for the for my Mac during the twenty Fifteen Ron [noise] there's a lot of things I put it in feet at the moment for example why would you I thought I Want now hindsight being what it is why when you put a starter\nYeah the most crucial game of of the season\nYeah I had to how it worked\nHe would've looked a little bit like a genius because that meaning you got all your start if you could set the rotation the way you want it right\nIf there's one thing I remember from them from watching Teri column tonight and that in the twenty fifth in Iran as I wanted to do or die situation you know for broke you ... you have to\nYou have to because I remember in game five in the in the\nUnited States who basically struggled his way to pitch ... to to a really good ... good pitching performance and then you know what's in the guard out of the bullpen\nI'm like I'm thinking on what you feel it\nBut it works out in favor 'cause he ... he plays out do or die situation not been in Georgia situations before he should have known better\nThat's the way I I just all all Yankee fans than I Am one of them although\nOne of those crazy baseball fans because during the season baseball puts me to sleep [noise]\nBut I Love the playoffs or even that makes it even better when you have a team and their\nBut uh she's something to it gives you like a [noise] a sort of vested interest\nIn you know when when you see well besides that\nPlay off the show as usual she's the best that they got to offer\nSo usually yeah always butter\nOut thinking that depends on the sport 'cause I can say that in ... the last couple of years in the playoffs [noise] pretty early stuff\nNot so much yeah well I think it's about that and then each round\nRefreshing 'cause I Can't stand watching the giants jets anymore so [laughter]\nWell as I said I think the Jim McDonnell in in that exact seat two days ago [noise]\nIf you look at the ... the jets you have a rookie quarterback scene\nI Love the playoffs or even that makes it even better when you have a team and their\nBut uh just something to kick it gives you like a on a sort of vested interest\nAnd we were you see well besides that\nPlay off the show and it's usually the best that they got to offer\nStarted usually usually better orange butter don't\nThink it depends on the sport 'cause um I can say that in ... the last couple of years in the playoffs pretty early stuff\nNot so much yeah well I think it's the best the best and then each round\nEach refreshing 'cause I Can't stand watching the trial judge anymore so [laughter]\nWell as I said I think the Jim McDonnell in in ... vaccine two days ago\nBecause you look at the ... the jets you have a rookie quarterback so you know there's going to be growing pains of the expected\nThe giants however a different story\nThey tried they tried to get better to get into being a window now

good offensive lineman he really\nReached it and you thought this was going to be a better season and that's my point that it wasn't so far I mean when a quarter of the season and they got to pull

came out and said she thought that the ah information and the supplemental uh FBI report was exceptionally helpful and credible\nWow that's amazing yeah so it will save ... we'll see if Collins is will stick out or well she'll she'll fold like flake apparently is folded\nBut you know I'm ... I haven't heard anything where it's like ah\nYeah I think ... I think this and he got what he wanted he got he got the deep covered that he wanted a I don't see why wouldn't vote for him unless ... unless you believe the whole thing so sure\nYeah it's interesting that you mentioned Feinstein what you just said about find signing open a monologue was borne out by the Latin comments at the bottom of the hour on the news because now it's she did exactly what you said she was going to do she was she now is now starting on that supposedly now that report is not good enough\nWell she has zero credibility in my mind here is she the woman asked her to keep things confidential okay within seven days to her receipt of or this woman's letter okay she met with her\nThat's just unheard of higher former Clinton lawyers okay yeah\nYeah I think ... I think\nThis and he got what he wanted he got he got the deep cover that he wanted a I don't see why wouldn't vote for him unless ... unless you believe the whole thing so sure\nYeah it's interesting that you mentioned Feinstein what you just said about find signing open a monologue was borne out by the Latin comments at the bottom of the hour on the news because now it she did exactly what you said she was going to do she was she now is now starting on that supposedly now that report is not good enough\nWell she has zero credibility in my mind here at age ... the woman asked her to keep things confidential okay within seven days of her receipt of or this woman's letter okay she met with her\nAssistant hurt a higher former Clinton lawyers okay yeah right why did she need lawyers right away he was telling the truth okay yeah with the day after that\nThey did what appears to be a very suspect polygraph test aspect\nOf the questions were very very circa ... or ... or ... which I wouldn't expect less if you're going to run your own polygraph a\nAn ... and only two questions\nYeah and I notice that although it was requested by the committee um\nThe actual or what do you call the graphs of the test I Am and the questions and everything else ah her attorneys never turns it over wow so I didn't know about that yeah\nSo this was interesting\nI thought about Feinstein now that you mentioned that the CIA\nI think she I think she well she certainly I think she did a terrible thing to to the doctor for\nWhat she did to Ford is inexcusable she could help this woman and then at the federal or whether there are charges are true\nOr the very least if she was assaulted let her get her story or it could have been by somebody else could have been you know it can be a cap and all but there's nothing that she brought forward to make anybody believe that it's definitely other than those people that were going to believe any then\nShe said mhm and those are the people that were voting no for Kavanaugh from the get go\nI think I think personally I think Feinstein if when this all ends up and it's and it and cat when I was cleared and efficient orchestrated campaign I think Feinstein\nShould uh be gone in court for this and I also and the other day why say this the other day Nina Totenberg a high powered inside Washington oppression was going to bat for Feinstein it's just a person who is deeply involved in these campaigns\nTo destroy conservative judges she would say none of what Thomas and the other day Nina Totenberg said that these things they're talking about that the letter these things just seep out and hundreds of people knew anyway so they are already circling the wagons Ron Feinstein Feinstein as guilty as hell here\nSo I had just to so I just assume forget about it by the way a north lake has come out and said there is no additional cooperating information in the report so I was another one okay\nI mean a so anyway I was always a pleasure thanks out banks for your call okay we've got Christian white plains that I Know I was a completely different viewpoint of course are you there [laughter]\nHow are you doing okay thanks for your ... I really don't have much time because it's\nTo destroy conservative judges she was with Thomas and the other day Nina Totenberg said that these things they're talking about that the letter these things just seep out in the hundreds of people knew any way so they are already circling the wagons Ron Feinstein Feinstein as guilty as hell here\nSo I just to so I just assume forget about it by the way it or something like this come out and said there is no additional cooperating information in the report so well with another one okay\nI mean uh anyway it's always a pleasure thanks out bugs me a call okay we got close to what plans that I Know as a completely different viewpoint\nOf course are you there [laughter]\nHow are you doing okay it's actually\nI really don't have much time because I'm a I'm babysitting duty today tell what I wanted to uh to think so I think I think a key uh disqualified themselves by virtue of the fact of is overreaction okay to off what he characterized\nAs completely false accusations and okay and\nHis refusal to request an investigation of what she called completely false accusations\nWell you're quite large wildfires shock I I think that's not even close but I'll tell a lie but there could be other reasons any disqualified himself but putting those aside a\nThose on it um he\nYou know I'm thinking over reacted well I think you know it'll full of and I'm emphasizing faults okay because you know if it gets created by his reaction OK false accusations instead of just saying\nThat the accusations falls and welcoming investigation of it you know there are real questions about his\nTemperament for ... and his wife [noise]\nRisking your whole goal minute I got to really care I can I'll pay I'll talk about it after I also listen to [noise]\nOkay uh we're going to be back after this short break\nHe did not disqualify himself and thought that was me\nI think I probably would've launched lawsuits against everybody in sight\nA defamation of character\nIf I really believe that wasn't\nBut he kept because he's got\nSenate nomination hanging over is that [noise]\nWe're doing here is the latest updates from Fox News radio\nFourteen sixty building\nNews radio I'm the only in line for the Senate to vote White House press secretary Sarah Sanders as senators get their first look at these supplemental FBI report into Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh Judiciary Committee chairman Chuck Grassley\nThe FBI found no hint of misconduct but democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein says from what she saw a report look incomplete the most notable\nPart of this report is what's not in it as we noted by the White House the FBI I did not interview threats Kavanaugh nor did the FBI interview doctors lazy for having\nThe reports of witnesses who wanted to speak to the FBI but we're not interviewed and we're learning that demand suspected of shooting seven officers in South Carolina killing one of them in a Vietnam vet who bragged about its target shooting scaled news we reform\n\n\nOf your favorite for\nOn the nation coming to me the\nFeinstein says from what she saw a report look incomplete the most\nNotable part of this report is what's not in it as we noted by the White House sci fi I did not interview threats Kavanaugh nor did the FBI interview shots of lazy for setting\nThere are reports of witnesses who wanted to speak to the FBI but we're not interviewed and we're learning that demand suspected of shooting seven officers in South Carolina killing one of them in a Vietnam vet who bragged about its target shooting scale Tom Brokaw\nAnd\nShe's talking and special\nWhat your favorite hobbies for\nOn the nation coming to perfect and be the personal\nFox Nation don't gum now Fox News rundown weekly morning time just dive deep into the major and controversial during the day hosted by the anchors the Fox news radio driving down the river but she knew you won't find anywhere a plane to fall asleep bunch and it's got a job fair\nOne to watch the news they want someone that you try our job is to come through the talking points Martha ... we're going to have the top of my gender because there's a lot of conventional wisdom out there and they need to be challenged in bringing when I'm making sure that whatever you know during the day people are fully informed from Dakota we're twenty four seven news\nWe're going to be here let's we're going to be fair\nWeather for am a midnight for their contribution real news real honest opinion [noise]\nWrestling with us from all over\nStakes me Down Easy\nLet's return to the home town our with our German um fourteen sixty W.

Jeffrey Goldberg and you know he's he's a liberal guy isn't really good he's brilliant guys could could writer and he\nSo he was going to he was kind of just kind of ... or a little bit [laughter] and again she didn't ... but she was the originator of the vast right wing conspiracy idea so this is from a couple of years ago that one more clip of Hillary uh\nI think it's with ah what's that guy from CNN you know or the ... you know the guy with the white hair a you know Cooper yes yeah yeah yeah they got Anderson Cooper this was when she was running for president I think it's like the summer of twenty six I'm not sure what it's twenty sixteen anyway here you go you mentioned attack\nOn the early nineties I still believe there's a vast right wing conspiracy don't you [laughter]\nAway by the way that guy had a\nYou know they brought it to him now\nFree Goldberg and you know he's he's a liberal guy he's really good he's brilliant guys good good writer and he\nSo he was going to he was kind of just kind of poker or a little bit [laughter] and again she didn't ... but she was the originator of the vast right wing conspiracy idea so this is from a couple of years ago got one more clip of Hillary uh\nI think it's with uh what's that guy from CNN you know or the ... you know the guy with the white hair a\nYou know Cooper yes yeah yeah yeah they got Anderson Cooper this is when she was running for president tickets like December twenty six I'm not sure whether it's twenty sixteen anyway here you go you mentioned attack\nOn the early nineties you still believe there's a vast right wing conspiracy don't you [laughter]\nYou know by the way that guy had a\nYou know they brought it to know about the billionaires to pump the money and add\nAbout these guys play for Cape they want to control our country\nCenter Saturday and I agree on that completely\nThey want to read the economy so they continue to get richer and rich or they could care less are allowed to become inequality they saw their conscience is getting big money to flat there panda it all getting\nGreat pictures of them standing in front of whatever charity they donate it to but make no mistake they wanna destroy union they want to go after\nAny determine hey I'm the only by the way they want to destroy\nTwin around like Trump feel after\nOur political system has on felt like when little steady day and a do over you know I\nDon't think all of the Republican candidates are still ill informed about climate change that they say they don't know because they are not scientists they're just doing the betting and the Koch brothers they're told don't you dare say climate change Israel because where the fossil fuel bed nets felt deserving\n\nQuite it's probably not correct to say at the conspiracy because that's out in the open\nNow that there is no doubt about\nWhat they're doing and I ... I mean everybody's trying to achieve their shopping and All right thanks for your candidate can\nGet off my phone [laughter] ah no but have you know but the point is the point is that the vast right wing conspiracy the best left wing conspiracy there you go yeah this is it right this is the battle if everybody agrees Janelle\nBut the world is divided by the by the ... to conspiratorial movements on the left and the right right there it is yeah so you know I don't know how much responsibility you know Hillary tapes were that probably a lot of existence\nSince the days of Machiavelli and it will continue as long as a you know your hands end up on the levers of power that you know\nThat's exactly right so yeah interesting so what's\nGoing to what's going on now I just noticed over your shoulder right or the call or the information bar at the bottom of a a\nOf a cable news networks as a Senator Flake says quote a he has seen no additional corroborating information right so it sounds like flake who is the one that said that we needed to have this investigation right at the end of it doesn't see anything that's going to prevent him from a voting to confront\nWell there you go I mean you know I mean I never believed that this was going to turn up anything you know ... well how many tended to yeah wasn't it was really just sort of throw a sad but I guess the left\nAnd uh you know and as a matter of fact the Chris Coons the uh the Democrat on the Judiciary Committee who his wife's friend and they made the steel together they were both on a sixty minutes\nYeah interesting so what's going to what's going on now I just noticed over your shoulder\nRight or the call or the information bar at the bottom of a a\nOf a cable news networks says that Senator Flake says quote he had seen no additional corroborating information right so it sounds like flake who is the one that said that we needed to have this investigation right at the end of it doesn't see anything that's going to prevent him from a voting to confront\nWell there you go I mean you know I mean I'd never believed that this was going to turn up anything you know a while they tended to yeah [laughter] it wasn't it was really just sort of throw a sad I guess the left\nAnd uh you know and as a matter of fact the Chris Coons the uh\nThe Democrat on the Judiciary Committee who is flakes friend and they made the steel together they were both on a sixty minutes right Tuesday a Sunday\nUm you know he basically said it doesn't really matter on voting against them anyway uh yeah you know on on the ground or you know a bad guy [laughter] in his mind you know uh his you know not the least of which is that\nI guess that there's a legitimate I'm feeling that um you know the Kavanaugh has already stated or at least ... implied is the idea that he would never indicted or\nA or doesn't believe that a sitting president can be indicted or or you know or I'm a stand trial so right so the so right away you know you know the Trump picked this guy from the reason that at maybe or you know that went beyond just\nYou know his views on certain things or is this past decisions on a issues such as a you know abortion and things like that I I don't know it's just uh\nYeah so so now we have so now we have of course this isn't gonna satisfy anybody or whatever the FBI ... there was also this notion that the FBI was going to come up with a conclusive I'm\nA report in other words therefore we conclude you know judge Kavanaugh is guilty as charged by you know by Cory Booker All right uh I got a\nUh but that's not what they do they they basically just come up with you know this is what people said mhm and that's it that's it you know and also it isn't a I bought I understand the stuffed doesn't isn't made public either so\nAspects of it will certainly be late we'll hear from different senators that out you know things that will sit there narratives and should go\nSo okay so now we have a guy that's probably going to get voted on and you know and be approved and now we're going to have um a Supreme Court justice who was already compromised himself politically by testifying what he said\nYou know about the the vast right wing rescues me the vast what he didn't say that left wing conspiracy but we know what he meant right any any evoke the Clintons and The Revenge aspect and all of that now\nUh you know and I know that that he's not the first one to do um as a matter of fact Ruth Bader Ginsburg just during the campaign yep and uh I'll just read I don't know if we have enough time have much time before the break you minutes I\nI just read some of the comments that Ruth Bader Ginsburg ...\nUh she was interviewed three times I'm the quotes that actually came from those interviews were not complete ... and we don't really know everything that she said but these are the coach that made it sure did apologize that well yet in bed that's important I wouldn't get to that too\nUm socialize seven twenty six and she told the Associated Press a when asked what is Trump won the presidency Ginsberg said quote I don't want to think about that possibility but if it should be then\nThat now uh you know and I know Matt that he's not the first one to do um as\nA matter of fact Ruth Bader Ginsburg just during the campaign yep mhm and uh I'll just read I don't know if we have enough time have much time before the break you minutes I was just reading some of the comments that Ruth Bader Ginsburg\nUh she was interviewed three times I'm the quotes that actually came from those interviews were not complete and so we don't really know everything that she said but these were the coach to me to delete your did apologize that well yeah that that's important I Want to get to that too\nUm so July seven twenty six and she told the Associated Press\nA when asked what is Trump won the presidency Ginsberg said quote I don't want to think about that possibility but if it should be\nThat everything was up for grabs unquote interview July eighth twenty six team with the New York times quote I Can't imagine what this place would be I Can't imagine what the country would be with Donald Trump is our president\nFor the country it could be four years for the court it could be\nI don't even want to cuddle contemplate that contemplate that are\nReferring something to cheat to something she thought her late husband tax lawyer Martin Ginsburg would've said she said now it's time for us to move to New Zealand [laughter] quote unquote right\nInterview July eleventh twenty six team with CNN quote referring to Trump quote here's a fake or he has no consistency about him he says whatever comes into his head at the moment it really has an ego\nHow has it gotten away with not turning over his tax\nReturns [laughter] the press seems to be very general wisdom on that well all true right all true right now one sister green ... the worst guy in the world is president right now I have no problem with that but you're a Supreme Court justice right and that's supposed to say that right now he above that right\nAnd now she's going to have to serve with Brett Kavanaugh let's hope that there are legion says that more um that small club that they are in the top jury sit in the land and let's hope that their allegiances to that institution more so to their\nPolitical well I don't know I don't I mean we're it's always going to be in question is ... now here's the thing you just said she apologized ... which was you know I I have a feeling that\nThat you know or\nThey shouldn't take anything back I mean she no she said it was inappropriate for Supreme Court justice to interject yourself political exactly acknowledged then I'm now he should do the same thing I mean here he really should I mean this guy and I'll tell you something else the other thing that was troubled by his testimony Matt\nWas that he really didn't express enough sympathy I didn't think for Dr Ford\nUm you know it was clear all ten year old wanted to pray for yeah [laughter] I Know I thought it was that was pretty contrived yeah and I just thought that you know I I didn't you know I I remember reading some of the accounts I saw a lot of the hearings by watching the testimony\nOr on ... you know watched on television and I was I wanted to see what the New York times how they're going to characterize it the next day and in turn farm they had people on the New York times basically saying that he rented\nThat you know I didn't know I I remember reading some of the accounts I saw a lot of the hearings are watching the testimony a ... you know watched on television and I was I wanted to see what the New York times with how they were going to characterize it the next day and in turn for him they had people on the New York times basically saying that he rented\nThat folks a what a presumed to watch but as you know I've been paying attention to some of his stuff for nearly fifty years [noise]\nAnd I would just politely suggest to some of my friends out there who are really dead set one way or the other\nThan in my humble opinion in my fifty years of looking and being somewhat involved and hopefully a reasonably [noise] ah I don't know if ... is the word but I think I'm not an observer who's willing to hear all sides\nBut unfortunately for me as attractive of many democratic policies may be in many ways\nWhere tactics are inseparable and destructive to our democracy\nNot that the Republicans have been perfect but over many many decades that I've paid attention it seems to me and this is just another case to Kavanaugh matter that in order to preserve power for\nOver a larger issues at hand in reshaping American society they will say and do anything you\nKnow and that that is troubling yeah and\nThat's where a with dish but I Do hope that if if the Republicans lose the house I think they'll keep the Senate and maybe even gain\nGiven some of the more recent polls yeah if they lose the house\nYou can now folks and move you folks that are somewhat on the fence about all this you're going to see a firestorm of insanity take place nothing phone\nTerms of investigations will happen I think by the way this new trade agreement that Trump negotiated that nobody thought he could do\nThe prime minister of Canada and the president of Mexico appraising it but now Trump asked to submit it perhaps to the new Congress the new house of representatives\nSo if you want the trade deal the great thrill if nothing else I Hope people will vote and keep mystified so and there's a congressman on a local level and of course nationwide\nOr is it makes you recall her she was not anything that's no no\nJust that you know I I think that you know how how this plays out on the Supreme Court is going to influence yeah um you know the midterms clearly and I I think that if the you know the Republicans want to stick with Kavanaugh\nThey're going to inflame passions on

that's another issue which was was that you have your judicious and should you know that that's another\n... a concern or you know for people but with his ... his temperament showed a lack of judicial temperament and and I and I don't want to say something\nA Nancy and I think you can relate to this as someone who probably went through an experience as close to what cabinets going through as as as anybody at which was my own personal uh experience\nUm\nI don't think in public I Would ever have shown that that type of temperament that that that a judge Kavanaugh showed if they I don't\nI don't think the average individual what and you know when you sat and watched his testimony which is also true Palin you looked at him and he said well this guy's got a problem um you know the wedding

the the inappropriate\nAsking senator called the shark or have you block that have you\nIt it it almost to me personally and this is my opinion only he acts and we've all had that one person that we work with that you know it's a functioning alcoholic mhm mhm and he had\nTo me plenty of the health cell phone lines going loft or else\nFor seemingly ridiculous questions [noise] um\nThe constant perspiration now they're like ... fine you know maybe maybe it's not jumping the or maybe it's not that the second thing going on I just\nI really found him I almost at times so far for the ...\nYeah well they always look it's easy to feel sorry for him I certainly had had sympathy for ... and empathy for him um as I did for DACA floored uh bought 'em I thought that his his behavior was\nA concern as far as the temperament I Want from the Supreme Court judge\nThat that that was a concern of mine\nAnd the other thing I learned I had with the ... and again it goes back to my personal experience because I'm very sympathetic 'cause 'cause I I I Know would have liked to have false allegations leveled out due that are very personal nature and and and really you know hurtful I and I I understand how how do you feel about all of\n'em but I Know in my case in my situation all I wanted was a full fair and thorough investigation and I only wish that I have had that um and he was seemingly\nDoing everything possible to prevent that and I yeah\nI don't understand the rationale really I had a hard time you know understanding why he did what he said he just want us to testify following that\nBother them step back and say you know maybe it's a good good thing to have the final investigation instead of going through all the flock to get a rush job\nRight by Nancy ... you know uh and you remember when I was going through what I was going through all I wanted was for someone to investigate it yeah that's all I wanted I I was said please I Need a thorough investigation here\nWhen you're when you're innocent and and you know that's that that's going to help you yeah\nAnd and and and unfortunately as you know I didn't get that the closest thing was was was a someone like yourself went out of their way to interview a lot of people but I never got a thorough investigation now and I only want to go out and I only wanted that\nAnd and that sort of any rational person would ask\nFor and this is the big word here is fractional is judge Kavanaugh irrational this or did he ever momentary discretion I mean the other things\nWhen I listen to him and looked at its calendar and then listen to Dr Ford these were both very privileged kids very privileged\nA lot of people but I never got a thorough investigation now and I only want to go out and I only wanted that\nAnd and that's what any rational person would ask\nFor and that's a big word here is rational is judge Kavanaugh irrational do or did he ever momentary crushed and I mean the other thing when I listen to him and looked at as calendar and then listen to Dr for these were both very privileged kids\nVery privileged absolutely steak place since the tribe and\nWe would be so we don't know what the directive from White House counsel a lot but not through what the FBI operate under that operate under what did that help them directly from the White House and\nFrom what I understand they haven't seen that either the White House and the president was saying whatever the seven one of us to do that is what we would have the FBI to do\nWell I I again I think the way I Would be interesting to see what the directive Watson I that would help all respect\nBut Democrats will never be satisfied if it was a ten year investigation because this is not really what it's about it's about power and spent about truth otherwise Senator Feinstein\nWho held on to these allegations for nearly two wants kept them hidden and Judiciary Committee colleagues\nAre required by the doctor for hearing closed that's all that trouble you\nKnow I that was the third one doctor who we are because I understand it\nShe doesn't have the right to direct whip the Senate committee does she\nWanted to be anonymous was very clear whether you can ask\nYou that if that's to be anonymous for instead go public with it for the hearing was over\nI I I don't know ... doctor Ford's name will do know that that will be very interesting to find out where\nYou see this is where I Would think a neutral observer which say well you know what what they're talking about sounds rational it would be nice to have an investigation that everybody could trust\nBut right from the get go the whole thing appears to most I think most folks who aren't in the weeds on politics as\nWhat what are you talking about they interview the lady I didn't ... but she said she was ... making didn't fly and that's why she couldn't come to Washington but they get to interview or at a higher since she refused but she flies over the world so the lady is a proven\nWay when you're in one\nI I don't know ... doctor Ford's name will do know that that will be very interesting to find out what\nYou're saying this is where I Would think and neutral observer which say well you know what what they're talking about sounds rational it would be nice to have an investigation that everybody could trust\nBut right from the get go the whole thing appears to most I think most folks who aren't in the weeds on politics as\nWell what are you talking about they get to interview the lady and the house but she said she was ... making didn't fly and that's why she couldn't come to Washington but they were to interview at our house and she refused she flies over the world so the lady is a proven\nWay when you're in one thing you know I don't agree with\nThe senators said that many replies but we're there it's not about this\nEvent I disagree with your assessment as far as the fear of flying there are a lot of people fear of flying who do fly they prefer not to\nEnsure stricter I Can't speak to that but I I don't\nThink the behavior of someone who doesn't like by the lot of people don't like flying and so why\nBut that happens all the time I guess it wasn't that important to her was it I Can't speak for that\nI think they're making an assumption I thought I thought it was a very credible I thought you would have told me about the offer I think for them to come to my house I think she was really credible witness and I you know I think I think that I get too personal we're really in court you know\nWhen the patient testified against you credible\nUh honestly a in a pot cross examination I didn't I don't want you wiped off the ... well I I that is fortunately\nAt what most men don't have the money for an appeal\nRight correct to get a fair trial that's true\nThat's right and it's just it's a civil matter you don't have the right to an attorney right\nWell this isn't a simple matter that this is a job interview\nFor market about in your situation with the criminal matter what's credible and it was the trial of fat\nI who who prevented any other witnesses sometimes the\nStuff that happened and I understand\nThat when the conversation that is useful I could see this in practice and just how life works I'm Glad this conversation about people can get really did is finally coming to the fore\nI agree I have a\nVery good conversation that a lot of folks are saying wait a minute what's this big push to the statute of limitations you're telling me\nMy showed me can be she gets up there for Thirty years ago when ruined my life will say this is really very\nGood it's people into a conversation that Democrats really want because they were happy under the weeds won't be\n... let me say that because I I absolutely agree with you I'm I'm In a unique position um because because of what I went through and I and I think that that you know one of the concerns I have that\nThere is a presumption of guilt when an allegation is made in these types of situations\nAnd I think towards an eye on the Santa Claus\nWas explaining why been dead woman in the parking lot of protection is good at two o'clock\nOr were with me too movement\nWhen we hope to accomplish Democrats would we won't we\nWon't let me say that because I I absolutely agree with you I'm I'm In a unique position um because because of what I went through and I and I think that that you know one of the concerns I have is that\nThere is a presumption of guilt when an allegation is made in these types of situations\nAnd I think and I own a shattered\nWomen in the parking lot that you\nWere with me too movement has the same but the you know sexual allegations rice and and I and I think that's the concern at the end you know\nYou know interesting well\nThen I'm not sure I agree with that but I thought were\nShut down and shut up membership gosh well I kind of country as a I\nI don't I don't agree with that but but uh but I'll tell you why should he was driving will will will maybe the next week pat thank you for the call I voted for him to\nTo be out out of Bradley show we'll be right

anything you care to talk about\nSo I was I'm Talking a little bit about the budget process this year I in the chair of the budget Appropriations Committee\nAnd some of you might have heard our new county executive George Latimer gave a little bit of a background about what's going on with our budget or earlier this in the summertime [noise]\nWe do have an operational deficit ah we expected it was going to be in the twenty five million dollar range but because of some operational efficiencies that looks like it's about Eighteen million dollars\nFor the twenty Eighteen year but as you might have heard we have uh just settled a contract\nWith the ... and the leaders of the SEA our largest union\nOr have just reached the conclusion of contract negotiations and now our members are voting on this contract and we'll know by friday whether or not the they accept this contract or not um and if they do accept this contract that's going to be another large chunk of money that will have to find because you might know that people haven't had a contract in Westchester County ... the U.S our largest union by far\nAnd people haven't had a contract since two thousand and seven\nSo um there's a lot of old a ... years that needs to be taken into account when you when you settled a union contract\nPeople are entitled to whatever you negotiate as pay increases but they are entitled to back pay so\nIf the contract is approved and we go forward with it and the legislature after careful review\nDecides that we're going to approve this contract then I'm Will have to find a another several million um to to close that part of the gap too estimated around thirty four million\nOne of the things that um the county executive has promised is that all of the that back pay will um will be paid to people you know in the course of this calendar year but as a as an incentive\nUm because we know that people have waited a long long long long long time for their raises so um we're looking forward with a sort of bated breath about what's going to happen on friday\nOr to see whether or not we have a vote or nay voted we've ... we've heard\nYou know we've heard different things like sort of from the grapevine a so we're not we're not really sure what's gonna what's gonna happen so uh that's an interesting thing but we are expecting next week that we're going to get the first part of the budget from the county executive and that's the capital projects budget so\nLegislators in the county executive work with our local municipalities\nTo see what kind of infrastructure resources and other types of capital projects parks roads et cetera\nThat are county owned with with the county has an interest in a at how we're what we're gonna do bonding wise to um to fix up our infrastructure uh ... it's really important obviously because of the first the first goals of a of a\nForward with a set of bated breath about what's going to happen on friday or to see whether or not we have a vote or nay voted we've ... we've heard\nYou know we've heard different things like sort of from the grapevine a so we're not we're not really sure what's gonna what's gonna happen so uh that's an

executive work with our local municipalities\nTo see what kind of infrastructure resources and other types of capital projects parks roads et cetera\nThat are county owned or that the county has an interest in\nA at how we're what we're gonna do bonding wise to um to fix up\nOur infrastructure uh ... it's really important obviously because the first the first goal of a of a um any kind of governing body or the health safety welfare of the people that they represent but also\nInfrastructure and parks and um amenities that this nature are also really significant economic drivers because people businesses don't want to relocate and people don't want to live\nIn an area where the roads are always broken down or where there's no um you know nice a nice amenities nice recreation nice park so there's sort of thing that we give a lot of consideration too\nAs we do the budget process\nUm and then the next part of the budget will come out on um November night the county executive has said he hasn't told\nHe has until the ... but he has said that he is going to give it to us on the ninth which will be our operational budget for the twenty Nineteen year for the county executive presents that the legislature spends a several weeks really going over the line by line with every department every\nPart of the operational budget it is one of the most intense times of the year for the county board of legislators\nAnd even though they're headed up the Seventeen members are on the budget committee very frequently on many more of our members even if they're not on the committee will come and listen to presentations especially in key areas like the department of social services which is what our largest department and our biggest single expense\nFor Westchester County so it's it's at the beginning of a very intense time of year I think uh the county executive has done\nA really good job of sort of setting expectations\nThe the county is in a situation where we don't have a lot of extra resources but it's really important to a look at the look at the budget with very clear eyes and then make some ... that make some decisions that can start turning the ship back to really excellent financial solvency you know west Chester is a\nVery rich rich county we are looked at by not only other places in New York state but places around\nThe country as as an innovative county and we want to make sure that where you know we're doing the right we're doing right by by our county residents so we're right at the beginning of that process I Am really anxious to hear\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThat's what's nice about this particular ... um [noise] project is eight and restores buildings that have really just deteriorated from from ditch you\nBut it also turns them into very very very functional senior apartments\nI'm David I'm sure you know but I don't know if our listeners know that ah Westchester County has a good fortune of having the highest life expectancy in New York state sales so I'm very proud of the yeah it's great that we are living longer we're living healthier it really is a reflection of our general access to resources here in Westchester County which is a wonderful thing\nBut as you say David it really means that we need to change our thinking about a lot of things we need to change your thinking not only about housing and making good housing unit for people so that they can move out of their houses and young families can move into their houses that are too difficult or too expensive to maintain for the senior citizen\nBut keep them in the communities that they live\nAging in place is such a smart way to go\nBut I completely agree and helps keep our fabric of the way it is you know people who help raise our children\nAre involved in our community you know they should have the option of staying here if they like and not be forced out right looks fences or even maintenance and you're allergic to downsize\nThan just you know just part of life up but they should not be forced out you know that's what we're doing here making housing more affordable and accessible to or senior population of all the population tacoma's well\nYeah for sure for sure there's plenty of need but but I also like about a project like this is you know study is really show first of all that aging in place winds up being cheaper from ... for everyone wet weather in the health care costs I picked up by a\nMedicare and Medicaid and um that picked up by the by the counting and by the state and the federal government\nUm so the there is definitely a cost benefit but really when when seniors are allowed to ... when I have a community what's nice about this project is it's really going to\nCreate a community of seniors who are living together we're not living facility but they will have community rooms and opportunities for classes and other kinds of things it's right on the college campus right adjacent to the college campus so it's plenty of things seniors to do in Westchester community college\nWell speaking of uh classes in college not that long ago show stronger heavy with our\nCoverage goes out to have your are your area of expertise David [laughter] 'cause I\nWas at a community college offers wonderful classes for seniors actually and they all non credits on credit classes are very

censorship that's occurring there people may be aware that\nThe conservative actor James Woods who's had his account shut down and there have been stories about other accounts couldn't shut down for no legitimate reason in my view especially if you're from even free speech\nSenator but we are seeing in New York as well Here's Mark Marlon arrow he refuses to he refused to back and doesn't back now President Trump\nYou know he has not endorsed Brett Kavanaugh's confirmation for the Senate he's a dissident within his own Republican Party but on the Democratic side they walk in lock step in talk in lock step\nAnd it used to be thought of it I think some people still do think that the Democratic party as the party of tolerance but you can make a strong case don't you agree that it's really the party of intolerance\nFelt completely the Democrats are one hundred percent tolerant as long as you are a drone and as long as you agree with everything they said you step on line just a little they will try to pound you down and attack you they are the least tolerant group you're ever going to see up there the left\nIs borderline fascists at this point the way they're ... they're reacting in

can't be allowed to continue\nTheir like little children but I have always said\nThis is what you get when you raise a couple of generations of kids who get a trophy just for showing up they don't know how to take no for an answer they don't know how to take the feet and they throw these ridiculous temper tantrums and they are filled by the leadership of the Democratic party\nWhere you don't go

talking to a rents are counting jacket or Stephen Glass and said you know as a member of the assembly down to the capital and I as a member of the press corps the Capitol both saw\nThat in where'd you describe with these active is so we've seen them down there for a couple of decades now are engaging in civil disobedience disruption is always on the left never on the right but I wasn't it just adds something you know you talk about it being a childish behavior\nBeing the product of a education system where everybody has to feel rewarded it's also a clever tactic not where they've made the decision to to act\nLike a noxious interference with democracy because it\nGets impressed and they often dominate the headlines we saw that with the anti or natural gas generally anti hydro fracking people they show up they harassed Andrew Cuomo they show up in his home they wind up harassed them there and they wind up intimidating people don't you think it's a calculated tactic that often works\nWell it does and that's because far too often on our side they backup instead of standing right there and and\nFiguratively not literally but figure throwing the punch back at them and standing in the breach far too often the Republicans have been too willing to fight from the ropes unique to go toe to toe with these people their arguments don't hold up\nAnd when you did that when my kids were babies that they throw a tantrum you ignore them you don't you don't feed into it so it learned pretty quickly it wasn't going to work so\nYeah you're right they get away with it they're they're they're out of their minds if you look at some of these folks\nThere just out of their minds with rage they don't have any idea what they're talking about that you know it just it's mind boggling to see but you know the the thing with the Democrats read as\nThey are never ever held responsible for anything they never need redemption that they're never held responsible for thing Republicans are held responsible for absolutely everything and can never ever be redeemed and the Democrats eyes it's really something to watch\nThat didn't Bush is a very sweeping I think accurate indictments of the

reality is the guy the guy didn't do what they saying he's doing it appears so\nI don't know at ... at I'm shaking my head and discussed at what the Democrats have pulled their\nBy the way the lead largely by our own junior Senator Pearce and children should be ashamed of herself as a law school graduate for saying that due process doesn't matter\nThe presumption of innocence has gone that's pretty frightening stance for law school graduate and a U.S senator to take\nI agree what are you making the fact that your candidate for governor mark Marlon arrow or refuses to say that he ... he said he won't say whether he thinks cabin or should be confirmed that is to say he doesn't support the confirmation\nOf judge Kavanaugh and to deal with that in part I think the conservative party which accent Marlon arrow is now running really bizarre radio commercials in which they say that they and the conservative party that President Trump\nAnd they've ... mile an hour or so you should be ... mile an arrow even though they don't say that in our in our does in fact Trump and I pointed out\nHe doesn't back a judge Kavanaugh what do you make of his failure to do that and you think that's gonna hurt mowing arrow with Republican voters\nIt remains to be seen from my perspective I think it's a mistake I think you you listen to your guts and not your handlers and are you do what you think is the right thing to do and I think the right thing to do here is to say look\nThere's no proof this lady's story keeps falling apart by the day she said she's afraid to fly she flew more than I did as a pilot for crying out she's all over the world\nSo an air story just doesn't seem to hold up in that water on hold water I'm not saying that something didn't happen to the lady but a judge Kavanaugh said it wasn't him\nAnd and her her own witnesses are falling apart so uh I think what do you trust your gut and you do the right thing\nYou think any of the Republican candidates in your area for Congress for the state Senate assembly for district attorney are in trouble right now\nI feel good I mean they need don't you don't know for sure we have a very tight race here with our district attorney but I Want to make it clear to everybody out there listening to my Joel able love's opponent is a big fan of Andrew Cuomo and a big opponent of the second amendment and that should say a lot here rents are county\nI think John ... going to be in good shape but we are not ever taken a foot off the gas Daphne Jordan should be good Jay Gatsby should be good and they are both working their tails off so I think you know with the ... race anybody looks at that race and see that\nThe first the next time that a Delgado votes in his district will be the first time he has no connection in this district\nWhere I have are of course they've nationalized election but I think it's something you alluded to earlier season is very important and that is several polls including in NPR Marist College poll I Believe it was\nA show that there's a growing level of enthusiasm among Republican voters that now is at least he calls are very well known it's been talked about for some time enthusiasm anti Trump and fuzzy hasn't really amongst democratic voters and that should help\nI really think Republican candidates all across the board\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor a new um NAFTA or which would open up at least some markets for an American and New York in particular dairy products to get into Canada ... ... ... you know about it and it sounded like something that can help New York dairy farm farms like yours\nUm ... yes if if for no other reason certain things better than uncertainty and um I we can talk about Canada and just a minute but our largest um consumer of\nOf dairy products to Mexico and we are exporting about sixteen Seventeen percent of our ah dairy products exporting them every day so like one day a week we've got to exploit that product\nYou man you know and I did I Do you mean mail there he's talking about your farm are we talking about American dairy producers\nI'm Talking about the American dairy producers okay\nSo Mexico is you know by far biggest customer so that is important for the American dairy producer be\nAnything else on oil is priced based on a national\nUm Christ set up the Chicago mercantile exchange and then there's differential based on where you live or for instance ah we sell in the\nCity and we get a premium for that now but the base of our clients is all priced nationally so we we might get a little bit more milk than someone saying\nIn western New York or Ohio but we're all getting the same base so that's really important so that the the certainty for Mexico and it was really really important because they have a huge market for our product that's number one\nUh where candidates concerned Canada's important as the New York producer because\nI'm a store for the last I'm guessing decade or so we've had two cooperatives of of um of dairy farms from one from the finger lakes can use a marketing group and I'm from Rochester buffalo upstate Niagara\nThat would send ultra filtered milk powder or to Canada where they would take that\nI'm caught up\nIn New York or Ohio but we're all getting the same base so that's really important so that the the certainty for Mexico as it was really really important because they have a huge market for our product that's number one\nUh where candidates concerned Canada's important as the New York producer\nBecause I'm historic sort of last I'm guessing decade or so we've had two cooperatives of of um of dairy farms from one from the finger lakes can use a marketing group\nAnd I'm from Rochester and buffalo upstate Niagara\nThat would send ultra filtered milk powder or to Canada where they would take that\nAnd use it to make a de formula or what have you and I say they're sending it to Canada we're talking about you know an hour two hour drive and that's why they serve that market because it was close\nUm than Canada would in turn there'll be a process of there that would turn it into baby formula or what have you and they would\nExport it and it's just the way commerce worked um the Canadians found a way I'm guessing about two years ago to create this class seven milk\nThat they would basically under price that products for themselves\nAnd just make it impossible for anyone to compete it appears going forward that they're getting rid of that class of milk\nWhich and it appears as though there's going to be a level playing field of course so the initial news is great great news I mean it was\nIt it's always been good news to see um the administration so engaged um on behalf of dairy farm so that's good the question is is it going to be is the new system going to be viable and are we going to police it enough\nAnd those questions remain to be seen as hot as it is it's all positive but you know the proof is in the putting we'll find out long term um how good it's going to be you know in the next couple of months but they all appearances are good\nHurt you make it sound and I just don't follow it closely and I'm sure our listeners do you make it sound like is it was only a few years ago that Canada maybe using some loophole or ...\nOr a section of existing I've been asked a treaty started imposing these restrictions on a New Yorker or American varies is that the case or has it been difficult to do any business in Canada for some time\nI'm both how's that [laughter] you know there's always been very protectionist and they've done things here and there this\nUm class seven loophole has been for the past two years and it was a large amount of milk I Know for the one cooperative was tent the equivalent of ten tractor trailer loads of milk a day\nThat they were sending to Canada as part of this deal is allowing us more access to the Canadian market which\nThat's fine but those thirty million people in Canada so it's not like this is a massive market that we're gaining access to\nThat's all fine and good but the bigger factor was this product that we were making into that essentially Canada was that supporting the product but they're only exporting it because they had products from off\nSo going forward it appears as though there\nIt's always been very protectionist and they've done things here and there this um class seven loophole has been for the past two years and it was a large amount of milk I Know for the one cooperative it was ten the equivalent of ten tractor trailer loads of milk a day\nThat they were sending to Canada because part of this deal is allowing us more access to the Canadian market which\nThat's fine but this thirty million people in Canada so it's not like this is a massive market that we're gaining access to\nThat's all fine and good but the bigger factor was this product that we were making into that essentially Canada was that supporting the product but they're only exporting it because they had products from us\nSo going forward it appears as though they're Canadian um product is going to be on a level playing field with our us products and it's supposed to be\nI think in long term it's going to be better but again\nCanada as always play games I mean I I can speak better on\nThe line issue or where people would come from Ontario into central and western in northern New York go to the finger lakes and go to a winery they'd buy wine and if they took it home they would have like a two hundred percent terrorists so\nYou'd have Washington talk with Ottawa\nAnd they'd say oh no no it's a provincial issue so so then the state of New York would talk with you know wherever the head of Ontario is and they just constantly keep moving the ball\nSo um that's how they've survived that's how they've I mean I I heard a presentation from a dairy farmer from\nCanada this summer talking about their system and he openly said well you know part of our part of our deal as Lee a protectionist and it's not something that we\nHave been able to get away with in America and we just we can't operate that way because they produce so much and if you look at the world\nSupplies of food um we have so much\nGreat farmland and so much potential that grow food we have to be able to export or just change our whole mentality as a as a nation\nAnd that's not easy either so I'm just one of those things\nAre going to fair to say that from what you've seen in the very community in New York there is a unanimity that what the Trump is ah called tentatively accomplish he's a good thing or are there any dissenting voices voices that you've seen out there\nUm I haven't seen any so I have a good friend who won would characterize as are never Trump and when we have a a good discussion and say well how do you do you disagree with anything you know he said about Canada and no one can argue with that um you might find\nYou might find other people that you're getting into other politics but if you just stay in on dairy terms everyone agrees this has been a problem\nIn it is nice to um to have a you know to to be thought of as well I mean the going forward the challenge is\nGoing to continue to be um\nWith the the trade war with China it's costing\nThat that's the next big thing I\nI Know we export a lot of dry milk products way protein products um to China and for my cooperative that's a hundred thousand dollars a month or so I mean all long it would seem obvious that it will be easier to win the battle with Canada\nUm you might find\nYou might find other people that you're getting into other politics but if you just stay in on dairy terms everyone agrees this has been a problem and it is nice to um to have a you know to to be thought\nOf well I mean the going forward the challenge is going to continue to be um with the the trade war with China it's costing\nThat that's the next big thing I\nI Know we export a lot of dry up products way protein products um to China and from my cooperative that's a hundred thousand dollars a month or so I mean all long it would seem obvious that it would be easier to win\nThe battle with candidate because honestly where scanners are going to go\nThey can make deals with other countries but the reality is we are great partner for them short and we're I mean us markets a great market for any country\nMuch less our neighbor China they you know authoritarian regime they they can get away with and do whatever they want and again I don't\nHear too many\nPeople in America saying I'll leave China alone the challenge is\nHow do you as a business um get through this is my my point is as\nWe all well I I Would assume a lot of people think that we need to do something about China\nIt's just the question of where you come down and how much how much you can take the um\nThe challenges for instance China's the biggest by far they they China eats up more soybeans and the world than any other country then all the rest of the countries combined there is a huge market for us so I didn't I couldn't tell you the numbers 'cause I don't see over and soybeans but\nUm a friend of mine was at a talk and said that if China bought every ... in the world they still have to get like twenty percent of the world's supply from the u._s. um so at some point they're either going to change their habits or they're going to buy us soybeans the priority\nI Would just point out let me just say if you're going to sell or it's going on in China they have great economic difficulties now in and growing internal problems and they're very worried about the Trump administration's willingness to take them on an economically we
