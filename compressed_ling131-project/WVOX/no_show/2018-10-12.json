hundred people who were all involved in production and computer animation and all kinds of stuff we got a tire curve going on over here\nLot you know you and me and everything [noise] who we are [noise]\nAre like a gigantic machine [noise]\nAll of humanity at what where are we can spread out and accomplish thing you know I think that if you were to look at it humanity is the most powerful machine in the history of the planet and because we've gone from living in the forest [noise]\nAh to pull out all jazz but you see around you now know that stuff you know that this was an air people did it people did most of it anyway people that are just got done a lot of it [noise]\nWe we built all that stuff [noise] only building made all these institutions when we come up with all these ideologies and we believe all these things and\nFor what who knows what we're doing it so I suggest that humanity is the most powerful machine on the planet [noise]\nBuild pyramids the skyscrapers and the Internet and talk to each other instantaneously across the globe ... with all this infrastructure and stuff that we put up all these wires and telephone poles and transmitters and receivers and everything all over the place all of it working all the time now [noise]\nTo people thanks to us we did it I mean not me personally I did put up any of the transmitters but you know we we did it all of us we did it together [noise]\nPerhaps what I mean by humanity is the most powerful machine [noise]\nWhen you have that\nAnd for what who knows what we're doing it so I suggest that humanity is the most powerful machine on the planet [noise]\nBuild pyramids the skyscrapers and the Internet and talk to each other instantaneously across the globe with all this infrastructure and stuff that we can put up all these wires and telephone poles and transmitters and receivers and everything all over the place all of it working all the time now [noise]\nLike two people thanks to us we did it I mean not me personally I didn't put up any of the transmitters but you know we we did it all of us we did it together [noise]\nBut what I mean by humanity at the most powerful machine [noise]\nWhen you have that much power\nThe there's this sort of it seems like a natural human urged to want to use it to do something let's say let's zoom out for a second let's say that I Want the power to\nCreate a beautiful painting [noise] well that takes practice and that takes us kind of a talent [noise]\nAnd it takes to kind of learning what the right thing to do and what you don't want to do and and you work at it and you get something you get painting and you start painting on the canvas and you look at it and you say that doesn't look so good and you do it again and you're looking at that looks a little bit and so what you're doing is you're building up your ability to do something power to paint [noise]\nIt's awfully similar in the form of organizing other people to do things you know organizing thirty people that come together and do a thing and it's all of those thirty people all have to learn to paint together\nA certain way and then finally maybe if they learn to play together they can create a\nGreat big painting altogether using their individual effort and that's the power of the human machine we use computers at all these things but really what they do is just an extension of our\nOwn little thing that we want to do whatever you want to do things you know we want to get out there and do something what did you do something with their life is like by what I hear go do something what'd ya what do you do with sitting around go do something [laughter] and so you'd be picked out and you know we get a refill ourselves that a lot of you know into\nThinking that that sitting with the technology is really doing something like the people that watch the news you watch\nThe news you watch the news and you get the best I really am engaged in the civic discussion on the conversation on the ... century doing is you're watching a\nScreen with a bunch of people on it talking about stuff they don't know anything about and you know making points and then you listen and yet that they are you watching the news religiously or doing something well you know maybe I don't I don't know I don't don't don't put me down here are taken up side you know\nGet off my back I just let me let me see what I'm saying [laughter]\n\nI says oh I tell you what radio station and says oh my goodness I don't think I did well you are in for a shock because this radio station it's W. B. O. X.\nFourteen sixty eight him\nW. B. I. P. H. D. too for those of you who do ... I don't know anybody that does the whole HD Radio thing except for maybe if it came in your car like pre packaged maybe then you might have it but I don't know anybody that's got out and bought in ... the radio and listen to those channels so properly or [noise]\nIt wasn't really the right direction I don't think for the industry but it's there [noise]\nSo humanity as a gigantic machine [noise]\nThink it it must be one of those things to do\nSo what I'm saying [laughter] [laughter]\nI says oh I tell you what radio station and says oh my goodness I don't think I did well you are in for a shock because this radio station is W. V. O. X.\nFourteen sixty eight\nW. B. I. P. H. D. too for those of you who do HD rate I don't know anybody that does the whole HD Radio thing except for maybe if it came in your car like pre packaged maybe then you might have it but I don't know anybody that's gone out and bought an HD Radio and listen to those channels so properly [noise]\nIt wasn't really the right direction I don't think for the industry but it's there [laughter] [noise]\nSo humanity as a gigantic machine [noise]\nI think it it it must be one of those things to do when you said that that that power out there to do something to build a pyramid you know that took a lot of work from a lot of people\nThere's also those people who get the sense that they want to control it they want to be in charge of the people who move the things and build the stuff and then you don't want they want to order it around\nAnd sometimes you are in charge because you want people to build something that will make everyone live better sometimes you're in charge because you want to put a gigantic tune for your own death up 'cause you're just in our success even consider that perhaps the pyramid or just built by three megalomaniac\nHave anything to do with\nReligion or are they just said you know make it bigger 'cause I'm going to be dead and I want to leave my mark on the world and they are all just happened to have the political power to do it at the time\nThat we'll never really know but you know that's what we do we we get together and we build Great Pyramid the Internet that guy's scrapers of our city these football stadiums and gained governments and constitutional law these are all the great pyramid that come together when people formed giant group decide that they want to accomplish something [noise]\nAnd uh well there's all those also those people that want to control all of that and to direct their creative energy through the use of the human machine [noise]\nAnd that's of course it's not all to say that we are all machine [noise]\nBecause there are certainly things out there that are\nThere is nothing to do with any of this [noise] nothing to do with the building of great things that part of the human machine and working together whatever that are extremely an enjoyable for in life like ah Chris bottom breeze or or feeling a\nWhile I get the rain today [noise]\nI had nothing to do with any of this giant machine stuff\nYou know it's great to accomplish something and and with Fifteen other people and look back and say wow we did that we built that from the ground up and it's also great to go for a walk every ... playing their own game [noise] now I suspect I suspect that those people\nWho ah [noise] well [noise]\nSeek out the power to control of the people in the context of building power for the ... you know from the human from humanity uses using humanity as your own power [noise]\nI suspect that there are some people out there who want to do that because they want everybody to work together to build something that everyone will enjoy like a let's say a republic you know just as an ideal and we get together and we come together and we build a system of government that it might not be perfect but it makes everybody more or less [noise]\nHappy when we all get a voice and we all get a little bit of power and vote for the most part everybody sits around the banks things are pretty fine\nUh that I can imagine there's other people out there who don't exactly know\nThe game [noise] now I suspect I suspect that those people\nWho ah [noise] well [noise]\nSeek out the power to control of the people in the context of building power for the ... you know from the humans from humanity uses using humanity as your own power [noise]\nI suspect that there are some people out there who want to do that because they want everybody to work together to build something that everyone will enjoy like a let's say a republic you know just as an ideal\nWe get together we come together and we build a system of government that it might not be perfect but it makes everybody more or less [noise]\nHappy we all get a voice and we all got a little bit of power and vote for the most part everybody sits around the banks things are pretty fine [noise]\nUh that I can imagine there's other people out there who don't exactly know why they want it but they want that [noise]\nThese are the people that want power for ... sake [noise]\nLike there's really no end goal\nThere is no final product [noise]\nAnd it's not much\nIs not much being worked towards except for the continuous\nBuilding of one's own power and there's more and more I can can accomplish more and more and more isn't that great book how great it [noise]\nAnd then one day you're dead\nSuspect that these people are everywhere in the world and all kinds of ...\nBut all kinds of institutions [noise]\nBut uh ... it's a it's a great it's a great balancing act I'd say between a working in that world of the human machines building the great pyramid or whatever and are just going out and enjoying a cross bottom breathe the balance between that it took a lot of people for me to do this radio show but I certainly enjoy doing it [noise]\nIt took a lot of people to to to build\nAll of the stuff that the the infrastructure of here that allows me to do that but at the same time I feel like I'm going for a walk through the woods right now where it's just me and who am I saying [noise]\nSo where is the balance I don't know\nWhen you get to thinking these things when you when the elections are coming up the people are making speeches about how great they are and how terrible their opponent the new the commercials and all that stuff going on all over the place [noise] local national level\nGlobal level there's all kinds of everyone's vying for position politically it and for the most part it's fun for me to sit back and watch the whole thing because we get our own fascinated people just vying for power\nOr but on the other hand you know I live in uh we live in this republic here and management and we don't want to keep it going strong and so sometimes it takes a little involvement [noise]\nTypical ... difficult to come down on the say this is why I Can't take anyone seriously when they got up and said that they have the answer because I can never believe that I really totally have the answer for anything and so how could somebody else really habit unless they're fooling themselves and the rest of the crowd\nAnd all I don't buy it I don't buy it for a second [noise] go for someone else without mumbo jumbo what'd ya [noise]\nAt all I don't buy it I don't buy it for a second\nGoal for someone else without mumbo jumbo what'd ya [noise]\nHad a maybe put together three or four teams and the three or four teams will compete in a big tournament to see who was the best and so they all play with a bunch of different field going all kinds of games\nAnd it'd be like three or four games a and a three or four field at any given moment and we'd play two or three games a day will go for for a whole week and it was a great big event there was everything was focusing on that when you were that cap you were doing other stuff you were having fun you're doing other things that we were worried about cap and everything and then\nThen all of a sudden it's baseball weak and everybody would pick teams in it and so I was on the team [noise] ah well first of all I Need to explain the political parties I don't know how or why this worked\nI think it's one of those ingrained subconscious things but uh we I was on team green [noise]\nAnd uh what team green for some reason I don't know if it was a by by choice or by locker by chance are what team green was ah was basically the cup perpetual underdog\nWe were absolutely not favored to win anything ever it was always going to be a gigantic battle between red and blue and green was just kind of happy to be there may be participating in the other but they just sort of\nYou know the age of ... [laughter] they're just happy to be that you know they're not going to win but you know everybody's having fun and that's what it's all about right and so that was team green\nOr wherever we knew we would never have a shot at it but you know we just we just showed up anyway [laughter]\nAnd uh again I think that this uh mayor for my political views for the rest of my life going forward I think that being isolated and the and the third party or just just just changed my way of thinking for my entire life\nAnd it's all thanks to this camp and so\nThere was a time during this great big tournament a leading up to it leading up to the tournament a that was not very much there was baseball going on but it wasn't part of the games on it wasn't a baseball cap you know this wasn't\nBlue like what you went to do this was just a great big event that occurred during the period of time of kept that everyone thought about one in what's happening but before it happened it wasn't like every once in ...\nBut you know everybody's having fun and that's what it's all about right and that was team green\nOr wherever we knew we would never have a shot at it but you know we just we just showed up anyway [laughter]\nAnd uh again I think that this may have formed my political views for the rest of my life going forward I think that being isolated and the and the third party or just just just changed my way of thinking for my entire life\nAnd it's all thanks to this camp and so\nThere was a time during this great big tournament a leading up to it leading up to the tournament a there was not very much there was baseball going on but it wasn't part of it wasn't a baseball cap you know this wasn't\nDo what you what to do this was just a great big event that occurred during the period of time of kept that everyone thought about what's happening but before it happened it wasn't like everyone sitting around playing baseball so one time when you got a free rein sometimes you you would go to less than you would go to a activities\nUh and then you'd come around and and every now and then you get the option to just do like whatever you want it for an hour and just make sure you show up at the next thing that that was one of the things that you could do it you know within reason other kids being supervised but you don't always kept ...\nAnd so you know you just do whatever you want and so one time me and a bunch of guys which kids are I think I think a James was there and I think\n[laughter] actually we we call them Jamal at the time [laughter]\nUh what what was his name um [noise] I think Luke it was one of them and Brian\nUh uh you know ... ... and then then of course then of course there was the big guy the ringer this was our slugger and his name\nAnd Joe was a big tough guy who always referred to everyone else is stupid jerk\nAnd he and I and James and Bryan we live together or in the same cabin like a you know you get like sex or twelve kids to a cabin something like that at some number maybe ten I mean everyone's going to do in a bunk bed so me and Joe and James of Bryant you know foreign little friendship\nAnd uh you know it's always fun to hang out with Joe because he was always picking fights\nOr and always winning them so you wanted to hang out with them because anytime you got into a tough\nJob was there and you knew that you were going to be okay with Joe and so we had this guy and Brian brain was the quick one he was a sort of you with sharp minded he was always coming up with the singers and the one liners and he was also just kind of very fast and wiring\nA [laughter] so [laughter] the four of us we would hang out on their free time and er during the first couple of weeks of camp we decided that we were going to play baseball\nOr you know just a little talk some around have fun with the type baseball uh the kind where it without the umpires without the pageantry with all that stuff and so we would play we play fast pitch I had my catches equipment and then we like and uh you know we'd get up and get a couple of other groups of kids that come over and we'd be playing like a you know [noise]\nAh say five on five or or or maybe six on six baseball factor that kind of thing you know we are ... two guys in the outfield three in the field and you're done you're ready to go [laughter]\nAnd uh I Would catch for both teams and I wasn't allowed to head if it came down to that [laughter] or something like that 'cause nobody else wanted a cat they don't nobody else quite figured out the scam with the whole catching thing everybody wanted to be out in the shortstop for some reason Derek Jeter was big at that time so I think it was one of those things I ever wanted to be Derek Jeter 'cause of course is the camp in New York\nSo uh [laughter] well anyway we would go out to the field and we were play baseball on her own justice get just for fun and and we'd go out and we and we realized\nThe the kind where it without the umpires without the patch and trade with all that stuff and so we would play we play bass patch I had my catches equipment and ... and uh you know we'd get up and get a couple of other groups of kids that come over and we'd be playing like a you know [noise]\nAh say five on five or or or maybe six on sex baseball ... two guys in the outfield three in the field and you're done you're ready to go [laughter]\nAnd uh I Would catch for both teams that I wasn't allowed to ... if it came down to that [laughter] or something like that 'cause nobody else wanted a cat they know nobody else quite figured out the scam with the whole catching thing everybody wanted about be out in the shortstop for some reason but Derek Jeter with big at that time so I think it was one of those things I ever wanted to be Derek Jeter 'cause of course this was a camp in New York\nSo uh well anyway we would go out to the field and nearby baseball on the road justice get just for fun and and we'd go out and we and we realized whatever we had a way that Brian pitching and we'd have a job would come up to the ... he was a big guy\nAnd he would always knock 'em out of the park every time you know he ... he was the flood or he'd come up there and we all moved back it's Joe\nAnd he said every now and then he'd strike out and he called the pitcher is stupid jerk and we'd move on it every now and then a lot of the time he went out of the park and where you would say hey man this guy's really tough oh speaking of stupid jerks smacking it out of the park here come the people with the news you know we've got to do it [noise]\n... national news here is the latest updates from Fox News radio\nLose I'm rich Dennison Lee Associated Press reports the Ari discharge more than five hundred

manage to the\nIdea of manhood that'll make you ought to be between the free market and what the government can do and people's expectations\nBut that that's a big question with a lot of layers but but uh the free market is important because in order to get proper pricey for a development you have to have the free market and have people compete to give you the best price you lose that government sometimes um as far as praise yeah it was you know\nSo so that's a problem as as far as picky locations uh I mean if the government is going to go in and pick a location for its family court\nUm you know we assume they have to go to the market and pay the price for for the place that they want to have 'em unless they're gonna use eminent domain but\nI don't think that's where we're talking about in this place and see if he could play case of the places where the family court it's what's the appropriate place for transportation purposes um I mean is that is that what the nature of discussion is\nWell yeah and the also the nature of this discussion is because of politics everything has entered the dynamic including race including the tea including people that don't want something in their backyard and or paranoia electron justified or not these are tough how you do you do\nWhat are those those courses entering but but to you know the best best a development is that the develops organically and and so we're doing development now in an average student Harris and it was just a matter of time before Harrison kind of caught up with an American religion\nA and right and so uh they have some development there because it's needed their downtown and also because transferring developed which is a popular now so they're looking to do something they're downtown so so that's developed organically\nThe transformation of um office parks into housing or medical uses is is a organically happening to eighty seven so some of these things happen organically in and then on the government functions that need a place to go in and to this one family court\nUm there has to be a number of family court sprinkled throughout um Westchester to to serve to leave\nYou know the best best a development is that the develops organically and and so we're doing development now in an average student ... it was just a matter of time before Harrison kind of caught up with an American religion\nA and rye and so uh they have some development there because it's needed their downtown and also because transferring development is a popular now so they're looking to do something they're downtown so so that's developed organically\nThe transformation of um office parks into housing or medical uses is is a organically happening to eighty seven so some of these things happen organically in and then um the government functions that need a place to go in and to this one family court\nUm there has to be a number of family court sprinkled throughout um Westchester to to serve to lead to the community and it's got to go someplace so that decision as to maybe that's why\nWe have a local controllers owning so that any decisions can be made by the local a local seeds jurisdiction um but then there's another level of of the county has got to come in and say where does the counting somebody should go for it it's\nJust shove your story ... we're talking with John Bernie he's run for office he say a a a very decent guy always have to say that because people said only know you a little ... or even better than they kind of the radio he is he does to some real estate development in his law practice\nDeep water with Graham oh All right what's going on what's on your mind today [noise]\n[noise] well we asked couples couples stories lots of stories in the paper this week but two of them that we featured was um\nA racist state Senate up north northern west Chester parents Murphy first is Peter Hart come um you know there there's a blue wave here in West Chester but doesn't seem to be extending up north in West Chester to this race\nUm Harkin was a supposedly selected by Governor Cuomo to run in this race against Murphy he defeated\nA a a popular progressive indivisible member Robert cashed in ... in a in a Democratic primary the catch them people are now finished off at a car coming for beating their guy ... they're not supporting him a park come as no money in the bank the governor has not come in with any help for\nThe court so far\nAnd now that Murphy can't get it in public that a\nLot of them may have been double dipping on taxpayer dollars with two different salaries one at the Tappan Zee bridge each ... each of brain tiny beer his old job Bob ...\nPerson for the bridge yeah okay\nYeah and then\nTo this race um Harkin was a supposedly selected by Governor Cuomo to run in this race against Murphy he defeated\nA a a popular progressive indivisible member Robert test in ... in a in a Democratic primary the casting people are now finished off at a car coming for beating their guy ... they're not supporting him a park come as no money in the bank the governor has not come in with any help for\nThe port so far\nAnd now that Murphy ... going to get ... and public that a\nLot of them may have been double dipping on taxpayer dollars with two different salaries one at the Tappan Zee bridge each took he took Brian ... job Bob oh I'm\nSorry for the bridge yeah okay\nYeah and then he also had a job in the state a community urban renewal agency um it's not very clear what he did and neither of those jobs Bob and it's also not clear\nYou

it's north Salem and south fail I'm In a a a assert supposedly he got his job from a certain close friend of the governors who was a going away to prison very soon\n... living in state housing yes\nYeah so um it's a mess the ...\nThat that race is a mess for Democrats allow me a who want it who want to take the state Senate I I don't see that one happening less ... beats Marlon arrow by forty now without a [noise]\nWho knows it will be closed because of the coma with the top of the ticket but I as we have talked to you and I for years now the only guy better than Karen Murphy at

citizenship but they change in most countries around the world one of your parents must be a citizen of that country\nI was not an hour of that go ahead\nSo this raises a question but of course anybody who suggests that America should have a policy that says you are an American citizen by birth\nIf one of your parents is this ... now that's a logical rational but of course that will ... will not fly with Schumer or Joe the brand\nOr the left or the Democratic party because the politics of illegal immigration seem they seem to feel helps them politically in the long run out of course by even suggesting that uh you'll be called a racist\nWell we're not letting that happened here go ahead continue\nBut but you say I Would like to hear the good will argue that I Know it goes back to the civil war\nAnd the fourteenth amendment and so on but that was really meant that was really meant if you look at the history to allow blacks who were already here when the country and brought here and born here or even to become citizens it was not meant as a carte blanche ticket\nFor the entire world about like you're saying\nYou're right on the race great point I Would think that there's a sweet spot in there for example let's say you have a couple that is applied for citizenship here working they're paying taxes they have a proper green card or a proper\nA proper paperwork they said they were living in the country legally but don't yet have citizenship I wouldn't have a problem granting citizenship to that child the child frankly\nI mean that's a discussion about and that can be out of five yes\nThe idea of citizenship by birth\nOnly if a parent encourages people to step lively\nOn becoming citizens to not\nBe here for Twenty years on on a visa or green card and do nothing ivy you wish to join the American culture in American society and become a citizen or you don't end up and up and if people are told up front look\nIf you're not an American citizen your child is not one by birth maybe there can be some angles\nOf well if your parents what year was ...\nPaperwork they said they were living in the country legally but don't yet have citizenship I wouldn't have a problem granting citizenship to that child their child rightly\nSo like I mean that's a discussion about it and it's yeah it can be modified yes\nThe idea of citizenship by birth\nOnly if a parent encourages people to stop lively\nOn becoming citizens to not be here for Twenty years on on a visa or green card and do nothing ivy you wish to join the American culture in American society and become a citizen or you don't end up and up and the people are told up front look\nIf you were not an American citizen your child is not one by birth maybe there can be some all\nGoes well if your parents we're as permanent residents it's easier to apply when you get older but\nThere must be some inherent value to solve written citizenship\nRight now there is not\nWell you know what another good call you really

um even though I'm In bed with my back I was able to do much just out back without the weather's fine tooth comb it and you're not going to have much to my friend\nUm I get a little search on a a President Trump being the worst president uh and the reason the reason there was no poll quoted because it was based on a a opinion piece by the New York times sure\nOh well that's why I needed to be able to get me wrong there there there is no doubt if a poll was taken the day that President Trump would be voted the worst president because he lost the popular vote that just makes sense okay make that that's OK well might as well people call people come on and make comments like that okay they should back them up and quote the source\nYou know what's interesting Anthony ... let me get your reaction to that he may be the worst be the evening president but he's made some breakthroughs in Korea I think that keep them from being at the bottom of that list I don't\nHave problem his problem is he has a verbal diarrhea I've said that they ...

what's going on [laughter] and whenever I talk about as we speak during the show several people will die of drug overdoses\nYou know the documents those drugs actually can my opinion that should be a capital crime if anyone dies but uh there's a doctor in prison I mentioned last week for a hundred and fifty years one of his patients died he does exactly the same thing it will go on and on and on until we regulate drug so tightly around\nYou and I go to the word I was about to ask you about we have a great debate in this country about regulations there's been a week where a card carrying twenty people killed them all because regulations weren't followed Fort Lauderdale and people are dying now from drug overdoses because of lack of regulation we're at the sweet spot\nBob there is there is which is no sweet spot when it comes to regulating health realistic issues that should be dealt with by the government are obviously where did we dropped the ball I mean this drug issues going on for decades\nBut what we talk about Congress so you know I I I'm a big believer in the government has a role I'm also a real real is to understand the government is extremely inefficient\nAnd often and often negligent of doing they were doing their responsibility\nYou know what happened recently with Donald Trump's tax returns in the end and the the kinds of allusion there used to avoid

I don't think anybody claim it's a hoax I think at this point claiming\nIt's not manmade that could be argued all one way or another but there's no there's no getting around the fact that the last

that we may be seeing today that we can see a a thirty forty years ago even ten years ago maybe caught maybe happening due to the change in the in the ...\nIt's a good question you know the two things that come to mind are the you know as the temperature changes it also a will allow the growth of certain organisms of bacterial organism so you know one of the fears we have in medicine is that there's going to be\nDrug resistant bacteria which will will kill our population so one issue is we don't know the unintended consequences of racing temperature rise in temperature on the growth growth of bacterial species\nThe other issues with terms of all there were a lot of people that are suffering from respiratory diseases as the temperature gets warmer that's only going to increase so all the people who are currently have COPD and have more difficulty breathing so there's no question that when you take her with an environment the earth's atmosphere\nThe temperature there there's

rebuild North Carolina flower that\nAllows the lowly of your you know it's interesting we have not had the severity of hurricanes in such a short period of time as we've had now\nYou know I I've been always interested in the weather and I you know we've had a number of very severe storms Hurricane Andrew hurricane Camille but they're far and few between\nDeaf category five four and five storms strikes as part of the the the country has been unusual I mean I was saying you're right Mitch this is a virus called met thank you we go to our next caller I Do believe it's Chris Chris you're on with Dr ... thank you for calling good morning it's\nMorning doc okay I I think your health plan sounds a little bit like the public education a commitment\nWell private and public but he wants to be done well\nYeah I wanted to change do I look I said Christ or two things we named our country is a very rigorous valued education it's not optional and we don't have it the second is a health care system that take care of all of us in a reasonable way\nAnd that must be a private I Do not believe eliminate private schools I don't blame eliminate private health care insurance but this is just an alternative to Obamacare\nAnd it's clear to me that the system we have now does not work effectively what I told you last week my premiums are now almost thirty one thousand dollars a year\nThat should tell you that for most young people starting out that I've known businesses have to pay themselves it's not affordable we have to come up with another system and I think this combination\nWe have to get past this idea that the government taking over healthcare they've already taken over health care we have Medicare Medicaid ... many Americans are getting regional health care under Medicare Bob does and I do I am not dying because I'm a ... a government pay for health care but I pay for it yeah because I work\nI have a higher income therefore I have to pay more I'm OK about that and the poor the poor guy working as a ... there's a woman the thing is secretary that makes thirty five thousand she should pay but much less so let's ... you know whether that socialism you call it what it wants but I pay more income tax that's not socialism is somebody who makes less money it's a fair system\nThan Korea just a quick comment on what you said earlier in the show um you know we\nHave a young the right to call it the fundamental could opponent of are\nA society is that the harder you work and the more qualified you walk your chances for success are much greater correct not a guarantee okay but it's something that uh you know oh it is a component of our capitalistic and democratic a component\nAnd I'm all for it because you know what one thing America has that we should never lose is that regardless of your background religion source of origin color that if you do have talent if you work hard you should be rewarded I Do not believe\nAnd as somebody who makes less money it's a fair system ... it's just\nA quick comment on what you said earlier in the show um you know we\nHave a young we are at the Cold War the fundamental component of our\nSociety is that the harder you work and the more qualified you walk your chances for success are much greater correct not a guarantee okay but it's something that uh you know a a it is a component of our capitalistic and democratic a component\nAnd I'm all for it because you know what one thing America has that we should never lose is that regardless of your background religion source of origin color that if you do have talent if you work hard\nYou should be rewarded I Do not believe in a in a level playing I Believe in a level playing field will never have it but I Believe that people will come to this country or people who were born in this country\n... this guy should be the limit based upon their belief that effort absolutely Chris thank you very much for the call we go next to Anthony Anthony good morning thank you for calling Dr sundberg good morning Anthony\nGood morning number one of the uh the global warming a man of the ... and no doubt about it but it is a natural phenomena we came from an ice age [laughter]\nUm but we were definitely just try and get done then spreading it um but I Do like your health plan simply because it's based on a mandatory annual physical which many people don't get which would\nCut catch a lot of diseases very early on and actually be able to cure them as opposed to treat them and just to extend your life span as opposed to having a normal life span [noise]\nUm but you know when you get on opioids that gets me because we never present the other side of the table way there are regulations that exist and explain to you before when I have to go to to get my opioids every month so the people you're talking about on breaking those regulations that breaking the law\nAnd they will always be people yes that will break the law for money much like guns it's the same scenario I don't care how you cut it they they have one guy they use variations on the spelling of his name they use different birth dates they were always ways around the system\nAnthony you're absolutely right you should not have to go through hoops and that should change but on the other side of the coin is there are people who ... who who produced these drugs who distribute them\nThat must be carefully watched because the because of the people that um the various\nThere's gonna be abuse but at least let us make them responsibility every drug they ship they follow up how many and where it goes it cannot be you know the like the doctor down in Florida\nThat that's distributed twenty thousand opioids a month that nobody knows about that because most of those when I was given to you and say no given the people that were drug addicts split but\nIt ... if those regulations at the end that he has to write down and even if the names of different they have to know he's dispensing twenty thousand\nIt was ignored the government look how\nDifferent is already see that's my point that's my point if it's ignored because he's breaking the law he stretching you know he's changing the numbers around that's my point do you notice they actually they actually took called my doctor\nAnd said that they wanted his patients to submit to rent the random urine tests to prove that they're taking drugs should I have that kind of an invasion of privacy in my life when I've been on these pills for over a decade and have no problems with them\nLet me ask you a flip side do you think they should have random drug tests for high school athletes absolutely okay so most of them have not done anything wrong but they still have that that's an ...\nHe's spent and twenty thousand it was the ... the government look how different is or is he that's my point that's my point if it's ignored because he's breaking the law stretching you know he's changing the numbers around that's my point do you know that they actually they actually took called my doctor\nAnd said that they wanted his patients to submit to Iran that random urine test to prove that they're taking drugs should I have that kind of an invasion of privacy in my life when I've been on these pills for over a decade and have no problems with them\nLet me ask you a flip side do you think they should have random drug tests for high school athletes\nUh because the cost of it is absolutely sky high and the voters care and the taxpayers care and that's one of the reason we have a wagon train going to the border accident in the state but there's a crisis of confidence in a crisis of credibility of the state's government\nYou know people understand that decisions are getting made for reasons that aren't the right reasons which is the taxpayers' best interest and when people see that that's going on\nWhether it's individuals who are productive citizens or small businesses or big businesses they don't want to put more chips on the table by investing more time here they don't want to put chips on the table by investing more money here they see that this thing is rigged up and they asked for the exits and so the cost of this corruption is killing us\nBecause we who stay here and remain in New York has to replace those lost jobs have to replace those last taxes so you know\nAndrew Cuomo's corrupt government and Andrew Cuomo's oversight of a machine that's not doing what the people want it to do and what it should be doing is absolutely killing us and there's got to be someone in the attorney general's office who keeps on that and put a stop to\nThe last to be the biggest reason we have an independent constitutionally elected attorney general if the state constitution and wanted to say that Andrew Cuomo got to pick the next attorney general it would say that but the state constitution doesn't say that it's just that the voters get to choose the next attorney general and the reason for that in part is that the attorney general has to be independent\nSo let's talk about corruption Nikki food if we can for a moment and stay with that what would you do you get in the office you're now the attorney general or what would you do specifically I we knows that Andrew Cuomo and frankly and then he was an adjective here you might not like disgraced truly disbanded\nHis more on that commission which she set up with an attorney general of the state so would you do\nWell look the commission example tells you exactly why you have to look if it goes is that commission was established to supposedly be independent and come back corruption they put a lot to find people on the commission and then what history tells us is that Andrew Cuomo\nThe next attorney general would say that but the state constitution doesn't say that it's just that the voters get to choose the next attorney general and the reason for that in part is that the attorney general has to be independent\nSo let's talk about corruption Nikki food if we can for a moment and stayed with that what would you do you get in the office you're now the attorney general uh what would you do specifically I we knows that Andrew Cuomo and frankly and then he was an adjective here you might not like his gracefully disbanded\nHis more on that commission which is set up with an attorney general of the state so would you do\nWell look the more on commission example tells you exactly why you have to look because that commission was established to supposedly be independent and combat corruption they put a lot to find people on the commission and then what history tells us\nIs that Andrew Cuomo's through his lawyers and end advisors and emphasizing ... interfered with its conduct interfered with the two best occasion all the way through and when he couldn't interfere with enough Andrew Cuomo disbanded it\nThat's why you need an attorney general independent the governor to look into this but what is that the question of what you do\nFirst thing he has to do is you have to start looking\nYou know you have to use every power of the office to go after it you have to use the inherent ... power of the office\nYou have to use the provisions of the executive law you have to use a provision to the general business law you have to use the provisions of the public officers law and the municipal law you have all these available so for example you know the executive law\nSays that you can go after instances of an unfair and deceptive practices\nOkay so I Would start looking at the contributions right you have all these contributors tens of millions I think it's forty fifty million dollars a day Andrew Cuomo has raised right you have millions of dollars that these other public officials suppressed so\nYou can believe they're putting all that money and just because they believe in Andrew Cuomo's philosophy a good government or the other officials philosophy of good government or you can believe is I Do that some of them fronting the money and to get something out from the taxpayers on the other at so the point of the initial investigation is the answer\nWhich is it and in which case is is it that people are putting things in to get things out I mean we we should have found the buffalo billion thing before it happened right you know the convicted developer on one side and buffalo some analysis that got three quarters of a billion dollar contract to get\nIt would be a contributor to answer Cormac you know you you have this instance what these I heard about these ... to ... the ...\nTwins I you know we hear about contributions from them and then there is talk of them getting a license one of the few bitcoin licenses you know you have the core development issue with the bribery with for cocoa\nRight they're replacing the biggest power plant in the state Indian point with gas power plants and lo and behold a gas plant developer comes in bribes the governor secretary so\nYou know you have the stuff over and over it's not the contributions to solve the problem you know it's free country people can treat contributing to participate in democracy but some people put things into the government\nAnd expect to get things out from the government at the expense of taxpayers you gotta look so that would be a first major area we would look at the other area you got to look at the revolving door\nRight you know you have the NCAA people sweat in on the platform because it takes them a you know billions of dollars and and the hundreds of years seemingly to build anything right people slept on the platform because they can't get projects done\nOne of the continual issues with the MTA\nIs this revolving door people going in and out of the industry agency between the agency and the big contract was on the other side of the ... so we've got to look at that and say okay well why are these people going into these ... these companies what are they getting from those people is there some unfair and improper advantage that they're getting against the taxpayers by hiring\nIt's free country people can contribute and participate in democracy is when people put things into the government and expect to get things out from the government at the expense of taxpayers you gotta look so that would be a first major area we would look at the other hand you've got to look at the revolving door\nRight you know you have the MTA people sweat in on the platform but does it take some of you know billions of dollars and and the hundreds of years to ... to build anything right people are sweating on the platform because they can't get projects done\nOne of the continual issues what the MTA\nIs this revolving door people going in and out of the industry agency between the agency and the big contract was on the other side of the government\nSo we got to look at that and say okay well why are these people going into these ... these companies what are they getting from those people is there some unfair and improper advantage that they're getting against the taxpayers by hiring the people who used to be on the taxpayers payroll\nSo you know these are the things you have to work at the first thing you have to look at it as the contracts even before you get two indictments\nBefore you get to putting people in orange jumpsuits you have to look at the contracts for signing\nAnd water the provisions of those and can those be improved we have a lot of contracts that are in no bid contracts are single bitter contracts you know when the government is in that position where there's only one person on the other side of the table we've got to be extra careful about what we do in those circumstances to make sure\nThe contract doesn't go from a thousand dollars to a hundred thousand dollars to a million dollars to a billion dollars because we have a long history of cost overruns and you know so so there are a number of things you can do on the contracts side but it'd be nice to have someone who is actually spent\nYou know blast twenty plus years looking at multibillion dollar contracts right you know this is not something given the level of ... that you want there to be on the job training having someone with private sector contract experiencing knows the games people play\nWho knows the tricks people pull who knows every trick in the book is something that the taxpayers would really benefit from\nSo we we have a number of things we can do simply a we have a number of things we can do you know before we sign contracts and frankly we have another things to do in order to identify red flags in trouble spots in terms of getting our arms around corruption but the biggest thing you need someone with the independence and willingness to actually do all of that and the expertise to do it well\nWe'll be referred it to ... going to be a democratic year I Believe a blue wave in a New York state and you have Donald Trump who is mentally unpopular you know obviously there will be will try to tell you to Trump what do you do that that\nWill look for the first thing we do is we got to remind people that this is election is about the attorney general of New York state a state that it has had a special after official after official go to jail for public corruption out of the taxpayers pockets so you know when we talk about what's at stake\nWhich is the future of our state and whether we grow or whether we shrink whether our kids get adequate education or whether we dumped whether people can get to work or whether they cannot you know when you talk about the everyday steaks and the cost of this to people\nYou know that out ways for most dogs and certainly most people I've talked to these issues coming out of Washington or the other thing though is that with respect to the president or anything else you know I'm an independent person and you know I\nConnect I contributed to block Obama\nWhen he first ran I've been for the other Democrats the past politically\nAh so you know I look at the person that I looked at the situation and I've always been you know an outsider and extremely independent and you know the voters know not only that there are important state issues and critical state issues we have to deal with but they also going to look at the person and not just say\nEducation or whether we dumped whether people can get to work or whether they could not you know when you talk about the everyday steaks and the cost of this to people\nYou know that out ways for most dogs and certainly most people I've talked to these issues coming out of Washington or the other thing though is that with respect to the president or anything else you know I'm an independent person and you know I\nConnect I contributed to block Obama\nWhen he first ran I've been for the other Democrats the past politically\nAh so you know I look at the person and I looked at the situation and I've always been you know an outsider and extremely independent and you know the voters know not only that there are important state issues in critical state issues we have to deal with but they also are going to look at the person\nAnd not just say you know oh this is just to some political consultant says the word mini me\nYou know they're not going to be fooled by that they've\nSeen the parade a horrible rehab listened pretty general's office to the last three you know probably should've been convicted of crimes right so the voters that enough of that\nAnd that kind of transcending partisanship ages had enough and they know the important from the states for the state uh and so that's what I'm hearing all over the state I mean you know it's not Democrat or Republican to not want your government to steal from it if not Democrat or Republican to one public services\nTo be delivered honestly and effectively and so not withstanding you know some of the other things that are potentially going on out there what we're hearing around the state is that we're going to be in a position to win because we're the only viable alternative provides what the voters shaped\nOkay so you got microprocessor than running as the Green Party candidate you could convert Garvey running as a libertarian but you're running as a Republican so I got an ... and Vance you're going to vote for Trump in twenty joining\nYou know I don't know what I'm going to do in twenty twenty we'll see we'll see what the record books like you know we've had this phenomena out\nAnd many many presidential terms whether it was Obama whether even was Reagan where presidents in their first term do things and they're stored narrowly unpopular times during his first tour of him and then on the voters get to look back and\nSee the full entirety of the records you know they they take a step back and and they decide what they really want to do and in many cases\nYou know that's a reelection and educational and it's not you know and Bush one's case it was not so I'm going to look back just like all the other voters in America and make a decision when we see the complete sort of record\nNow what about the current attorney general's investigation into President Trump and the Trump family would you continue\nCalled five nine two for one to nine five\nCalled five nine two for

you know fighting fighting back on you know one of the questions I have is used food on the Iranian government but I remember\nI Believe that US law does not allow did not allow private citizens to ... to foreign governments\nWas expressly forbidden so how do you overcome that challenge [noise]\nUh in Nineteen Ninety six or President Clinton signed a law called the anti terrorism and effective death penalty act and what it did\nIs it did give American citizens the right to sue state sponsors of terrorism who had a participated in terror attacks\nAgainst um American citizens and uh we fell under that act um rule um and um [noise] began to to look at the statute was them that we discovered that um it really didn't have any teeth and it\nUh the background to the the statute was the Oklahoma City uh attack of April Nineteen Ninety five\nAnd other terror attacks around the world that involved American citizens\nSo the president asked for a new terrorism bill which for instance um provided the death penalty of domestic terrorism or as I said it also gave the ability of American citizens to pursue state sponsors of terrorism around the world\nBut there were no teeth [noise] the the bill did not tell us where we could bring a lawsuit how we measure damages a what courts we should be using uh how do we get service I'm against um the state sponsor but most importantly the state department to designate who the sponsors war\nAnd a two hour um [noise] I guess not surprised but I'm the Iranian government was the number one state sponsor of terrorism and we knew at that point in time that they had financially bankrolled Islamic jihad which claimed credit for the uh the attack that emerge Lisa\nSo they became our prime defended they being the Iranian republic or Islamic republic and we started a lawsuit based upon a statute that I had to lobby over a six month period to get changed\nAnd I thought on where I read on I think in your book that the courts through through without\nNow what they were throwing out where our subsequent attempts Paul to enforce our judgment um as any good plaintiffs attorney will try to do once you recovery judgment which we did in March of Nineteen Ninety eight to the tune of almost\nTwo hundred and fifty million dollars a we proceeded to identify a rainy an asset to the United states I'm the first asked that we came across was the former residents of you\nKnew at that point in time that they had financially bankrolled Islamic jihad which claimed credit for the the attack that number to Lisa\nSo they became our prime defended they being the Iranian republic or Islamic republic and so we started a lawsuit based upon a statute that I had to lobby over a six month period to get changed\nAnd I I thought on where I read on I think in the course through through without\nNow what they were throwing out where our subsequent attempts Paul to enforce our judgment um as any good plaintiffs attorney will try to do once you recover a judgment which we did in March of Nineteen Ninety eight to the tune of almost\nTwo hundred and fifty million dollars a we proceeded to identify a rainy and assets in the United states I'm the first asked that we came across was the former residents of uranium Vassar and Washington DC and we obtained a writ of attachment so that we can literally sees the property [noise]\nUm when the Justice Department got wind of that uh they began to oppose us in our efforts to collect on our judgment\nWhile as you know what yeah what was your impression of a you know Bill Clinton it seems like you had positive experiences and also negative experiences\nWhile the positive experience was that um you know he told me and other a terror victims of families that he wanted to bring these killers to justice\nThat disappointing side is that he was apparently out of step with the justice and the state department's who didn't want us um I guess in their mind interfering with the affairs of a of of another country and and that's one of the real fun began\nSo um so how did you overcome\nWith legislation with perseverance I'm more legislation more perseverance I'm at the end of the day the president or set up a um a committee quoted go she any committee you see we weren't the only family that was affected by Iranian terrorism there were many others\nUm they also at the same time there was a Cuban ... a group called the brothers to the rescue who had six of their members shot down over international waters by the Cuban air force\nSo it wasn't just choose and it was ... it was it was the Cubans it was people who are ... hostages of his bottom Lebanon so at the end of the day there were about fifty people who were affected by this legislation with everybody coming at the White House from different directions um something had to give\nAnd so as I said they set up this committee are headed by Jacob Lew who who subsequently became secretary the treasury and he worked out a compromise with the victims of the United states\nHow much money were you able to collect at the end of the day\nWell the judge what was the two hundred and fifty million dollars we collected about twenty four others collected a more based upon their judgments um and and the interesting thing was um in our in our battles with uh the state department and treasury\nThey kept denying that there was any Iranian money in this country well we uncovered and account called the foreign military sales act account that had about four hundred million dollars\nSo we arrange for legislation that earmark that money to ah reimbursed terror victims um fast forward to um twenty sixteen twenty Seventeen and we found out that that money was returned by the Obama administration to Iran\nRight so I'm now ... and I was thinking on you know what your opinion of the present President Obama's on a rainy in agreement\nElected a more based upon their judgments um and and the interesting thing was um in our in our battles with the state department of treasury\nThey kept denying that there was any Iranian money in this country where we uncovered and account called the foreign military cells that kept it had about four hundred million dollars\nSo we arrange for rent legislation that earmark that money to ah reimbursed terror victims um fast forward to um twenty sixteen twenty Seventeen and we found out that that money was returned by the Obama administration to Iran\nRight so I'm a ... now ... and I was thinking you know what's your opinion of the present President Obama's on a rainy and agreements\nWell it really wasn't what was an offshoot of what President Clinton had been trying to do for for seven or eight years\nUh that was one of the reasons why we we donated releases Oregon's um I had a red earlier in the year that Israel had been kicked out of an organ sharing consortium in Europe\nBecause it wasn't um uh creating its own bank of organs uh and uh when a lease it died\nI was approached a very nicely by the head of a hospital and asked if I Would donate\nA her organs he explained to me that um religious Jews do not donate under a misunderstanding of what the Jewish law is\nAnd he he said touching himself pointed to his own chess pieces and we non religious issues we just don't do it they asked me if I Would help [noise] um and how would I how can I say no in that situation you know at least it was on her six trip to Israel when she was murdered\nAnd every time she came back she didn't come back just a a better juice came back a a better person she was taking something out of the country every time she was there\nAnd at the end of the day I thought it would be appropriate to um give back some of the lease because of what what what she had taken out of out of Israel and what it did is they created an uproar because here was an American who's could have just been murdered\nAnd he was doing something that Israelis they didn't do for themselves so a prime minister ripping recognize that fact and he came to visit us our house in New Jersey a month after she was murdered\nOn you know how the how did your wife or deal with on greed and how have you been dealing with it over the past ... you've you've obviously been dealing with it by with the organ transplants than on but how do you deal with this type of grief on a personal basis\nEveryone has to find their own way hum\nShe was taking something out of the country every time she was there\nAnd at the end of the day I thought it would be appropriate to give back some of the least so because of what what what she had taken out of out of Israel and what it did is they created an uproar because here was an American who's kid have just been murdered\nAnd he was doing something that Israelis they've been through for themselves so a prime minister ripping recognize that fact and he came to visit us our house in New Jersey a month after she was murdered\nOn you know how the how did your wife or deal with on greed and how have you been dealing with it over the past ... you've you've obviously been dealing with it by with the organ transplants than on but how do you deal with this type of grief on a personal basis\nWell everyone has to find their own way um my wife um uh basically closed down emotionally when it came to I'm Alisa but even to this day a while she has come out of she she's moved along from that\nUm to this day she won't do an interview she won't speak to a reporter uh she won't express any political opinions I I'm within a few months after release was murdered I began a a speaking tour on behalf of a couple of organizations and I traveled around the country\nFor a period of four years and I still speak but\nIt was very intense though that first four years but what it did is it gave me an outlet to talk about uh Lisa talk about terrorism or what you do you as a means to us and I'm ... and that became my my therapy\nUm and and what was telling about that as one night I had um I finished up his speech in in Boston\nAnd a man comes up to me and and to say he looked like a stereotypical college professor would be an understatement he had a quarter right jacket he had a leather patches on his elbows and he was wearing horn rimmed glasses and he he looked at me and he and he said\nDo you find that speaking helps I remarked him I said are you a psychiatrist\nAnd the answer to me and he simply said keep it up so I realized at that point I was actually on the right ah it was on the right path um I was exhausted from each speech\nOf my back literally ... was soaked every time I finished talking but once I got up I I I'm I I just kept moving and whether it was adrenalin or whatever it was at that point in time I'd spoken I smoke and I spoke and I still speaking speaking speak\nAnd that's part of my therapy or the book I guess it's part of my therapy because I've started now I'm speaking tour as well and people have to hear about this story because they they can't give up I'm and I'm at the end of the day that everyone has to find their own way to cope with the tragedy like this\nRight you think that ... one of your goals is to get you ran out of the terrorism a business you see all that these legal actions are hurting on Iran enough that maybe they'll think twice about supporting terrorists in the future\nNot yet no I'm the only people who have really been\nHurt to this point in time have been several banks\nAh because of two years ago the federal government\nUm identified bank ... a ... a large French back bank as a um money laundering ... for Iran I'm at but the but the the funny thing is the genesis of that prosecution which took several years was the work I had done in my late Nineteen nineties linking Iranian banks\nUm that were open here in the states to Iran to Tehran Iran's capital\nOut of the terrorism uh business do you feel that uh these legal actions are hurting Iran enough that maybe they'll think twice about reporting terrorists in the future\nNot yet no I'm the only people who have really been hurt to this point in time have been several banks\nUh because uh two years ago the federal

spend some time talking about voting you know there are these questions of religion and politics and separation of church and state and so we're going to spend some time to be talking about all that and you know it's always if you like you can call in to the show the number nine months or six three six\nZero one one zero nine when for three six zero one one zero there's always that do have a couple of close to to get started and then the prayer to give the nerd in subtle we'll we'll start with the prayer um to get a hundred unsettled and\nIt's from a book dot com and that award some time

things to you and focus on your goodness\nThank you for today for every good gift you've given for every black man you've sent\nAll the forgiveness I did not deserve and yet for every trial you've allowed in my life you bring could out of every circumstance if only all like going to leave you I Know that when I pray and give things instead of worrying you've promised that I can experience the kind of peace\nThat passes all understanding that you're kind of peace for it and it's the kind I crave\nAnd Jesus name we pray\nAmen because that's our prayer today and I've got a couple of quotes here about about voting and uh I've got actually three tours for it and then there's the longer one the first Isaac Asimov he says anti intellectualism has been a constant threat and winding its way through our political and cultural life\nMeasured by the false notion that democracy means that my ignorance is just as good as more knowledge that's Isaac Asimov the second one is from Winston Churchill who said that was the best argument against democracy is a five minute conversation with the average voter that's what's been Churchill\nAnd then David Foster Wallace has this that they said if you will boredom disgusted by politics and don't bother to vote you are in effect voting for the entrenched establishment of the two major parties\nIn our community so I'm interested to know if you vote do you vote being out and vote a I don't I don't need to know if you voted for in in the vote foreign and who you support politically I don't I don't need to know the thing but I Am interested to know do you vote and like I said you're always welcome to get a call here\nIn Studio the number is nine when for six three sticks\nThey're all in one zero that's not on for six or six zero in on zero and you know we've been working our way through Snoop Dogg\nWe've been working our way through Snoop Dogg album and coming up I've got um\nIn our community so I'm interested to know if you both do you vote vote a I don't I don't need to be voted for in in Geneva foreign and who you support politically I don't I don't need to know the thing but I Am interested to know do you vote and like I said you're always welcome to get a call here\nIn Studio the numbers nine months or six three six\nZero in one zero that's not on four sixty six zero in on your own you know we've been working our way through Snoop Dogg\nWe'd been working our way through ... and coming up I thought I'm with the praise\nFrom the Snoop Dogg album in ... Doug gospel album called Bible as well\nYou know money [noise] they wouldn't have\nTo\nFor you [noise]\nFor re [noise]\nWeren't there but you may end up\nWriting [noise] you're not just like\nJust don't get me wrong [noise]\nBut you know yeah\n[noise]\n\n[noise]\n\n[noise]\n[noise]\nOoh [noise]\nAnd that was dug up with his his praise and you know I'm like the album that snoop dog has produced and you know it does it does take from those of us who call\nOurselves fond of Christ to task you know ... it's called without because you know your your your your your point the finger\nOn a particular song that you know you point the finger but are you willing to look at yourself and you know voting or when we when we don't vote I think it should be it should cost to question\nWho we say we are at colors of price because you know it's one of the times that we actually do get to voice our opinion polls we do get to say you know we get to choose the people who we think support 'em a cause that you support you know but I'm always I'm always a little bit conflicted you know because\nIt's always around election season when you see you know a lot of the the right to life first pop out of the woodwork and those sorts of things and\nI'm In and I think you know I I think I I personally believe in a woman's right to choose you know I'm Glad that I've never had to make that type of choice but a lot of times my ... spoke a\nYou know they are um they're anti abortion but there for the death penalty and you know it's like well either either you're all or nothing right I feel like you know you can't seriously be anti abortion but then you're pro death penalty because if you're saying that this thing over here\nIs taking the lights and then what about this thing over here and so I think that when we have on a conversation and engage the Kennedy Center in ways that are healthy we do have to help the dialogue around me and I think we should be challenging each other to think differently about how we live in the world\nAnd to think about are we living in the world is such a way that we're promoting loved or are we living\nBelieve in a woman's right to choose you know I'm Glad that I've never had to make that type of choice but a lot of times when I talk to these folks are\nYou know they are um they're anti abortion but there for the death penalty and you know and it's like well either either you're all or nothing right I feel like you know you can't seriously be anti abortion but then you're pro death penalty because if you're saying that this thing over here\nIs taking the life and then what about this thing over here and so I think that when we have on the conversation and engage the candidate in ways that are healthy we do have healthy dialogue around the ... and I think we should be challenging each other to think differently about how we live in the world\nAre and to think about are we living in the world on such a way that we are promoting love or are we living in the world on such a way that we're promoting everything about love because sometimes when you I Know sometimes when I've even taken a look at\nHow I Am engaging in the world with other people I'm like oh that that possibly could have been more loving 'em I could have shown an extra dose of care to to that person and so we should be constantly doing a critical examination of ourselves of\nOwn like morals and gold and you know like our own moral compass\nSo that we're going to the polls and as we're voting where we're not just voting were not voting for him to promises but also we're voting for people\nWho really do have the interests of the best interests of others in mind and you know as I said to her and I talk a little bit more about what what scripture says about these things 'cause I Know that's always the question as well whether it's the Bible say\nUm you know as they are in um as a a one Seventeen real challenge to I'm sensitive to learn to do right the justice to send your pressed take up the cause of the fatherless plead the case of the widow\nProverbs thirty one versus eight to nine states except for those who cannot speak for themselves for the rights of all who were destitute speak up and judged fairly defend the rights of the porn needy and Jeremiah twenty to one that says what the lord says go down\nTo the power of the king of Sudan proclaimed this message there do you what is Justin right rescued from the hands of the press or the one who has been robbed\nDo no wrong or violence to the foreigner fatherless or the widow and did not sent innocent blood in place for your careful to carry out these command than the king whose son David thrown will come through the gate of this ... writing in chariots and on horses\nAccompanied by their officials in their people but if you do not obey the man's declares the lord I Swear by myself but this\nPalace will become a ruined and so the challenge that we have is to defend the poor and the press and just thinking about who are the people that are reporting oppressed in our society who are the people in our communities that are pouring oppressed who are the people\nAnd the places where we live in where we work and where we serve\nWho are those who are the I'm In the country that fit that demographic both so what are those places in the world where there are porno pressed\nAnd what are those places in the world where we are contributing to the poverty\nAnd where we are the oppressor because there are lots of countries in the world where\nTheir poverty it's been directly caused by this country by the United states of America where their poverty has been caused by us and the people continue to be oppressed there because of policies that we've created created because of leaders that we've helped to come into power in those countries\nAnd so that's a very real part of our modern day history that we don't talk about you know how are we contributing to um the the poverty and the the oppression and other countries and so it's important that as we go to the polls\nWho are those who are the I'm In the country that at that demographic both so what are those places in the world where there are porno press\nAnd what are those places in the world where we are contributing to the poverty\nAnd where we are the press or because there are lots of countries in the world where\nTheir poverty is been directly caused by this country by the United states of America where their poverty has gone up by us and the people continue to be oppressed there because of policies that we've created created because of leaders that we've helped to come into power in the country\nAnd so that's a very real part of our modern day history that we don't talk about you know how we're week contributing to um get the poverty knew the oppression in other countries and so it's important that as we go to the polls on this November\nThat we're putting people in office who if we stay if I Am of our credit\nThan I should be voting for those people who are going to be working on behalf of the reporting the oppressed not just in my own community but the the poor and the people of the world I I feel like a broken record but you can't say that enough right that we do have a responsibility\nFor those who um the holy Bible cause called belief that the and really ask him that question of who the least of bees are and what that means and and now it's not it's not an easy question to answer\nUm I was pleased that they had an additional FBI investigation after Dr Ford's testimony I think it's important that senators be given access to all of that information\nUm and I respect that set up to advise and consent and while I'm not privy to that FBI investigation I respect\nUm how the senators cast their vote and I think we need to make reforms moving forward that require senators if you have information that is integral to a Supreme Court justice nomination you need to turn that over to the Senate Judiciary committee and it shouldn't be leak in the press\nUm I Do think this will have an impact on voter turnout because as I was going door to door actually

I think response from Pataki at one point but that's a kind of ancient history has been retired for several years as many people now the feds have broad very serious criminal charges against him he was convicted on the first trial reversed for cost of a decision by the Supreme Court tried again and I'm\nTroy I was over our me Albany in federal court in Albany I went to that trial and covered it for the show it I'm a horrified me how weak\nThe evidence was against Bruno and arguably I Would argue that there was no evidence of all at all of any criminal conduct and uh it didn't take the jury long it was a stunning moment that I'll always recorder I recall in the courtroom when the jury came and it looked like the judges draw dropped at the time and they said\nA verdict of not guilty and

Republican county chair really a lead the renaissance so it was a historic high point for the Republican Party late in the um or in the mid Nineteen nineties into are the two thousands\nReelection Daphne Jordan is the Republican candidate seeking to succeed her and she's running against Aaron glad the Democrat who's a former Cuomo operative I gather Andrew Cuomo operative who uh unexpectedly I Would think although maybe on the inside of wasn't unexpected received the endorsement yesterday to Democrats did\nI've kind of a turn coat Republican Roy McDonald who used to be the Wilson town supervisor and became a senator I think he succeeded you\nAnd he became very embittered because a caffeine marsh showing the current senator defeated him in the Republican primary after he back climbing supporting same sex marriage but that's the context in which you're now indoors indefinitely Jordan is that new Jordan has it not\nThat's exactly right Fred and thank you for that and that background and that's why you know among the phone and is critically important [noise] and um\nHe kept the marsh you own excelled as a senator very representative of the district and she supports a Daphne and then they were very closely with her and work with her for a number of years\nAnd Daphne is the mother of two boys so why she's entrepreneurial she had a couple of small businesses earlier in her life\nAnd uh oh well rounded and very learned in knows how to function in government and in society\nAnd in business so she would be a great addition to the Republicans and to the Republican majority but friends I really need\nAnd is critically important and um\nHe kept the marsh you own excelled as a senator very representative of the district and she supports a Daphne and dance and have worked very closely with her and work with her for a number of years\nAnd Daphne is the mother of two boys so why she's ... she had a couple of small businesses earlier in her life\nAnd uh all well rounded and very learned in knows how to function in government and in society\nAnd in business so she would be a great addition to the Republicans in to the Republican majority but friends I really\nNeed to dwell on check and balance the governor's an executive and there's three branches government the executive legislative judicial\nAnd the executive is Democrat and for what it's worth Pataki was Republican but we have Democrats great deal of the time and that's all fine\nBut the legislature is split and has been Republican and a son that's why he definitely is a critical edition and the forty ... district and I don't take anything away from her opponent because I Know him\nBut I Know he works in the governor's office now I Believe\nAnd um [noise] but that's not representative to me in a check and balance because he would be primarily voting than have to almost with the state Democrats [noise] so that's why I'm here now in ... find is critically important\nAh that definitely get the support of the majority of the people in the forties or district after the short because she will be truly representative and welcome education to majority of the New York state Senate\nSaturday you make of Roy McDonald supportive as Democrats our he's a guy who was I don't know if he's a lifelong Republican but he was a long time Republican official what are your truck it up to where do you have you had a chance to speak to him about it\nI Am not a spoken to really when I talked with in many many months ago\nHe was very cordial very friendly and very pleasant I always got along well with a quick Roy\nI helped him get elected his first time I get one of the largest contributions effort I think an individual up from my campaign account to Roy to help them get elected helped him get the nomination and so I'm absolutely amazed and surprised\nOr that he would be doing this but again in a democracy is a free country people have a right to express themselves\nAnd so I'm not going to know how to go with a bunch of ... or how does it because she's a ... pen in citizen and has a right to do with it\nBut I just think it's the wrong way to go and Daphne Jordan is the right choice poor checks and balances and the un representative of upstate New York in the capital region\nAnd again if I wasn't in the majority when I was in the Senate all of the good things that we're able to do with all the support that I got from great friends and people like Daphne\nWithout a happens in the capital region in upstate New York we offered to balance to the rest of the state and I'm proud that we were able to do what we did which part of so many people including you Fred\n[laughter] well I I Would I Would just describing what was going on as a journalist and to the extent that you saw that as supportive I saw it as being objective\nIt's a right to do with them but I just think it's the wrong way to go and Daphne Jordan is the right choice poor checks and balances and the un representative of upstate New York in the capital region and again\nIf I wasn't in the majority when I was in the Senate all of the good things that we're able to do with all the support that I got from great friends and people like to have me\nWould not have happened in the capital region in upstate New York we are for the balance to the rest of the state and I'm proud that we were able to do what we did which part of so many people including you for it\n[laughter] well I I wouldn't I Would just describing what was going on as a journalist and to the extent that you saw that as supportive I saw it as being objective and honest about\nThe reality is out there you know anything about Aaron glad the Democratic candidates I've never heard of them I've covered the area you're old district for many many years I've never heard of him doing anything related to the area have you are you familiar with them at all\nDo I really I don't know I don't believe I've ever met him and I'm frankly I didn't know who was running it until just a while ago but I Do know that he has amassed a lot of money\nYou know it's ... money a lot of the first time caller I'm always you know the governor is throwing themselves into this because you've got to keep the or left wing Democrats who've been so critical of him off his back so he's made a major play this year so the first time\n[noise] well and I think you'll hear from her opponent because he does have a lot of money and he will be spending these last couple of weeks and that's just kind of smart politics because that's when people are totally focused\nAnd book yeah they'll they'll vote but again it's a free country for each state and the people have a right to do whatever\nYou know what I Am talking objectively about what's best for upstate New York especially as a capital a region especially and that's that checks and balance a balance will come from a senator like Daphne Jordan and\nThe majority in the Republican Senate\nCenter I Know you're not directly involved you may not even be following it that closely but I'm sure you're following\nNational politics to some degree the tremendous polarization and the country over President Trump's it looks like\nHere in New York the Democrats to a considerable degree or trying to\nNationalize the local elections and make President Trump a local issue makeup Brett Kavanaugh wine is domination or to the Supreme Court a local issue\nWe even have a situation now where the candidate for governor of your party ... mile an arrow is ultimately saying he didn't vote for President Trump and he refused to say whether he thought Britain cabin or should be\nConfirmed for the Senate or not you think that's going to be a smart tactic in New York or do you think this is your party risk alienating many Republican voters or maybe some voters who may not be Republicans with like some of what Trump is doing\nBy saying away from the president in the way they are\n[noise] well uh I Know politically predators you know as a pro or that you have to be pretty objective and pick your spots in right now in New York state polls show Trump is very unpopular\nSo you don't want to be crappy and his coat tails when he sat unpopular but I can tell you this whether we like President Trump or not\nA lot of what he has done with the lowest unemployment rate him and the I think ever in the United states three point seven\nPercent or the economic growth which is breaking records\nDoes your party risk alienating many Republican voters or maybe some voters who may not be Republicans with like some of what Trump is doing by saying away from the president's away they are\nWell ah I Know politically predators you know as a pro or that you have to be pretty objective and pick your spots in right now in New York state polls show Trump is very unpopular\nSo you don't want to be grabbing his coat tails when he sat unpopular but I can tell you this whether we like President Trump or not\nA lot of what he has done whereas\nThe lowest unemployment rate him and the I think ever in the United states three point seven\nPercent or the economic growth which is breaking records stock market was somewhat selective all all the positive what he's been doing some of the foreign affairs like with North Korea\nAn Brickell and so you have to give him credit worthy of like him or not now he talks too much in my mind he creates a lot of negativity he should he talks when he should be listening and I know him extremely well\nAnd I'm always you know had a great report it'd be it with them talk with him after he was elected president\nAnd a big could genial very friendly and very personable but you know people have to make their own choices but objectively if you take a look\nAt what's going on in the country I think you have to come down on the side of being very positive\nWrap him around you in New York state politically doesn't help because his numbers are often you know ... ... people know that Democrats and Republicans snow that\nSenate just quickly or as you are well now you're a conference someone you are close to one time a politically lost one of its members a long time Senator Frank pattern van I passed away yesterday just any quick so much about the senator we have about a minute and a half left\nI'm just so sad and they hear about that Frank was a great friend a real patriots you probably know he was in the service like active duty for about Twenty years\nOld I was living here in the army I sometimes feel okay\nHe was in the service yeah and he was Thirty years in the reserves and I'm sure with great distinction became an officer and then when he came into the sand and I think two thirty\nSeven years in one of the most democratic districts and all of New York state in Queens ten to one Democrat enrollment he was a lot to it for thirty seven years\nAnd you want to talk about a patriot in a in a true spirit of a democracy that wins Frank pet it and he was a great friend and when I was leaving he does everything he could keep you there I'm Talking personally and then the conference\nAnd the and the true spirit of a democracy that was Frank better than he was a great friend and when I was leaving and she did everything he could keep you there I'm Talking personally and and the conference\nFor governor has probably fewer real followers and I even have and I'm not trying to hold myself up as an example of anything other than a radio talk show host and former longtime journalist the state capital but my God a candidate for governor or to have a hundred thousand followers here to have\nHuge numbers get out there and be doing things he wouldn't while we know he wouldn't support the president\nOf his party didn't vote for him and he wouldn't support and said he thought Brett Kavanaugh's deserve to be\nConfirmed for a seat on the United States Supreme court I'm not advocating for Kavanaugh I'm just saying as a Republican and this was a defining issue for many Republicans including many in New York Republicans across the nation by doing what he's done or not doing what he's done not doing what he's not done\nHe's alienating his own party so if you want to talk about that I'd be curious to know\nThat I Know we have a lot of Republican listeners out there than others as well what they think about this mall an arrow campaign because it doesn't isn't going anywhere side it doesn't seem to it hasn't gone anywhere hasn't raised any money because I made some money for the people who are involved with the presumably they're getting paid\nThe other statewide Republican candidates are going nowhere I challenge most people even name them they don't even know their name there's a lot of people think from the start that this was the George Pataki\nAnd in fact Chris Gibson a former congressman from the capital district very it was seen as behind not certainly not even that much behind the scenes he was seen as part of a group\nThat wants to put mowing arrow in there and there are people out there who think they did it with an ice or four years from now maybe running Chris Gibson for governor or someone else they'll get behind\nMeanwhile a guy who would have taken the governor on and if you have a great many people Senator John de Francisco which pushed out and he has more money in the bank\nOr from his campaign war chest as a senator then mowing arrow apparently has raised from the beginning we had at least one caller on the line who want to give us the most talked about this issue love to hear from me for seven six Thirteen hundred five one aid for seven six Thirteen hundred let's go I think we have um\nIf he's still with us either on the line are as old regular colon through a lot of radio talk shows good morning Ira what's on your mind where do you think\nGood morning from first of all the Republicans are actually a cardboard cutout this time around that's about what they amount to\nThe cat okay well I got I heard or a McDonald's thing then show which always makes my ears perk up in two thousand and two I was up at the sunset in North Troy a political event like\nSenator John de Francisco we pushed out and he had more money in the bank\nOr from his campaign war chest is a senator then mile an

McDonald's name mentioned which always makes my ears perked up in two thousand and two I was up at the sunset in and nor Troy a political event like before election\nAnd Roy myself for someone else for on stage and Roy always kind of guy shoot in his mouth off a patriotic is he drank out the picture of him and his Marine Corps uniform you know the VFW OKC and all that they handed him to Mike and ask him to do the pledge of allegiance\nHe froze up hand that to me and ran off the stage\nWhere did you make of that what does that say it's a win back that's the short answer is a win back right\nIra thank you got some other callers out there I Want to go to Saratoga Springs where a long time public officials who I knew in my year early years as a journalist and I still do today I think is on the line and he's a longtime public works commissioner up in Saratoga Springs comic saga morning John nice to hear from in\nThe morning Freda ah I really enjoyed the talk your head with a former senator Bruno you know working for the legislature for the number of years that I work I certainly understand leadership and we'll never see that kind of power come to this uh this is true and the leadership he brought here to this district\nAnd he was very good to our community\nThat is a Democrat right you're a Democrat or Republican\nQuestion no question about it I was concerned and interested in doing things for my community and senator ruined though was\nVery very supportive\nOf many things that we did hear in Saratoga Springs a matter of fact he gave odd\nThe lead money to put it on a terror cell in Congress park beautiful ... a hundred and twenty five thousand dollars that were allowed us to put that ... billion up in Congress park he also gave us money to do improvements on union avenue\nHe also made a donation toward the improvement is fitness span when it was vandalized in the park\nI knew how important was working at the legislature over the years\nBut I Know one of many of my democratic friends here in the city that I Would even consider working with senator Bruno but I was concerned for the improvements for the community there are nine that never mind the politics of it all he was a great guy yeah and what they did to him was was\nWas unbelievable I Believe that I couldn't believe the money that the federal government spent and the people that they had investigating him over the years was in the millions and millions of dollars and a pretty much tried to break them\nSome good here for you to thanks for listening ... longtime official in Saratoga Springs that go to Steve in Albany wants to comment on the narrow go right ahead to see if\nIt's\nUh I'm trying to figure out who I'm going to vote for for governor because uh I certainly don't want to vote for the current governor\nAnd ... seems to only know about down state and then we you know talks about corruption and some everybody talks about corruption even Cuomo sure so I'm trying to figure out who I Wish\nIt was unbelievable I Believe that I couldn't believe the money that the federal government spent and the people that they had investigated him over the years was in the millions and millions of dollars and a pretty much tried to break them\nSome good to hear for your thanks for listening comic tie longtime official in Saratoga Springs just go to Steve in Albany wants to comment on the narrow go right ahead Steve\nIt's\nI'm trying to figure out who I'm going to vote for for governor because uh I certainly don't want to vote for the current governor\nAnd ... seems to only know about down state and then we you know talks about corruption some everybody talks about corruption even Cuomo sure\nSo I'm trying to figure out who I Wish John Francisco ... in the Republican nominee right and and I don't know why the county chairman chairs and the committee people decided on\nMark mall narrow I Wish I knew that and I was thinking about voting for a\nA Stephanie minor\nYou know the former mayor of Syracuse who at least knows what the problems of upstate New York are and seems to be pretty candid about a lot of the problems and look at how honestly is about Andrew Cuomo now she was Cuomo's top pick to help lead the Democratic party and now she's very very critical\nWhat do you think about that it seems to me that whatever you whatever we whoever we vote for a bitter our governor is going to get back you know and then the question is how does how to send a message to the Republican Party\nI agree I mean looking for a protest road I think Stephanie ... is a good place to go she's not going to win\nA neither is the libertarian candidate or the Green Party candidate so if you don't like bow and arrow and I know a lot of people are disappointed is not falling arrow personally it's the forces behind him and his failure to run a real campaign and you shouldn't have been in that position if it wasn't going to be able to do so and they shouldn't have put them in that position\nWithout the guarantees of money which he is not gotten so we just have to find the right protest vote I think Stephanie minors probably a good one getting says we've got to take a break right now here there's nobody is if you want to talk about the sad state and it's coming down to the wire now less than thirty days to go to the election the sad state of the two party system in New York and\nMark mowing arrows a Kennedy in particular were at five twenty four seven six Thirteen hundred we'll be right back after the break\nBe sure to listen to W.

the on and welcome visitors and welcome you for you to learn as much as you can from them and that part of that time so\nShe tell us again where the nation's located\nA great well before we say that actually thank you for bringing that point up uh we do enjoy when folks stopped by the fire houses are impromptu kind of thing\nBut if you don't see anybody in there you're not sure how to do it you could always call fire headquarters and I can give everybody the number for that is a six five four\nTwo two one two and somebody will answer and just state that you'd like to uh you know whatever neighborhoods your end and we could run down those right quick right now are like we said station one is in the center of town at forty five Harrison street between you and Maine\nA station to which is currently being renovated a won't be open until probably next summer some time ah but that's it a seven or as I was a one Seventy ... avenue\nA near union avenue uh let's see station three probably our most visited fire house because of its location very prominent location or on north avenue seven fifty six [noise] ah I'm right by the corner is just a road by on a college\nAnd uh the guys there again our use of folks dropping and going to the beach monitored ... pizza whatever you have over there I'm\nAlways a nice thing a station for is on the south side or at one fifty five Drake avenue and finally in the north end we have a station five at the end up ... boulevard at four Ninety six Stratton road\nAnd again basically all the houses right now are we must have a list of twenty five or thirty visits scheduled right now folks are calling fire headquarters for us to come by the boys club to come by ... by the fire house we went to a Home Depot last weekend\nA definitely a good thing for us to get out and just to interact with the folks\nSo it's not just that people can come to visit the firehouse five house can also says come to visit you at your school\nAt a club or organization which Churchill you cynic on if you want to have the courage if you want to learn more my own means Mm oh an arranged it they're happy to do that part of\nTheir service to the city as long as they're not actually fighting a fire there'll be happy to help out mhm\nYeah and it's as we were saying before during the break you lead very nicely into this year's um theme of the fire prevention campaign for the NFL PA and\nTo come by ... by the fire house we went to a Home Depot last weekend a definitely a good thing for us to get out and just to interact with the folks\nSo it's not just that people can come to visit the firehouse firehouse can also send come to visit you at your school\nLike a club or organization which Churchill you'd send the gun if you want to have peak or if you want to learn more by all means my whole and arrange it kind of happy to do that part of\nTheir service to the city as long as they're not actually fighting a fire there'll be happy to help out mhm\nYeah and it's as you were saying before during the break you lead very nicely into this year's um theme of the fire prevention campaign for the NFL PA\nAnd it's usually they come up with a simple dirty little memorization thing uh this year they're telling us to look listen and learn and very simply\nIn the home look for fire places fire could start a listen for the sound of a smoke alarm or anything out of the ordinary\nAnd learn two ways out of every room and again that ties in to just the situational awareness again that you and I spoke amount or\nYou know a homes sad to say a are where we see probably the worst or human events with fires 'cause\nThat's where most people feel most comfortable uh so they're not really used to ah thinking about how would I get out right now kind of thing if something happened [noise] so what we had an acronym what we used to say uh it's called eat his exit drills in the home\nAnd sometimes when we used to go around to the schools to a larger extent we're hoping to reinstate that if we can [noise]\nUm [noise] we would tell the kids and and you know go home and try to you know make up a fire drill plan or some type of escape plan you know get with mommy and daddy and mentioned this to them and\nUh things like that so that's the kind of thing and of course in this day and age you mentioned how W. V. O. X. is on the computer so everybody's got their fate buried in the computer and their iPhone you know we're all losing kind of situational awareness to an extent [noise] so uh again\nI've got to pay attention to what's going on around you haven't talked to a teenager while they're in on the phone yeah I've talked to them when they're like the end of their head but yes yes no actually it's very scary\nNot just the teenagers all people ... no matter where you go you see the top people had and I don't know how many people are really and truly aware of their surroundings when they are focused sewed deeply\nRight whatever it is that they're doing on their phones it's not necessarily talking sometimes there are things sometimes it's chatting sometimes it's making faces whatever they're doing I think you're right they're not paying attention to this around it and I mean\nThat that's just a function of of the times we live and some folks are communicating in a lot better I'd say in some ways than we ever have you know uh getting open to a lot more ideas and such\nBut again the whole point being you know it's great to go through your phone or your computer but maintain your situational awareness especially in public life you know and in your home as well\nThere are only talking sometimes it's there are things sometimes it's chatting sometimes is making faces whatever they're doing I think you're right they're not paying attention to their surrounding\nAnd I mean that's just a function of of the times we live and some folks are communicating in a lot better I'd say in some ways than we ever have you know uh getting open to a lot more ideas and such\nBut again the whole point being you know it's great to go through your phone or your computer but maintained your situational awareness especially in public life you know and in your home as well\nThere's going to be all kinds of people going looking to go that way so you might want to have it maybe off to the side\nBy a big oak tree or even out by the mailbox or some such ... feet across the street that gets everybody away from the house kind are and get away so yeah and let the firemen do that job mhm so\nExactly and of course makes sure you dial nine one one don't stop inside your own house to dial nine one one go ahead and go to your neighbor's house and uh\nMake that call or if you're in an apartment building a depending on the situation depending on the high rises and we actually have a program that we're working on\nA to go around a to offer to high rises where our guys could come around and talk about fire prevention what to do if you live on the twenty third floor\nAnd there's an alarm on the fifteenth floor okay do I evacuate do I stay in place how's the alarm system in my building work there's just too many scenarios to discuss in the given amount of time we have here\nBut are absolutely very important if you live in one of the high rises to have some type of plan what to do if the fire alarm goes off or if there's a fire\nThat these high rises has building meetings periodically to discuss by prevention of fire safety short short rethink that it'd be a great idea and I'm going to be willing to send someone speak to these meetings are\nAbsolutely absolutely that's one of the things that we've been discussing at headquarters with or you know since I came in we are talking of more about fire prevention and things like that and try to reestablish programs or get programs established\nAnd I'm ... or just things for folks to think about their um even just a a personal thing just something you know from having traveled been in the service and all you get used to or wherever you go where is the ... where's the eggs to chat with\nOne of the high rises to have some type of plan what to do if the fire alarm goes off or if there's a fire\nThat these high rises has building meetings periodically to discuss by prevention of fire safety short short rethink that it'd be a great idea and I'm going to be willing to send someone speak to these meetings\nAre absolutely absolutely that's one of the things that we've been discussing at headquarters with a you know since I came in we are talking more about fire prevention and things like that and try to reestablish programs or get programs established\nAnd um [noise] ... ah just thanks for folks to think about their um even just a a personal thing just something you know from having traveled been in the service and all you get used to or wherever you go where is the word the eggs that\nWe go out to dinner and my wife God Bless her nose if I if we're if we have a place to sit down and go to dinner she knows that I Want to sit\nAnd be able to do you want to be able to lay the eggs I Know\nThere's just a thing I have so uh and I just little things that folks you know anybody could think of you know when you go somewhere I mean just and think about it for ten seconds you know and then you walk in and you enjoy yourself and you have a great male or a great time or whatever and uh but again just kind of a you know\nWhere being aware as you around and be aware of what looks normal and what might not your normal ... have gone to some place time and time again and this and that is something different what is it is that ... is it\nA sense that something short he keep your eyes open keep your ears open keep you know\nAnd not just the times we live and again the post nine eleven era et cetera all those kinds of things go on and uh the saying if you see something say something kind of thing yeah sure that goes well with any type of a unfamiliar bags or any such thing\nBut also a any unsafe condition you know folks could be aware of if they see something out of the ordinary so\nGoing back to own a home for the moment whether it's an apartment or whether it's a how um how was that the smoke detectors\nOh smoke detectors are quite effective it's been proven time and again smoke detector save lives a saw a picture again the day of social media is that the other thing I saw a picture I think it was yesterday somebody posted a a melted\nSmoke detector that they actually somebody made a plaque out of it and the whole point was before the smoke detector melted it sounded and it saved six lives for violating\nThat it was still in working order just because you buy a smoke detector and bring it to your home it's not a picture on the wall that's going to stay there forever looking beautiful you have to maintain it how you maintain the smoke detector Orleans\nPlay very nicely thank you very much for being October it being the time we do what changed the clocks right and and now to change the clocks change the batteries and your smoke to write a fall and spring not a bad idea at all\nThe batteries may still Welby good could come out put them in a toy or something and and use up the rest of whatever in the battery but put a fresh battery ... in your smoke detector\nAnd while we're right there on that topic that's a big point for folks to realize it's smoke detectors to have a life\nAnd what you need to do if you don't when you install it if you haven't done that already you should look at the back of your smoke detector and knows today and noticed that day and you will see it does have an expiration date usually about ...\nAnd the smoke detector Orleans we play very nicely thank you very much it being October it being the time we do what changed the clocks right I'm going out to change the clocks change the batteries and your smoke to write a fall and spring not

say somewhere in that ballpark [noise]\nSo ah folks should be aware of that and you know it's definitely a worthy investment to ah keep up with good maintenance\nProgram on your smoke detector but when we come back we're going to talk about some of the things that you should do to protect you know you can't be a hundred percent said that you can protect yourself as best they can\nThe cat was

stopped at all sorts of bed and breakfast along the way so these are you know old houses that has you know quilts\nAnd we will bring you to you [laughter] um I was just completely enchanted\nBy these but breakfast and I'm so it is my total dream that still hasn't let go after all these years to own a bed and breakfast one day and um [noise] in fact when I was when I was in college um I had the opportunity to\nOpen the study abroad program but it was it I got this research fellowship that I could do anything I wanted with and so I went to Ireland to\nStudy something but on the way I got to live for about two months with a family who\nOperated at a bed and breakfast and I got to work at a bed and breakfast or two months in Ireland\nUm that was I worked from like six AM to eleven PM\nI [laughter] I mean it's really hard work and work for a vote and breakfast and you think that would have squash the dream but it just can't do that [laughter]\nSo I still have this like when I retire\nI Want to buy like a bagel mansion and rent it out to people and serve them scones\n[laughter] that's my dream [laughter] very alive still sounds good [laughter] you can all come for free

stopped working and [noise]\nAnd so we were talking about dreams and um [noise]\nI Know that for myself that ... there's been a lot in terms of work like I Dreamed of being a clinical psychologist and I would [noise]\nYou know I was going on route to that and then I stopped and did ... did a different route and that dream it's not fully dead but it's mostly dead [noise] um [noise]\nAnd just just didn't it didn't think it manifested in many\nAnd I I was just talking last night to someone who it's going to retire and we were talking about dreams because\nHe was wanting to ... you know he wanted

many ways what I've learned about psychology has been like no other PHD on earth [laughter]\nAnd I owe that to you grew and I don't think I think because it was met in that way that desire for all that learning and the research and the brain and all of it so fascinating to me\nI've done it um through the school the new school learning and through my own study as well and I don't feel like I actually need to be in practice doing that I also had a dream\nAbout writing\nAnd being a writer and boy if that didn't happen by sort of surprised um produced really by God and and the order and I'm extremely grateful about that\nI had a dream about singing too and um [noise] and that one I didn't really you know you you know as a kid you're out there and my father used to manage the monkeys do

programs are traveled all the middle eastern ... and I'm far eastern religions that I was interested in so I've come I was realizing that there's a part of me that to really kind of a leaves that dreams are\nLike I don't know if God sort of put the dream in your mind knowing that they're gonna be manifest at some point in time or it's really your dream and somehow or other your desire\nLake

ultimately run into a force field of energy that comes through it introduces it so\nI think it was in answer to my need to know more about human nature what are we what kind of people really are we

until the lord trust also and him and he's so bringing the past and\nI came across that scripture many years ago and it spoke to me so clearly that if I just thank God something higher something more than myself then those desires are going to not that he's going to give me what I Want\nWhat that what I Need what I Need for myself\nWill be put that desire for\nThat will be put within me and that's what I have found when when it started speaking of all the all of the dreams I realize I'm living my dream as well because many years back when I came across that scripture one of my dream was\nTo no God and a personal way in such a strong way that I wouldn't want to do anything else but serve him and and who and they and they brought me to ... to New York and things that I didn't even know what

working for peace and that we used to cross then we ...\nIs that that's what's amazing about it that I Love about it is that your fourth one that was the tile had 'em [laughter] almost an optical illusion I mean you could be looking at\n... but it looked like wood floors for instance and I do a lot of commercial space and I've used that that the porcelain tie that look like wood and it is amazing they the illusion that it create\n[noise] well yeah it's come a long way if I'm from where it originally started again using the point that when I used to sell the wood portion piles every manufacturer you could see the framing on them now the tiles are rectified and you can pretty much but joined them together\nAnd are at the end of the day with digital technology which helps enhanced\nThe ah the realism of the planks it's very hard to tell to pieces alike\nAnd or at the end of the day we do a good job of mimicking a real would and one of our best selling collections is somebody there was inspired is called ... who was inspired by natural collections of wood from all over the world but we do quite well with our would porcelain so thank you for the compliment\nAnd you

it's very hard to tell to pieces alike\nAnd uh at the end of the day we do a good job of mimicking a real would and one of our best selling collections is something that was inspired is called ... who was inspired by natural collections of wood from all over the world but we do quite well with our would porcelain so thank you for the compliment\nAnd you know for our listeners out there these are homeowners business owners they're going to of course the answer it and the car what does the what is a good number per square foot because isn't that the way high minded square foot\nCorrect it is um I Would give it to you this way I mean on average\nDepending if we're having things that are let's say on promotion or or just everyday I mess or pay a lot of our products are going to range from five six dollars a square foot up to about ten to twelve dollars a square foot\nThat being the case I Would say we fall into the the mid range category I'm obviously with dealing with people if you like the trade we try to take care of your industry and the use you as a reference point to try and promote our products\nUm but in general I Would say that it ... were mid level we're not that we try to offer a high quality price said not such a super expensive a cost\nYeah but I I must say you know as I said I I'm betting the market all the time and and I agree it is Mitt price range\nBut there is a certain quality your child when I compared to other tile that are similar to your tile in style and also when I Do use some of them I feel like I'm looking at high fashion tie like things are a product that are that are on the latest\nOf nine and a new trend setter\nThat's what I find when I'm at ... then your show room and ... and the and the ... district and signed by the famous ...

four foot by eight foot sheets thirty nine by one hundred and Eighteen and sheets it's near uh\nIt can be used as large scale wall covering it can also be used for certain cases for the exterior of buildings\nAnd ah it can even be use the fourth of July Fourth of the pieces can be used on the floor it's uh it gives you almost a seamless appearance\nIt could also have been you've seen we also have something called a air slate which is a pretty cool way of saying it's late wallpaper it's us late veneer put over fiberglass back it comes in four foot by eight foot sheets and it can be mounted a exterior as well as interior to be used\nAs a and wet areas there's a wall covering for showers or bathrooms that can be used in fireplace applications lobbies of buildings that has a lot of other uses so\nA lot of materials as they get bigger and bigger they need to be thinner and thinner for just sheer weight to be able to be supported on a wall salaries ease of installation becomes a big deal when you're doing you're using big pieces\nOf the things he's in a pre cut and numbered by the by the by the by the factory\nWell there isn't in the title version the porcelain versions we have in a in a day for like a left in a ripe what are called book matched in the industry but we do have Iran we do have a random piece which I guess you would call the uh when it comes to the air slate\nBut by eight foot sheets and it can be mounted a exterior as well as interior to be used\nAs a and wet areas as well covering for showers or bathrooms are can be used in fireplace applications

when it comes to the air slate type pieces I mentioned those are just totally random\nI show for daring yeah\nThat's that's so interesting really all of the fascinating products that poor for notes as expanding upon I\nI Want to thank you so much for joining me today on Baron on design\nAnd I'll see you in the showrooms soon as we move on a word um and again porcelain do says ours as our sponsor as

now again Jerry both parts the architectural sales rep from porcelain notes or\nThank you for your support Jonathan and have a great after\nThank you Bye bye and now we're going to go to the secret of the day and what I Want to bring out of the secret tip of the day is how to pick paint colors for your home\nSo you're going to start by having a fan set or bringing in samples of your\n... title or rural rural covering to the store and you're going to be able to\nCoordinate the paint colors that ship with the other samples that you have simple as that right but then there's one more step\nBy a small portion of it painted on the wall and lastly I really believe in neutral backgrounds I'm not a big believer in strong colors in homes um that can you can have that a lot of rooms to go into but I'm a ... a big believer in soft Wyatt background colors\nAnd I want to thank get Jerry Rohde part sat in\nA ... which uh from coverage interiors and antiques that two hundred Lexington Avenue and also with the Upper East Side Story to search in east ... street today for joining us I'm Jonathon Barron Barron on design and sitting next week's show\nI'm going to be bringing you some information from craftsmen\nA a a difference painting are the people that do different types of paint finishes info finished it on walls I'm going to\nAnd I ... from craftsmen or a ... a different painting are the people that do different I paint finish it then spoke Spanish on Wall I'm going to shoot for you or a different types of crafts and decorate your home\nI Know and for the last show it started to talk about this topic a little bit and if there is value to the press briefing and the spokespeople for the president has something of value to tell the media than that it's useful the problem is that the truth telling from the diets and the press briefing room\nHas been scant there hasn't been a lot of truth telling so I'm not\nSure that there is value in having press briefings everyday that small newspapers particularly benefit from those things because they may not be able to get access to the top officials in the White House you know I tend to have the ... election said last week about you know real reporting isn't done at a press conference\nWhen I used to be a reporter I knew that if I had a good question to ask I never asked at a press conference I Would prefer someone aside afterwards and asked that question to then [noise]\nI'm In favor of restriction answering reporters' questions it used to be a press conference we're a good way to do that but it's become more spectacle than anything else that in many ways it makes the reporters look bad because\nI hate the spectacle again of reporters shouting questions to a president and the rocks across the White House fine it makes us look like a pack of how things are just county marine is a high\nYou know the reporters have been largely very much willing to absorb that slings and arrows that are coming from the podium warm president\nEvery once in awhile ago Jim Acosta CNN will speak up or the the one fellow whose name I don't remember who\nWas involved with playboy magazine as a political reporter I guess the question is is that the appropriate response at this time for the media to just sort of grin and bear it or should we be talking back in ... and when you hear an obvious mistake\nOr if you're insulted as was just a very good of ABC and the other day should they be saying wait a minute that's not correct she said I Believe I beg your pardon clearly were actually took a deep sigh and you know listen\nLet me let me say that things have changed I hear what our can distinguish panelist had said here\nI think things have changed in that we're now getting the microphone time they are basically becoming stars those cells and by asking the questions that they're asking\nMay alert the American people as to what the story is who you know than it it's like playing handball you know you're going to ban that against the wall what you're going to get back but the fact that you're able to ask the question\nBy the way I have proof of this and that is they don't have these briefings anymore they don't\nHere in our biggest mistake or if you're insulted as was just a very good of ABC and the other day should they be saying wait a minute that's not correct she said I Believe I beg your pardon clearly were actually took a deep sigh and you know listen\nLet me let me say that things have changed a here with our to distinguish panelist said here I think things have changed in the ... we're now getting microphone time they are basically becoming stars cells and by asking the questions that they're asking\nThey alert the American people as to what the story is who you know you're going to it's like playing handball you know you're going to bounce it against the wall what you're going to get back but the fact that you're able to ask the question by the way I have proof of this and that is they don't have these briefings anymore\nThey don't have one because it's not good for them that's going to be in their their way of dealing with it when they have something they have to say they'll have a briefing as they did the White House yes yep\nYou're on the disdain for reporters was palpable with the president's treatment as the\nFemale reporters that was clear when you're actually looked at the Internet where he can start thinking I think it was early and it was hard to understand exactly what she was saying and there was some confusion but his ultimate responsible you're not thinking and it was a cat that was beneath the president of the United states and so many ways\nWell beneath the president in the United states and says you know grab them by the you know what I mean does it get any worse than that\nHe clearly has a problem with women and that's been well documented but for him to have attacked the only invaded the way he did even if he misunderstood what she said she said thank you she did not say I'm not thinking and he responded with\nI Know you're not thinking or something to say look the character assassination and should the group of reporters in the rose garden if that's where I remember it was ...\nShould they have responded and somehow come to her assistants\nI mean this is a professional woman who's clearly capable of handling herself one engaging with the president the United states I think that that was a surprise than it would have taken a person who's on camera live off guard what do you do in a circumstance that that fact down or say Mr President you misunderstood me or why are you saying that\nCan limit as he is the problem do you think she's a reporter you've been a reporter shut you really have let them have it\nI don't know how you do let the president habit but I Do think that there's a problem to take a character assassination and just take it on the cough and say oh well I don't think I would've thought quickly enough to have responded in a way that took the precedent down but on hindsight we could all say\nWell I don't think it would have been inappropriate for Sicilia Vega after being ... by the president saying you're not thinking or whatever the cold was for her to say in effect excuse me Mr President that is inappropriate or something to that effect and the worry of course 'cause it's all about power that they will get cold I guess a lot of those of us as a certain age remember\nA famous press conference in Nixon's near the end of Nixon's presidency where he said to Dan Rather after Dan Rather question are you running for office Mr rather something of that effect and rather answered back notes or are you know I don't know if that was the best rejoined or but he finally subject it was it was something to do and\nYou know in this atmosphere in this country right now where the press is under\nConstant attack many people might not think that's appropriate and we think it all of a reporter who did that but what do they have to lose at this point there's already the thirty fiber third whatever number percentage of people who don't like us let's stand up for ourselves\nYou know every once in a while they will stand up for each other they'll say is the president refuses to answer somebody's question or or moved on\nOr something to that effect and the worry of course 'cause it's all about power that they won't get colon again a lot of\nThose as of a certain age remember a famous press conference in Nixon's near the end of Nixon's presidency where he said to Dan Rather after Dan Rather question are you running for office Mr rather something of that effect\nAnd rather answered back notes or are you know I don't know if that was the best rejoined or but he finally said it was it was something he did and and\nYou know in this atmosphere in this country right now where the press is under\nConstant attack many people might not think that's appropriate and which they get all of a reporter who did that but what do they have to lose at this point there's already the thirty five or ... whatever number percentage of people who don't like us let's stand up for ourselves\nYou know every once in a while they will stand up for each other they'll say is the president refuses cancers somebody's questioner or move on to say no no let the right to totally receptive elderly ... and I actually I proud that I think that's a good move on their part I thought the reporter in this case handles herself while we tried to\nTeach our reporters to always be professional and knock it down in it or\nSo before I get off the subject let's go back to the original premise about how few daily quote unquote daily press briefing there are two we need them do we want to make Trump does seem to be more available than it used to be to answer questions why go through Sarah Huckabee and listen to her obfuscate when we can at least here it from the man himself\nI Am not a big fan of pack journalism and I've always considered press conferences to be the ultimate manifestation of pack journalism the best journalism I've seen it's gotten by people like Susan and Craig and her colleagues at the New York times working on the tax story concerning the Trump family\nThat happened behind the scenes in down in the trenches them with the record than late nights and constant documents over a hundred thousand documents that sort of reporting that I think affects more change than a press briefing\nI I Want to check it because I think Judy and I are on different sides on this one for those good and that is that I think there have been major changes\nIn the culture of journalism so for example the ... machine people play the CNN tapes and CNN and play the Fox tapes and everybody is in a much more cooperative move\nSo when Judy said before it's interesting I never wanted to give away my good questions you know I think now she would have gotten the credit for having asked the question another station or another newspaper would've quoted horror under the president's circumstance I think we should acknowledge that that changes happening\nI don't think so I think that if you have a good angle you're working on a you know you have a a piece of information nobody else has\nEspecially print reporters that maybe even reporters would be it but I don't know I mean please don't touch me but I don't think that the television reporting to have that in a great school that I think it's been the or the newspaper reporters will have the good schools that they're going to want to ask about after the fact they're going to show their hands\nBy and large by and large on CNN and MSNBC when they have an idols the panels are mostly filled by print\nTruly who by the way had had a good guess in the newspaper story and the next morning in the Morning Joe or the guys on the other channels we'll call him and say you had a great story that so Judy\nMay have a you know one of the things I think that we should really talk about it at some point is is those reporters are getting paid by those cable stations I don't know what the relationship is the arrangement in but it would be and move towards transparency I Would like to know ticketing\nI Can't swear that I'm right about this but I Believe the distinction between those who are paid and those who are not paid is when they will call them at MSNBC contributor to CNN contribute if they just introduce the reporter with the newspapers\nAfter the fat and show their hands\nBy and large by and large on CNN and MSNBC when they have panels the panels are mostly filled by print paper trail who by\nThe way had had a good guess in a newspaper story and the next morning in the Morning Joe or the guys on the other channels we'll call him and say you had a great story that so Judy\nMay have a you know one of the things I think that we should really talk about it at some point in in those reporters are getting paid by the Cape of things I don't know what the ... the arrangements with the move towards transparency I Would like to know what can\nI Can't swear that I'm right about this but I Believe the distinction between those who are paid and those who are not paid is when they will call them at MSNBC contributor or CNN contributor if they just introduce the reporter with the newspapers affiliation I Believe that there's still gets to\nPunish ... you know it's the idea that they want to know that their brain is out there in other words the owners of the New York times\nWe used to have trouble now we have no trouble people want to come on stage you who have a relationship and I I'm sure that that comes right top down to telling everybody the more of the ability you get the better off you are\nWell I I'm not telling tales out of school the shooting and Caitlin and I are not paid for being on this but\nI Know when I was ... [laughter] what what you mean you owe me money you can get a bagel I used to go anywhere but but you know when I was still active I felt it was important for me to be here and not only because I enjoy doing it and thought I had something to bring to the table but it was a publicity coup for my newspaper\nAnd you know people in a capital district a lot of the legislators\nDidn't know the kings and daily framing from Kingston, Jamaica times\nUntil the name of the paper was repeated and repeated being on on this program and on the roundtable for so long so that's a change from a generation guy yes yeah what's pat ourselves on the back collectively for by the way this is the Media Project ... brown\nJudy Patrick announced shark here on Northeast Public radio and all of our affiliates around the country\nThe New York times did a remarkable job by most measurements accept Sarah Sanders\nA with a rather long investigative piece about the Trump and the tax situation and Trump's father on and on and on\nYou know in his favorite have happened if the idea that the profit margins weren't what they used to be in what they were in the sixties and seventies ... but that's my question is what I don't know if\nWhen you say you're doing worse how worse it out the door it you're done with that but I Know\nIn the meantime we have these initiatives and innovations that are happening with the it's not for profits and they are valuable and they land some content to neighborhoods in cities and towns that might have no contact at all yet but if you're the publishing you're not happy\nYou know newspapers have happened if the idea that the profit margins weren't what they used to be in what they were in the sixties and seventies who am I talking to my question to eat what I Do know is when you say you're doing worse how worse out the door it's oh you're done with that but I Know\nBut in the meantime we have these initiatives and innovations that are happening with these not for profits and they are valuable and they lend some content to neighborhoods in cities and towns that might have no contact at all yet but if you're the poetry you're not happy that doesn't make you\nWere out of time I'm happy about the Irish ...
