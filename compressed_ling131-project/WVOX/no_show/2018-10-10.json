I went to college radio hour might emerges good morning how are you\nWell it's not a good morning if you're a Yankee fan like myself ah I didn't have much faith of this team when the playoffs started and unfortunately I Wish I was wrong but I was right\nWhy were what were you write about the pitching couldn't do it or that the the big power guns wouldn't come through in the clutch\nAnd I had concerts season started\nUm that when they brought in June Carlos stand they were bringing in another another big righty bad that could make contact a hit or with a lot of holes in his swing and they already have that with judge and Gary Sanchez I mean just look at the ... that\nGene ... got two hundred and eleven times this year and over six hundred and Eighteen at batch Joe DiMaggio and his career only struck out three hundred and sixty nine times never striking out more than forty times in one sees although\nMichael isn't that the necessary a necessary part of the game in fact the night before that was hit and run I haven't seen it and run and three years\nOr if you look at teams like the red Sox were advancing now\nYou know they they do play small ball in the playoffs the liquid the Astros did you do put the ball and play you put pressure on the opposing team\nA and force them into making mistakes the Yankees and the infield is a disaster no could field outside of D. D. quarries they don't mean yell and how they have to pull the fifth district's any because he can't field or look for you for his ... really is a true first baseman Gary Sanchez needs a brick\nWall behind the walls Gary said just has hands of steel they're going to rush the next time it rains this yeah this is you know and you look how they hit with men in scoring position for for ... you can't do that and she ... after after those runners on base and he's the power eater but let me know\nIf it'll be destroyed the search to drink like Reggie Jackson you got to come through\nWell you know while you're absolutely right you know um there's a difference between a champion and people and teams that are not and it's not something that you can\nCan do by I think we see baseball taking an ugly turn us saying we win more games in home run don't need to point small ball pitchers shouldn't puts more than five minutes in hockey we're seeing a little bit now but at the end of the day\nThe teams that win all the teams in the heart of a champion along with the talent and you can't put that in\nNo that's absolutely true if you look at the teams\nFrom the nineties a vote those teams says heart they didn't have the best players they didn't have the MVP players they hit with one is this going physician that plays like Paul O'Neil Derek Jeter Williams that came through during crunch time and they they knew what it was to be Yankee and and they had a lot of heart\nYou know it's an example of that even though he was he missed the rating excoriated because of his uh women issues but Tiger Woods we hear never doubted that he would win a championship again even after five surgeries people why that\nHave a drive that you can't get out of now let's find out about what you're talking about today again by the way folks Michael Moore the broadcaster in his own ride a on a lot of sports marketing teaches what are you guys doing today at four o'clock\nSay four o'clock in the eye on a college radio hour we happy Thomas Paine a conference coming up on campus starting on Thursday to Saturday So we're going to talk to North ... about that and then we're gonna have a nice conversation with mass calm professor a doctor ... Cosby and get from her perspective\nKnew what it was to be Yankee and and they had a lot of heart\nYou know it's an example of that even though he was he missed the rating excoriated because of his uh women issues but Tiger Woods we hear never doubted that he would win a championship again even after five surgeries people why that\nHave a drive that you can't get to take out of now let's find out about what you're talking about today again by the way folks Michael is sports the broadcaster in his own right God on a lot of sports broadcasting teaches what are you guys doing today at four o'clock\nI'd say four o'clock in the eye on a college radio hour we happy Thomas Paine\nA conference coming up on campus starting on Thursday to Saturday So we're going to talk to North ... about that and then we're gonna have a nice conversation with mass calm professor a doctor needing Cosby and get\nFrom her perspective and a professional working in the media a female reaction to all the stuff with Brett Kavanaugh and Donald Trump but I think I think you'll find that very\nOh good to be she'll she'll be talking about beer pong Brett today\n[laughter] this is my new Brett thank God [noise]\nExplain that sound like a beer can you don't want to hear\nDisqualified him and he was qualified and he was right to say hey you know presumption of innocence but when you sit there and you are to the American people and you say things like what goes around comes around what is wrong with us but in our system we don't realize that you can't up so much on Supreme Court and talks like that\nWell I mean I you know again when you look at this as you look at the system and it is up to the Senate or to make that decision and we have to do what what the women who were opposed and not just women and men to the post\nAnd also those who supported and that is we have to go out and lobbied those people and we have to make sure that people are not as reflect hurt you and I would say a lot of that falls on us that voters and citizens right because you can't just do that when the chips are down and the guy\nIs you know two weeks away on the confirmation vote for like course that's got to be done consistently and you know in fairness I mean look back\nAt twenty fourteen our last midterm night and we always talk to students about that\nYou know young people have every right to be frustrated and we don't make voting easy but less than two out of ten millennials voted in the mid term of twenty fourteen it's awfully tough to fight back and do you know\nDecrease the enormous and that they're carrying it only one point eight of you go out and vote in the mid term elections because it gets our elected officials and those reading very little incentive to pay attention so you know\nWe have to go out and ... those people and we have to make sure that people in us reflect our use and I would say a lot of that falls on us as voters and citizens right because you can't just do that when the chips are down and the guy\nIs you know two weeks away from a confirmation vote for like course that's got to be done consistently and you know in fairness I mean look back\nAt twenty fourteen our last midterm night and we always talk to students about that\nYou know young people have that'd be great to be frustrated and we don't make voting easy but less than two out of ten millennials voted in the mid term of twenty fourteen it's awfully tough to fight back and talk to you know\nDecrease the enormous student debt they're carrying it only one point eight of you go out and vote in the mid term election because it gets our elected officials and those reading very little incentive to pay attention so you know all of which is to say we can you know the ... the people in office but we've also got to do our part\nYou to read in school professors everyone who were forging WBAL works as a perfect segue a let's look at the upcoming election [noise]\nUh if\nThe Democrats took root here and in some ways deservedly so as you suggested waiting for the last minute it's a really made it look like a job\nBut we'll women be out their voting will people of good will be out there boating but again you know the me too movement has to be very careful one of the elements of the me too movement as you are guilty until proven innocent and that's a huge problem and evolving problem gaining steam\nYeah and you know the truth is nobody knows what's gonna happen in the mid term you know historically the party out of power will gain the seats necessary for Democrats to take the house this time and the Senate will either likely remain Republican they pick up a seat or too because the map so bad for Democrats\nBut again we've never been at this moment where there's so much energy and enthusiasm on both sides than I Would point to you know what I think it's one of the most important polls we've seen recently which is the NPR PBS poll which showed the enthusiasm gap amongst Republicans closed to almost ... percent one percent\nOver the Kavanaugh hearings so you've got very energized\nBasis if this holds true for weeks and the real key is going to be what happens in that moderate middle and we don't know you can cherry pick pools\nThe other thing is that as much as we focus on ... these are local and state races were talking about and that matters who we are the candidates want her to a local issues facing folks that they go out to vote you know how well are people who organized on the ground\nAll of those things come into play as well so it's not all Trump and Kevin ... you know people are making decisions for their their district in their state so you know to say we know what's going to happen we can only look historically and historically it's you know about three quarters\n... Seventy five percent chance Democrats take the house and about fifty fifty probably fifty one forty nine I save Republicans hold the Senate at this point\nWhich gives us divided government which you know I'm not a fan of either I mean you know if you don't like Trump it's better to have Democrats and they're holding the line but it also means that we will have a very slow moving Congress struggle less next two years depending on what happens in twenty twenty\nWell let's take a look about as we come up now on seven forty ... to ... take Congress not than what the likely to pursue in your view [noise]\nWhat I Hope they don't pursue at this point and I agree with Nancy Pelosi on this I Hope they don't pursue impeachment of both Kavanaugh and Trump as a leading issue on their agenda I don't think that's a winning for either the voters or their constituents or the country as a whole\nUnless of course we you know something changes in and and the evidence that sport coming from the mother record and you know that may change things but I think to have that front and center\nWhich you know I'm not a fan of either I mean you know if you don't like Trump it's better to have Democrats and they're holding the line but it also means that we will have a very slow moving Congress struggle less next two years depending on what happens in twenty twenty\nWell let's take a look at that as we come up now on seven forty three to Democrats take Congress not done it what are they likely to pursue in your view [noise]\nWell what I Hope they don't pursue at this point and I agree with Nancy Pelosi on this I Hope they don't pursue impeachment of both ... and Trump as a leading issue on their agenda I don't think that's a winning for either the voters or their constituents country as a whole\nUnless of course we you know something changes in and and the evidence that sport coming from the mother record and you know that may change things but I think they have that front and center is not\nEither a winning political strategy or winning for the country what I Do hope that they're able to do is I Do hope they're able to hold the line against things that they do not like about what the Trump has done policy wise\nSo that would be everything from taxes to immigration to health care you know you can go down the litany of policies that they disagree on regulation certainly I I you know they could hold the line against those things as the people who would ever lifted them to do and they need to put forth a positive\nAgenda that focuses on bringing up the middle class I mean you know jobs unemployment so many of the thing was\nThat the Democrats have had difficulty\nYou know really making a case as to what positive things they want to do going forward and that's really a job for them because I'm like the Republicans they do not have a single\nLeader so to speak who can you know take charge you know maybe you could say Nancy Pelosi navy Chuck Schumer but I ...\nYeah you you know and that's you know that's another issue but you really do need somebody who can verbalize on behalf of the party um and communicate to people why should come over to the fold and and Democrats have had trouble doing that\nAnd and and the president has done the things he said he would do we don't get enough credit for that\nI think that ... even if North Korea never gets perfect it is so he's made progress there when we come back here's your homework assignment what will be the issues in the mid term [noise]\nGot to go to ... do you have to\nHold on go cook something to break we'll be back with are closing\nMoments with training center with them we'll talk with Franco though this is the one and only for the sixty WB\nSubmitted from\n\nFox News I'm Chris foster hurricane

talk a little bit about it last week of course\nTo principals gone the superintendent of schools is gone and we have a board that seems to be more outgoing where do we go from here do you think with the with the new show schools and I think there's\nI think they still have a lot of a lot of issues in front of a lot um you know they they're they're um they're dodging a little bit on the issues of of of the security resource officers there you know they're they're putting their putting this out to this this climate in culture committee um said there's a lot of issues\nThat I'm getting culture committee what's that yeah exactly\nI'm actually in culture right exactly mhm you got it all involve restored of justice I I I have no idea I you know it's a climate culture can be restored of justice is working in a New York city mhm with just so they got it\nLast week of course the principles of schools who's gone and we have a board that seems to be more going where do we go from here do you think with the with the new show schools and I think there's\nI think they still have a lot of a lot of issues in front of them a lot um you know they they're they're um they're dodging a little bit on the issues of of of the security resource officers there you know they're they're putting their putting this out to this this climate and culture committee I'm so there's a lot of issues\nCulture committee what the\nYeah exactly um\nNicely and culture right exactly mhm you got it restored of Justin I I I have no idea you know it's a climate culture can be restored of justice is working in New York City mhm so they did a lot of hand it over to that\nParticular committee I mean so there's so there's that um the the code of conduct has to be rewritten um so that's an issue of course they still have to hire a new superintendent hire permanent for principle\nUm those are big issues that are in front of them it aside whether or not they're going to actually fully implement restored of justice or not because it's because whether or not it actually works is questionable\nWhat was the term I mean it's like anything how is it executed I mean if we're going to let people off the hook for violent crimes or great disruptions is not going to work\nThis out and and and I I actually had a conference call with a friend of mine who\nActually involved in it in Idaho and I'm In the

produced on it\nUm and reviewed some of our stuff online about it um said to me you know he he ... his ... his comment was that\nUm he he he was concerned that our focus is it necessarily in the right place that it it's supposed to be the restoration is supposed to be for the victim\nAnd\nThat we mean you're right yeah it is the restoration supposed to be for the victim and and although we're looking to to restore the ... the the perpetrators the you know the the owners but you have to\nBut but but again I think I can say this\nI think until it loses the tent if you will no pun intended

they're the prosecutor right he was speaking as a prosecutor when he was a prosecutor that\nThey don't have to lie about everything but if there's one lie that affects the credibility that that sort of brought up and the way I Am I ... it is that that's\nWhat I Would add to the ice is Michelle and he had to say any excuse me and Anthony what the point the greatest bringing up in a lot of Ford's alright Anthony I wouldn't be called wise\nAnthony appointed that he's bringing up is that in in the court and they always cross examined people by the ... the statements the legal principles if you make pie Rick ... statements if you if you lie about one thing that you're apt to live\nBut I I fully understand what I'm saying what I'm saying I never ... elite the witnesses okay\nBut he's the last person who should be bringing that up as he lied about his Vietnam service to advance his political career so to me I thought it was tremendously hypocritical I understand with great that that certainly as a legal principle but that guy is not the guy should we bring it up what\nShould we be talking about the underlying reality about rather than who who throws the first stone we're talking about an appointment of a judicial appointment to the ...\nAnd how could you say it's not a jury\nThere's a committee there who has to vote just like a jury who who testimony that testimony is under perjury the felony perjury the witnesses to appear whether it be the candidate end or Dr Ford are under penalty of ...\nA a pet a felony perjury so I mean how could you say it's\nNot as serious a I'd have\nTo say it's just I Love these people let's say it's just a job application in my view I I never been to an interview or I was put under oath and now in Westchester you can't even ask somebody if they have a criminal record you got to hire somebody that could be a convicted felon to work with children are not even realize it\nSo I think the politics behind it and I don't think right will admit this but the but the politics behind it is that they're saying on this job interview\nThat because this is John ... job interview\n'em now we're going to shift the burden from presumption of innocence and beyond even preponderance of yeah they are going to go to sue innocence beyond a reasonable doubt you know and therefore if ...\nSo I mean how could you say it's not a jury is uh I I just I Love these people let's say it's just a job application in my view I I never been to an interview or I was put under oath and now in Westchester you can't even ask somebody if they have a criminal record you got to hire somebody that can be a convicted felon to work with children are not even realize it\nSo I think the politics behind it and I don't think right will admit this but the but the politics behind it is that they're saying on this job interview but because this is John ... job interview 'em now we're going to shift the burden for a presumption of ... and beyond even preponderance of yeah we are going to sue sue innocent beyond a reasonable\nWhy I think that's part of the politics of it I'm trying to stay [noise] I'm trying to states whether there's there's a clean\nThat's corroborated then and it it is it more likely than not that this occurred and anyone can be believable there was a girl down in Virginia who said that she was raped by some of the things that you be a and the Rolling Stones went ahead and ran with it because it was believable and it turns out that it was not\nThe whole thing was made up we had a case down and do a bunch of lacrosse players ... and it turned out that ... that was also clearly you know anybody who's a believable I leave or if it's believable enough\nBelievable enough that the charges were brought in both of those cases and so yes the victim was\nElite charge you know but my point you go into a theory that no one\nWho is court of public ... or ... or you know capital\nChristmas or to public opinion this is George ... was made very public in in what was essentially a trial because you had senators questioning that this person and just say oh we need an FBI investigation the point is that the Democrats are never going to be happy to have a\nTrial except that you call it a trial but let's say the Democrats made that decision was it a whole this off to the last minute why usually I usually on the politics that OK dictates consequences okay they may or may have been better for them to release it earlier because they may have been able to get a better investing I should know that that\nThat's the politics of course that doesn't make any sense because I'm Sorry but but if they wanted more credible investigation they were trying to find somebody turned over to the\nLast like it sounds like they made a political calculation well we're going to hold it to the late night when we don't eat it or maybe ... but if we see that we need it we're going to use it\nThat well that's that's a that's a huge role in the process of course that that's that is that all assuming that's held it back as opposed to what ... what else was quick Christmas just in the position that that's that's a valid point you know some ... that's a deli more proof that that was the case\nThat allows Mrs fought it I'm fine confirmation\nBy ambush so so so I think the Republicans played it straight as they said okay well let the woman testified testified that the judge got your response\nAble to get a better investment I should know that that\nThat's the politics and of course that doesn't make any sense because I'm Sorry but but if they wanted more credible investigation I Would have turned ... over and over to the\nLast thing that doesn't like it sounds like\nThey made a political calculation well we're going to hold it totally maybe we don't eat it or maybe ... but if we see that we ate it will go to use it\nThat well that's that's a that's a huge role in the process of course that that that is but that also mean that that's held it back as opposed to be at least what else was quick Christmas just in the position that that that's a valid point or some shit that's a valid proof that that was the case\nThat allows Mrs fought it I'm fine confirmation\nBy ambush so so so I think the Republicans played it straight as they said okay well let the woman testified testified\nThat the judge got to respond judge Kavanaugh responded and when we say is the story corroborated if any of those witnesses said this happened what didn't happen this way you know the question is is this like three levels to this thing one did it happen at all to didn't happen but it didn't happen this way or three did happen and how bad was\nDo you really believe that there were Republican senators that we're holding back on their decision until after the process show yes yeah there are senators that said there were that they were supporting him regardless\nOf what those are the floor in the middle of most of the ... for the ... but I think they do their jobs as the centers okay and that was mccaskey rounded up saying\nPressure wasn't on the committee yes understand your point oh she was a long time as you said it was not on the community college it's on the ... or ... will flake was definitely on the committee yeah Ali flight where the two on the committee\nI don't know if you have comments was on the committee I think flake was on many columns colleagues and I had was one of the ones that the name was on the fence and as was mccaskey so it was always that way and I don't ... mansion\nAnd flame answer wasn't on the ... no no no I don't know what I'm saying those senators those as well as the host for senators and that's what I'm saying if you're not going to look in our country to what those force and just instead say on the far left\nOr right but then we're about we're not on the committee we're talking about what the committee laid it they will they hold\nIt hold on to do with his father left far right Republican this is a matter of our country and our constitution a and and preserving actually and our\n... exactly and and and so what's your ... which which are basically saying that she sounded credible and so even though it's not corroborated even though no one else says it happened we\nBelieve no one else believe I Believe in that case you happen to believe or so so an unfair unsubstantiated claims and at at anytime substantiate that that that is the value of the classes\nAre totally unsubstantiated she did a lie detector test she I lie detectors or not she can't wait she named people lie detectors on what is thought\nLook I've ... I've also heard that the her that she she's a psychiatrist to who to coaches people lie detector test or so that that that is a knock\nKnock everything again it's the political process and the Senate and had to take all of this shit that consideration and I vote\nAnd look I I look to those worse than it is I think the four senators did the right things they they ask for some station and and the Democrats were still never going to be happy or the whole thing was was a sham on airport to want that one yesterday\nAnd today President Trump at the end of the way the wind trying everything\nOkay I I mean we've got some other callers we've got to go to so hopefully some other topics and [laughter]\nI didn't know if we're going to get this is pretty big All right let's go to our next caller with Don and Greg stuck in the middle\nAnd heck cell morning how are you ...\nKept going I like I always great electric your before I get in to the capital in the ...\nCoaches people lie detector test or so that that that is uh not\nMuch everything again it's the political process and try to take all of this ship the consideration\nAnd I vote and look I I look to those worse I mean there's I think the force interest at the right things they bashed their station and and the Democrats were still never going to be happy or saw the whole thing was was a sham on the airport to walk to one yesterday\nI was in front of the Trump actually turned out the way the wind drawing everything\nOkay All right and that's another close we've got to go through so hopefully some other topics [laughter]\nI don't know if we're going to get a pretty big All right let's go to go with John and Greg stuck in the middle and a real morning how are you so much\nTrouble going I Greg I always good to electric your before I get in to the Capitol immature a couple of drinks strict ... mentioned on the uh the ... are\nUp you've got to go to a break Mitchell so hold on there and we'll come back with the next segment with you and I'm more of stuck with Don and Greg Reed back at them you\nKnow those kids don't do much\nLonger\nTo get a job [noise] well\nRight now can\nYou can have you know you can't just smile and you know\n[noise] well\nThat's right exactly [noise]\nMary Lou here is the latest updates from Fox News radio\nFourteenth street do\nNews I'm Emily and Lou Michael's a monster with winds of a hundred and forty five miles an hour taking aim at the Florida Panhandle where could make landfall this afternoon and unfortunately\nThe window sill evacuated come to a close a bad that already done so for many of the citizens that are in Florida the\nAdministrator Brock Long Fox meteorologist Janet Dean warns Michael will cause incredible amounts of\nDamage to tropic for parts of the Big Bend up Florida they've never seen a category four of this magnitude and that's part of Florida and that's actually could go down in history as the strongest cat for four October\nThe storm so powerful expected to stay a hurricane and moved over central Georgia tomorrow and a new poll find that a large majority of Americans have worried the nation's voting systems might be vulnerable to have heard\nWhat it\nIs a star is any guide to Britain the cannery and we're excited to be a part in the ... nation because now more than ever we need a powerful voice that\nWe need ... the new faith and you don't want to know and the Fox news favorites you already love Latin\nThey're going to be very PC hell no Humvees be more like a lot done right but if I may just dot com and find\nChris Wallace from Fox News channel animating western for me it's always going to happen\nIf people Sam's that you're not pushing an agenda\nYou're not pulling your punch it they're going to rely on your\nOne of the advantages of having been in this business so long and you're able to do\nWhat is real what is important\nAnd watch a whole new way\nIn the park and lock nation because now more than ever we need ...\nNeed Fox Nation than you and you don't want to know in the Fox news favorites you already love Latin\nThey're going to be very PC hell no more life can be done right certify sneezes dot com and find\nBritish woman from Fox News channel animating western for me is always going to happen\nIf people saying that you're not pushing an agenda\nYou're not holding your punches they're going to rely on your\nOne of the advantages of having been in this business so long as you're able to just\nWhat is real what is important to\nWatch just hold on a call ...\nChris Wallace from Fox News channel real news real honest opinion\nIs just one man well the\nAnswer you six weeks old teams\nThe\nWhat's return now to stuck in the middle with John Bernie I'm Greg variant on fourteen sixty W.

cash and brought him in here to follow the numbers and to be a\nA saber metrics guy and to be stats guy and boy they stick with that he wasn't willing to change your game plan to match what was going on in the game at all he was picking with what he was sticking with the ... and and he left the sea into long you love Severino into long\nOr he brought the wrong guy in what he a relief submarine I thought he just did a terrible job next the next to probably gene Carlos Stanton who came up really small\nWell I'm you know here's here's the performances that were I don't know I don't know if our listeners are real baseball they may not but that's okay you know I mean I I Am in more than a Yankee fan you know all my life and um\nI I think it's I think there's just a just a fundamental problem with the Yankees and I if you give you ... can be two minutes\nI'll Try to explain it loves to here they are built totally on the all or nothing premise home run or nothing\nAnd even though I like the uh the long blasts just as much as the next guy you you can you can win a lot of regular season games that way but you can't win in the playoffs with a team that the way they are constructed which is\nThat they strike out too much they don't get enough you know I'm an old school guy when it comes to batting average I think batting average matters their team average was under two fifty\nThat's not good so uh uh what happens is they don't get enough men on base and then when they do they don't get enough timely hit so they they rely on these homeruns\nWhich like I said can and other teams to uh to they're not the only ones but the problem with the Yankees is that they don't have the starting pitching that can make up for the fact that when you have an all or nothing team like that they're going to go through these droughts where they can score more than two runs or or maybe one Ron\nOr because their starting pitching cannot hold leads yeah and so that's what happens when the the Yankees really\nYou know if you look at the the season uh and and and so when they go up against the team with good pitching and it seemed like the red Sox have high average hitters at least two of them anyway right um they're going to be matched I mean the red Sox are better team yeah if you look at those guys ... bats and a a JD Martinez\nThose guys those two guys are worth five Yankees in my view [laughter] because they can hit they can head and neck and they'll hit in situations where they're not always trying to hit homeruns right ... uh what's his name that's also can run to mix with\nThe Yankees are ... are are based a base station to station they most of them can't run that fast they'll do a couple of them can\nBut they don't hit enough right they just don't I mean the homeruns were hollow if not standing by the way Jane Carlos stent who had his opportunities bases loaded twice but he is symptomatic of the ... the ... the panic in which that guy makes\nTwenty six million a year or twenty seven at some point it peaks that's like thirty three ... thirty two million a year for three years when he's going to be\nNot as good as as he is now ... you know\nBut he had a very hollow year I mean he had thirty eight ... runs a hundred RBI let me never hits with men on a ... in and out around the Yankees are up six to write you know yeah it's and worse than that\nMatt he'd strike he struck out I actually looked at that age ... he struck out two hundred and eleven times this year\nYou know how many times Joe DiMaggio struck out in his life how many ... fourteen your career three hundred and sixty eight times while standing strikes out at a rate six or seven times DiMaggio did in any given year right I mean that's you\nStrike out are horrible and worse\nThan that stand straight so usually on three pitches right he doesn't even make the pitch for work\nNow he doesn't watch three go by yesterday\nTwo million a year for three years when he's going to be not as good as as he is now ... you know but he had a very hollow year I mean he had thirty eight ... runs a hundred RBI never hits with men on a\nMatter on the Yankees are up six to write you know yeah it's\nAnd worse than that Matt he'd strike he struck out I actually looked this up that he ... he struck out two hundred and eleven times this year\nYou know how many times Joe DiMaggio struck out in his wife how many ... fourteen your career three hundred and sixty eight times while standing strikes out at a rate six or seven times DiMaggio did in any given year right I mean that's you\nStrike out are horrible and worse than that stand straight so usually on three pitches he doesn't even make the pitch for work\nNow he eastern watched three go by yesterday or day before yesterday he looks like he's on drugs that you know and in their ... and you know people say well you know people strike out a lot more now it's the way the game is like nothing can happen when you strike out happens you know if you hit behind a runner and and it hit you know a ground ball at least you're than someone or you know\nContact make matters because right is ... because it makes other next the other team move right you know create opportunities for for mistakes and you know and the\nThe problem with Stanton is when he you know if there's ever men on base and he's up two outs you can pretty much turn off the sound I mean he's not going to hit the ball you know it's just not most of the time it's a shame that any morale killer to do you think a guardian back next year and I don't know you know\nI like the guy at least it's sad and hit anymore can't hit and eat\nAnd that's the other problem with a lot of the Yankees some gardeners part of this to their own like this there they you know some of them have more success than others in terms of their their you know the frequency of getting on base\nBut you know it's not a good habit for ... for example in ... corner does is also as soon as he did great these guys are swinging from their heels every time they come up and ... looks like he's gonna rip a muscle yeah I mean he shows put\nShorten a swing your total it choke up put that on the ball and\nPut it in play right I mean you know she mentioned rod crew today playing he wouldn't be on any team\nI mean his whole this whole of logging at regular protests was batting average cannot get a get the get the ban on the ball and\nGet on race right and you know and it's okay to have one or two guys that can hit the\nShores table for another day another great by all of them\nYou know so when they celebrated the fact that they set the a home run record team record in law every position in the batting order one through nine you know hit more twenty or more home runs on second so what do\nYou know I mean if you look at the teams that are going to probably get into the world series you know one of the things they have going for them is\nThey all of them have a ... I think except maybe the Dodgers but all of them have an\nIn fact the Dodgers look a lot like the Yankees in we weeks except for ... no great starting pitching in a lot of guys are swaying from their heels\nWith low batting average ... you know middle of the shadows and terrible right he got there but the other teams like the Astros\nThe brewers and the red Sox all have high power high batting average type players in balance you know right and it matters you know this business of deciding or just saying to savor metric stuff the batting average doesn't matter of course it matters right\nFor them is that all of them have a ...

[noise]\nThey don't you get a lot of ideas on the newspapers they tried to be relevant and I wanted to talk about bailed before because so you'd have to understand the concept to bail\nWhen a loved one of George gets arrested or make it a rest of the getting involved in some kind of a of a serious situation they are entitled as a matter of law total reasonable bailed it brought before a judge and the judge will evaluate the purses roots in the community\nAnd evaluate nature of the crime and will determine what the bail will be\nIn many instances there is no bail at all it's released on their own reconnaissance but in some instances person that has a previous record or has a record of jumping bail not showing up in court on other occasions they will put a bail and the bail will depend upon the nature of the charge and the crime involved\nNow if it's a series of violent crime and its likelihood that might be facing serious time the bail may be higher because it might motivate him not to show up to avoid prosecution\nBut in the world we live in today is difficult to avoid being found out to claim that a person is going to jump bail it's rather disingenuous because\nIt's just a matter of time that they'll pick 'em up a violation of a traffic violation and the computer age you're going to come in contact with some authority and you're going to be picked up\nI've been practicing well very very many years and all that time I've handled upwards of probably more than twenty thousand cases and I've only had four or five people ever jump bail on me and that's significant\nAnd all instances every single one of the instances but one person was was brought back to court within six months and the ... and the one that ... wasn't it took them three years to bring back to court so that so that's the reality of it\nDo we have to have laws going to cost hundreds of thousands of people who satisfy one a tool five ten cases like that I wouldn't doubt it you're not going to avoid being prosecuted you're not going to disappear into the woodwork you're going to be found out\nAs part of the life this is the system we have so it's expected that the person should have reasonable bell\nHow often do you get a situation where the seats are son get arrested for a fight\nOr where he may have overreacted if somebody with a bat or steak or a bottle\nAnd he's charged with a a serious crime and then she's crying and she says but it's really a good boy and he may very well be that boy but he did a stupid thing under the influence of alcohol to something and he goes before a judge\nAnd the judge will evaluate this determine what if anything or any would there would be many judges hold themselves out as being tough on criminals which just make very much sense\nAnd will said ridiculously high amounts to bail that makes really no sense at all because the constitution says reasonable bell and nine times out of the appeal to a higher court the bill will be reduced the judge ends up looking foolish\nSo religion reasonable bail and that should be reasonable at all times but this is one of the factors Miller bail is you're entitled to it and it should be there to protect you on the other hand if the crime is such a significant nature I eat a murder\nI ... something terrorism or something like that where there's possibilities that you can do damage to the community and you may not return\nThere's a determine what if anything ... and ... with the bail would be many judges hold themselves out as being tough on criminals which just make very much sense\nAnd will said but if you stay high amounts to bail that makes really no sense at all because the constitution says reasonable bell and nine times out of ten of appeal to a higher court the bill will be reduced the judge ends up looking foolish\nSo maybe it's a reasonable bail and that should be reasonable at all times but this is one of the factors no bail is you're entitled to it and it should be there to protect you on the other hand if the crime is such a significant nature I eat a murder\nI ... something terrorism or something like that where there's possibilities that you can do damage to the community and you may not return then you can understand why bail would be very high and they would be a desire to have person out on bail\nRemember in the same cause danger to the community is not a criteria\nIn federal cause it is\nNow let me move on to another thing the issue also a story that appeared in today's post\nIn\nLooking page who let me see this\nAge seven and a headline we judged too old and it speaks of a lawyer who was in the midst of trying to case\nAnd the judge stops the trial and says the lawyer I don't think you should be trying cases Mr blank leaves his name out he has had a long and distinguished career\nAnd the person who responded after reflection kind of agree with your judge things ... you you don't realize how you lose your ability is quite interesting this is a lawyer who was eighty seven years of age and he was trying a criminal case at what point\nTo the person that has to stop the judge declared a mistrial\nI think that there should not have gone public I think this should have been done privately there was no reason why it has to appear to press the lawyer has a good reputation and it's been around a long time I've known him and I've known the judge by the way for many years and they do each other\nThat would be no harm to the person being called up the bench and saying I think you should withdraw\nBecause it said on the record it was demeaning and the judge is a sweetheart real nice woman judge or a pickles\nKnown for years and the lawyer will remain nameless for the time being it's in the post you could read it\nAnd it's a sad thing to watch and hold\nThe lawyers a good lawyer was\nAnd maybe it's time to step off of the Dell puzzle the ladder so to say before you fall down and gets hurt\nAnd the eighty seven does a lot of years to practice law I mean he practiced well over sixty years practicing that's a lotta years\nWhat do you think give us a call\nHis intent was there but apparently and making the record I'm reading here now he jumbled up words he fell asleep the little things like that can that may have faced with a serious charge or a woman in this particular case it was a nanny case in which the woman who is alleged to have stuffed with towels out of baby throat\nVery serious case and or if he was in effect if he shouldn't have gone to take this just the just the foot ... issue of use as\nI've seen some lawyers who are very young are are ineffective I can tell you that should be a qualifying test when trying cases it's a difficult situation to the best of circumstances but whether it's\nWell I mean he practiced well over six years practicing that's a lotta years\nWhat do you think give us a call\nHis intent was there but apparently and making the record I'm reading here that he jumbled up words of a sleepy little things like that can demand faced with a serious charge or a woman in this particular case it was a nanny case in which the woman is alleged to have stuffed the towel down a baby throat\nVery serious case and or if he was ineffective you should know on taking it just as just a thought can misuse views on it\nAnd I've seen some lawyers who are very young and our our our ineffective\nI can tell you that should be a qualifying testament trying cases it's a difficult situation under the best of circumstances but whether there was a difficult situation that makes it uh the worst of circumstance\nThey don't have the control of the bus that don't have the safety of a bus they don't have the weight of a bus and have you have a situation where it's put together something made that by additionally it's put together with pasta added to it so the joints are not as strong as\nAs um [noise] you might expect any car to be and you know the whole car is not even fit it out the safety belts\nSo how then because these people they wanted to drink they do the right thing you hire a car and they go to go do the right thing no matter how are you do it\nAnd now they're dead\nThey did the right thing company did\nChristian wonderful yep Kris Murray I don't try Chris what's up yeah that's terrible thing that happened back it was about is that just a key bothers me yeah of course\nBut recently I think the president was talking about returning to stop and frisk [laughter]\n[noise]\nYeah I I you know how I feel all that\nI think that's nonsense I complete nonsense I write the husband he speaks the other day about the rule of law as people have to be presumed innocent\nExcept what he wants to not to be presumed innocent then you can go and search people without ... without clothes of course yeah so that they were the two brewers two presumed innocent there\nWas some people have a different color skin because of the fact that they may be poor small but Charles or kids that's absurd right I I just didn't realize how absurd he sounds\n[laughter] that's sixty four dollar question\nYou know the funny thing about it is I I Try to remain non political issues are very important legal issues that has to be addressed\nWell let's just say that as far as I think on the um local level on a local level that um\nComplete nonsense I write it hasn't he speaks the other day about the rule of law as people have to be presumed innocent\n... except when he wants to not to be presumed innocent then you can go and search people without ... without probable cause yeah so that the Buddhist to ruin the presumed innocent there\nWas people have a different color skin because of the fact that they may be poor small but Charles or kids that's absurd right I I just didn't realize how absurd he sounds\n[laughter] that's sixty four dollar question\nYou know the funny thing about it as I I Try to remain non political issues are very important legal issues they ask me address\nWell let's just to take a little bit further [noise] do you think on the um local level on the local level that I'm\nThat guy you know it's it's in any way too long the local level like you know for law enforcement [noise] yeah I don't know what you say [noise] well I Know that works for local police still engaged in this long\nThese engaged to stop and frisk yeah stop before slim held that if the illegal now you have a federal court as hell I'll tell this I mean I'm Bob taking exception to what the the people's court has ruled in favor of the person's being searched\nBut now we have a ... the president wants to disregard legal action and do it the way he wants it that's the problem I have been able to we have a nation of laws all we do not have a nation that may have to follow the laws and no matter how we like it or not\nOr we go to a totalitarian state\nYou can't run the country by whim\nI well\nYou know in other words I I'm trying to get to a point about the federal government and always to act the federal government let's say like in Chicago which so at the crime rate was so you know the extent that they had a convenient you know and ah what should I and I and I think in New York where the federal government\nGot together with local police or\nTo uh you know improve or slow spent the recall that\nWell did they did they did they did do that they do get together with the police ... if you are familiar with the\nUh gangs ... existed in the projects the New York city police department Sean O'Malley was one of the cops right I got involved with the ... the southern district of New York and they really put the gang they had a gangs or a cruel people fighting the gangs\nAnd it's an eye on one gang after another and flipping them

Saturday I own a host the international conference on Thomas Paine studies\nI sit down with Dr ... to explain why ... or pains work is so relevant almost three hundred years later\nThe interview for Thomas Paine study or the TPS for short is hosting I think to the support of the gardener foundation and the odd Johnson educational trust 'em pointed out and called revolutionary text and the digital age Thomas pains publishing network past and present\nAnd this is the third international conference on Thomas Paine studying I own had previously hosted them in years past price for twice the third\nAnd this one that we've gone the federally different direction so building on that foundation of those first two events which is very exciting which we're focused largely on Thomas Paine life like the man himself and his writing and his personal experiences\nThis event is looking at Thomas Paine and his world\nThomas pain in the context of the American revolution the age of revolutions

know the way we consume media how did how did people consume you needed two hundred years ago in America so\nPamphlets newspapers maps um orally for conversation the old maid late Eighteen century really cutting moment is printing technology with changing and more and more people in America had access to printing presses so they were running off pamphlets which were usually short\nRelatively inexpensive to produce\nThere was one Christian brother that knew me socially and academically his name his brother Jason Ford who now is a part of the admissions staff here at I own a college\nAnd he you know one after they came I met with him and I started to have the conversation with him of you know where am I going to be after the four years of high school\nUm and again he knew me socially and academically and he he felt that I Would be a great fit for ... and taking that leap of faith of stepping out of my comfort zone leaving my my family abuse probably everyone down there and kind of giving New Yorkers shot\nHow difficult was that\nYou know you're young you're Eighteen and here you are you're leaving your family to come rely on a you have no idea what to expect other and you know you visited the school um but again you have is it you're not comfortable with the surroundings you don't know the area how how does one go through the\n... you know it's it's an interesting question because during my sophomore year of high school I knew that I wanted to leave Miami did I Know I Want to do it to be I own or New York no uh but with my current situation of me constantly pushing\nTo be something else and to be different I knew I needed to leave Miami and my comfort zone\nSo when I first came on a college I think the biggest difference was uh the demographic so when you're in Miami ... predominantly Hispanic or speaking Spanish is a quote speak English in the United states everyone down their hand in hand\nAnd here up in New York you know you have different backgrounds and people that have been raised differently than you especially coming from South Florida where the weather year round it's sunny and ... you know the introduction into the four seasons that was

to leave Miami did I Know I Want to do it to be I own or New York no uh but with my current situation of me constantly pushing to be something else and to be different I knew I needed to leave Miami and my comfort zone\nSo when I first came on to college I think the biggest difference was uh the demographic so when you're in Miami ... predominantly Hispanic or speaking Spanish is a quote speak English in the United states everyone down there you know hand in hand\nAnd here up in New York you know you have different backgrounds and people that have been raised differently than you especially coming from South Florida where the weather year round it's sunny and ... you know the introduction into the four seasons that was definitely different for me and the biggest thing that really touching my own ability if I Want it to be in New York was the winter\nOf but wholeheartedly everything that I didn't when I came here um it was the intention of getting out of my comfort zone and surrounding myself with people that I would've never thought I Would meet and most importantly taking advantage of opportunities I wouldn't have down in Miami a wall attending school in New York\nNow you were a big management a major correct what inspired you to be a business management major did you go into I own a already having that idea and knowing I Want to go into business\nGreat question so when I came into I own a I had no idea what I wanted to do and I think this is important that kids are sorry would have an essay kids I mean undergraduate I mean kids are children that are now in high school is trying to go to college\nThat one it's okay to not know what you want to do I entered college with no idea but to it's taking that action if you know that\nThat point entering school you're not certain of what you want to major in that to take action and by taking action you try different things so throughout my four year period name it and I tried it and I did it in business I knew I wanted to be business but I didn't know the major\nSo my freshman year I had an internship\nI'm Down in Miami, Florida was in the accounting internship I did it throughout the summer simultaneously working retail um you know the truth be told that I did the accounting into ... at that point I knew I wanted nothing to do is counting all doing the retail job aside from making the money because my county internship was free\nUm I knew at that point that it looked people so the management side in marketing we're kind of on the horizon there but I still wasn't sure my sophomore year I was fortunate enough to work on my girlfriend's father's car dealership\nThere I got to see the ins and outs of finance and kind of what runs a business you know they were very open with me and I was able to you know run around and see different things um at that point looking at numbers they didn't really attract me either\nI'm Sorry you know I I write off the rip the first two years I removed finance and accounting firm my idea and then really what pushed it all was my junior year that summer I had a marketing internship with gay parade or this marketing to ship required me to take pictures and videos are presenting it to the mark or the gator a board and\nThat point that was when I was given a camera during that time and you know the the rest of the kind of history which I Know touch on\nYou and you mentioned taking action right which is key to really developing and finding out what you want to do yes which with your life right and you mentioned all those great opportunity outside of I own a right what about the opportunity at I own a lot of help you get to where you are today\nSo I own a college you know\nIt's so interesting because our our school so small so it being so small you would think there's less opportunities and coming into school there's so many opportunities to choose from that I was overwhelmed\nAnd I think at that point it was saying you know what fits best for me uh me not knowing I signed up for everything that that involvement fair is so key during her freshman year where you're able to see what opportunities you\nUh the gator a board and\nThat point that was when I was given a camera during that time and you know the the rest of the kind of history which I Know touch on yeah and you mentioned\nTaking action right which is key to really developing and finding out what you want to do yes which with your life right and you mentioned all those great opportunity outside of eye on them right what about the opportunity at I own a lot of help you get to where you are today\nYes so I own a college you know\nIt's so interesting because our our school so small so it being so small you would think there's less opportunities and coming into school there's so many opportunities to choose from that I was overwhelmed\nAnd I think at that point it was saying you know what it's best for me uh me not knowing I signed up for everything that that involvement fair is so key during her freshman year\nWhere you're able to see what opportunities you have and then you make the decision of what do I want to take action with and what I Want to try a that year for the next four years of during the involvement I signed up for everything I ... and I did it honestly from Red Cross to uh doing soup kitchen with I own admission\nTo being a part of the newspaper I tried that for a semester\nUm\nYeah you know the the off the top of my head I can't even tell you but I'm the clubs and activities that it gave me being a part of Greek life I Can't forget that that was a huge\nRole and and and it played such a big deal and uh who I Am today and what it was able to do for me a while as an undergraduate I own a Roger Rojas class\nOf twenty ... joins me here on WBAL lacks\nNow you mentioned all the opportunity outside of my own ... inside of I own a white\nPrepared you how did you prepare yourself to get internships to get more opportunity\nSo one of the great a resource that we have on campus is the ... development and the creative element of prepared me not only prepared my resume but they prepare me for interviews\nAnd they they were so great I had set up an appointment I had called her I Believe I walked in and I had set up an appointment and they they're they're waiting for me open hands with booklet and different things that I should know and be aware of while walking into an interview\nAnd I think that that's something that really for me is what separates I own a from a lot of other schools is that their attention to the students is very rare\nThat now more than ever I think students you know they they care and they understand that one if they're going to come to college and pay the money that they are going to pay that they want to be service and they understand that the the future this is only four years and you know four years in your view of how you want I think very short\nUm and that's opportunities that you have while you're here and I own a college does that with their creative element of showing hey you know we care about you now and we care about your future and we're willing to prepare you and set you off when you graduate that you have the right resources to go on to the real world and find a job and succeed in your field\nHow often did you uh lean on career development to help point you into the right direction or tweak and improve your resume cover letter\nYet so I had gone to or something else that I did throughout my four years because you know I you know leaving Miami was a big deal I'm One of five I'm I'm the forced out of the five and I was the first one to leave a quote unquote leave the nest her home right\nAnd I knew that I needed to do the more to not only succeed in New York but to be to show my family that you know I'm taking advantage of my opportunity here in New York\nSo right off the bat in my freshman year they hosting dinners a workshop dinners I don't know the term that they may call it now but they would have alumni come in or speak on a panel and they would serve dinner\nUm I started doing that right off from my freshman year um and that's when I was in Korea development where these people afterwards would hang around and they would accept resumes I didn't have a resume at the time and creative element was there waiting in the corners\nOn career development to help point you into the right direction or tweak and improve your resume cover letter\nYet so I had gone to or something else that I did throughout my four years because you know I you know leaving Miami was a big deal I'm One of five I'm I'm the forced out of the five and I was the first one to leave a quote unquote leave the nest or home right\nAnd I knew that I needed to do the more to not only succeed in New York but to be to show my family that you know I'm taking advantage of my opportunity here in New York\nSo right off the bat in my freshman year they hosted dinners a workshop dinners I don't know the term that they may call it now but they would have alumni coming or speak on a panel and they would serve dinner\nUm I started doing that right off from my freshman year um and that's when I was in groups occur development where these people afterwards would hang around and they would accept resumes I didn't have a resume at the time and ... it was there waiting in the corner and saying hey for anyone that need to get or need to work on it we're here to help you\nUh during those first two years that I own a ... I went in the handful times but my junior and especially in my senior year I was at least every other week and if not if I wasn't president I was emailing had occurred development\nHow important is it to network and and take advantage of all those opportunity to meet industry professionals great question\nNow I talk about uh you know I I I referred to action um and then with action I Believe something under that is networking\nA networking you know you could go to an event and taking their information but I think the true power of networking is when you attend a place where you have similar liking of what you're trying to do it what you're trying to accomplish and you meet these people and take that next step of speaking to him after the conference and seeing how you can get involved with their business\nAnd ... when it comes to networking I think another vital thing to understand is that when you meet someone is that you never know the relationship that it could take you and how long are work and go with that point of bringing that up I think a huge networking a moment that happened to me I own a college was during my junior year each or was it my junior\n... I Believe no yeah it was if it wasn't my ... I Believe it was my sophomore shrinks semesters fall junior or had met my best friend Frankie during a modern dance class now you know he may laugh at this moment because you know you never think that a class you know me majoring in business that modern dance how would that influence my future\nA little did I Know that relationship would for four go where I Am now and kind of helped me in pushing me to what I'm doing today through that one person that I met\nWith what advice would you give students in terms of overcoming that fear of attending these networking event and going up to someone and ask gang and just having a conversation\nRay you need to be yourself um you know no one is you and you you need to be authentic and when you meet these people I think it's important to have kind of a baseline of introduce yourself and now as they say the elevator pitch a but simultaneously understanding that you can't be something that you're not\nAnd once you once you start to do that people do that\nAnd that if you truly want something it's understanding the person you're speaking to and how you should be speaking to them so contacts from going into a networking Yvette I'm a business management major and I know gator it's going to be there\nIt'd be something that you're not and once you once you start to do that people do that\nAnd that if you truly want something it's understanding the person you're speaking to and how you should be speaking to them so contacts from going into a networking Yvette I'm a business management major and I know gator it's going to be there\nUm and they were happy to see him convicted of a crime that were committed about the same amount of years ago as what you know Kavanaugh is being accused of right\nSo we can't really have it both ways that can't be something that we criticize when it happens in the political forum but when it happens and you know pop culture and two celebrities we'd say okay it's fine you know doesn't matter how long it's been\nSo I think women wait to come forward for different reasons and most of the time it's because they know that as accusers they're going to be victimized again by the public and you know by the media in some cases and by the supporters of you know whoever they're accusing\nYou know it's funny as a society we we sent to different messages for a woman that they claim they were sexually assaulted you look you know I Know capital you look at Bill Cosby look throughout the years recently with with me too movement hearken back to to Kobe Bryant [noise]\nThat I and I remember on ESPN the anchor Stuart Scott said\nYou know basically Kobe's legs were wearing from sitting in a courtroom all day and it it was very bizarre that all of a sudden Kobe Bryant got ... street cred right for doing something like this because there's a good boy and I think the sinus and a different message with stuff like this\nOh absolutely you know it's it's great that you mentioned sports because you know this topic has been happening forever right and we've seen it\nIn many different iterations and then a lot of cases we've seen this with African athlete being accused of sexual harassment sexual assaults and rape\nUm and in a lot of those cases I Would say the majority of them\nBe accused of we're just then destroyed you know we looked at the way they dress and you know why was she getting into a limousine with him you know after a game and all of these questions that really don't matter because in the end no one should be altered or victimize\nUm so yeah there are absolutely mixed messages we criticize them we flood shame and we call names when we look at women and they dress a certain way and you know we say their gold digger than they are looking for it [noise]\nUm and then we say well why didn't that person come out sooner well that's why who wants to be destroyed publicly in that way when\nYou know honestly you're just kind of looking for a justice for something that was done to you\nAs a female working in the media when you see someone like Donald Trump mock a victim\nHow do you how do you stay neutral\nThe accused and we're just then destroyed you know we looked at the way they dress to and you know why was she getting into a limousine with him you know after a game and all of these questions that really don't matter because in the end no one should be salted or victimize\nUm so yeah they are absolutely mixed messages we criticize them we slut shaming we call names when we look at women and they dress a certain way and you know we say their gold digger than they are looking for it\nUm and then we say well why didn't that person come out sooner well that's why who wants to be destroyed publicly in that way when\nYou know honestly you're just kind of looking for a justice for something that was done to you\nAs a female working in the media when you see someone like Donald Trump mock a victim\nHow do you how do you stay neutral [noise]\nYeah [laughter]\nIt's gotta be tough that's a great question [noise] um you know it's beyond tough it's tough I understand that that's the part of the job and I guess you know for me I just look at\nWhat he's doing you know in how disgraceful it really is and and then that that makes me feel that it's even more important to you know stay neutral remain composed and deal with reality and deal with facts because\nUm you know you see what the opposite of that looks like and unfortunately we see that in our president right now\nI'm you know but it but it's hard because you're you're looking at just behavior that's not only on becoming of a president but I'm becoming of anyone who is\nYou know to actually make fun of someone that was victimized um you know and and for a crowd to be laughing at it as a business you know stand up comedy is is unfortunate but I think for me I focus on what I Know to be fact and\nUm you know kind of just approach any story from that perspective\nI think it just ... if you think back forty fifty years ago it was okay for the husband to strike his wife to keep her in place right\nYou know I think we've addressed that it's not okay right and but I I just think that we're as a society we're going back even before the sixties racially and then how we um you know how we treat women and it's just sending it a terrible example what kind of conversation do you have with your friends about stuff\nYeah it's it's interesting because as we have a lot of conversations about exactly what you mentioned this kind of a reversal of time\nUm you know and it's unfortunate but they're also there are a couple of perspective on it so you know as a woman and as a woman of color in a lot of ways\nYou know I've seen a lot of this throughout you know so I feel like it a lot of ways it's only that it's become more public it's in the spotlight more because um I Believe people feel more emboldened to to show what they've been feeling and suppressing all along\nOkay a very serious conversation with professor ... caused me to department of mess creation coming up the sports sit down but first Joe Louis you as a sports

okay but your whole dollar last week that the Yankees were going to lose I said the release of the twins but I\nDidn't have much faith in the scene going forward and unfortunately I was right they went down like a bunch of went to the Boston Red Sox\nUh fortunately well I mean I mean let let's let's let's back up to the wild card game\nThey look great against the Oakland A's they pilots that relief pitcher doubt even starting they lose interest they lost to race in a relief pitcher okay well it's the old when aids they pitch it they picked an Australian pitcher that had been won the game and it's you know he's in it and it's you know major league career\nThen you look at the rest of the number they ... they should all one game one they win game too but it's not really a great when you look at it they had a lotta times are they are pressing up\nAnd it it seems like the game could have slipped away from them at any moment\nYou know it and then I mean there's so many people on the list would there well the one for Eighteen and\nNo conversion trying to get that runner's heritage\nFor for twenty six runners in scoring position one fifty four average you know what the Red Sox were they better for hundreds one of the scoring position how 'bout you get a guy that he had to face it with runners describing visited instead of getting you can call us down striking out\nCarlos ... the big homerun hitter you can't you can't you can't rely on him from shut them on the ... the people I'm surprised about the gallon do are like labor tore it those are the guys I was surprised about that because the rookies Joe\nAnd one of the game and it's you know season ... and it's you know major league career then you look at the rest of the numbers they should a law they should have one game one they win game too but it's not really a great when you look at it they had a lot of times are they are pressing up and it it seems like the game could have slipped away from them at any moment\nYou know and then I mean there's so many people on the flip through it there's the one for Eighteen and\nYou know conversion trying to get that runner's heritage\nFor for twenty six runners the scoring

I'm not I was reading reading hardy oh okay well I'm Glad to but I'm going to ask but I'm going to ask you this the New York times comes out with this incredible report I heard one report that they had an extra ... to the times\nTo cover the major report\nHow many people are going to read it number one as what are the take away from it and the interpretations have been very different\nThe White House was so scared about it that they had to come out and say you know it's not true and respond to it that way and then the people who love\nExcept do we not all sit here and marvel at the store is now I'm going to take a contrary view [laughter]\nAlmost inviting I wanted I wanted to tell you the object is oh okay so here's the deal would take it up by the way it's where you guys heard people\nWho are Gulf yes so you know I'm a golfer after college on a I was raised reading already oh okay well I'm going to but I'm going to ask but I'm going to ask you this the New York times comes out with this incredible report I heard one report that they had to add extra ... to the times\nTo cover the major report\nHow many people are going to read it number one as what are the takeaways from it and the interpretations have been very different\nThe White House was so scared about it that they had to come out and say you know it's not true and respond to it that way and then the people who love the Trump White house who said well they all do it so it's okay [laughter] you know it was okay they're all doing\nTo me that take away was hey I don't cheat on my taxes and if I needed somebody will be knocking on my door and saying let me or to you and here's the president in the United states is getting away with it that out of this and tired courage it huge excellent\nProbably Pulitzer winning approach is probably the only take away that I can walk away with\nWell I Walk away with the fact that lawlessness does not\nNegate a person getting elected to the highest office in the land or eventually perhaps the highest court clearly laws were broken tax laws in place the IRS appear to fail to do its job\nAnd I don't know if the people who should be reading this will be reading it but it seems that individuals who are concerned that they are paying too much in taxes\nWould wonder why they weren't afforded the same opportunity and the same breaks also the people who tended to vote 'em for the current president or the very people who then have their services caught and don't get that sort of\nGovernment help that they might need they do that because I Wonder about that every day I just\nGraduated my takeaway let's thank goodness for journalism I mean and for the New York times\nYou know small papers tend to say oh yeah well if it's New York times they can do these kinds of things but if you read it they did some hard digging and they also did some basic shoe leather journalism by you know knocking on doors repeatedly calling people getting to freedom of information request\nFor sales my lingering question now is you know how did they get those big boxes of tax returns from Fred Trump it's Neal how did they land a lot of the documents because they must have been difficult\nTo get [noise] yeah I was gonna say what you said I think it's just remarkable from a journalistic standpoint\nThis is the sort of thing that a New York times is almost uniquely capable of doing putting these three or four reporters giving them their own office they were the only ones that had the came to the office locking them away and and then doing this kind of reporting this astonishing to me an encouraging to me\nThat's one but one is the fact that Trump over the long haul has so prime the pump among his base to be sure\nTo not believe that the New York times to not believe what what is real factual journalism that there are people many people too many people who are shrug this off as just another job by the liberal media and\nThat's what he said he said this is another job not ahead try to document based digging in the wall fact based and double checked and tripled fact I'm not arguing so I Know I I think\nWe quoting the president of the United states who says it to his base which eighty seven percent or something like that women and men believe everything the guy says and he said\nI'm doing this kind of reporting this astonishing to me and encouraging to me\nThat's one but one day is the fact that Trump over the long haul has so prime the pump among his base to be sure\nTo not believe that the New York times to not believe what what is real factual journalism that there are people many people too many people who are shrug this off as just another job by the liberal media and\nThat's what he said he said this is another job not ahead try to document based digging and while fact based and double check and tripled fact I'm not arguing that I Know I I think they quoting the president of the United states who say that too in Spain which eighty seven percent or something like that\nWomen and men believe everything the guy says and he said\nAnother job and guess what Kevin they believe that you know I like the fact that they printed on one guy Saturn pages just chock full of information on it I'm like I had more of an impact on\nThe traditional big story like that would have been spread over several days\nYeah the thing that I felt a little bit about what the interactive pieces that they had I\nUm maybe it's just because I'm a reader but I was fascinated by the quality of the writing and I didn't really bother to look it up a lot of the interactive that they had posted and defining direct and force that would be they had an interactive map where you can zoom in and see where the audience where the tape or talking about they had some videos\nAgain from my perspective I Want to take ... and actually read the words\nWell if you listen to this program on Sunday night\nA six to a TV set at nine thirty on Showtime there is going to be a documentary\nAbout this whole story and the process parents ethically one of the producers of the Kingston native but a very important that it is very important to kings donated but if you're already watching the circus on Showtime which many of us do this is on right after it tonight I thought they had the officers around [laughter]\nLet's go to a little bit more pleasant or perhaps hopeful news or perhaps not and that's the increasing reliance on growth of non profit news sites in the light of what is going on in our industry which has been largely negative financially that New York times investigative story not withstanding\nThere is a according to the Institute for non profit news estimated revenues of between three hundred and twenty five to three hundred and fifty million dollars has been generated by non profit news sites\nAnd that upwards of three thousand people have been employed by the sights twenty two hundred of of whom are journalists and that also comes on the heels of a profit making venture which would be the Philadelphia Inquirer Pittsburgh Post Gazette\nAnd something called the L and the media group which has announced that they're working together to cover the state Capitol in Pennsylvania fluent exactly\nAbout that cooperation if you remember people doing things that would have been unimaginable before I wanted to ask you a question is somebody who is a publisher and editor\nAnd know that stuff backwards and forwards and that is how bad it ... in the commercial press in other words we know they're making less money than they did we know they're firing a lot of people when I Want to know and I think all Americans want to do is how much\nHow in danger is the commercial press are they in danger of going out of business in some cases they have but you know right here in Albany we had the all the time junior and we have other places and you know I Know there's a lot of senior the blues by these folks but how bad it\nThe short answer is it's bad I mean how bad it's very bad life in danger in fear that they are I think before you see a number of publications literally go out of business on the print side you're going to see an increasing number of daily newspapers to stick to them\nSomebody who is a publisher and editor\nAnd do this stuff backwards and forwards and that is how bad it bleed in the commercial press in other words we know they're making less money than they did we know they're firing a lot of people when I Want to know and I think all Americans want to do is how much\nHow in danger is the commercial press are they in danger of going out of business in some cases they have but you know right here in Albany we had the Albany Times Union and the other places and you know I Know there's a lot of seeing the blues by these folks but how bad it\nWell the short answer is it's bad I mean how bad it's very bad life in danger ink used to do I think before you see a number of publications literally go out of business on the inside you're going to see an increasing number of daily newspapers to stick the number of days they print\nOkay so back to your original question but do you think that if you're the publisher let's say you're the publisher of a local paper maybe it's time to maybe some connectivity pay which used to work and you look and you see WAMC for example last year is approaching\nFour million dollars in on your writing on the things you do get sick to the stomach these take hey maybe that was the money that used to be mine can you get angry\nAs a former publisher and then it's not just WAMC it's all of the other print and broadcast competitors that have sprung up and the last ten or Fifteen Years taking a bite of the pie that we use to control them if you did a pie chart in in my market a relatively small market in the old days when I started in the in the seventies\nYou could look at that pie chart and see the size of a piece of pie but it's pretty much all of it would be daily Freeman advertising revenue and then there would be this one little slights that went to the local radio station [noise]\nWell that's slice of the pie has changed dramatically I don't have the most recent numbers but I dare say that the daily newspaper which used to get Ninety percent is now getting less than fifty percent\nSays you know we're the editor of the Schenectady paper major paper in our area certainly your ear to the ground with the grumbling wisdom happiness or the other guys are getting\nSo I think there's always been competition and underwriting at WAMC I Know they call it Andrea and by the sound like ads to me I Know now that things are not [laughter]\nBut they are they just have some restrictions that that's always fun to cater to people that are scooping up or reading most of the pie or Facebook and Google that's really the problem I mean that's the competition and the local market has always been there you just have to make the case\nI think as you get this convergence of media brand newspapers are traditional mania offer audio where patients that ain't the offer ... on line\nAnd when you get the convenience you're going to see more of the competition for the local dollars\nI tend to disagree a little bit with Ira about how bad it is for print media and not to stick to the small local community newspapers will\nWill continue to survive and perhaps even thrive coming to a reckoning about how they spend their money that you know I was going to say that the based on what Judy I mean after all they're firing a lot of their borders now there's still a lot of money coming in through subscriptions and you know I look at this story about the local non profit news sites generating\nTo a reckoning about how they spend their money that's all I was going to say that but based on what Judy I mean after all they're firing a lot of their borders you know there's still a lot of money coming in through subscriptions and you know I look at this story about the ... states generating\nWhich can block you from reaching your troops potential and keep you backwards while the rest of the world continues to move forward\nHere's a bail when I was young I remember that raised a story with my father\nI think I was in grade six or seven yeah this is a long time ago I'd been not remember I sat there which grade but I was younger and I came from school and I had at ... yeah and that was happy okay because before I\nHad the hours of the study and I had been ... and I was happy and I came I was so happy and I rushed to my dad\nAnd I told him that I got beat you know what happened what happened to my dad or look at me he smiled and he did not it did not release this word I was expecting this word eighth ...\nIt did not say congratulations and that was way to do war day that he would lead this word to me only ... on it did not\nKnow what happened what happened to me I felt like maybe I did not do what what was expected from me by my dad you know what happened what happened I decided to work harder and I'm telling you I start to work\nAnd work and work I studied at night and what happened next semester I got a minus when I got a mind that's my dies this time when you look at me he said San atone ... glued job\nAnd he told me down if I did not I'm not too late to the last time it because I did not long she looked to be satisfied wave that be because the ones who are satisfied way that the it was not try to get to a\nBecause eh man we satisfy we they shut down to ever win not fight your goal Hi\nMe profit assignment yes now and thank you for your story because I think that is something people really an absolutely all of our listeners need to here and understand now isn't gentleman if you are listening to me\nAnd that's when I got a mountainous my died this time when you look at me he said San atone ... glued shot\nAnd he told me down if I did not come back to relate to the last time it because I did not long she looked to be satisfied wave that be because one was that this fight way that the it was not try to get to a\nBecause eh man we satisfy we they shut down to ever win not fight your goal I excuse\nMe profit if I may yes now and thank you for your story because I think that is something people really an absolutely all of our listeners need to here and understand now\nLadies and gentlemen if you are listening to me right now I I Want you to picture something in your mind I Want you to picture the world without ambition\nI Want you to picture of the world without incentives because I'm willing to bet that a lot of you are listening to me today and ... and thinking you know bill I don't really get what you're saying because my only drive is to be happy to be right where I wanted to be to have everything that I ever wanted and that\nThen and only then am I going to be happy just being a right where I've always wanted to be I have my I don't know God Forbid you your car\nAnd your kids and whatever it is that you think is going to keep you satisfied and that's going to be enough for you\nBut now I'm asking you to picture once the world would be like\nWithout ambition without without a drive for more now I'm willing to bet that there would be no America\nThat the world would be in a very primitive state because rather than keep moving forward rather than pushing toward something better or rather than wanting to be better than we are\nNow we would have decided that where we are is the most that humanity can every evolve we would have decided that right where we are is where we should be\nAnd things would be dire today\nBut something something as deep and and passionate\nAs the American dream is built on the foundation that one day people came from everywhere from all across the world to this land a promise a land slowing with milk and honey and decided that they wanted more\nBe like just watch something on the top of what you say absolutely they came from France they can find anger they came from across Europe\nAt that time of year up once they've been able to replace it is today yes but I Will tell us just a big field plantations ...\nThere were a there was nothing\nAnd you hit on force field yours are very advantaged see if any of the nation\nBut you cannot watch what happens does speed bumps out when you want more than chess why we have now\nThat's why they ...

time for a very important part of our show effect is one of the first uh\nSegments my head is actually the second sex but because the first segment was so sports all the time all day which was I was growing up\nIn Brooklyn all sports all the time and a\nSpotlight entertainment is now the number one spot\nEven take it all from what you get more time than sports stars and we get it over sports to our\nSports especially the young man in his twenties comes to sports expert and they believe in telling you about how ... how I met him many many years ago\nWilling to Willa\nOf politics um anger\nDirected by Thailand most so\nIt is having its world premiere\nAt the hear art center from October fifth through the twentieth\nI must tell you that I was clutching on to the\nSide of my chair for the entire performance thought that was why\nI liked the way it's set up when you walk in it's a rather small theatre and there are several screens and honors queens clips from the from the Nineteen fifties um I did not recognize many of the planes but I recognized some of the actors from that time\nSo it's sort of set the mood and then when the light went on stage you saw the old rounded refrigerator and Leno Liam flooring and the four legged tables and no counters anyway\nThe doorbell rings and in walks three FBI man and this is the story of the possibility of an assassination of the president of the United states\nFor that was why\nI like the way it's set up when you walk in it's a rather small theatre and there are several screens and on the screens there clips from old movies from the Nineteen fifties um I did not recognize many of the planes but I recognized some of the actors from that time\nSo it's sort of set the mood and then when the lights went on stage you saw the old rounded refrigerator and ... flooring and the four legged tables and no town just anyway\nThe doorbell rings and in walks three FBI man and this is the story of the possibility of an assassination of the president of the United states the possibility that he would be passing through their little town was whether we moved\nUp the house happens to be in a spot where\nEverything in the inhabitants lives very quickly changes [noise]\nWhat things that I thought about as I watched the show was the reality of the fact that it was set back in the fifties\nAnd how much we live in a world that incentive today also around violence [noise]\nIn that day of course some of the communication was very different than the communication that we have now a days\nBut it was a very stirring moment when the ... hit that perhaps in an instance the politics the leadership of our country could change in an instant\nIt was done extremely well\nI thought that even though it was like type cast for the fifties that it was really very valid relevant to today\nAnd the ... in today's world as much as it was a threat back then I'd like to give a shout out to one of the actor's name is Henry Finn bury\nAny place that's very\nGrave Peter rich Benson the third who's the youngest member of the cast and the sun and the cast of the very brave grandfather and\nHis mother so it's a it's a really interesting show I Would highly recommend that you'd see suddenly at the light source the at a group at the world from here at the IRS heart center makes you think you walk out and you are thinking [noise]\nSuddenly was really very special and\nA lot of things are expected\nWhat second place was that obvious from that from the start\nVery a middle class families\nWill bear floors would that would be the same after what happened to them\nUh [noise] it makes you think that uh [noise] something that that could happen in America\nThat happen anywhere in the world which crazy people out there and the people who were\nWell I'm not going to give it don't give it away but but I I think the relevance of of a show like suddenly is that although this was a time piece and it was we were an adapted 'em to relevance is\nTerrorists are fright and the um [noise]\nSecond place was that obvious from the from the start\nVery a middle class families\nWill bear flies would that would be the same after what happened in Salt lake to them\nUh [noise] it makes you think that uh [noise] something that that could happen in America\nCould happen anywhere in the world which crazy people out there and it's the people who were\nI'm not going to give it don't give it away but but I I think the relevance of of a show like suddenly is that although this was a time peas and it was we were an adapted 'em to relevance is\nTerrorists are fright and the um [noise]\nBoom is of some people too and and certain things in a way that is very harsh\nAnd I think it was very very well done um I really felt as I said I was flipping the side of my chair because I thought they handle the situation extremely well\nIt was excellent [noise]\nI Would like to give a shout out to a very special place that I'd love to eat at [noise]\nIt's actually called lucky strike and it's at fifty grand street and so how lucky strike I don't know if it was always a restaurant but when you walk and you feel like you're stepping back in time\nI don't know what the forties and fifties for like but I kind of feel that must be from that era I'm wouldn't floors old tin ceilings kinda narrow\nUm food is excellent by the way long barge working very wouldn't need the dark and dark and you walk to the back and one thing that strikes you immediately is along the wall\nThere's what looks like a class mirror that goes from one end of the restaurant in the back to the other end and it has the day's\nMenu on it um and it looks like it's written in crayon that can easily be ways to what changed or we moved out of course you get men used to but I like to see what they have on that 'cause it's always something interesting and good\nIt's a very interesting place that everyone is so\nSo friendly in fact so we're also might want to give a shout out to another restaurant it's\nA it's called mama New Year's was forty fourth and mama is or where they're keeping an eye on her daughter runs the operation gone to the corner of ... avenue and forty fourth\nStraight I think ... also likes to keep an eye on what everyone's eating she constantly check seat Jeff enough and how best to try an accent and is it good and it's at the way you want it it's a fun place to go because it's always lovely things going on [noise] the last few times we've gone we've set very close to mom who just can't wait to chat\nAnd the food is really delicious but again I Believe it's one of the oldest Italian restaurants in New York City and it has that flour and that feeling of really good northern Italian food delicious\nWhile we're talking I Want to talk about another show that I called be more chill [noise] ... well\n[noise] the more chill is that the ... square signature center [noise] and it's a very interesting thought what if you thought you were really wheel\nMay be found out through somebody else that you really want\nTo go because there's always lovely things going on the last few times we've gone we've set very close to my mom who just can't wait to chat\nAnd the food is really delicious but again I Believe it's one of the oldest Italian restaurants in New York City and it has that flaring that feeling of really good northern Italian food delicious [noise]\nWhile we're talking I Want to talk about another show that I called be more chill [noise] ... well\nThe more chill is that the ... square signature center [noise] and it's an interesting thought what if you thought you were really wheel\nAnd you may be found out through somebody else that you really weren't really meal but\nMaybe when you found out you are really really when you were in the imagination or somebody else who makes you feel\nAnd then he fell in love you made friends but you couldn't think of anything that would be in your life such as a mother or father\nOr a place to be or\nPlanners of what you're going to do in your future [noise] very interesting premise because it long time to realize that the main tactics and be what shall\nWe only worry we'll they did real thing they ain't they talk they laugh they dance they talked about what they were wearing ... tiny town\nThat they really want\nWe'll be more chill is that the parsing square signature theater um it's directed by Steven bracket\nAnd it was quite interesting show to say I would highly recommend it [noise]\nIt was really something very different and\nVery special and we actually tried to talk about\nThe special productions that we see there are so many productions and some of them are\nSome of them are just not something I Do want to talk about on the radio we don't want to be insulting we know the people try very hard and if it's a form but if if if we're going to critical no one's going to want to go out and said it and then they're going to feel that we set up to see a show and they spent their money and that they didn't enjoy it\nSo we try to speak about\nProduction was on the air [noise] ah there's a difference between that and\nBroadway shows when my review them around here man it's not just talking about a show and we will be two names of news so actually after we get back from a [noise]\n... when I can tell you where are we talking about restaurants so don't tell them a payment outside of New York\nThere might be some a nice place for an adult listeners to\nOwner just apologized with David will ensure a who was involved with the open gates which has a a\nA production that's related to a [noise] a shooting at them and uh I think all of those who want to hear about those for science I'm hoping was just a bad connection that I guess never got through to the studio so we'll try to get there will logistic\nTalking about restaurants and hotels and uh entertainment outside of New York\nUh they might be some a nice place for many of our listeners to\nI Want to just apologized David will ensure a who was involved with the open gates which has a a\nA production that's related to a a shooting at them and uh I think the

a new thing but maybe they found in two thousand one\nBut with with the Knicks being part of us now and then having stood maybe it brings more attention to it I'm like it that you are Joyce so\nBecause I really couldn't figure it out when they when they don't understand is\nApparently he was the only one that was retained\nAnd the others were on like going to see them more from here to go to the next next or is this well\nThey might very well be that because you know there's this other stuff that as much as ... percent who have been in the elite are actually I'm On the season Oscar by the end of the year by the end of this year so it'll be interesting to see what happens now I hear a couple of the ...\nAnd then of course you've got a poor zinc is back in there\nAnd that also has a daughter of a new era with what the next ... will have to see what happens\nTo make a prediction how do you think the next senator this year\n[laughter] uh I I Want to say yeah I think we have some talent\nAnd I mean I don't know I I think the lead the back conference is totally changed its Oklahoma Brian James conference anymore [laughter] you got solidified players there every T don't expect to be a little more competitive I'm ... I Believe that with the raptors that changes\nThe leader but you see their coach got fired three days after you know being knocked out by the end is Portland um by the cavalier sorry\nFor your point is yeah the point is excellent either I think you got to hang around we're going to continue sports for another few minutes we have to uh give a a plug any message from border or maybe [noise]\n\n[noise]\n[noise] [laughter]\nWhat's up with a broad James conference anymore [laughter] you got the lid applied player there every cheap ... be a little more competitive I'm ...

phase also at the same way I see the heater in Westbury used to be called the Westbury music there\n[noise]\n\nBy the way north will health will looking to get them as wonderful as much as it's one of the largest uh health facilities uh\nI guess in the northeast the United states they have these sports about sixty three thousand five hundred employees so it's it's been a pretty decent size and a\nWhile I was just listening to this program you can go to a north well health facility so with that\nAlex so what else do you have those sports with regard to ah let's see we spoke about the NBA little basically was the uh the Knicks you spoke about the rangers but you know what you didn't speak about it you didn't need you did not speak out about Brooklyn\nYeah the closer than they are just uh-huh the closest to the Mike and so the nets are kind of like ... um [noise]\nI don't know I I have to be on the other more focus on the Yankees an ad and willing them through the play offs have basketball but\nAgain the letters seeming to be in just a um well I guess rebuilding stage I mean that was what feels like you're in you're out and and we'll have to see what happens I I have not followed them this closely lecture that um [noise]\nBut as it seems like when you bring up\nA blind or have you had a chance to go out and see any any entertainment recently and they work very hard to tell us about just the name of the radio station or that you work at\nI work at A M nine Seventy the answer it's a news talk political speech and so again that's aimed nine Seventy the answer and\nI don't know I I have to be on the other more focus on an ad and willing them through the playoffs have ... but\nAgain the letters seeming to be in just a um well I guess rebuilding stage I mean that's

to go out and see any any entertainment recently worked very hard to tell us about just all the name of the radio station or that you work at\nI work at A M nine suddenly the answer is a news talk political station so\nAgain that's am nine Seventy the answer and uh\nIt's more politics and that kind of where my focus was every day but that's a what I produce and produce loose talk\nSo it's been a [laughter] it's been quite a few weeks or talk about the play that much I'm sure you guys are with you I don't follow it as much as close as you ... recall on global politics pretty much just as close\nTo really segue into what I'm going to talk about next because I was for the and had the opportunity with stuck to dance to see a play that totally little thing\nThat totally allows me in the realm of politics and the realm of the good of man to leave a theater with nonstop talking because I needed to discuss the winning side the winning side it's a new play by James ...\nAlex thank you so much for sharing the sports segment with us the same thing and that was a perfect segue [noise] ah the winning side is a must see for everyone\nIs is probably one of the deepest thoughtful historical

another side he was\nA German rocket scientist and he was German rocket scientist during World War two and he worked out of Hitler [noise] part of the\nOn the part that troubled me in many ways was

passed away that some of the things that he did well being part of the Nazi Party and part of the army I'm actually came out but\nIn terms of the public it was never told he was highly respected his brilliance\nOne of the things that are long me and made me feel\nVery upset was that he had an ongoing love\nWith a young French woman she was a\nVery involved in\nBeing very angry was what was
