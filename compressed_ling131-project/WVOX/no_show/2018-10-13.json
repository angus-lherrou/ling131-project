be in a very primitive stage because rather than keep moving forward rather than\nPushing toward something better or rather than wanting to be better than we are now we would have decided that where we are is the most that humanity can every evolve we would have decided that right where we are is where we should be\nAnd things would be dire today\nBut something something as deep and and passionate\nAs the American dream is built on the foundation that on day people came from everywhere from all across the world to this land a promise a land flowing with milk and honey and decided that they wanted more just\nBe like just why aren't you a stocking up or what you say absolutely they came from France they can find they came from across Europe\nAt that time you know what they're

America\nAnd they built this nation yes they're when they're not satisfied with what they had in France they were not satisfy what would they are they named Len Len or they'd be able to fourth place we know that in the street but those people\nThose people came here they call themselves I\nI Want more than what I have to die and that's what made them your travel across the ocean\nAnd kick 'em to

D ourselves yes because\nWe're living now in an era in an era of crucial team because we are the product of people who decided that they were going to keep pushing forward\nMe as imagine that people never decided to keep pushing forward we probably wouldn't even be born today so we owe it to ourselves and we owe it to the human race we owed to America to keep pushing forward and tonight to never give up and then never\nEver think of ourselves as being satisfied because that is when we stopped moving forward and we start to go backwards\nAnd gentlemen I Want it in mind your day my name is ... ...\n...
