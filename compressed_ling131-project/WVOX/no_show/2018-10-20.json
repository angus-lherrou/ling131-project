world would be in a very primitive state because rather than keep moving forward rather than pushing toward something better or rather than wanting to be better than we are\nNow we would have decided that where we are is the most that humanity can ever evolve we would have decided that right where we are is where we should be\nAnd things would be dire today\nBut something something as deep and
