people seem to you know count every calorie deprive themselves and while\nA strict diet may work in the short term we find that clients keep returning over and over because they can sustain I'm a restrictive wave eating for very long\nSo my book um takes in a holistic approach so it takes into account your stress levels how you're relating to your food how you're relating to yourself up on a second relating\n... or so\nIt's a little more complicated than that maybe for women more than men but women have a very in my experience I don't want to generalize but I have a complicated relationship with food in terms of this is it bad food this is a good food I shouldn't eat this food\nI you know feel guilty for eating this food and\nUm the way that we relate to our food you know some women don't eat breakfast table all their calories you know I was good for breakfast I was good for lunch and then by the afternoon they're gorgeous themselves because they're starving I mean you know\nWhat what what levels to\nThink it's a desperate attempt to lose weight any way we can because that's what society expects from ...\nUp to the book is Marshall was skinny by joining barge telling them what about yourself what what brought you to write this book what is your background\nSo I Am a you know I was a psychotherapist and but I was also a junk\nFood eater and um you know growing up my relationship with food was just eat whatever you want basically and um I didn't have good habits at all I didn't have a weight problem but I didn't have good habits and what ended up happening was\nI got diagnosed with Celia disease in my mid thirties which is an auto immune condition where the body cannot process any gluten at all\n[noise] um so I had to avoid gluten and this was you know Fifteen Years ago when no one really heard of ... now everybody knows what Clinton is pretty much about Fifteen Years ago nobody knew\nOvernight it dramatically changed the way I ate I had to learn how to eat mindfully how to think about every single thing I put in my mouth and I realize how strong the mind body connection while absolutely\nI I just want her love people so overwhelmed by your book Marshall was skinny by Jordan ...\nTalking about change ah went through how to change it but you\nShoes and everybody seems to be twenty pounds for worse when we will walk with them again back how to keep from getting it back on your change that relationship [noise]\nIt's not by doing a restrictive diet it's by changing right like what you said changing your relationship by not\nPutting such a charge on every food\nHeard of ... now everybody knows what Clinton is pretty much but Fifteen Years ago nobody knew overnight it dramatically changed the way I ate I had to learn how to eat mindfully how to think about every single thing I put in my mouth and I realize how strong the mind body connection while I'm\nSo little we are just one remote people's overwhelmed by your book love skinny by Jordan ...\nTalking about change a wind through how would you change you know what you\nShoes and everybody seems to be twenty pounds for words will be willing to walk with them again back how to keep from getting back on your change that relationship [noise]\nWell it's not by doing a restrictive diet it's by changing right like what you said changing your relationship by not\nPutting such a charge on every food\nAnd eating things in mind fully not unconsciously putting things in your mouth what happens when we restrict we tend to over eat afterwards we're finished with the diet and now we can eat whatever it's it's really just a lifestyle change not a diet\nUm and this is very kind of common but the mindful eating component really tuning into your hunger accused paying attention to when you're hungry and when\nYour phone which is something we don't typically do anymore so it's getting back to the basics and just paying attention to what you're putting in your mouth and that can last\nAnd I'm saying I have no problem working out addressing that issue but not in six months nine sixty days if we can create a longer time frame that that can be worked out that much work it out I Do believe that there are great opportunities for memorial field to generate revenue and\nFor Mount Vernon an Westchester but the challenge becomes you know how can we just get the ball rolling get this thing going and and let's deal with this issue over time not in a short short short time for his it it'd be too catastrophic\nAngers Jeff to the old\nMay be some room for compromise here because we seem\nTo ... ... if an agreement can be made to conduct an investigation that is one had to do they do not hold people accountable\nBut even the bottom line is what what

that has to be worked out before you go outside with\nWell and that's why I'm On what a point right back to work where we agree we agree that more if it should be open we agree that there should be in

Jonathan ... who's a long shot at best a\nFor say control over trying to make a play to make some headlines and get some attention and\nThe irony of course is that day and twenty sixteen then attorney general Eric Schneiderman\nChallenged the operations and the state and it's so basically successfully because the governor and the legislature then moved to legalize FanDuel and a draft draft king and get a piece of the actions of the state is receiving revenues\nAre additional Iranian seems to me is that in the in your case in challenging the legality of this operation you were citing the New York\nNewark attorney general against the current attorney general who is arguing that shy or\nYes it put the current attorney general in an awkward position and the reason it put him in an awkward position was very simply that um that the current attorney general's predecessor\nHad argued very strenuously that daily fantasy sports violated the constitution then the legislature turns rather than passing a law purporting to allow it\nAnd now the the current attorney general is in the position of having to defend something that the previous attorney general attacked there so there was some definite inconsistencies\nIn the arguments that were put forward by the attorney by the attorney general Schneiderman and the different uh arguments put before the court the oil most polar opposites in contradictory but we're ... put forward now that to\nA bar brawl Underwood is the acting attorney general\nAnd that's our contradiction or those contradictions are noted by the acting Supreme Court justice Gerald Connelly where are you located\nPlay acting Supreme Court justice in Albany county\nThat will let me ask you this who are your clients\nHere who are the plaintiffs that you're representing that challenge that these Big M\nThere were operational women across the state who were\nBall purporting to allow it and now the the current attorney general is in the position of having to defend something that the previous attorney general attack there so there was some definite inconsistencies\nIn the arguments that were put forward by the attorney by attorney general Schneiderman and the different uh arguments but before the court the oil most polar opposites in contradictory but we're ... put forward now that to\nA bar brawl Underwood is the acting attorney general\nAnd that contradiction or those contradictions are noted by the acting Supreme Court justice Gerald Connelly where are you located\nPlay acting Supreme Court justice in Albany county\nWe'll let me ask you this who are your clients\nHere who are the plaintiffs that you're representing that challenge that these big ... operational\nWomen across the state or who were either directly involved in a problem gambling compulsive gambling or a media relatives of family members who are involved all of them had devastating losses as a result\nUh and uh some very difficult financial circumstances and tragedies in their lives that were the direct result of a gambling\nAnd there's a national gambling I rather anti gambling organization that's backing the loss into isn't that correct I stop\nStop predatory gambling has made a contribution to it I Would say a in all honesty Fred it's very minimal\nWhat is the who who backed that organization I mean is that a religiously affiliated organizations and why do they have always done it religiously\nAffiliated organization it's a national organization I don't know everything about it I Know the person who heads up we've been friends for a long time and he indicated there was a liquor store on the part of them\nUh to support this uh but I I can tell you that uh what it takes to to a prosecutor lawsuit like this is a lot more than what you get reimbursed for\nI'm sure I was gonna ask you though whether or not you're entitled or have you been seeking a damages are the plaintiffs entitled\nWhere we're not really seeking damages Fred what we're really seeking is just stop it [noise] um and and you know everybody talks about the alleged benefits of gambling but there's a lot of people that ignore the dark underside\nAnd there's a lot of people who've been victimized by gambling and these poor people\nAre really a kind of poster children for a what the problem is on the other side of the people don't want to recognize\nWell it's probably certain that the state will appeal the ruling I Can't imagine it they wouldn't have only test the law has the authority of the legislature and the governor so they say appeal it would be an immediate stay presumably to any a a whole thing of gambling going to be able to be continued is that when you expect\nAnd we're looking at that Fred whether or not the state is titled the automatic stay in the context of this is a little unclear were actually do a little research on that very question as we speak\nAnd have you gotten an indication from the stage yet on what\nThough that this virtually certain that they will appeal and you're saying\nYes I yeah I Would say it's probable are I Would never say absolutely certain but I Would say it's probable\nTo ask you about a distinction that I didn't understand I saw a story about your victory are you from the connect or writers in Rochester paper noted that while this ruling held that daily sports fantasy I'm\nWas unconstitutional that seasonal sports fans of the betting is permitted and has been for many years in New York do you are you familiar with that distinction and\nWould you expect and we're looking at that Fred whether or not the state is titled the automatic stay in the context of this is a little unclear were actually do a little research on that very question as we speak\nAnd have you gotten any indication from the

to\nAsk you about a distinction that I didn't understand I saw a story about your victory are you from the connect or writers in Rochester paper noted that while this ruling held that daily sports fantasy I'm\nWas unconstitutional that seasonal sports fans who said betting is permitted and has been for many years in New York you are you familiar with that distinction and who wasn't the explanation I think\nThe distinction without a difference the emphasis here was on daily fantasy sports\nBut the reality is there is no difference between daily fantasy sports and seasonal fantasy sports other than the late all the bad obviously something seasonal wrong it's different but you're still you're still betting on the performance of actual players\nIn actual sporting events all be it over a longer period of time\nAlready claimed that gets a distinction without a difference the story\nThat the distinction was that this longer term fantasy betting seasonal signs you're getting the has been permitted in New York wasn't challenges that accurate and if so why are they in either\nCase that it was not it was they allowed that to go but um be that as it may there was no real legislative authority for and it was only when daily fantasy sports started off with a caught the eye of the former attorney general Schneiderman\nAny prosecuted the case or she may have made the distinction in his own mind between seasonal a fancy sports a daily fantasy sports but the reality is that in both games the essence of the of\nThe activity is you're betting on the outcome of a sporting event\nYeah I guess the dailies a sense of the sport and really took off financially involving national sums of money much more than seasonal sports betting needs\nThat it needs the better because it's every day\nThis is a short as a claim made by David Boies is a pretty prominent lawyers representing draft came he called it already suggested that the ruling was a mixed ruling because of something you alluded to earlier\nThe judge held that the legislature and governor had the right to take this type of betting out of the felony gambling statute what's significant says that\nThere's a difference between criminality an illegality and ... that's what I alluded to a little bit earlier ... and it's a new ones but the fact is that the attorney general and the state still have the civil authority to stop this word I'm looking to put anybody in jail either\nWere just saying this is a commercial enterprise and direct violation of the constitution the legislative by the constitution the legislature is obligated obligated to pass laws to prevent the activity\nNow whether they decided to criminalize or not that is a legislative prerogative as a\nJudge tunnel himself pointed out but they must do something to stop it they just can't sit there and allow this the fan bill drafting too from their nose at the law in the constitution\nOtherwise this is all a joke I mean we have a rule of law here\nWe have a constitution unequivocally prohibits\nThe attorney general and the state still have the civil authority to stop this we're looking to put anybody in jail either\nWere just saying this is a commercial enterprise and direct violation of the constitution the legislative by the constitution the legislature is obligated obligated to pass laws to prevent the activity\nNow whether they decided to criminalize or not that is a legislative prerogative as a\nJudge suddenly himself pointed out but they must do something to stop it they just can't sit there and allow this the fan bill drafting too from their nose at the law in the constitution\nOtherwise this is all a joke I mean we have a rule of law here\nWe have a constitutional unequivocally prohibits commercialized gambling of this sort\nThe judges said the activity is unconstitutional beyond a reasonable doubt and not understanding that we have David Boies come in and say well you know what this really is a technical thing and we don't have to we don't have to we we can find a way around it\nI don't think it can circumvent around it and if you do it just makes a mockery of the whole process and the rule of law\nWell David Boies probably guess what would you think the thousand dollars an hour for his time\n[laughter] I have no idea where do you live in that but you know what has the tuitions not for sale and money shouldn't be able to buy it I could just lay a power the lawyers are reality is that this is an illegal activity\nJust the last question that dealing with him running FanDuel draft Kings' they spent a fortune did they not back in twenty sixteen and probably all I'm going to get this legalize from their point of view what they thought it was legalization of because the stakes are so high here I mean he's involved millions of dollars that are not in lobbying and other expenses\nAs I said Fred constitution should be for sale and I understand that but uh yeah and fortunately I think that is the reality I don't know the precise numbers but there was a lot of money spent on the lobbying campaign to get this bill through\nLast question is in fact as we both agree there's likely there is an appeal of is how much longer do you think of just throwing the timetable of course is as likely to go on before it reaches a court of appeals the highest court in right and then when there's a decision as soon as I Will be finalized anything\nYeah a very old lady time within which party has a right to perfect the appeal but\nThe other side can request an expedited appeal [noise] so uh I Do think however that it's realistically speaking it's probably going to take at least a year before this case finally gets before the court of appeals so there's\nYeah a lot more work out for your down the road exactly\nThis is not over by any means\nAnd the absolute final question in a very similar decisions that have occurred in other states as far as you know involved in these daily fantasy sports where states ought to legalize them but then the courts held that that legalization violated the state's constitution\nOver by any means\nAnd the absolute final question very similar decisions that have occurred in other states as far as you know involved in these daily fantasy sports where they thought to legalize them but then the court held that that legalization violated the state's constitution\nNo question about it in many states maybe you could just talk a little bit about the reforms in other states are brought about in contrast that with the stagnation in New York which is another installment in the long list the reasons that businesses don't like to be in New York [noise]\nYeah I mean I think one great example is the issue of trust passed a responsibility the idea that somebody can break into to Europe premise is could break into your radio station\nInjure themselves and that would be your fault in a court of law here in New York most every other state it's fixed that they say if you didn't expect the person on your property you don't have any duty of care you don't you're not responsible for their injuries but here in New York somebody can break into your property injure themselves\nAnd you pay for that and that's why if you're a property owner a homeowner your insurance costs are as high as they are because a burglar could sue you all trying to steal from you so they steal from you twice really\nAnd this is analogous to and and I guess this is exhibit a day or as the evidence against this kind of a practice this is analogous to the Capitol last so called right where workers can show up on a job the drunk fall off the scaffold and it's still the employers liability or responsibility\nCorrect It's known as absolute liability so if there's an injury on the job it is absolutely the fault of the property owner contractor great example is a worker cutting the whole around themselves in before\nYou would think that in a court of law we worried a portion liability\nBased on fault but that's not the way we do it in New York the liability a hundred percent land with the property owner and with the contractor and so every property owner insurance policy every construction project costs more\nBecause we can't give defendants basic access to write and justice and due process\nThey should be able to go to court and say this person was drunk this person cut to hold onto them selves into for whatever it may be but we don't do that in New York we have what's called summary judgment\nAnd it really you just decide how much you pay a way if you're a contractor a property owner in this situation and it's not just contractors we do this for so many kinds of liability in in many other contacts you would be able to go to court and prove what's called comparative negligence\nThis other person was somewhat responsible that's not the way it works here in New York and that encourages people to just sue the deepest pockets sue anybody that they can out of ... I mean that's one of the things that often happens is they soon is apologies they sued the town the town ... W they do that\nAnd in basic access to write and justice and due process\nThey should be able to go to court and say this person was drunk this person to hold onto them selves and must for whatever it may be but we don't do that in New York we have what's called a summary judgment\nAnd it really you just decide how much you pay a way if you're a contractor a property owner in this situation and not just contractors we do this for so many kinds of liability and many other contacts you would be able to go to court and prove what's called comparative negligence\nThis other person was somewhat responsible that's not the way it works here in New York and that encourages people to just sue the deepest pockets sue anybody that they can\nThat is true I mean that's one of the things they are that often happens is they ... they sued the town the town ... W they to the village to the village deeply W they sue every solving bystander to get any money that they can uh and that's why we're all paying for this this broken system\nIt's not it's not just the individual who's encouraged to bring a lawsuit says so law firms that are out there soliciting these individuals to bring a lawsuit because they know they're going to get a third or whatever it may be or whatever damages all recovered is not correct\nAbsolutely you don't need to be home for daytime television or late night TV to know that it is a booming business litigation here in New York\nDrive down any highway and most of the billboards are blaring which to somebody who somebody and that's because the lawyers are making so much money on that some one of the things they're not allowed to do is solicit\nClients within thirty days of an accident but what we've seen is a new trend developing called geo fencing where they place\nFacebook ads and Twitter add that only show up if you're in an emergency room\nSo if you're in that emergency room you're getting lawyer rats like crazy\nThey're not allowed to solicit people within thirty days of a accent but they're doing it with this this new trend of geo fencing and it's really unfortunate way of getting around the ambulance chasing laws that we ... we fortunately have put into place here in New York\nWell I'm Glad to hear there are some laws in place in New York but doesn't uh Tom New York rank a bottom the worst said in the nation or one of the worst states and the nations of the village as these numbers that I cited earlier suggest who the ability to win large awards and to have access to litigation that would not be permitted in other states\nAbsolutely we are the worst state in the nation were the worst state in the nation on a per capita basis so New Yorkers pay more for litigation than any other people in the United states any other state than it and in the United states and we pay more for medical costs\nAre are medical liability insurance sure payouts are the highest in the nation we pay more for taxes\nBecause of him and miss a polite ability New York city pays more in lawsuits and litigation and the next night team largest us to come to find so it is an unbelievable staggering figure and you pay for it in your taxes you pay for it when you go to the doctors or hospitals\nAnd you pay for it any time that you're trying to build or start a business here in New York\nWas talking to Tom ... from the last of the reforms alliance on don't take this personally okay I'm sure you will pay because you do your job well and you're articulate advocate for your position but how do you keep your sanity over these many years I mean it's not as if you have any prospects for victory where these people who control the New York state legislature in fact that maybe about to get worse\nIf the Democrats take control of the Senate how'd you sort of ... excellent emitter your equilibrium when you make the case when you know you're not you know your your calls are falling really figuratively on deaf ears\nIn law suits and litigation then the next night team largest comes on so it is an unbelievable staggering figure and you pay for it in your taxes you pay for it when you go to the doctors or hospitals and you pay for it any time that you're trying to build or start a business here in New York\nWas talking to Tom ... from the last ... a riff on the line and some don't take this personally okay I'm sure you will pay because you do your job well and you're articulate advocate for your position but how do you keep your sanity over these many years I mean it's not as if you have any prospects for victory where these people who control the New York state legislature in fact that maybe about to get worse\nIf the Democrats they control the Senate how do you sort of ... acronym into your equilibrium when you make the case when you know you're not you know your your calls are flowing really figuratively on deaf ears\nWell I don't share your pessimism and me and my heart because we have been able to position so many of these issues that's important to Democrats\nSchools get sued all the time I as I said our our state government on our city governments are suit all the time so that money\nThat could be spent on schools tax cuts bridges whatever a particular politician may favor could be spent on that if we weren't spending it on lawsuits in litigation and we have made progress in some areas we passed a bill last session along with the the New York State Farm bureau\nTo limit the liability of farms\nAnd you pick operations when they have people on their premises to pick apples to ride horses what have you we used to be a similar situation at the scaffold law where it was near absolute liability for the property owner now we've\nInstilled the standard of what's called inherent risk if you weren't going to one of these properties you realize you're on a farm and you may hurt yourself we already had this in place for ski mountains so if you were barreling down a scheme now you understand there's an inherent risk\nAnd if you fall and you twist your ankle that's not the mountains fault that some inherently risky activity and now fortunately with a supportive in New York state legislature we were able to pass the same kind of bill for our farms or you pick operations in our ... operations\nWhich is a great small step but a great step and so we are seeing progress in certain areas\nAnd we're optimistic that we can continue to see progress\nAs I said because so many of these costs are doctors for city government whatever uh are really being passed on to regular people being passed on to poor people being passed on to people trying to develop affordable housing so I think this has often been position as business versus the little guy\nThis really is about ... all of us versus the personal injury lawyer lobby who's who's really jamming all these costs down our throats\nWell or maintaining the status quo in half for a long period of time do you know the origin historical origin a ton of these laws and\nUh they must have been adopted at a time when you were a lot of industrial accidents and there was a great deal of desire in New York to kind of bend over backwards I guess on the on the half of the little guy before the trial lawyers got totally established as a a a defender of the status quo that got out of hand you know the origin of them\nYeah it's a great point Fred one of the great examples of that is the capital law which was put into place and Eighteen eighty five\nBefore we had workers' compensation before we had OSHA before we had the protections that we have now\nI like to think of the old photo of the work man on the ... or not [laughter] no helmets on they're not tied often they're just eating lunch on those days are over but those are the days when the things like this capital bought were put into place\nAnd so you know one of the things we're going for in this capitalized not to to prevent people from\n[noise] uh that must have been adopted at a time when you were a lot of industrial accidents and there was a great deal of desire in New York to kind of bend over backwards I guess on the ... on the half of the little guy before the trial lawyers got totally established as a a a defender of a status quo that got out of hand you know the origin of him\nYeah it's a great point Fred one of the good examples of that is the scaffold law which was put into place and Eighteen eighty five\nBefore we had workers' compensation before we had OSHA before we had the protections that we have now I like to think of the old photo of the work man on the ... or not [laughter] no helmets on they're not tied off and they're just eating lunch\nOn those days are over but those are the days when the things like this capital bought were put into place\nAnd so you know one of the things we're going for in this capitalized not to to prevent people from getting compensation the workers' compensation system now covers that in most states had something like the scaffold law back in the twenties\nBut when the workers' compensation system came into play\nMost states got rid of that New York did and and that's in part because the trial lawyers were making so much money off of these cases\nSo now if the worker gets injured they make a worker's comp claim they get paid from that and then they make us capital block time and they get paid from that we believe that they should get that secondary claim only if there was actual negligence which is what our courts are designed to prove\nBut in New York you don't get that opportunity if you're a defendant in construction accident and again New York is the only state where that exist\nAll the other states when workers comp came around got rid of that system because it really is a double dipping system and that's not the way it should be and that's what we're advocating to fix\nOr you just think of as a fact that Sheldon Silver now a convicted felon as assembly speaker for almost Twenty years or so I was cashing in there's a trial lawyer basically into his law firm won last form or another getting more\nFound to be checked facts no wonder no legislation ever went through this through the family I Would think Joe Bruno though when he was in charge of the Senate would have been open to real reforms\nAnd it's not surprising I guess that buffalo has the poorest community has been a fight and all of upstate New York the handling park

do\nI'm saying is a very popular today or\nKind of like having British those without having to tell us a little bit about that the cost of all it takes and how it operates\nShore so the nice thing about is there's a line you know we were just talking about cleaning up is that it really gives the patient the ability to continue to flush their teeth to really clean\n'em I have regular conventional metal braces for four years and everything got stuck in them and you had to be you know thank God my dad's a dentist because he was\nBringing home index contraptions to try and keep them clean but you know sometimes can take their braces off and they have cavities underneath so um as long as the patients willing to do there and made by making sure that the appliance days then\nIt's really a great way to um help correct amount ... crooked teeth which um besides the aesthetics um it's it's important to ... because of\nCatching food it between the have the ability of your body and not really self clients every time we drink water your body is always cleaning um so if you have people that are crowded you're ... you have more of that bio film on your chance which you know\nI'm

usually dictates the overall cost of treatment so\nUm you know patients get some type of their insurance help subsidize the costs on so depending upon where you are you to be looking at three thousand dollars you can be looking at ten thousand dollars I'm not saying those are the fees that are off this were a general practice on some patients me\nThe next level up that they're invisible line isn't hands on with other orthodontics procedures you know sometimes even surgical procedure so\nThan your hair but you know try to provide\nTo build okay\nAbout exactly so you know bouncing off of the

a draft draft king and get a piece of the actions of the state is\nDistance and you're a case in challenging the legality\nNewark attorney general against the current attorney general\nYes it put the current attorney general in an awkward position and\nReason it put them in an awkward position was very simply that um that the current attorney general's predecessor\nHad argued very strenuously that daily fantasy sports violated the constitution then the legislature turns around them pass a law purporting to allow it\nAnd now the current attorney general is in the position of having to defend something with the previous attorney general attacked there so there was some definite inconsistencies in the arguments that were put forward by the attorney by attorney general Schneiderman\nAnd the different uh arguments but before the court the war almost polar opposites and contradictory but\nWe're ... put forward now that to\nA bar brawl Underwood is the acting attorney general and that's\nBy

similar position of having to defend something with the previous attorney general attacked there so there was some definite inconsistencies in the arguments that were put forward by the attorney by the attorney general Schneiderman\nAnd the different uh arguments but before the court the oil most polar opposites in contradictory but\nWe're ... put forward now that to\nA bar brawl Underwood is the acting attorney general and that\nBy the acting Supreme Court justice shoveled\nWill he located play acting Supreme Court justice in Albany county\nWhere were they asking us who\nHere who are the planes that said you're representing\nThat challenge that these big ... women\nAcross the state or\nWere either directly involved in a a problem gambling compulsive gambling or immediate relatives of family members who are involved all of whom had devastating losses as a result\nUh and uh some very difficult financial circumstances of tragedies their\nLives that were made direct result of a gambling there's a\nThat's backing the loss into isn't that correct stop\nStop predatory gambling has made a contribution to it I Would say a\nHonesty Fred it's very minimal\nI mean is it a religiously affiliated\nReligiously affiliated organization it's a national organization I don't know everything about it I Know the person who heads it up we've been friends for a long time and he indicated there was a liquor store on the part of them\nTo support this uh but I I Will tell you that uh what it takes two to prosecute a lawsuit like this is a lot more than what you get reimbursed for it I'm sure I was gonna ask you though\nHave you been speaking damages are the plaintiffs entitled\nWe were really seeking damages Fred what we're really seeking is just stop at a ... and and you know everybody talks about the alleged benefits of gamble but there's a lot of people that ignore the dark underside\nAnd there's a lot of people who've been victimized by gambling and these poor people are really\nA kind of poster children for a what the problem is on the other side of the people don't want to recognize well it's\nCertain that the state will\nOnly touched the law has the authority of the legislature and the governor so they say appeal may\nTo any a a whole thing of the gambling and be able to be continued as that would you expect\n... we're looking at that Fred whether or not the state is titled till the automatic stay in the context of this is a little clearer were actually do a little research on that very question as we speak\nAnd have you gotten an indication from the stage at all\nYes I guess I Would say it's probably I I Would never say absolutely certain but I Would say it's probably\nAbout a distinction that I understand I saw a story\nVictory or\nSports fantasy\nThat seasonal sports fans I said betting is\nTo any a a whole thing of the gambling and be able to be continued is that when you expect ... we're\nLooking at that Fred whether or not the state is titled till the automatic stay in the context of this is a little unclear were actually do a little research on that very question as we speak\nAnd have you gotten an indication from the stage at all\nYes I I Would say it's probably I Would never say absolutely certain but I Would say it's probable to\nThe station that I understand I saw a story\nVictory or\nSports fantasy I'm\nThat seasonal sports fans of safeguarding is permitted and has been for many years in New York do you are you familiar\nWith that distinction and I\nWasn't there but I think the distinction without a difference the emphasis here which are daily fantasy sports\nBut the reality is there is no difference between daily fantasy sports and she's a little fantasy sports other than the late all the bad obviously something with seasonal wrong it's different but you're still you're still betting on the performance of actual players\nIn actual sporting events albeit over a longer period of time\nThat gets a distinction without a difference the story\nThat this oil or tone fantasy betting seasonal signs his name\nWasn't challenges that accurate and if so why are they in either\nCase that it was not it was they allowed that to go but I'm\nBeat out as it may there was no real legislative authority for to was only when daily fantasy sports started off with it caught the eye of the former attorney general Schneiderman\nAny prosecuted the case that he may have made the distinction with his own mind between seasonal a fancy sports a daily credits each porch but the reality is that in both games the essence of the of\nThe activity is you were a betting on the outcome of the sporting event yeah I guess\nHistorian really took off financially sorted\nSum of money much more than seasonal sports but in our needs\nIt needs a better because it's every day this\nIs actually\nBecause of something you alluded\nThe judge held that the legislature and governor had the right to take this type of betting out of the felony gambling statute what's significant says that\nThere's a difference between criminality an illegality and ... that's what I alluded to a little bit earlier Freda and it's a nuance but the fact remains that the attorney general and the state still have the civil authority to stop is looking to put anybody in jail either\nWere just saying this is a commercial enterprise of direct violation of the constitution the legislative by the constitution the legislature is obligated obligated to pass laws to prevent the activity\nNow whether they decided to criminalize or know what that is a legislative prerogative as a\nJudge tunnel himself pointed out but they must do something to stop it they just can't sit there and allow this the fan boy drafting too from their nose at the law in the constitution\nOtherwise this is all the joke I mean we\nYour friends and it's a new ones but the fact games that the attorney general in the states still have the civil authority to stop is looking to put anybody in jail either\nWere just saying this is a commercial enterprise and direct violation of the constitution the legislative by the constitution the legislature is obligated obligated to pass laws to prevent the activity\nNow whether they decided to criminalize are there and what that is a legislative prerogative as a\nJudge suddenly himself pointed out but they must do something to stop it they just can't sit there and allow this the fan boy drafting too from their nose at the law in the constitution\nOtherwise this is all the joke I mean we have a rule of law here\nWe have a constitutional unequivocally prohibits commercialized gambling of this sort of\nThe judges said the activities unconstitutional beyond a reasonable doubt and not understanding that we have David Boies come in and say well you know what this really is a technical thing and we don't have to we don't have to we we can find a way around it\nI don't think you can circumvent around and if you do\nIt just makes a mockery of the whole process and the\nBush's father guess over thousand dollars an hour for his time\n[laughter] I have no idea where do you live in that but you know what concentrations for sale and money shouldn't be able to buy it I\nPower the lawyers are reality is that this is illegal activity\nJust the last question here where the money FanDuel\nKings' they spent a fortune did they not back in twenty sixteen and probably on\nTo get this legalize from their\nIt was the legalization of because the stakes are so high here that means is involved millions\nOther expenses as I said Fred constitution should be for sale and\nAre yeah yeah fortunately I think that is the reality I don't know the precise numbers but there was a lot of money spent on the lobbying campaign to get this bill through\nLast question is in fact\nThe highest court in reading which were then\nA decision houses\nAnything yeah there's a lengthy time within which party has a right to perfect the appeal but the other side can request an expedited appeal [noise]\nSo uh I Do think however that it's realistically speaking it's probably going to take at least a year before this case finally gets before the court of appeals so there's\nExactly\nThis is not over by any means and they\nHave a similar decisions that have occurred\nExactly\nThis is not over by any means and the\nSimilar decisions that have occurred\nFrom the lawsuit reform alliance of New York has been with us before and it could have come back with us again you weren't in town thanks for joining us boarding fried great to be with you first what period of time with these figures covering I didn't see that from the Institute for legal reform\nSo this was over the year two thousand sixteen and as you mentioned we're spending in the United states more\nOf our GDP by percentage than just about any other industrialized country on\nLawsuits in litigation and of course we in New York are spending more per capita as you mentioned over six thousand dollars a year four times what the average New Yorker would spend on gas on lawsuits in litigation so this is costing everybody and not just defended we're all paying for this system\nNo question about it and many states maybe you could just talk a little\nThat other states are brought about in contrast that with the stagnation in New York which is another installment in the long list the reasons that businesses don't like to be in New York [noise]\nYeah I mean I think one great example is the issue of trust past her responsibility the idea that somebody can break into to Europe premises could break into your radio station\nInjure themselves and that would be your fault in a court of law here in New York most every other state it's fixed that they say if you didn't expect the person on your property you don't have a duty of care you don't you're not responsible for their injuries but here in New York somebody can break into your property injure themselves\nAnd you pay for that and that's why if you're a property owner or homeowner your insurance costs are as high as they are because a burglar could show you all trying to steal from you so they steal from you twice really\nAnd this is analogous to and and I guess this is exhibit day or as the evidence against this kind of practice analogous to the Capitol last so called right where workers can show up on a job being drunk fall off the scaffold and it's filled the employers liability or responsibility\nCorrect It's only absolute liability so if there's an injury on the job it is absolutely the fault of the property owner contractor great example as they work or cutting the whole around themselves in before\nYou would think that in a court of law we worried apportion liability based on fault but that's not the way we do it in New York the liability a hundred percent land with the property owner and with the contract\nCosts are as high as they are because a burglar could sue you walk trying to steal from you so they steal from you twice really\nAnd this is analogous to and and I guess this is exhibit a day or as the evidence against this kind of practices analogous to the Capitol last so called right where workers can show up on a job be drunk fall off the scaffold and it's filled the employers liability or responsibility\nCorrect It's only absolute liability so if there's an injury on the job it is absolutely the fault of the property owner contractor great example as they work or cutting the whole around themselves in before\nYou would think that in a court of law we worried apportion liability\nBased on fault but that's not the way we do it in New York the liability a hundred percent land with the property owner and with the contractor and so every property owner insurance policy every construction project cost more\nBecause we can't give defendants basic access to write and justice and due process\nThey should be able to go to court and say this person was drunk\nThis person to hold onto them selves and must for whatever it may be but we don't do that in New York we have what's called summary judgment and it really you just decide how much you pay a way if you're a contractor a property owner in this situation\nAnd not just contractors we do this for so many kinds of liability and many other contacts you would be able to go to court and prove what's called comparative negligence\nThis other person was somewhat responsible that's not the way it works here in New York and that encourages people to just sue the deepest pockets sue anybody that they can\nThat is true I mean that's one of the things they are that often happens is they soon is a policy they sued the town to the town ... W they to the village to the village deeply W they sue every solving bystander to get any money that they can uh and that's why we're all paying for this this broken system\nIt's not it's not just the individual has encouraged to bring these lawsuits is so lost arms that are out there soliciting these individuals to bring a lawsuit because they know they're going to get a third\nIt may be or whatever damages all recovered isn't that correct\nAbsolutely you don't need to be home for daytime TV a late night TV to know that it is a booming business ... here in New York\nDrive down any highway and most of the billboards are blaring wave sue somebody to somebody and that's because the lawyers are making so much money on that same one of the things they're not allowed to do is solicit\nClients within thirty days of an accident but what we've seen is a new trend developing called geo fencing where they place\nFacebook ads and Twitter ad but only show up if you're in an emergency room\nSo if you're in that emergency room you're getting lawyer rats like crazy\nThey're not allowed to solicit people within thirty days of a accent but they're doing it with this this new trend of geo fencing and it's really unfortunate way of getting around these ambulance chasing laws that we ... we fortunately have put into place here in New York\nWell I'm Glad to hear there are some laws in place in Europe but doesn't uh Tom Newark rank a bottom the worst said in the nation or one\nOf the worst states and the nations of the vote as these numbers that I cited earlier suggest to the ability to win large awards than to have access to litigation that would not be permitted in other states\nAbsolutely we are the worst state in the nation were the worst state in the nation on a per capita basis so New Yorkers pay more for litigation than any other people in the United states any other state then it ends in the United states and we pay more for medical costs are are medical liability insurance sure pay\nTo to listen to people within thirty days of a accent but they're doing it with this this new trend of geo fencing and it's really unfortunate way of getting around the ambulance chasing laws that we ... we fortunately have put into place here in New York\nWell I'm Glad to hear there are some laws in place in New York but doesn't uh Tom Newark rank or the bottom of the worst said in the nation or one\nOf the worst states and the nation and so the villain as these numbers that I cited earlier suggest to the ability to win large awards and to have access to litigation that would not be permitted in other states\nAbsolutely we are the worst state in the nation were the worst state in the nation on a per capita basis so New Yorkers pay more for litigation than any other people in the United states any other state that is in the United states and we pay more for medical costs\nAre are medical liability insurance sure payouts are the highest in the nation we pay more for taxes\nBecause of ... New York city pays more in lawsuits and litigation then the next night team largest come to find her so it is an unbelievable staggering figure and you pay for it in your taxes you pay for it when you go to the doctors or hospitals\nAnd you pay for it any time that you're trying to build or start a business here in New York\nWas talking to Tom stabbings from the last of the reforms alliance on don't take this personally okay I'm sure you will pay because you do your job well and you're articulate\nAdvocate for your observations but how do you keep your sanity over these many years I mean it's not as if you have any prospects for victory where these people who control the New York state legislature in fact it may be about to get worse\nIf the Democrats take control of the Senate\nHow'd you sort of take reckless echoing image of your equilibrium when you make the case when you know you're not you know your your calls are flowing\nFiguratively on deaf ears\nWell I don't share your pessimism aiming at heart because we have been able to position so many of these issues that's important to Democrats schools get sued all the time I as I said our our state government and our city governments are pseudo all the time so that money that could be spent on\nSchools tax cuts bridges what ever a particular politician may favor could be spent on that if we weren't spending it on lawsuits in litigation and we have made progress in some areas we passed a bill last session along with the the New York State Farm bureau to limit the liability on farms\nAnd you pick operations when they have people on their premises to pick apples to ride horses what happy we used to be a similar situation like this capital ball where it was near absolute liability for the property owner now we've\nInstilled the standard of what's called inherent risk if you were going to one of these properties you realize you're on a farm and you may hurt yourself we already had this in place for ski mountains so if you were barreling down a ski mountain you understand there's an inherent risk\nAnd if you fall and you twist your ankle that's not the mountains fault that's an inherently risky activity and now fortunately with the support of the New York state legislature we were able to pass the same kind of bill for farms\nOr you pick operations in our act line operations which is a great small step but a great step and so we are seeing progress in certain areas and we're optimistic that we can continue to see progress\nAs I said because so many of these costs are doctors for city government whatever are are really being passed on to regular people being passed on to poor people being passed on to people trying to develop affordable housing so I think this has often been

been adopted at a time when you were a lot of industrial accidents and there was a great deal of desire\nIn New York to kind of bend over backwards I guess on the on the half of the little guy before the trial lawyers got so many established as a a a defender of the status quo that got out of hand you know the origin of him\nYeah it's a great point friend one of the good examples of that is the scaffold law which was put into place in Eighteen eighty five before we had workers' compensation before we had OSHA before we had the protections that we have now\nI like to think of the old photo of the work man on the ... or not [laughter] no helmets on they're not tied off and they're just eating lunch\nOn those days are over but those are the days when the things like this capital bought were put into place\nAnd so you know one of the things we're going for in this capital was not to to prevent people from getting compensation the workers' compensation system now covers that in most states had something like the scaffold law back in the twenties but when the workers' compensation system came into play\nMost states got rid of that New York did and and that's in part because the trial lawyers were making so much money off of these cases\nSo now if the worker gets injured they make a worker's comp claim they get paid from that and then they make us capital block time and they get paid from that we believe that they should get that secondary claim only if there was actual negligence which is what our courts are designed to prove\nNatural gas drilling and it's not surprising I

by all of us and promotion and\nSaid that she follows the rules and she can't lose the weight so how do we address that and I will just added\nMarket for it\nSo for she'd have to find out just irate is an issue for her\nIt is when\nI Would rotate\nWould actually I I Would both that the silly and\nOn rotate the other because they really articles are good for like breast cancer prevention and so many so many things but I Would cook it like Dr King said and I would rotate it into a diet and at\nOther things like spinach with charred\nYou know there's a lot of other healthy on vegetables\nI think if you work so think some of the symptoms that you both\nAs well if if your goal is to achieve a healthier\nTake the ... plus Cohen ... information that helped me sixty five and when it's all about\nA vigil or generalize\nVoted not for you so hard to say like why are you not losing weight if we don't see all the big picture here do you know there's so much information that needs to be

saying is that the old\nOf calories in calories out like national sudden ... out so well\nThe update is which is to look in at the blood panel and the technology and research and his\nDo you get in line at fault so you\nThink I'm just calling to eat blasted\nSoy and then why I'm a frustrated by not not saying wait so this is the why yes\nThe\nSo some of the symptoms that someone may have low

to look at the blood panel and the technology and the research is\nDo you want your fault so you\nI'm just going to eat blasted\nA soy and then why am I frustrated and they're not losing weight so this is the lie yeah\nTo wall\nSo some of the symptoms that someone may have low thyroid function\nAs we said to cheat overwhelming fatigue um they may\nTry skiing and ... falling out a\nConstipated that's a big cyber age I'm ... they may have elevated cholesterol out\n'em that would cause that I'm really should always a big cholesterol on elevator and um\nAnd they just they have a depression actually do have a problem getting pregnant that's a big one that's not addressing\nPostpartum um symptoms the longest postpartum if they still don't\nDon't you just sharing all the symptoms what comes to mind also is today we were often border patrol the physical commercial hush\nWere just describing sounds like some of\nThem with west coast and say why cause Charlie\nLady is part that you might be prescribed it I'm not saying that to take away but I'm saying when you look at the toxicity or you look at the side effects on the symptoms are women same and that's what's great about the health risks of relief to if I were setting it's ...\nIt's a start it and that's why it's like I'm a very sharp sharp in\nIt that's why you can lose weight and he talks even when it's so excited yeah\nIt's it's you know\nDon't think there's anything better out\nAnd I certainly loved to do the healthy sixty five to find out what's going on\nThat is for weight loss but to\nExactly look within
