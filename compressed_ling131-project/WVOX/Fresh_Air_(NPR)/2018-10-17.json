home care but\nFirst of all welcome Amy ... thanks for having me I'm happy to have you on the air\nI'm Amy as you know home care at the very sensitive topic you can't just place anybody in anybody's home there has to be proper vetting proper ensuring that these are trusted\nReliable caregiver however when you add the echelon of cognitive impairment Alzheimer than dimension to\nThe need for specialized care so much more high end and that being said\nAs life starts to Rob you of your memory and the basic comfort that you know to have to leave your home to an institutionalized setting it's just one more thing\nTo go through correct taller than about their sure so ... carry for somebody with dementia any of the dimensions all climbers a cognitive loss Louis bodies all the kinds of dimensions\nThat's a tough thing to do so I understand when people want to place their loved one or ended up placing a loved one in a facility whether it be an assisted living or long term care [noise]\nWe just feel that at sterling there's avoid their their their time people can stay home if they're if they're not medically complex perhaps they can stay home but they still need good care um compassionate care\nLet's talk about some of the concerns when we're dealing with these issues\nFirst of all a lot of times the physical body remains relatively adage island healthy absolutely ... and that's the dichotomy between the mind and body at that point on you can have somebody who\nDoesn't experience any you know joins down months or or cardio element they can be physically fine\nBut the cognitive impairment that takes over um in addition to the memory loss it can cause ... ah people leaving the home people taking off and getting in the car people kind of keep things from the purview of the caregiver\nYou're dealing with an entirely different set of issues I'm ... and not to diminish someone who is suffering from cancer or join replacement or or heart attacks or strokes all awful things that that inflict on but this is different\nIt is it is very different um [noise] so you mentioned people leaving the home and\nThat creates that's a that's a big issue um people being lost and as a caregiver bring 'em it's not so hard to to to take care of that um a lot of people put it in ... extensive like ... and stuff like that if you put a\nA slide lock at the top of the door\nOr a bell\nThat that alerts you took the fact that the parts of\nTo get out [noise] right absolutely but also the degree of patients that you must have an absolutely you you have to have\nYou have to have a lot of patience and and it's not a failing of you that you don't have that patients it's hard work [noise] so yes I mean for in terms of the ... so let's let's talk about the family caregiver for this moment um everyone's well intentioned and searched\nPeople being lost and as a caregiver bring 'em it's not so hard to to to take care of that um a lot of people put in extent extensive like a long arms and stuff like that if you put a a slide lock at the top of the door\nOr a bell\nThat that alerts you to the fact that the parts of trying to get out [noise] right absolutely yeah but also the degree of patients\nThat you must have absolutely you you have to have\nYou have to have a lot of patience and and it's not a failing of you that you don't have that patients it's hard work [noise] so yes\nI mean for in terms of the ... so let's let's talk about the family caregiver for the moment um everyone's well intentioned and to remove the guilt that this is not like don't blame yourself for yourself off if you can't care for your loved one who is suffering from this this is a heightened degree of care that is required\nExactly and so we provide care up to twenty four hours a day seven days a week or as little as like four hours a day twice a week so anywhere in between what what works for you um [noise]\nAnd and it's great as I said are caregivers are specifically trained they have access to me by telephone by tax by voice you know what a computer\nAnd I can get back to them immediately or I can make a special visit out hey I'm having trouble with they don't want to eat or they don't you know one time is one thing a trend is something else right you know what I mean I'm\nWell those direct accountability so again you're dealing with employees sterling care we're not dealing with subcontracted independent oxygen which are employees they're accountable\nThere is you know there's just felt there's Amy that again if there's an issue you're on the field so you're not just in an office you're not behind a desk you're in the home you're watching earth than I Am you are communicating with families you're offering support you're offering the comforting ear which is\nAbove and beyond your call of duty but you're recognizing ... where it's really [laughter] well well you know what you go for the visit you don't have to stay out of the amateur session but the cuts again you you've been there right in their shoes [noise]\nUm I Want to keep talking about what makes your approach different so it's a unique program special training daily monitoring of the case um [noise]\nAnd the support what state of the art technology and the home can you talk a bit of our technology we\nHave a program um [noise] it's a computer program and it's based on an assessment that I Do a pretty extensive assessment of the character of the the client's abilities functional abilities what can they still do can they still do the laundry can they still\nHomes are watching earth than I Am you are communicating with families you're offering support your offerings if the comforting ear which is\nAbove and beyond your call of duty but you're recognizing ... where it's really [laughter] well well you know what you go for the visit you don't have to stay out of the amateur fashion but the cuts again you you've been there right in their shoes [noise]\nUm I Want to keep talking about what makes your approach different so it's a unique program special training daily monitoring of the case um [noise]\nAnd the support what state of the art technology and the home and you talk a bit of our technology\nWe have a program um [noise]\nIt's a computer program and it's based on an assessment that I Do a pretty extensive assessment of the character of the the client's\nAbilities functional abilities what can they still do can they still do the laundry can they still drive to still handle money that kind of question that you know do they need help getting dressed there's a functional ability but the rest of that assessment it's a lifestyle assessment [noise]\nSo if you're a person who loves to read the paper every morning and also new caregiver comes in and says no we're eating breakfast them you know we try to keep things the way you work before\nWhat's familiar to you so while the caregiver is stranger to you jeep I read the paper every morning before I have breakfast that's not strange to you right right\nYou want to you want to maintain the status quo as much as you can exactly so how often does this assessment ah get re done because at that as a person continues on their journey right you know things status quo just isn't the case anymore so how often do you rate that we\nDo it every three months OK I'm or as needed so along in this assessment are what were the person hobbies or like or dislike um did they like to play cards you know there are people that love playing cards and perhaps they can still play cards\nBut they can hold the cards they could put the cart they're not harder for them what's the millionaire right so anyway so I Do this assessment that we um introduced to this program that we have a specific program creates a structured day what's best for this person with this level of dementia and what they like to do\nSo we might have something like an exercise a time in the morning because you don't really want to do a lot of exercise at night before somebody sleeps they're not really going to sleep so we do that kind of things but we're going to exercise with this person who's the swim and we can get them there and they can still swim we're going to bring them swimming [noise]\nSo any the a home health aides that you have a mom or they have a medical background so we have some that are medical background these people are companion companion put them to get just the word of mouth can companionship and let that invoke\nUm isolation it's probably a greater detriment to these conditions because some of the ways on your emotion and depression\nUm which Austin overlaps with Senate does of all time earth and mentioned it so we go out all of the nation is so important having somebody watching TV with you're going for a walk with you right\nWell and going for a walk with you I Would like to uh focus on that watching TV you know not that people can do what they like you know\nThe the wife and I would imagine and accept that would be at that that it's never any age right so\nFor nothing he ate enough for the caregiver or not for the client I'm so we had them engage by whether it means we're going to go out to Marshall's and we're going to walk around the store because proceeds to like to shop we're going to go for coffee that's something somebody always did\nAnd and we're maybe somebody with you know kind of middle dementia can't go to a French restaurant any more they can still go to McDonalds and enjoy a cup of coffee and I'm not negating what McDonald's is are saying what how I ended\nAll the time and match it so we thought out all of the nation so important having somebody watching TV with you're going for a walk with\nYou right well and going for a walk with you I Would like to uh focus on that watching TV you know not that people can do what they like you know the the class but I Would imagine an excess that would be that that it's never any age right so for not for the aid and not for the caregiver\nOr not for the client I'm so we have them engage by whether it means we're going to go out to Marshall's and we're going to walk around the store because proceeds to like to shop we're going to go for coffee that's something somebody always did\nAnd and we're maybe somebody with you know kind of middle dementia can't go to a French restaurant any more they can still go to McDonalds and enjoy a cup of coffee and I'm not negating what McDonald's is are saying what is\nHow I ended up but they may not be able to ... an hour and a half and still do right and it's important to have someone to enable you to do them right\nSo let's go back again to the need for bringing in care because if you are let's say you're an adult child I'm In the throes of your career with a young family yourself\nYou're not physically able to provide that level of attentive care you've had no and it just becomes impossible for a person with this condition to remain independent on their own\nIt's correct a lotta times people don't leave their home um they might come live with the daughter of they've lived with the daughter for a while or something like that but the daughter still working where she had your child's\nHealth I mean it's wonderful commendable that you did that you can still bring an absolutely there's also other concerns there's Hi Jenna concerns you know argue it's huge because again if the ... all the faculties are not in there the routine doesn't it's not routine anymore\nExactly and that's a big caregiving tip 'em for whether it be home to home care and yeah it's a big sign that something God right ... right that that person is in clean they they're not eating they've lost weight but yeah who would isn't and Rory\nBy what they're eating is not you know there is nothing new right fish that there's something balancing and again\nIt's a system the mind and body suffer not feeding your body with proper nutrition you know the immunity is going to go down everything you know much like a car one issues going to have the heart heart stopped working\nSo you have to get over that hump that I don't need anybody for myself or my loved one at a cut out of the ... off one\nNow and then and a lotta times with these cases what happens with people will start our four hours a day twice a week that's what I'm going to use and within a week or two can we just three days\nThey can see how they see the benefits I Want to talk to you a bit about um the introductory purple memory five okay\nSo that's um that's something that we created at sterling\nOur clients so they used to do things they used to so they used to do water color they\nPlay cards so I can tell a family or a caregiver so you should get the cards out and play with them\nThey don't really know how to do that\nSo I said the box has the part that an old house directions [noise] this is the things you can do with the playing cards you can sort them in number water you can sort of in a suit order you can try matching them\nUm whatever the functional level that person is now I'm going to tell you that if you do Fifteen minutes you've done okay and if it doesn't work today and it might work tomorrow that's the whole thing about caregiving and having this close eye on it what works tomorrow doesn't work today and you have to\nYou had everybody okay with that you have to adjust so this box is more activity bait not sentimental ... like if you have a photo Iowa well that's in there to okay\nSo I can tell a family or a caregiver so you should get the cards out and play with them they don't really know how to do that\nSo I said the box has the part that an old house directions [noise] this is the things you can do with the playing cards you can sort them in number on or you can sort of in a suit order you can try matching them\nUm whatever the functional level that person is now I'm going to tell you that if you do Fifteen minutes you've done okay and if it doesn't work today and it might work tomorrow that's the whole thing about caregiving and having this close eye on it what works tomorrow doesn't work today and you have to\nAnd you have to be okay with that you have to adjust so this box is more activity bait not sentiment ... like if you have a photo Iowa well\nThat's in there to okay um this is I F families can you give me some photos will put it in a little bag or in a little small album look through the photos hey who was who was at at the party who was the next tell your story um yeah tell the story and does it matter if it's right you know it matters\nThat they're engaged and they get enjoyment you know oh you went to Cape Cod did you go over a year did you stay in in you know\nThey might know the answer they might not right but here you've ... you've spent some time and that person had a great feeling right\nYou know it's all about making making\nThe a person suffering from this able to live able to function and recognizing that this is not just the standard of care that okay a person's old we need somebody in the house and you're just going to sit there for eight hours that just I guess I'm a little more popular very popular to phone doesn't ring all day and they told me about it\nUm but that being said a recognizing the need for stimulation ending gauge meant I have to imagine with no scientific context for this but keeping keeping keeping the cognitive functions moving it is the key to the treatment\n... you know that's saying if you don't use it you lose it and get an absolutely true no longer you are ... I'm engaged the more cognitively intact you become you say does the disease go on it always goes on but you\nBut you can mitigate right you know they say I'm at study I read that grandparents are actively involved grandparents or great way to water it all fell\nRight You're welcome mom and dad I don't do for many years because they are I don't know but I Can't just moved out to Arizona that wasn't good enough I Know you know the reason is that when your children and then later on your grandchildren they are just keeping you engaged purpose stuff to do\nWith a purpose and the home health companion to write home help companion it's going to help you remember that purpose you're going to look forward to them [noise] so how do we get in touch with you aiming at sterling home care again\nA cut above for helping people at home with cognitive impairment\nSo you can call us in our a branch office two or three five three to five hundred or or New York office which is nine one for\nTrump is two or three by three two oh five hundred or our New York office which is nine one for\nIf I leave the studio\nI couldn't drive quite easily in neighboring communities like hell I'm Mount Vernon east Chester Scarsdale Larchmont ...\nThey're All right here and you know when you leave new or shall I go into one of those communities when you're doing it 'cause there'll be a sign there saying welcome to our village or town\nSometimes the differences maybe very stark very noticeable\nOr if you're driving on the Boston post road us one and you're in ...\nAnd you cross over into rye you notice the difference right away why 'cause my ... got a lotta ugly shopping centers oh I'm Sorry maybe I shouldn't have said that but rye has different zoning it's residential\nSituation here in Westchester has nothing to or to do it all with the way it was an ancient painting\nBut we should imagine if instead you who are on the post road let's say route twenty two and you were driving up the duchess county\nWhat would happen there you'd come to a town or village and then you leave a small downtown area and then you drive another ten miles and then there'd be another town and so on and so forth there are not hard pressed right up against each other\nThey're actually like the area around route thirty and thirty a that we heard about recently with the limousine accident when you go to upstate New York\nImmunities are separated by great distances and that's the way it was an ancient Canaan cities were scattered apart they warn pressed up next to each other the way cities and communities are year in Westchester\nAnd what would you find if you went to a community well what would you find here\nThere'd be a post office thank you Ben Franklin\nThere might be a library Oh thank you Andrew Carnegie\nA village drawl yeah how about a church with a staple quite likely a tavern\nSo you get the idea that any community especially if we go back in time a little here in New York there's certain things you could reasonably count on as being there that help define the community\nSo what did they have in ancient fainted and the city life\nAnd that's the way it was an ancient Canaan cities were scattered apart they warn pressed up next to each other the way cities and communities are year in Westchester and what would you find if you went to a community well what would you find here\nThere'd be a post office thank you Ben Franklin there might be a library Oh thank you Andrew Carnegie\nA village drawl yeah how about a church with a staple quite likely a tavern\nSo you get the idea that any community especially if we go back in time a little here in New York there are certain things you could reasonably count on as being there that help define that community\nSo what did they have in ancient sane and the city like new slum\nWell they all had gangs so there'd be a palace\nThey all had at temple forget about the which theater a but there would be at least the temple their\nDepending on the time period they also would have all these cities had walls built around them for protection\nAnd the primary thing they want to protect his water\nIf you've been to Jerusalem you might have been to the gills spring\nThat gosh is that where the name comes from like old faithful does\nThey still get their water in Jerusalem from there if you've been there you can bathe or washed their take photos there\nBut it's that water source that made the city possible without a perennial a constant source of water you really have a hard time having a settled area so you have to protect that area\nAnd that's what the cities have\nSo even if you don't find it in Jerusalem\nBecause of archaeological excavations are somewhat limited there since people still live there and you can escalate in the Temple Mount without causing a whole lot of trouble a lot of people you still can make reasonable guesses\nAs to what you said fine if you were able to excavate\nBecause all the cities had similar things the same way are you near and you hear often have similar types of structures were buildings that survive in the city\nNow something else you may have is how this whole where did people live\nFor children to that that remind you you're you're listening to me on WB elects community radio the number here is nine one for six three six zero one one zero you want to call in\nAnd if you want to be a friend of the show and help keep it on the air you can go to go find me dot com forward slash fine talk that's go fund me dot com forward slash fine talk\nSo we're talking about the house is the home where we'd people live\nYou remember railroad flat and if you have parents grandparents great parents lived on the lower east side and lived in what is called the railroad flat so that means you have this apartment that's straight back\nA straight line going through it cordoned off into different room the farthest room in the inner recesses that the ordinary child is not allowed to maybe only the grandparents can go there are only the parents\nGo fund to me dot com forward slash fine talk that's go fund me dot com forward slash fine talk\nSo we're talking about the house is the home where would people live\nDo you remember railroad flat and if you have parents grandparents great parents lived on the lower east side and lived in what is called the railroad flat so that means you have this apartment that's straight back\nA straight line going through it cordoned off into different room the farthest room in the inner recesses that the ordinary child is not allowed to maybe only the grandparents can go there are only the parents\nAnd then the next room only the parents and then perhaps the room you can go to and the public or all the welcoming room so the apartment is set up so each area is more and more restricted\nAnd this is reflective of the tainted I way of life\nIt was the way of life where everyone knew their place there's no American Dream and the land of Canaan there's no oh I'm going to go to school and I'm going to learn a skill and on to make something of myself\nThat's not the way it works you have a stratified society where each person knows their place\nAnd that's reflected in the very architecture of the house where you live where you know which room you're allowed to enter and which rooms you can't enter that's the exact opposite of the way things were in Israel Israel had an open architecture and it's home\nImagine if you walk in and you think you're in a courtyard\nAnd then around the courtyard our rooms there's a room in front of you there's a room to the right and there's a room to the left and they may even be subdivided that's an open structure where you can go from the center to any room and no room is restricted\nAnd I said courtyard because archeologists didn't realize when they first discovered these that Israel like houses were two floors\nSo in that insurance you would bring in your animals you're sheep and your vote and they would stay there and you would sleep on the second floor but took a while before archaeologist figure that out\nSo I mentioned these homes just to show you\nThe difference in value the differences in culture between\nThe two people the Cain and I and you use realize that you can see just through the homes and just move the structures because Israel didn't have a king so it didn't have a pilot Israel didn't have temples and this is before the time of Solomon David's\nSon and successor Israel didn't have walled city\nSo you're dealing with two very different people two very different ways of life and then all of a sudden David is going to take the city of Jerusalem and make it the capital of his kingdom\n\nArcheologists have uncovered some parts of Jerusalem if you build something in Jerusalem guess what's gonna happen\nYou're going to find something you can't dig down into the dirt there without finding something the city has been occupied or inhabited for centuries for millennia wherever you go you're going to find something put in\nPalace Israel didn't have temples and this is before the time of Solomon David's son and successor\nIsrael didn't have walled city so you're dealing with two very different people two very different ways of life and then all of a sudden David is going to take the city of Jerusalem and make it the capital of his kingdom\n\nArcheologists have uncovered some parts of Jerusalem\nIf you build something in Jerusalem guess what's gonna happen\nYou're going to find something you can't dig down into the dirt there without finding something\nThe city has been occupied or inhabited for centuries for millennia wherever you go you're going to find something put it in a basement building office complex or in this case bill a visitor center\nSeveral years ago Israel decided to build a tourist visitor center in Jerusalem right near the spring that I was mentioning earlier the young spring where they get their water and suddenly they found huge wall\nGiant walls they call them Cyclops rock as if these rocks in place by the Cyclops from Greek ... no I was expecting it it just appeared out of nowhere like the excavation that uncovered the African burial ground on lower Manhattan\nThey just were building an office building for the federal government and there it was because that's the way lower Manhattan is to whenever you start to build something you're going to find something underneath\nThis will all this gay complex again I can show you the images of what it would look like because this is radio and television and I'm not speaking to you live\nBut this complex help them understand that Jerusalem was like many other cities in the land of pain and\nLike the ghetto where we get the word Armageddon in English and likely variety of other cities they had these walls they had the control of water and they had the game because the gate is how you control access to the city", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Fresh Air (NPR)", "city": "New Rochelle", "day": "17"}
