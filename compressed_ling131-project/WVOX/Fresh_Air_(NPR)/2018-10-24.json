gas from my elder advocate that this is when I heard the title of your business\nAnd really thought this is something\nI'm very passionate about taking care of seniors and making sure they have optimal quality of life and there are so much information that they don't have\nAccess to they are so many resources that you can have now to help guide she said the process of nursing homes on care care management case Spanish bad it don't have to go it alone and you have a lot of extra people who can do your homework for you\nBut that's where my elder out of the guys that I like both of my

you came to find it [noise]\nUm [noise] what's on and\nIn two thousand two actually are in court reporting school where north or in white plains a court reporter since I'm we're both a little burned out for various reasons and we've been best friends sent them a reprieve sided we want to do something else\nWhy do why in the field the senior care was there an incident a triggering event that you go through something with the parents that you have a friend who was in need of some help dealing with a nursing home or I get why why the field\nWhen we knew we wanted something service oriented but didn't really know how about we didn't know about 'em so I have to just sort of found that we'd go to a franchise showing that it just only because my my ex husband owns a franchise or so and so we decided to go to the expo in\nAnd see what was out there and we came across my older African [noise]\nExplain what in fact you are you are advocates in every sense of the word and this morning when I was on air with bomber on talking about today show I said I said who you are and I said one of the topics we weren't going to talk about were nursing home in ...\nAnd that word in of itself is frightening the word addiction and editing circumstance you know it it's not a great word really invoke some fearful math right um but it's for real thing and and I think that\nWhat you were afraid to a premature discharges for nursing home right likely the cost of insurance\nRaising their coverage rates but like you to explain specifically what you do so we try to connect to our audience out there today there's one points for nursing home residents in the United states I'm awfully for ... million ... million residents okay\nIn nursing homes there's eight to nine thousand if charges illegal infections every year most residents don't know they're right [noise]\nUm there's very few recent that can be charged for him a nursing home um for example if your health is in jeopardy or your or your house can affect the other residents in a nursing home or um you no longer need nursing home care [noise] um\nWhat does he have to raise your disturbance to write their other than in residence right you're mentally incapacitated and your if you put yourself in danger or the residents voted by a different scale so you're saying it there has to be reasons for nursing homes to discharge only hands at all\nRight and there's there's not many no so but a lot of times you know with the insurance climate that we're and there's only certain things that will be covered there's only\nUp to so many time off that so many days you know Medicare is only going to cover one hundred days and then um people just to see might have Medicare I'm ... and then right around then comes the question of Medicaid and applying for Medicaid is a full time job ended up at solving affect my line of work on the funeral home because\nPart of the requirements are that people have to make\nPre funded funeral arrangements and you watch what they go through in your boss the paperwork process as well as the mist information out\nThere it it's it's a nightmare where many people\nYou're if you put yourself in danger or the residency about her fire a different scale so you're saying it there has to be reasons for nursing homes to discharge it only hands at all\nRight and there's there's not many no so but a lot of times you know with the insurance climate that we're and there's only certain things that will be covered that only\nUp to so many times after so many days you know Medicare is only going to cover one hundred years and then um people just for the might have Medicare I'm ... and then right around then comes the question of Medicaid and applying for Medicaid is a full time job ended up at some effect my line of work on the funeral home because\nPart of the requirements are that people have to make\nPre funded funeral arrangements and you watch what they go through you botched the paperwork process as well as the mist information out\nThere it's it's a nightmare where many people\nAre concerned anecdote about a client that we have learned\nIn the city um but this particular client I Lived in San Francisco or even for nine years and the entire nine years he was in a wheelchair [noise] um it's client thought ill and has to be taken to the hospital he was in the hospital for a bit and after the hospital he has to go to rehab and he was in rehab now\nAsked questions if something doesn't sound right it's not\nAnd don't be afraid to speak up we are talking about situations where people are being admitted to inadequate facilities as factions are happening but unnecessary surgeries are being authorized when you're in a hospital you were scared your way out for whatever reason\nBut there are level heads that can guide to throw a if you're not that they all hospitals are bad all nursing homes or a bad 'cause there's wonderful people out there in the healthcare system however there are also some not a wonderful facility or a fall and I didn't know much about what you did coming in but\nIn Fifteen minutes I certainly understand the need for you and I commend you for what changes have I I saw had dropped from what you've been telling me so far\nAnd the problem becomes again hospitals and nursing facilities there for treatment rehabilitation I can make the personally even a better states and they came in for\nUs to go yeah if the protocols are not being followed at a watchful eyes are not on you you're being prematurely discharge which was only going to lead to you're guaranteed ... admitted it goes goes on and on and on because you're going to you re admitted to the same facility is we bought\nHer another week we're the winter we wear your we stay in the hospital\nFor the more than that you bought her a different hospitals fast rate of ... and you know the goal is to get out of the hospital credit harder every step of the economic people well this particular hospital advocate the like the you know their rifles one\nBeen telling me so far and the problem becomes again hospitals and nursing facilities there for treatment rehabilitation I can make the personally even a better ... states and they came in for\nUs to go yeah if the protocols are not being followed at a watchful eyes are not on you you're being prematurely discharge which is only going to lead to you're guaranteed ... admission and then they go goes on and on and on 'cause you're going to you re admitted to the same facility is\nWe bought her another week we're the ... here we are a number to where you stay in the hospital\nFor the more than that you bought her a different hospitals treated her like totally right yeah and you know the goal is to get out of the hospital credit hotter every step of the economic people well this particular hospital\nAdvocate ... like the you know their rifles went up to me where I have known what my ...\nBecause we can talk about this or when you're ready um we're doing a monitoring your new and better at this facility as welcoming us with open arms third base that we can go to ... where they're in for Chester\nGonna ... your case and you're okay so that's why I ask questions are it's part of your service so you're the advocate won the situation has happened you're in the facility um you're there to help the way you don't go to the\nHospital we don't hear it from the beginning and I'm sure there are released or that you saw him were family will authorize you to be privy to these conversations was not a violation is part of your service somewhat of a vetting a lot\nOf people are on the brink of looking for a nursing home care if they just come to you\nAnd your your independent I mean you don't own part of any nursing home or facility again you know there is no tracks with no referral ... none of us we're above board so you can give your honest opinion right\nI'm let's talk about that part of your job how can we how can what kind of questions because people ask you or should they start speaking to you how far far in advance of being in need of the pair\nOf like people calling in advance but it doesn't normally work out that way but if my daughter\nYou know mom from the hospital and you know she made a nursing home after that and you're you know you're busy or working you don't it's been a third to half time but not that you don't care but you don't have time to do that we're touring all the facilities in Westchester so where there was an art though\nAnd I just interject one thing so when you go into a hospital like there are certain things that most people don't know from time that the game they play now that they keep the ... the patient Andra survey said not admitting that not many but another day things and then we'll get to that when you're the\nOne another thing is when the minute you enter a hospital there already working on your discharge so they'll come to the patient you can never get out on time that's the part that I don't get\nReady to leave there has to do anyway as an aside [laughter] so um they'll come to the to the patient at you know five five thirty in the morning and and hand them take the paper was three nursing home there\nOthers where Augie right if they hear pick one you don't know what you're picking which leads us [laughter] you know whenever you go to a nursing homes or stuff rated there's no governing body that\nObject to play bridge right there is no outside agency that objectively right there because they had a ... page for re there or the central question hair stylist out and you know when when you really look at it you know most of them say well all of their residents you know are able to just about no\n... they don't but nobody on catheter nobody everybody can emulate it there's plenty staff and better than I can come to the funeral home and I can give you my rating system of theirs\nI don't get ready to leave there has been anyway as an aside [laughter] um they'll come to the\nTo the patient at you know five five thirty in the mornings and handlers piece of paper with three nursing home there\n... right if they hear pick one you don't know what you're picking which leads us would agree to a nursing homes their stuff rated there's no governing body that\nObject the blue ridge right there is no outside agency that objectively right there you go to ... pays for re there or the central question hair stylist out and you know when you when you really look at it you know it most of them say well all of their residents you know are able to get the best for\nNow at source but nobody on the opposite or nobody everybody can emulate it there's plenty staff and better than I can come to the funeral and when I can give you my ratings have to have nursing home based on that in my line of work but\nThat's frightening yeah and that's frightening for so we will not allow our\nClients to go to a substandard nursing home there is no objectivity and again if the hardest thing in the world to walk out of a facility at night when your loved one is there and you want to take them home\nAnd you want to be given the care but it's just at a level that exceeded what you're able to get us mode you're in panic mode but you know\nTo have peace of mind and to put your head on a pillow that night that alright mom or dad or there but they are cared for that's priceless right right but it sounds like not many people can have that peace of mind\nWith nursing facility so you have to do your homework if it's minor collecting a college basically don't graduate from high school and say okay you don't mind get a job I really going to go all the homework yeah and you know you should always independently that but\nHow are people who are entrenched in the system and know the questions to ask\n'em again that's a very key distinction I think it's all part of an insurance game too because if you're under observation then you're not admitted there different it it affects how you can be admitted into winter and I'm all\nMedicare we're insurance or pay for it right and some nursing homes will only take you after a hospital admissions so they kind of play this game and say OK admit life be fed or already you know you're out of ...\nAnd they're asking you to make decisions with no family members pride than right you know you could ask me a logical question at five AM in the morning at Lackland I'm On anything player was um it it's it's really it's a scary thing as well we don't want to alarm lifted the viewers didn't want to drive the message home\nThat list support and services when selecting nursing home\nAny type of skilled care do your service and the extent to home care or you strictly limited to facility care lake to home care if they don't I don't care how you would drop in there the licensing regulation there is a very different you can open up a home\nCare agency wasn't no credentials no back or I think you might be bonded with the state or the fingerprint of the really good help after their head writer right correct we were we we had a call a few weeks ago from a woman who called us about home care and she said the current uh home care aide she walks in one day and\nFound the woman literally you know about to you know corporate join join with her parents and the next room [laughter] funny but it's not funny it's ridiculous stories but we're [laughter]\nGot together or not people it's a job and it's an agency as I see it all the time and the networks and circle that I travel you know people say I want to come on the show I have a home care aid and said well no that's not enough in non right to promote something that I personally wouldn't recommend for my\nIn a little during the licensing regulation there is a very different you can open up a home\nCare agency wasn't no credentials idol back or I think you might be bonded with the state or the fingerprint of the really good help after that right but you know correct\nWe were we we had a call a few weeks ago from a woman who uh conduct about home care and she says the current uh home care aide she walks in one day and\nFound the woman literally you know about to you know corporate join join with her parents and the next room funny but it's not funny it's ridiculous stories but we're [laughter] don't got together or not\nPeople at some job and it's an agency as I see it all the time and the networks and circle that I travel you know people say I want to come on the show I have a home care aid and said well no that's not enough in non right to promote something that I personally wouldn't recommend for my own family or a\nUm [noise] and and the lack of regulation there I have to hope that going to change at some point because they sprout up and then it seems like the whole niche market just kind of boomed overnight uh-huh I Know where everybody had gotten to the mortgages Fifteen Years ago\nNow although the relation or they had enough for yeah for the following following the crowd but um but it's good to know that there are services out\nA chest devise objective the IRS that can guide you through this process and again\nThe whole point of our show with to advocate planning ahead to get the plant the planes and the time to make your plan when you least need them correct when you're happy and healthy but you know what if you're in your late seventies you can tell me a very vibrant that's great for I have a plan\nIn mind because it takes one crazy fall right on already well\nFed it'll change the course of your house or something that the miners flip to the motel the eighty year old person would raise the cost of health and it doesn't mean that life is over but it means that you have to now shift years and get yourself the proper care that you need to carry out the rest of her life\nBut if you had given some thought to what ... you may have considered ... and you can picture that while you were healthy and happy you are you doing great air out\nThe right to push for five forty a week the nursing home and if it's an living placement and we're not going to take a client that wants to go outside of living that have three months worth of resources laugh financial resources\nBecause that will be another change you know we we we explore everything there to talk to them about their finances we'll talk to have their paperwork ready the power to turn it over there or something that you hope was to make them throw the paper because again the paperwork property crime sorry and even\nNot as far as we have a network of return but if they don't have the employee referral network afterward I have ... how do people get in touch with you\n[laughter] camera than Westchester al ... so um my elder Africa's our [laughter] our phone number nine once for tonight to zero for for for are Facebook pages mile drive to Westchester Sarah okay\nNine months for tonight to zero for for for I cannot stress enough the importance of people watching or listening to call you Tony crisis that should arrive um are your thoughts [laughter] Westchester ... miles\nYou know for for for our Facebook page and smile drafted Westchester Sarah okay nine months for tonight to zero for for for I cannot stress enough the importance of people watching and listening to call you Tony crisis that should\nAlthough the story said here in New York the filming took place in Virginia\nNow we do have lots of TV shows and movies that are filmed here in Westchester so I mean you perhaps may have had your daily routine just third when you see all these cameras show up and stage crews and so on\nThe reason why it's filmed in Virginia is not what you might expect\nIs that because the mount Vernon and George Washington\nIt's not because the Monticello and Thomas Jefferson not because the amount daily or and James Madison the three and Virginia presidents at the beginning of our\nCountry and it's not even be goes through your town where the battle occurred that ended the war supposedly although that lasted two more years and it's not because the Williamsburg either or Jamestown\nThe reason why it's film there is because there's the prison in Virginia\nThere's the prison there with a lot of land\nAnd they took all those empty land that they had and they build said they build sets for\nTV shows or movies\nSo if you want a film Philadelphia you can go to this prison you want a film colonial New York you go to this president you on a film anything back in those times you can go to this prison and film are near ground so it's understandable why they would want a film there\nBut you lose a little in that\nYou remember the Andy Griffith show remember Mayberry member Andy in open ego and fishing will take that creek and now pretended to Huston\n'cause that's what they did in this TV show they have a creek there in Virginia they were showing Benedict Arnold leading by water by boat after he was exposed first line to turn West Point over to the British\n\nAnd they sell them there in the body of water that really looks like a creek and try to pass it off as the majestic Hudson River so this really points out the shortcoming and the limitations of the\nFilming in Virginia it really doesn't give you the sense of New York\nBut it's understandable why they would fill in there\n\nJack creek and now pretend it's the Hudson 'cause that's what they did in this TV show they have a creek there in Virginia they were showing Benedict Arnold leading by water by boat after he was exposed\nFirst line to turn West Point over to the British\nAnd they show him there in the body of water that really looks like a creek and try to pass it off as the majestic Hudson River so this really points out the shortcoming and the limitations of the\nFilming in Virginia it really doesn't give you that sense of New York\nBut it's understandable why they would film there\nDo you think that New York should have staged public relation events with these characters you think New York's citizen why did the actors to come to New York state and to go to West Point and to go to garrison where\nA genetic to Arnold live or to go to Terry town why not have the actor portraying John enjoy standing right there in carried down with at the very spot where he was caught\nWe even have teachers in here in Westchester and partner who created a play on Benedict Arnold and John Andre recreating their life\nWouldn't have been a great publicity so odd for New York to broadcast in the United states the tourist injury industry that here's where it really occurred\nWhat do you think that we have done that the number here is nine one for six three six zero one one zero\nNow I can tell you who did advertise on that show it was Virginia\nVirginia said come to Virginia the word revolution occurred\nMeanwhile you're just been watching an hour at the revolution occurred in New York and then at the end you would see Virginia same come to our state are you are the revolution occurred\nThey at least had the intelligence and marketing skill to realize if you have an audience\nThat interested in the American revolution why not market to them and have them come visit your site\nFor Virginia did that you're listening to find talk um

come to New York you want to see the side you want to bring your family here you want to spend money here in New York visiting the size of the American revolution\nSo you fly into LaGuardia or your drive here or you take the train and get off at Penn Station in New York\nNow what do you do where do you go what sites do you see how do you get there what travel\nItinerary have we created so people can see these sites where the American revolution occurred\n\nIf you suspect that the answer is no didn't create a single one you're exactly right we didn't if you came here you'd be totally on your own to figure out where you want to go what do you want to see in Westchester where do you want to stay in Long Island what do you want to stay in Manhattan\nWhere do you want to stay in the Hudson Valley and so on\nWhere you don't help you\nTo make that travel that trip that plan your on your own to figure it out for yourself\nNow it's the talk of this tried they've come up with a weekend program\n\nShows where all the people in the show live their actual house is still around has activities for the family and for the kids\nTo read those events so they've decided to take advantage of that still putting them on the map in the country and saying here we have something for you over this weekend but\nThey did that on their own and I congratulate them for doing it but it shows part of the problem\n\nFor let's say something else that occurs in New York how 'bout Hamilton you ever hear of that pretty well know musical\nI was there at the opening night of Hamilton when I went to buy tickets on line the whole theater was empty I could have picked any the I wanted\nI had no idea what was going to happen I just said oh OK I only needed a few states though are\nPicked the ones that I wanted to and that was that little there now I Know I should have maxed out my credit cards on every seat I could possibly buy for that show and all the ones to follow\nBut I didn't know at the time but again suppose you're interested in Hamilton and you wanted to come to New York and you want it\nDid you ever hear of that pretty well know musical I was there at the opening night of Hamilton when I went to buy tickets on line the whole theater was empty I could have picked any the I wanted\nI had no idea what was going to happen I just said oh OK I only needed a few states though are\nPicked the ones that I wanted to and that was that little you know I Know I should have maxed out my credit cards on every seat I could possibly buy for that show and all the ones to follow\nBut I didn't know at the time but again suppose you're interested in Hamilton and you wanted to come to New York and you wanted to see where Alexander Hamilton live\nHow would we help you do it as the state how would I Love New York help you figure out your trip\nHamilton's home still exist at the national Park Service site in Manhattan\nOr other colonial places you can visit and if not the original structure at least the location you can go there and maybe there'll be a sign or maybe they won't be\nYou can go up to Albany to members ... married into the style or family they had a house in Albany it's the state's side of the one in Manhattan the his own house is the federal government like the one in Albany is in New York state office the parks site\nBut again you're on your own if you say boy I Love Hamilton I'd really like to see more of that I'd like to visit the site but we don't help you\nKnow this is the kind of thing I write about in a block in other words I'm not writing about today's history I'm writing about how we are treating our own history in New York\nHow are we making people aware of how we're promoting it for tourism how are we teaching our children what happened in the very communities where they live they may walk\nBy sign statues memorials and have no idea why they're there because we don't make any effort to connect people have their location",
