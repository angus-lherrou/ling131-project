I Hope after the show everybody will ah will find out more about you because once again I I'm a huge proponent of that\nAnd um I can I see that the right doctor makes all the different than arming yourself against a cap on the element oh we had a doctor and let's talk about these winter well on the full story here with the ...\nThe first one obviously the winter ... that we always have to worry about is the flu and now for everyone out there listening let's recognize this year the flu is going to be a little more aggressive I hate to bring that sort of news to your but it is called the all the flu yeah actually happened\nVery very early in Australia typically a guy who was from October ... may oh but this year it started really in August over in Australia and we knew that it was going to be a little bit of a period even though\nThere are some things we need to at least ... today and understand a little bit more about the flu and how it works\nAnd explain that to us um you know so we're we're looking at a different strain of flu or is it just that the season began earlier\n[noise] well it's a little bit of both the season began a little earlier and this strain of each three aimed to strain and this one Dan tends to be a little more aggressive when we know that each and every year when we kind\nOf look down in Australia and in other areas in Asia the weeds over to us than the United states were able to at least try to guess what sort of strange are going to come to us and then that's when we make our flu vaccine and hopefully we kinda\nAre able to nail it when it gets a\nMan had at the flu vaccine work such individualized strains of the disease um how do we know I mean the cost this new one is here on the horizon it doesn't mean that the other ones are gone and my correct you can\nYour air rage and you're right it's pretty much a numbers game where we try to know which ones are at least number one the most aggressive and the one that we think we're going to be the most common and we try to do our best to kind of shoot it that in certain years were better than others we try to be around forty of course been taught to be pretty happy\nTo say we did a good job issues vaccine you may have heard a little more challenging a lot of the fact that the typical flu vaccine but that doesn't mean that we don't get the flu vaccine this year because at least it'll decrease it the verity should you get the flu so that's an important\nAnd that's when we make our flu vaccine and hopefully we kinda are able to nail it when it gets a\nSo how did how did the flu vaccine work such individualized strains of the disease um how do we know any across this new one is here on the horizon it doesn't mean that the other ones are gone and my correct you can\nWrite in your ear right you're right it's pretty much the numbers game where we try to know which ones are at least number one the most aggressive and the ones that we think we're going to be the most common and we try to do our best to kind of shoot it that in certain years were better than others we try to be around a forty of course been taught to be pretty happy\nTo say we did a good job this year's vaccine you may have heard a little more challenging it's not as effective as typical flu vaccine but that doesn't mean that we don't get the flu vaccine this year because what it means that it'll decrease the verity should you get the Pluto that's an important to keep them I\nDon't get me to have a flu vaccine children elderly people who work with children or work with the elderly just those through some group that you can put that broad generalization and they get that flu shot\nActually have what's called alma mater properties I don't know if you remember most is generally if you ever took by and I asked why do you remember right yeah they all have holes blew it out and so therefore you want to pull out some of the blue within a swollen sore throat\nWill hire like kind of a a wonder tonic if you think about it actually and and he's right growing some limit to get an extra added benefit all\nThat's going to jail [laughter]\nThank you Joe [laughter]\nI Want to I Want you to share with our audience doctor what is our out back about insulin that that most people might not know about\nOh gosh this is the fun stuff I'm a big trivia guy so what are the big but it's funny you know the the input when the actual virus comes from it it'd be a tie\nAnd root for and you and you may be able to help me with the hope your mom does the fear of I don't know if I go through that oh but but it was called input when the uh um buy into it influenced the debt because back then they thought that this was a pirate with actually influenced\nBy the stars of the moon or the planet so there was more or less ... so that's what actually the name ... almost always found pretty fascinated\nThat here and that's something that I certainly would have not have known some very good to be a doctor or another\nThing that's important to him that I should mention is that when you talk about the flu virus you have someone who's close to your everyone like you know I'm not that cold so I Can't get it but the flu virus that can live up to today on a surface\nSo therefore you can be in the city and think that everything's okay and they roll your hand you're in the subway and next thing you know that bars has been there for the second day and it's still able to get you think that's why we always get back to you know hand washing can never go wrong without that\nOh let's talk about um the modes of transmission for the flu virus it is a hand to hand out only contact I'm sharing of of food or drink I Am I mean it it's it's the immediate contact the most about contagion everyday correct\nYeah and unfortunately here we are and we're in New York very heavy populated even herring worse\nI Know another thing that's important to him that I should mention is that when you talk about the flu virus or you have someone who's close to your everyone like you know I'm not that cold so I Can't get it but the flu virus that can live up to today on a surface\nSo therefore you can be in the city and think that everything's okay and then lo your hand you're in the subway and next thing you know that bars has been there for the second day and it still able to get you know that's why we always get back to you know hand washing can never go wrong without that\nOh let's talk about the um the modes of transmission for the flu virus it is a hand to hand out only contact I'm sharing of of food or drink I Am I mean it's it's it's the immediate contact the most about contagion everyday correct\nYeah yeah and unfortunately here we are and we're in New York very heavy populated even here in Westchester we're a large population and so that's why I hand washing the only thing that really helps that one other question I get a lodge in it what about those anti bacterial ...\nDo you play on your next question about that [laughter]\nOh look great minds think alike [laughter]\nSo yeah you know that's important obviously you can't replace local water so if you're if you're home everyone please wash your hands with soap and water that same adage of try to think happy birthday to me the best way to watch you know you're doing a good job\nBut the other one bad bacteria they are okay if you're out and about I'd rather you wash your hands with something but it doesn't replace a good old fashioned so border\nOn green but then they have a doctor on the line I I have to ask this question because this is the ... they came into my home a few weeks ago my my daughter in the first grade came home with his knees and like the number five\nAnd I so I had chicken pox growing up I was pleasantly surprised to hear that we now vaccinated against that so the rash but I picked her up with with though she had a bad taste of it\nAnd it was so scary that they can pay period when way before that virus ever came out and there is on a fear of being around pregnant women here and there there's a lot to caution about\nIs this something that you weren't really traveled to the school and from what I'm hearing it's becoming more and more common and that's something we kept armor again it seems like it just comes out of nowhere\nYeah and that's what viruses typically do the best thing is like shows like yours where you're actually causing people to understand and know what it is that\nAnd hopefully go on the Internet and learn oh my gosh you know it's just my daughter and granddaughter now has this rash does she have the should I get her to the doctor so it's really awareness because it's a challenge when you talk about a lot of the pirates and so just like we talked today about the influenza virus or the flu\nIt's always important each and every year to kind of drill into our head it's about prevention it's about stocking up and getting ready each and every year because we know what's coming to lift be ready for it\nI'm not sure I Want to talk about some more homeopathic remedies because I I'm just a huge believer people only face a different western eastern medicine is often person the fat I'm at your trading the illness in western medicine whereas you're preventing the on the eastern medicine is there any credence to that\nYou know it actually it depends on which which the things you're talking about her and I'm One of the things I'm a big cross better and one that they could use a cost but a lot it are they care now or in a care is another homeopathic remedies but it helps we're paying swelling of grows and once again it's the studies show it all\nUp and this is actually in this case a little more of a treatment and even though you have to be careful when you say totally treat because it doesn't replace some of those other things depending on the on what's going on but the point is it's a benefit but it's so there are ways when you can find some benefit homeopathy glee that don't necessarily have to be warm\nI'm just a huge believer people only say a difference of western eastern medicine is often person the fat I'm that you're treating the illness in western medicine whereas you're preventing the on the eastern medicine is there any credence to that\n[noise] you know it actually it depends on which which the things you're talking about for instance I'm One of the things I'm a big cost spinner and one that they could use a cost but a lot it are they care now ... is another homeopathic remedies but it helps we're paying swelling in grows and once again it's the studies show it all\nAnd this is actually in this case a little more of a treatment and that even though you have to be careful when you say hold a treat because it doesn't replace some of those other things depending on the on what's going on but the point is it's a benefit um and so there are ways when you can find some benefit homeopathy glee that don't necessarily have\nTo be worn or the other connected by boat\nSo you think it's a good you know it's a good thing because I Know an awesome time you know only a path to remedy and talked to Smith by doctors I think that makes a they'd give you certainly a leg up that you embrace that offend you're treating the person\nOnly a only by incorporating both by it but I Do believe it's it's a combination of both and one shut down the other\nSo I I Do too giant and look I might get it but as I mentioned before I Am worse than a train and I didn't learn that stuff and my training either and so there are some things that I think are effective as something that I think are ineffective but I think the kids that you come together with the patient you have a discussion and then you go do your homework to meaning myself and then the patient when we come back together and say you know actually\nThere is a good study and it doesn't seem like there'll be any harm one always be where we can go with that so I think it's important to have to bring in different ... Haley\nAdopted you specialize in internal medicine you treated athlete between the liberty you treat in local you treated really you run the gamut on who you treated\n'em once again concierge medicine is offering and enhance patient Dr relationship if someone is just spinning in towards the end of our show I really want to make people aware of you and also why they should can enter\nPerhaps leaving one of these groups are but that's all you really see out there now at the local doctor the doctor next door and he gets old fashioned doctor with a ... now been forced to join in a larger group and through no fault of his or her own however the personal care is almost Akron fight\nSo someone's just Sunni and can you briefly explain the enhanced doctor patient bond through your concierge practice\nNow the thing that's important for me but it's ... or send us once again that the patient has always at the top the patient as a decision maker and a partner in your care so one thing I always say James I think that the patient could feel it should go like a member of your family because when you think that way to help our come the better and also the position there are very happy\nAlso so it's allowed me to deliver care on the patient time given the access\nBut I think patients deserve and you know I think health care is slowly moving in that direction of the patients are demanding a lot more than they than they used to in the ...\nAbsolutely you know any whatever industry in her field that you weren't in nothing at the same today I was five years ago my my thought on a funeral industry that actually I think it's changed but the practice of law you know the introduction of well not the introduction by the\nAmount of information available on the Web I'm from makes a lot of their on their own doctors and their own way I Want to caution against that I'm at this is a wonderful resource right here in the heart of West right here in east chest or where are you located a doctor can read ...\nOh gosh so I Am in Asia or wonder things I've been doing a large at I've been really kind of hitting the road I just got back from Dallas\nGiven the access but I think patients deserve and you know I think health care it's slowly moving that direction of the patients are demanding a lot more than they than they used to in the past\nAbsolutely you know any when every industry in her field that you were in nothing at the same today I was five years ago my my thought on the funeral industry that actually I think it's a change but the practice of law you know the introduction of well not the introduction by the\nAmount of information available on the Web I'm trying to make a lot of time on their own doctors and their own way I Want to caution against that I'm like the wonderful resource right here in the heart of West right here in east chapter where are you located Dr ken Red Cross\nOh gosh so I Am in Asia or wonder things I've been doing a large at I've been really kind of hitting the road I just got back from Dallas I'm a black night late and I travel around the U.S and so I kind\nOf say now that I provide concierge tearing through your homes whether to take the radio and TV [noise] um\nBecause we're all so much but I think it's important to get the word out and also to talk about um some alternative way scaling as well so by all means by website yeah kind of on air Yeah Dr Red Cross dot com but if people want to just a check me out and the other thing that you want to say hello Facebook is Ken Red Cross and again\nI'm Twitter is at Dr Red Cross I'm always willing to say hello and then when the moon know much about that\nDr Red Cross R. E. D. U. R. O. S. as Dr Red Cross dot com a quick question for you Dr if you will find your self talk with the flu how long did you stay indoors and stay home before you return to work every year when I when I get affected by it\nAnd they really try to kick me out of the off and then I go crazy that's a different disease but\nThat is totally different that's a different surgeon up and down [laughter] after\nYou will be back for sure about how long can you stay home or keep yourself somewhat a ... yeah\nYeah I usually say a weekend or a five day weekend the weekend to kind of I'm kind of get you back on your back on the you know where you need to get to as far as work because you know your body's going to be pretty weak afterwards do you think you're you're ready to go and do nothing worse than getting back to work to only have to come back the next week or ... back to some\nVery true and how about the life and it's just the common cold or how long does that really think Iran through your body\nYeah that typically lingers and that also helps you recognize you're dealing with the cold and flu could believe me when you have the real blue Jen you come in and you want to get treating your bill miserable and thank God it doesn't last as long as the common cold which can absolutely\nYou economic development projects that had seen many of his closest aides hold off the hooves gallop\nYeah it has not been particularly with the buffalo bill you know I mean that is a black mark on what he was previously a very you know the proud accomplishment for him you know they've port I think one point five billion dollars or so and and counting into buffalo\nAnd there are some concrete accomplishments there but obviously the conviction of all I encounter heroes you know and to bid rigged there was the biggest project seven hundred and fifty million dollars for the solar plant on the on the banks the buffalo ... river\nIt's tough to kind of then said the buffalo billion is a unanimous success when you've got this giant corruption or right at the heart of it\nYou know and and by the same token some of the smaller for stuff like start up New York you mentioned have really spot or do you know that was an idea that he thought would work he thought it was going to be ten years based what tax free for new companies that were either expand our sport start up in New York state and it just never really took off so\nYou know if you talk to his economic development people part of it is we got to try things you know we we have to try something that isn't so those are going to work and some are not going to work and\nX Y and Z and and I think that there is some validity to that but obviously during a political season a opponent like Mark Marlon narrow is going to pick up on the failures and he is going to attack those failures and he's going to talk about um again and again and again\nOne of the things it seems a bit short sighted my analysis now and I haven't heard a lot of criticism on this may be because both sides have supported these projects or the casinos I mean you see all these casinos all around the north east some of the latest including in Springfield, Massachusetts and they're all in close proximity that's got to drain the Robin is\nI mean the the word in the in the industry is saturation and you know we did a series four or five years ago where we looked at this and I've covered casinos on and off for probably a decade and there is absolutely an issue in the northeast where\nIt used to be very rare to find a casino you know for decades the only place you could get them on the eastern seaboard was basically laid land like city and then after a tribal casinos came online you know yet foxwoods in Connecticut but still it was very small number of places where you could place at that\nNowadays you can place that pretty much anywhere and you mentioned Springfield you know obviously New Jersey has been aggressive about gaming they actually just got online gambling so you can bet on sporting sporting events\nWhich of course will be something that New York will probably have to take off in this coming legislative session you know people do like to bet on sports and now that the Supreme Court has cleared the way for that sort of thing [noise] New York is at least a year behind New Jersey and getting mad online\nAnd even in brick and mortar casinos you know the four that they authorized a couple of years ago\nHas been sputtering as well some of them you know the dialogue casino outside Rochester is not in great\nOn the eastern seaboard was basically laid land like city and then after a tribal casinos came on line you know yet foxwoods in Connecticut but still it was very small number of places where you can place at that\nNowadays you can place that pretty much anywhere and you mentioned Springfield you know obviously New Jersey has been aggressive about gaming they actually just got online gambling so you can bet on sporting

authorized a couple of years ago\nHas been sputtering as well some of them you know the dialogue casino outside Rochester is not in great financial shape for most analysts of perspective the reverse casino in Schenectady I think has done better but has had some troubles\nOr you know initial reports out of Monticello or they felt a billion dollar casino in the Catskills are that you know that has not exactly taken off the way they want it to all go that's owned by this giant gambling come again saying so they've they've got the pockets\nBut still the the idea that casinos would somehow results and kind of broad prosperity that promise hasn't come true either now the only copy on that with that is that it did create a lot of construction jobs you know these places are very fancy and they they have all the bells and whistles\nAnd so although they were being constructed they they looked great and and people certainly were employed but\nLong term you know it's probably too early to say but the initial indications are it hasn't quite than the boom that they don't have ... anticipated\nRight well let's go now to primary results and onto the general election we of course know that Governor Andrew Cuomo one big primary he not only win big for his own race but he gets his hand picked candidate regime was James\nYou know for all the talk of the corruption joke for ... for example and of course before the latest scandals deans gallows head of the Senate and ... Sheldon Silver\nAlso involved in corruption scandals and the issue of you know just you and I ... and the rest of us political insiders were all over the stories we see it all the time\nIt makes is perhaps a little cynical about politics in New York state but is the general public really paying attention\nWell you know it's it's a great point there is often what seems to me it was hurting at this curious disconnect where you read the polls right the polls come out and how do you feel about corruption and you know eighty Ninety percent of the respondents will say oh corruption is a horrible problem that's awful it's awful it's awful\nBut then when we get to election days it seems that corruption very rarely puts a dance an ambition\nThat because it's endemic did you see it as part of the system we can't do anything about corruption they're all corrupt but we're going to vote for our guy or ... or mid\nFor me to confess any sort of a bubble but I think sometimes when you're interested in politics and you're covering politics and you're talking politics it is easy to feel like it really is the whole world but you do have to remember that for most people\nPolitics is something that they pay attention to every two years or more likely every four years during the presidential cycles and other than\nThat not everybody out there is you're hanging on every political twist and turn and so when they do pay attention it may not be the first thing that catches there I I mean the political advertising obviously works I think Cuomo maximize his political advertising during the primary to kind of both juices numbers and help\nAn ambition\nThat because it endemic did you see it as part of the system we can't do anything about corruption they're all corrupt but we're going to vote for our guy or ... or mid\n... for me to confess and they sort of a bubble but I think sometimes when you're interested in politics and you're covering politics and you're talking politics it is easy to feel like it really is the whole world but you do have to remember that for most people\nPolitics is something that they pay attention to every two years or more likely every four years during the presidential cycles and other than\nThat not everybody out there is you're hanging on every political twist and turn and so when they do pay attention it may not be the first thing that catches there I I mean the political advertising obviously works I think Cuomo\nMaximize his political advertising during the primary to kind of both the juices numbers and help his down ballot people\nBut you know not everyone's paying attention all the time so when corruption scandals emergent make it a lot of coverage they might catch someone's I here and there but do they remember that you know six months or a year later or two years later when they actually go to the pole\nIt's not completely clear at all and and you know I think you're going to see a very interesting race on a federal level with Chris Collins who is the congressman out of buffalo\nWho is under indictment for insider trading and is running for Congress and I would not that against Chris calling us getting re elected I think he's in a very safe Republican district tea is popular in that district or at least was certainly before he got arrested\nBut you know even being arrested even being under indictment may not knock him out of out of the Congress so\nYou know he's he's going to run and and that's a pretty safe district people probably when he's you know he's facing a spirited challenge from a Democrat but you know I Would not that against Chris columns in that and and then of course if he does actually get the you know\nConvicted then it went up to give up his seat and all bets are off but for the time being he's on the ticket\nWe're talking with Jesse McKinley the Albany bureau chief for the New York times\nYeah so we have other congressional races to muddled stick with that theme I mean one of the big ones of course isn't the mohawk valley you have a strange that there was some sort of you to go down to the Binghamton area many Republican and you've got Anthony Brindisi as the Democrat\nThat's quite a race interesting dynamics and now it's getting pretty dirty with quite the accusations coming from the tiny camp being launched ... Family Association\nYeah I think that race is\nThat race has been pretty fair some since the beginning you know I think if you talk to national Democrats that is more important said for Democrats if they want to flip the house it is as you've mentioned are kind of an interesting geographical area Utica is a pretty solid democratic\nBastion but his surrounded by a lot of very conservative area is Tammy has a reputation for being a real true believer of the Trump Administration are real firebrand\nAnd sharp elbows ... he was coming out of the state assembly here I think has a good reputation for for being a somewhat of a moderate to left Democrat which probably works out in that district I Believe he voted against the say fact which was governor Cuomo's gun control bill from a couple of years ago\nSo they're real dog fight out there and you know if you talk to pollsters it's a toss up and and it it will really come down to probably turn out and I think in that regard\nDemocrats both from DC and statewide are going to be in possession of advantage because\nThe Democrats feel very bullish about this November they feel like they're going to be a huge turnout\nAlmost certainly feels like he got a huge turnout primary day at one point five million people voted in in a primary that only drew moments six hundred thousand people four years ago or those sorts of ah indications would would suggest that the Democrats are really engage that really\nHas a good reputation for for being a somewhat of a moderate to left Democrat which probably works out in that district I Believe he voted against the say fact which was governor Cuomo's gun control bill from a couple of years ago\nSo they're real dog fight out there and you know if you talk to pollsters it's a toss up and and it it will really come down to probably turn out and I think in that regard\nDemocrats both from DC and statewide are going to be in possession of advantage because\nThe Democrats feel very bullish about this November they feel like they're going to be a huge turnout\nAlmost certainly feels like he got a huge turnout with primary to you know at one point five million people voted in in a primary that only drew almost six hundred thousand people four years ago\nOr those sorts of uh indications would would suggest that the Democrats are really engage that really energized they really want to come out and said that that sort of turnout will help democratic candidates I think also in the Hudson Valley that that the John pass at rice with him to San Antonio Delgado\nThat's going to be on the nail biter too you know I think that's Delgado is\nIs that Chris Medicare man and and is running a kind of spirit race I think he's getting a lot of money thrown against him by national Republicans and and as a fighter too so you know come November eighth right November ... I think that's\nCorrect oh you know those are the sorts of races where you you know it might be a couple of thousand votes one way or another that that's why is that and by extension those are the types of seats that that could conceivably flip the house\nWhat's interesting to me is this other angle on the whole idea of money for a legend so reached between Delgado and fast so for example the ads coming from the Republican National committee over and over and over and over again going after do got all the ads on the side and just this issue of", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Fresh Air (NPR)", "city": "New Rochelle", "day": "03"}
