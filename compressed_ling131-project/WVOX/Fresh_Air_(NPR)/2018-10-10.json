day thank you Tim\nAre talking about once again very very important subjects earlier this morning we spoke about geriatric depression and later in life depression and we'd segue now into another I'm\nVery sensitive very rough topic but something nonetheless that merits our attention and awareness we'll be speaking about elder abuse it recognition at the prevention\nAnd a ways that we can stop the signs and also maybe um gift caregivers the support that they need a lot that will be discussing today with Nicole burn alley my guess she's the elder abuse prevention coordinator for families serve it to the west Chester welcome the Cole\nI'm happy to have you with us so we've had represented at the family services before\nUm I think we should start by just letting people know what exactly family services is uh the nature of the organization\nAnd um I Know you do a lot of services but just tell us a little bit\nAh family services west Chester is a nonprofit\nAt a nonprofit in Westchester we have over fifty different programs\nFor all different ages I'm sure all different ages\nAnd and there's tons for youth country seniors goes on all over we every agents stage right every agent stage we have offices all over the county as well um my particular program at the elder these program it's one of several senior programs that we have okay uh and so we\nWelcome the Cole I'm happy to have you with us so we've had representatives from family services before um I think we should start by just letting people know what exactly family services is uh the nature of the organization and um I Know you do a lot of services\nBut just tell us a little bit out it's a family services west Chester is a nonprofit\nAt a nonprofit in Westchester we have over fifty different programs\nFor all different ages\nI'm sure all different ages and and\nThere's tons for use country seniors goes on all over we every agents stage right every agent stage we have offices all over the county as well um my particular program is elder these program it's one of several senior programs that we have okay ah\nAnd so we just provide seniors with lots of support um who are at risk of being abused or currently being abused [noise]\nYou know it's so hard first of all the youth takes on so many forms um you know sometimes the word just makes us think physical but emotional verbal psychological uh\nThey are all in fact ways in which somebody can be abused and often times probably the biggest problem you've seen said is that\nA victim don't I self identify or they don't come for help or they don't report or they probably you know in the vulnerable population were speaking about a senior and\nThey probably don't even realize that they're falling under the category of an elder abuse victim um Phillips to start at the beginning obviously we called elder abuse because we're talking about somebody in later years a sixty five\nAn older so it's actually in Westchester at sixty and all their you know or I'm putting out can burn and six fifty an older really there are reasons for the the categorical difference I'm Still Mount Vernon we get 'em funding through Mount Vernon community block grant 'em\nAnd they want it to be fifty I guess they just recognize that this is a problem that you know that being said then if they're fun they're why not help more people understandable and also they can have physical challenges mental challenges as well at fifty yeah make them more vulnerable can ignore that\nAll of the list [laughter] I'm not I'm not every I'm a moral not that\nFar behind you um how would you define the term elder\nAbuse though from Europe ... from your clinical perspective so it's really can be a single or repeated\nUm pattern um sometimes isolated event where there's some kind of harm done to a senior and those age range it's um [noise]\nAnd it has to be by a person in a position of try so that's your caregiver but that can be like a family are very close friend [noise]\nSo it's somebody that you trust to somebody in a position a in a close in a close relationship in a position where they're able to inflict harm and you'd say it can be an isolated or can be recovering\nUm let's talk a bit about the types of people\nThat tend to be the perpetrator so you'd said caregiver yeah it can be somebody of familial nature can be a family member or it can be somebody that you hire from an agency and Nicole I'm sure you see this\nUm there are so many agencies out there for home health care\nAnd through the show I have caused to me lots of people involved in that and my message is always the same vetting I'm going through proper\nCaregiver but that can be like a family are very close friend [noise]\nSo it's somebody that you trust to somebody in a position a an a close in a close relationship in a position where they're able to inflict harm and you say it can be an isolated or can be recovering\nUm let's talk a bit about the type of people\nThat tend to be the perpetrator so you'd said caregiver yeah it can be somebody of familial nature can be a family member or it can be somebody that you hire from an agency and Nicole I'm sure you see this\nUm there are so many agencies out there for home health care\nAnd through the show I have caused to meet lots of people involved in this and my message is always the same vetting I'm going through proper screening investigating background not going with the for the agency that you'd see trusting your got 'em talk a little bit about\nYou know when you come out of a hospital you are in crisis mode and you're trying to get the person back home and you're trying to get the proper Karen and you know when you have people working or with your own family that's hard for them to get care to their aging parents\nSo you just kind of the tendency might be just to get someone to fill that position without researching the options again home care agencies on there aren't they are round bed and\nThere has to be more than just getting a body in the room you have to look at background checks don't be afraid to ask questions and if something doesn't sound right and doesn't add up like you said it's probably not [laughter] I'm actually [noise] so\nWhat are some services that your program provides for people who have been uh been victims of elder abuse\nUm so we do a lot of um supportive counting so I'll go one on one counseling with them for a a temporary basis um I'll provide if they want it more long term [noise] um I can provide them with fraud for people that will come into their home so they don't even have to leave [laughter]\nOkay um I can do a lot of referrals to transportation uh housing is another big one senior centers community center so they're not as isolated have interactions with people um\nDo a support group in white plains um two times a month the first from people who have been victims of them okay I'm or just at risk I think they're vulnerable I'm there more than welcome to commit the first and the third one days okay ordering off your sometimes\nWe'll talk we'll remind people later on the show to uh where where the ... can be obtained yet [noise] um [noise] do you have a particular kind of approach when providing services to older\nOf um supportive counseling so I'll go one on one counseling with them for a day a temporary basis um I'll provide if they want it more long term [noise] um I can provide them with fraud for people that will come into their home so they don't even have to leave [laughter] okay um I can do a lot of referrals to transportation uh\nHousing is another big one senior centers community center so they're not as isolated have interactions with people\nUm we do a support group in white plains um two times a month the first for people who have been victims of them okay I'm or just at risk I think they're vulnerable I'm there more than welcome to commit the first and third Wednesday's okay ordering off your sometimes\nSo we'll talk we'll remind people later on the show to oh where where the ... can be obtained yet [noise]\nUm [noise] do you have a particular kind of approach when providing services to older adults I mean is it uh your your background is in counseling and therapy and mental health but to have a different approach to dealing with seniors\nUm it's a lot of kind of listening to their once they um and anybody who is experiencing abused its listening to them and their story in what they need and want because they know their life the best I I Know nothing about them I Know just little pieces\nUm but really it comes down to them making those decisions and just kind of supporting them giving them options I'm pointing out things that they might not see right but still letting them make the decision right um what are some of the challenges\nThat senior faith and west Chester county trying to to get help and the more that they just don't come forward and identify as victims it is that the biggest challenge or that that you recognize the problem and finding a solution for it\n[noise] um there's some challenges Westchester huge services are spread out mhm\nI'm so some of them can access like transportation is a really big thing for a lot of the seniors perch transits great um but if they can't they don't have somebody to go with them if they're in a wheelchair then it's very challenging to use pair transit\nUm some of them can't afford taxis so getting them to the services it's a bit of a challenge but then also yes them not recognizing that India dumb [noise]\nSo is that one\nOf the reasons that somebody might not seek help or assistance like the ability to get to help or you know is it also just because the stigma that involves you don't want to\nSay that you're a victim you don't want to get anybody in trouble you don't want to complain to your children or you don't want you know for some people perhaps maybe they they are afraid to children will move them out of their home and into a facility um [noise]\nTalk a little bit about how we removed the barrier and the stigma that people do come forward and\nI'm a lot of it is education I've had a lot of people tell me they don't realize that violence can happen I'm In their household except with their spouse their they remember like domestic violence and just think people in their twenties and thirties newlyweds\nUm they don't realize that can be their children or grandchildren their husband or wife until their eighties I Know people that are an idea and just getting divorced because it will be planted 'em but even their caregivers the people that come the age they don't they're afraid they're going to get in trouble um they're afraid that people are going to convince them that\nYou know they're forgetting things are making things up\nA they're afraid their children if it's not the children it is this caregiver from an agency they're convinced the caregiver um it's going to convince their child that they're making things up and then a lot of it is also a fear of a nursing home right they're terrified of nursing home right here at all the time and that's sad too\nViolence can happen I'm In their household except with their spouse like they're they remember like domestic violence and just think people in their twenties and thirties newlyweds\nUm they don't realize it can be their children or grandchildren their husband or wife into their eighties I Know people that are an idea and just getting divorced because the movies um but even their caregivers the people that come like they they don't they're afraid they're going to get in trouble um they're afraid that people are going to convince them that\nYou know they're forgetting things are making things up\nA they're afraid their children if it's not the children it is this caregiver from an agency they're convinced the caregiver um it's going to convince their child that they're making things up and then a lot of it is also a fear of a nursing home right they're terrified of nursing home right I hear all the time and that\nSaid to him and now a days and then and you can understand no one wants to leave their home but nowadays the options around um are so much better they are and they weren't before so sometimes that fear but\nIf we can remove that stigma to you know they might it might be sometimes that might be the better answer um [noise]\nWhat are some of the resources that are offered from your programs with the counseling or they'll feed for these services you have your support groups any fee that\nThey're all free okay and it doesn't matter about income that's another question I get it doesn't matter with income everything free um but the counseling it's kind of temporary I see people about six months to a year usually um and so it's you know\nBy the programs going to the support group can be ongoing um yeah the support group\nAfter the six month two year um or when I retire like needs met referrals are done case management either done um you can continue coming to the support group\nTo find that the number of members of the groups that are growing do you find 'em\nMore of a you know when when people in the organization maybe it's been there longer um\nAre there are more bodies in the room and the these are people speaking up a little bit more now than they perhaps where before it goes in\nWaves um be were were low right now but it's a lot of it is that right now it's hard to find the group space\nUm that everybody can access comes it has to be handicap accessible right I'm a lot of seniors don't want to drive at night and not put a lot of the spaces are open right right right um and also\nWe're really thing like the conflicting message resenting of home does it because all my work is done at home but it's it's a cause that they don't have to come out anywhere that they don't feel comfortable but then we're going to ask them to come right\nSo hopefully by that point I mean they're going to the group after they've had the visit so after they've had the report build with you and they have the trust and you when you were able to say okay it's time to go on to the group setting you know perhaps that\nIt is different than if they off the bat how to come and do that I Am a stick them on you know you probably earn their trust exact [noise] um [noise]\nTalk a bit about caregivers who unintended lead inflict abuse um\nYou know caregiving is a very stressful will oftentimes caregivers are giving hair on top of full time employment uh raising their own children I'm\nThere could be a human nature and do the tendencies to snap even with your raising your voice and [noise] and um uh again I'm sure not intended but talk a bit about um caregiver and the need for them to have support to enable them to get better care\nYeah there's definitely and the there's actually a different they call it active for passive um neglect an active neglected when you're intentionally neglecting ...\nProbably earn their trust exact [noise] um [noise] talk a bit about caregivers who unintended lead inflict abuse um\nYou know caregiving is a very stressful will oftentimes caregivers are giving hair on top of full time employment uh raising their own children I'm\nThere could be a human nature and do the tendencies to snap even with your raising your voice and [noise] and um uh again I'm sure not intended but talk a bit about um caregiver and the need for them to have support to enable them to get\nBetter care yeah there's definitely and the there's actually a different they call it active for passive um neglect an\nActive neglected when you're intentionally neglecting intentionally withholding food medication um any major intentionally doing it but\nPassive is more when you don't realize what you're doing right you might not have had the most education on how to care for like a ... you know that there's medications really have to be taken at the time so you're not intentionally doing it [noise] um so while it's still bad it's a little bit easier to work with because I probably don't want to continue this pattern you want that helped\n'em so there are tons of 'em like caregiver support groups available throughout the county um if you're a loved one is and like a rehab or a nursing home\nThey oftentimes not everyone but a lot of them do have their own support groups that you can go to I'm taking your own counseling and beneficial um and kind of calling around and seeing if there's other services because there are a lot of free services and the county not\nJust with my program but there's a lot of other even ... has a lot of other programs\nYou know we always talk about what Chester and then the taxes that we pay here which are quite significant but\nThere are great services as well so take advantage of them you're here you're a resident here free services available to you for caregivers support but also again for elder abuse prevention it's not okay to be ... treated 'em at any age of your life or at any stage of your life\nBut there are things that can be done um again if you find yourself getting excess money to family members you don't have to do that um if you find caregivers in your home or\nHelp things are companion that are speaking harshly or or myth handling you physically or just being down to you you don't have\nTo undergo that so family services the west Chester Nepal herself and the organization that large they are here to help and really family services runs the gamut of yeah services like we'd say every age and every stage\nBut tell us again um [noise] there are programs available for elder abuse prevention victims can we go on a website and find out or get information to call you\nUm so you can go on the family services of West Chester website which is I Believe it's just a family services Westchester dark at that W yet or and you get yeah OK family services west shuts sort of their phone number for you um yes my phone number is ... I went for\nOut or get information to call you and so you can go on the family services the west Chester website which is I Believe it's just a panic Harris just watched it got dark at that W yet or and you get yeah OK family services last chapter that their phone number four yeah um yeah my phone number is and I went for\nChester I'm referring to the American revolution it wasn't simply a story of patriotic colonial's versus the British military there were plenty of loyalists here in America is well\nJohn Adams future second president of United States\nFamously divided the American population than two thirds but the biggest group was not the patriots or loyalists but to go away and leave me alone group\nThe majority of the population and really just wanted to be left on their farms\nProviding food they needed for their family to survive and not be involved in a military conflict\nUnfortunately didn't always work out that way for them but it was a war that split families communities and split the country where you all Warren on one side\n[noise] so how did America saw the first civil war well it was pretty simple the losers left this newer loyalists you got out of town\nIn New York especially upstate New York are you headed north into Canada\nIf you're in the New York city area then you left on what's known as evacuation day November twenty fifth Seventy eighty three the final departure British troops in the city they occupied for many years\n\nEvacuation day was a holiday celebrated in New York not nationally but in New York for many years\nUp until World War one the Irish immigrants\nAnd the Eighteen hundreds especially enjoy celebrating evacuation day they just they got to stick it to the British and that was great for them but was the ... World War one then it wasn't so good to condemn England as an enemy since we have our allies\nIn a war\nAt that point little over a hundred years ago the holiday stopped\nThe few years ago the lower Manhattan historical association again as I said I'm On the board of that decided to revive this holiday and we began celebrating evacuation day not necessarily on November twenty fifth we sometimes very it based on Thanksgiving\nYears up until World War one\nThe Irish immigrants in the Eighteen hundreds especially enjoy celebrating evacuation day they just they got to stick it to the British and that was great for them\nBut was the ... World War one man and it wasn't so good to condemn England as an enemy since we have our allies in a war\nSo at that point little over a hundred years ago the holiday stopped\nThe few years ago the lower Manhattan historical association again as I said I'm On the border that decided to revive this holiday and we began celebrating evacuation day not necessarily on November twenty fifth we sometimes\nVery it based on Thanksgiving and weekends and so on but we did petitions successfully the New York city council to rename the area by Bowling Green in lower Manhattan as evacuation day\nIn honor of the British finally leaving New York\nHowever this war really has come to an end\nIf you consider the popularity of princes Diana fate and Meghan I think it's pretty safe to say at this point that bygones be bygones and we're no longer really at war or in opposition to the British\nSecond civil war is a little different\nThat war known as the war of northern aggression in the confederacy is still being fought\nNot as violently as it was back then went over seven hundred and fifty thousand people died the bloodiest war in American history far beyond anything in Afghanistan Iraq in Vietnam\nBut a generation after that war ended a different theme was developed by the daughters of the confederacy\nHe began to promote what's known as the lost cause and this re define the south in a certain way that continues to live on to this very day\nThere cause the lost cause this idea of the south where slavery was misspelled harsh and the war was really an act of northern imperialism was aided by such things that go on with the wind\nStill the number one movie in America based on a percentage of the population and reach and on the total revenue used it had\nThat created a definitive image of the south including slavery that has continued for generations to come afterward showing in the Nineteen thirty\nIt came to define what the south means to a lot of people the same way for example the ten commandments later defined what he actually just means\nBut where is Charlton Heston played a real figuring that movie Clark Gable did not in his but nonetheless Rhett Butler has become as popular as real in history in the minds of people as Ben hur\nThere's no real end in sight for this civil war you've had the ... we celebrated one hundred fifty years since the civil war\nWe've had all our celebration as an anniversary but still the hostilities between the north and south remain\n\nIt doesn't look like anything really can solve that\nPeople the same way for example the ten commandments later defined what he actually this means\nThat whereas Charlton Heston played a real figure in that movie Clark Gable did not in his but nonetheless Rhett Butler has become as popular as real in history in the minds of people as Ben hur\nThere's no real end in sight for this civil war we've had this ethical centennial we celebrated one hundred fifty years since the civil war\nWe've had all our celebration as an anniversary but still the hostility between the north and south remain\n\nIt doesn't look like anything really can solve that\nAbraham Lincoln said a house divided cannot stand well we're still a house divided even after more than a hundred and fifty years\nAnd if you have any suggestions as to how that might be solved please give us a call here at nine one for six three six zero one one hero\nOne suggestion is let's not try to keep the house United\nLet's accept the fact that we really don't get a lot that we really have a news that we really consider ourselves to be part of different countries after all the confederacy has\nIts own flag which we still see all the time\nThe confederacy has its own national anthem\nThe confederacy has its own monuments and memorials which have really cost a lot of problems in recent years\nSo there's still a tremendous difference between the two areas of the country\nNow unlike with the first civil war the losing side can't just go sail off into the horizon you can't just pack up that many people and say OK wars over where you are and you lost so now you have to leave that's not going to work\nBut we can recognize the fact that perhaps we are a divided country and perhaps we are better off recognizing that then try to pretend that we're still can live together\nIf you look around the world today we've seen lots of countries have divided remembered Czechoslovakia well that's not a country anymore\nDo you remember Pakistan well that's now two countries remember the Soviet Union that's a whole lot of countries remembering Yugoslavia well that's not there anymore either how about England Great Britain the United kingdom\nSo maybe we need to think about\nFood we really try to force people to live together who don't agree with each other on basic fundamental values or should we just accept the fact that well we really don't but we have differences of opinion and we might be better off if we weren't part of a single entity\nNow that's a bit of a stretch I admit that it wouldn't be easy to separate the two but we have to start somewhere and pay for over differences and pretending that we can live together is not going to be the way to a better tomorrow\nWe had a chance to experience this recently with\nEither how about England Great Britain the United kingdom\nSo maybe we need to think about\nFood we really try to force people to live together who don't agree with each other on basic fundamental values or should we just accept the fact that well we really don't but we have differences of opinion and we might be better off if we weren't part of a single entity\nNow that's a bit of a stretch I admit that it wouldn't be easy to separate the two but we have to start somewhere and paper over differences and pretending that we can live together is not going to be the way to a better tomorrow\n\nWe had a chance to experience this recently with the Syrian civil war the one that just happened with the cabin owes versus the cab of yes\nBefore I turn to that I Want to remind you you're listening to find talk with Peter fine then I'm W. V. O. X. community radio the call number here is nine one for six three six zero one one zero\nThe third civil war with the ... yeses is one that's actually going on for quite a while\n\nOkay before I get into that let me take this caller\n[noise]\nEr Chris you're on TALK with Peter Simon on WB away\nOkay just to the conversation I think the biggest break down and our constitutional democracy is a breakdown of the separation of church and state [noise]\nWant to explain that a little what you mean I'm Sorry what did you explain a little what you mean by separation of church and state or some examples\nOf having a little hard time hearing yeah that that is one of the founding principles\nYou know all about democracy and I believe that that it's been a compromise show great extent by the Tea Party but will it just right and I think that's probably the biggest threat to the issue [noise]", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Fresh Air (NPR)", "city": "New Rochelle", "day": "10"}
