based system a here what where we're seeing all these expensive services so how does this for teaching insurance out those\nBasically the the that we don't take insurance okay um we we have insurance for\nWere insured button or would you not accept insurance business completely private for not out of pocket and we're in very affordable um you know anywhere from Fifteen to twenty five dollars an hour depending on what your knees or if you want someone just in the house for a few hours or overnight or to spend the weekend and I'm\nWhat's so it's it's it's approachable ... says on some exorbitant fee it's not like you're going to pay\nTo be and then going directly\nThem directly so it's a very very reasonable so do you communicate with your service providers and your clients after\nLet's say you know the relationship began to get a check in as barren as the interview and has been done with the caretaker out of the night\nLifted the services the client we do check and we have periodic check ins with both um\nAnd you know we just want to make sure that everybody's happy that there's no issues maybe maybe the care provider was not happy because the personal requires more help than\nOriginally told them I think that we need to know you know we also need to know maybe it's\nSo it's it's approachable the pain of all I mean this is not somebody who's orbit and the it's not like you're going to pay\nGoing for you and then going directly ...\nSo it's um it's very very reasonable so do you communicate with your service providers and your clients after\nLet's say you know the relationship began to get a check in as barren as the interview and has been done with the caretaker and the not\nIs to the surface of the clients will do check and we have periodic check ins with both um\nAnd you know we just want to make sure that everybody's happy that there is no issues maybe maybe the care provider was not happy because the personal requires more help than\nOriginally told something that we need to know when you know we all so much you know maybe it's not a good personality fit so we want to know from the crying you know if\nA good situation so we definitely keeping in constant contact with them just to make sure that everybody is happy and that the relationships a good one [laughter] so then\nLet's just say you know it's not a match and then\nClient comes back to where the caretaker I'm sure you go back to the system and he's trying again we did what we do is we'll speak with the client and service provider to find out what the issue with see if we can resolve\nIt and then if we can't at no additional fee will find one or two more candidates for\nStart the process again for them totally understandable\nSo the lady will continue the\nCare 'cause that's what it comes down to like you said Debbie non medical you're not a minister and the medication but yet you can be a reminder\nExactly have them on non medical I mean it's just getting out of the bath\nTub is not going to fall under the non medical that would fall under\nOut of a ... position that they're sitting in a chair and help probably not changing dress they\nWill care so that\nKnow again but um there'll be no I I did when it's ... not just the general getting around\nFrom the position where Trump facility a shower that's all non medical care the different

want to remain by what\nA roommate absolutely no way you could bring all your stuff that he is going to get rid of and I feel like all that stuff just kind of add to the overall feeling of unsettled messed up that it was just\nKind of your life it's taking so much away from you\nRacing yard of yourself surely they when your parents away a couple of years about your kids are moving\nDon't want it to take away your thing and ... and your independence\nLaying out than it is hard enough to have that conversation where maybe it's time to drive anymore\nYes that's I mean you have to\nRegularly at

even if she just went down down to ... and everybody\nBut once they took those keys away it was a big\nLess scary you know it's one thing to have your family say you can't be driving anymore it's not safe but then not to provide a solution but if if you know that it probably is not safe for him to be driving anymore I bet that you've got somebody\nYou know you don't want it to take away your thing

you want the company to be known\n... people here though you were focused on one major goal and that is extending ones and do they live in our homes independently with safety and integrity and we had just gotten back a little\nI'm having dignity um I think that that\nAs we can keep people happy and keep them feeling like they're not you\nPart of their life where they have to disrupt everything and go you know live somewhere that they're not excited to live in um you know it'll it'll keep everything a little bit more positive absolutely so so question came in through the Facebook teaming up we

and\nOn but you have to keep in mind that ... new service providers are not medical they cannot administer the medicine they're just they're as somebody to remind them to take their medicine and they can schedule something maybe a phone call every day at the end of the day to talk with the child\nYou know the person was home there and to tell them yes we'd given like made sure that their medicine has taken at the time this time and this time and just you know give them an update of what happened during the day\nThere is communication between\nBut they they're a senior and they have\nChildren their accounts there's\nNot to use an elder care example but we had a pet sitter where blown\nAnd the person that came and took care of them were sending her pictures of the cats and text messages how the cats were doing so we will do the exact same thing and we have done the exact same thing with some of the elder care you know just sending you know she was on\nPeace of mind that\nAbout and that
