because the governor\nTo legalize FanDuel and a draft a draft king and they get a piece of the actions of the state is\nIranian seems to me is that in the\nIn your case in challenging the legality\nOf this operation you reciting the New York\nAttorney general against the current attorney general\nYes put the current attorney general in an awkward position and\nReason it put him in an awkward position was very simply that um that the current attorney general's predecessor\nHad argued very strenuously that daily fantasy sports violated the constitution then the legislature terms rather than passing sidewalk purporting to allow it and now the current attorney general position of having to defend some\nOn a graph a draft king and they get a piece of the actions of the state is\nIranian seems to me is that in the\nIn your case in challenging the legality\nOf this operation you were citing the New York\nYork attorney general against the current attorney general\nYes it put the current attorney general in an awkward position and\nReason it put them in an awkward position was very simply that um that the current attorney general's predecessor\nHad argued very strenuously that daily fantasy sports violated the constitution then the legislature turns random passenger walk purporting to allow it\nAnd now the current attorney general and similar position of having the defendant something with the previous attorney general attack there so there was some definite inconsistencies in the arguments that were put forward by the attorney by attorney general Schneiderman\nAnd the different uh arguments but before the court the war almost polar opposites and contradictory but\nWe're ... put forward now that to\nA bar brawl Underwood is the acting attorney general and that\nBy the acting Supreme Court justice shoveled\nPlay acting Supreme Court justice in Albany county\nThat well let me ask you this who\nHere who are the planes have said you're representing\nThat challenge that these big worry\nWomen across the state or\nWere either directly involved in a a problem gambling compulsive gambling or a media relatives of family members who are involved all of whom had devastating losses as a result uh\nUh some very difficult financial circumstances of tragedies their\nLives that were the direct result of a gambling there's a\nThat's backing the loss into isn't that correct stop\nStop predatory gambling has made a contribution to it I Would say a\nHonesty Fred it's very minimal\nI mean he's had a religiously affiliated\nReligiously affiliated organization it's a national organization I don't know everything about it I Know the person who heads it up and we've been friends for a long time and he indicated there was a liquor store on the part of them\nTo support this uh but I I Will tell you that uh what it takes two to prosecute a lawsuit like this is a lot more than what you get reimbursed for it I'm sure I was gonna ask you though\nHave you been seeking damages are the plaintiffs entitles\nWe were all really seeking damages Fred what we're really seeking is just stop it [noise] um and and you know everybody talks about the alleged benefits of gamble but there's a lot of people that ignore the dark underside\nAnd there's a lot of people who've been victimized by gambling and these poor people are really\nA kind of poster children for a what the problem is and the other side of the people don't want to recognize\nWell it's probably certain that the state will\nOnly test the law has the authority of the legislature and the governor so they say appeal may\nWhole thing of the gambling and be able to be continued is that when you expect\nLooking at that Fred whether or not the state is titled till the automatic stay in the context of this is a little unclear\nReally seeking damages Fred what we're really seeking is just stop it [noise] um and and you know everybody talks about the alleged benefits of gamble but there's a lot of people

the gambling and be able to be continued is that when you expect\nLooking at that Fred whether or not the state of some titled till the automatic stay in the context of this is a little unclear were actually do a little research on that very question as we speak and\nYes I I Would say it's probably I Would never say absolutely certain but I Would say it's probably\nAbout a distinction that I understand I saw a story\nVictory or\nSports fantasy\nThat seasonal sports fans I say betting is permitted and has been for many years in New York do you are you familiar\nWith that distinction and\nIt wasn't the explanation I think the distinction without a difference to the emphasis here was on daily fantasy sports but the reality is there is no difference between daily fantasy sports and seasonal fantasy sports other than the late all the bad obviously something with seasonal\nThis effort but you're still you're still betting on the performance of actual players in actual sporting events all be it over a longer period of time\nThat gets a distinction without a difference the story claimed\nTone fantasy betting seasonal signs his name has\nWasn't challenges that accurate\nDoes the case that it was not it was they allowed that to go but I'm\nBeat out as it may there was no real legislative authority forward it was only when daily fantasy sports started off with caught the eye of former attorney general Schneiderman\nAny prosecuted the case that she may have made the distinction will result mind between seasonal a fish and sports a daily fantasy sports but the reality is that in both games the essence of the of\nThe activity is you're betting on the outcome of the sporting event\nYeah I guess that it's a fantasy\nSports really took off financially and turn it\nSum of money much more than seasonal sports but in our\nNeeds it needs to better because it's every day ...\nHas actually has\nBecause of something you alluded to\nThe judge that the legislature and governor had the right to take this type of vetting out of the felony gambling statute what's significant says that\nWas given to visit the rich between criminality illegality and ... that's what I alluded to a little bit earlier ... and it's a nuance but the fact is that the attorney general in the state still have the civil authority to stop those people put anybody in jail\nHistorian really took off financially and turn it\nSum of money much more than seasonal sports betting\nNeeds it needs a better because it's every day\nAnd it's actually has\nBecause there's something you alluded to\nThe judge held that the legislature and governor had the right to take this type of bending out of the felony gambling statute what's significant says that\nThere's a difference between criminality illegality and ... that's what I alluded to a little bit earlier ... and it's a new ones but\nThe fact that the attorney general and the state still have the civil authority to stop this word I'm looking to put anybody in jail either\nWere just saying this is a commercial in a crisis of direct violation of the constitution the legislative by the constitution legislature is obligated obligated to pass laws to prevent the activity\nNow whether they decided to criminalize or know what that is a legislative prerogative to a judge tunnel himself pointed out but they must do something to stop it they just can't sit there and allow\nThis the fan boy drafting too from their nose at the law in the constitution otherwise this is all the joke I mean we have a rule of law here we have a constitution unequivocally prohibits commercialized gambling of this sort of\nThe judges said the activity is unconstitutional beyond a reasonable doubt and not understanding that we have David Boies come in and say well you know what this really set a technical thing and we don't have to we don't have to we we can find a way around it\nI don't think it can circumvent around and if you\nUh it just makes a mockery of the whole process and the\nFirst time I have no idea where do you live and that but you know what constitutions that for sale and money shouldn't be able to buy it I\nPower the lawyers are reality is that this is an illegal activity\nJust the last question here where the money FanDuel\nDraft Kings' they spent a fortune did they not back in twenty sixteen and probably on\nTo get this legalize from their\nIt was legalization of because the stakes are so high here I mean he's involved millions\nOther expenses as I said Fred ... should be for sale and\nIt and I personally I think that is the reality I don't know the precise numbers but there was a lot of money spent on the lobbying campaign to get this bill through\nLast question is in fact there's\nA decision as soon as\nOn as anything ... yeah I mean there's a link the time when in which a party has a right to perfect the appeal\nBut the other side can request an expedited appeal [noise] so uh I Do think however that it's realistically speaking it's probably going to take at least a year before this case finally gets before the court of appeals\nExactly\nThis is not over by any means and the\nVery similar decisions that have occurred\nA decision as soon as\nLives in ... yeah I mean there's a link time within which party has a right to protect the appeal\nBut the other side can request an expedited appeal [noise] so uh I Do think however that it's realistically speaking which probably going to take at least a year before this case finally gets before the court of appeals so there's a\nA generally if I\nWere this is not over by any means an\nVery similar decisions that have occurred\nOf responsibility correct It's only absolute liability so if there's an injury on the job it is absolutely the fault of the property owner contractor great example as they work or cutting the whole around themselves in before\nYou would think that in a court of law we worried a portion liability\nBased on fault but that's not the way we do it in New York the liability a hundred percent land with the property owner and with the contractor and so every property owner insurance policy every construction project costs more\nBecause we can't give defendants basic access to write and justice and due process\nThey should be able to go to court and say this person was drug this person to hold onto them selves and look for whatever it may be but we don't do that in New York we have what's called a summary judgment and it really you just decide how much you pay a weight you're a contractor a property owner in this situation\nAnd not Jeff contractors we do this for so many kinds of liability in many other contacts you would be able to go to court and prove what's called comparative negligence\nThis other person was somewhat responsible that's not the way it works here in New York and that encourages people to just sue the deepest pockets through anybody that they can that is true I mean that's one of the things they are that often\nHappens is they ... they sued the town the town ... W they to the to the village deep you W they sue every solving bystander to get any money that they can uh and that's why we're all paying for this this broken system\nIt's not it's not just the individual who's encouraged to bring these lawsuits is so last phones that are out there soliciting these individuals to bring a lawsuit because they know they're going to get a third\nIt may be or whatever damages are recovered isn't that correct\nAbsolutely you don't need to be home for daytime TV a late night TV to know that it is\nWhat's called comparative negligence this\nOther person was somewhat responsible that's not the way it works here in New York and that encourages people to just sued the deepest pockets through anybody that they can that is true I mean that's one of the things that often\nHappens is they ... they sued the town the town ... W they to the to the village deep you W they sue every solving bystander to get any money that they can uh and that's why we're all paying for this this broken system\nBut something that's not just the individual who's\nTo bring his law student says so law firms that are out there soliciting these individuals to bring a lawsuit because they know they're going to get a third\nIt may be or whatever damages are recovered isn't that correct\nAbsolutely you don't need to be home for daytime TV a late night TV to know that it is a booming business ... here in New York\nDrive down any highway and most of the billboards are blaring which to somebody to somebody and that's because the lawyers are making so much money on that some one of the things they're not allowed to do is solicit\nClients within thirty days of an accident but what we've seen is a new trend developing called geo fencing where they place\nFacebook ads and Twitter ad but only show up if you're in an emergency room\nSo if you're in that emergency room you're getting lawyer rats like crazy\nThey're not allowed to selected people within thirty days of a accent but they're doing it with this this new trend of geo fencing and it's really unfortunate way of getting around the ambulance chasing laws that we ... we fortunately have put into place here in New York\nWell I'm Glad to hear there'll be some laws in place in New York but doesn't ah Tom Newark rank a bottom the worst said in the nation or one\nThe worst place and the nation from the village as these numbers that I cited earlier suggest for the ability\nLarge awards than to have access to litigation that would not be permitted in other states\nAbsolutely we are the worst state in the nation were the worst state in the nation on a per capita basis so New Yorkers pay more for litigation than any other people in the United states any other state that isn't in the United states and we pay more for medical costs\nAre are medical liability insurance sure\nPayouts are the highest in the nation we pay more for taxes because of ... a liability New York city pays more in lawsuits and litigation\nAnd the next night team barges come to find her so it is an unbelievable staggering figure and you pay for it in your taxes you pay for it when you go to the doctors or hospitals\nAnd you pay for it any time that you're trying to build or start a business here in New York\nWas talking to Tom stabbings from the last of the reforms alliance on don't take this personally okay I'm sure you will\nPay because you do your job well and you're articulate advocate for your but how do you keep your sanity over these many years I mean it's not as if you have any prospects for victory where these people who control the New York state legislature in fact that maybe about to get worse if the Democrats they control the Senate\nHow'd you sort of take reckless echoing him into your equilibrium when you make the case when you know you're not you know your your calls are flowing\nFiguratively on deaf ears\nWell I don't share your past them in my heart because we have been able to position so many of these issues that's important to Democrats\nSchools get sued all the time I\nAs I said our our state government and our city governments are sued all the time so that money that could be spent on\nSchools tax cuts bridges what ever a particular politician may favor could be spent on that if we weren't spending it on lawsuits in litigation and we have made progress in some areas we passed a bill last session outlaw\nOver these many years I mean it's not as if you have any prospects for victory where these people who controls the New York state legislature in fact maybe about to get worse if the Democrats they control the Senate how'd you sort of ... I went into your equilibrium not when you make the case when you know you're not you know your your calls are flowing\nFiguratively on deaf ears\nWell I don't share your pessimism Amy my heart because we have been able to position so many of these issues that's important to Democrats\nSchools get sued all the time I\nAs I said our our state government and our city governments are sued all the time so that money that could be spent on\nSchools tax cuts bridges what ever a particular politician may favor could be spent on that if we weren't spending it on lawsuits in litigation and we have made progress in some areas we passed a bill last session along with the the New York State Farm bureau to\nLimit the liability on farms and you pick operations when they have people on their premises to pick apples to ride horses what have you we used to be a similar situation at this capital ball where it was near absolute liability for the property owner now we've\nInstilled the standard of what's called inherent risk if you were going to one of these properties you realize you're on a farm and you may hurt yourself we already had this in place for ski mountains so if you were barreling down a scheme now you understand there's an inherent risk\nAnd if you fall and you twist your ankle that's not the mountains fault that someone hair and leave risky activity and now fortunately with the support of the New York state legislature we were able to pass the same kind of bill for farms\nOr you pick operations in our act line operations which is a great small step but a great step and so we are seeing progress in certain areas and we're optimistic that we can continue to see progress\nAs I said because so many of these costs for doctors for city government whatever uh are really being passed on to regular people being passed on to poor people being\nPassed on to people trying to develop affordable housing so I think this is often been position as business for instance the little guy\nThis really is about ... all of us versus the personal injury lawyer lobby who's who's really jamming all these costs down our throats\nOr maintaining the status quo in house for a long period of time do you know the origin there's solid Arjun Tom of these laws and uh they must have been adopted at a time when there were a lot of industrial accidents and there was a great deal of desire\nIn New York to kind of bend over backwards I guess on the on the half of the little guy before the trial lawyers got totally established as a a defender of a status quo that got out of hand you know the origin of him\nYeah it's a great point Fred one of the great examples of that is the capital law which was put into place and Eighteen eighty five before we had workers' compensation before we had OSHA before we had the protections that we have now\nI like to think of the old photo of the work man on the ... or not [laughter] no helmets on they're not tied off and they're just eating lunch on those days are over but those are the days when the things like this capital bought were put into place\nAnd so you know one of the things we're going for in this capitalized not to to prevent people from getting compensation the workers' compensation system now covers that in most states had something like the scaffold law back in the twenties but when the workers' compensation system came into play\nMost states got rid of that New York did and and that's in part because the trial lawyers were making so much money off of these cases\nSo now if the worker gets injured they make a worker's comp claim they get paid from that and then they make a scaffold lock him and they get paid from that we believe that they should get\nNow I like to think of the old photo of the work man on the ... or not [laughter] no helmets on they're not tied off and they're just eating lunch on those days are over but those are the days when the things like the scaffold law were put into place\nAnd so you know one of the things we're going for this capitalized not to to prevent people from getting compensation the workers' compensation system now covers that in most states had something like the scaffold law back in the twenties but when the workers' compensation system came into play\nMost states got rid of that New York didn't and that's in part because the trial lawyers were making so much money off of these cases\nSo now for worker gets injured they make a worker's comp claim they get paid from that\nAnd then they make a scaffold block time and they get paid from that we believe that they should get that secondary claim only if there was actual negligence which is what our courts are designed to prove\nBut in New York you don't get that opportunity if you're a defended and make construction accident and again New York is the only state where that exist\nAll the other states workers' comp came around got rid of that system because it really is a double dipping system and that's not the way it should be and that's what we're advocating to fix\nOr you just think about the fact that Sheldon Silver now a convicted felon as assembly speaker for almost twenty\nOr so I was cashing in there's a trial lawyer basically was offering more\nFound to be checked facts no wonder\nLegislation ever went through this through the assembly I Would think Joe Bruno though when he was in charge of the Senate would have\nOpen to real reforms\nYeah I never got a chance to work with Joe Bruno but you're absolutely right about Sheldon Silver and blend that shift fell after Sheldon Silver was arrested it was discovered that whites in Luxembourg to from that he worked for was getting preferential treatment on a few judges got kind of relocated before\nUh before investigators swooped in so\nThe specificity docket in New York is still a tragedy and is a complete disaster I and we're working to try to fix that right now\nBut there are so many entrenched interests there so much money a bet it's that it's certainly an uphill battle\nSome gives people a sense if you are you may know the numbers of the top of your head of how much money the trial lawyer spend every year lobbying the legislature last I looked it was two or three million dollars isn't that right\nYeah it's about one point eight million dollars in lobbying and one point two million in money going directly to candidates through political action committee so\nThat's that's it's really three million dollars all in which it may be less than people think I mean we are talking about state government the costs are not as high and there are some reasonable protections to avoid massive payouts are massive contributions\n\nA um fourteen sixty being aware New Rochelle\nCities and states I'm Dave
