Democrats on that hearing committee judicial hearing committing all of them are out to destroy the\nQuote what that's like that's how he shed all Democrat I don't I don't I don't I don't agree with that the people in the hearing that there's something wrong with them\nThey should be there should be voted out Democrats yet and the crash who bought us for that and this was a political advice and

anything about it it was a witch hunt it was a persecution it was in Philadelphia and it was disgraceful and those Democrats especially if it's five Fifteen should be voted out of office\nWell that that there is no problem with that that's when you're making my point that this was a tightly political process so let's say All right nice to get it to stop and frisk but let's say that Feinstein as you said\nWhat how this information I'll pay my right\nOr with the with the political you know a\nA strategy that well you know maybe they wouldn't need it or maybe we'll let it out at the end or

and private when no outside political ... and ... influence water issue to\nAccept the problem was the release of the letter the timing of the information and there's a problem\nWho could have

it's all over for Democrats I don't think the Democrats going to see the inside of the White House another twenty five years\nWell Republicans come out and vote in the rain [laughter] Republicans come out and vote Democrat that's always the issue based upon enrollment the issue in every election is whether the Democrats are going to come out and sufficient numbers in order to prevail and the elections\nAnd you know what hurt only half of them need to come out to one\nThat's right yeah well then that it's not going to happen but I think that the house will be taken over by the

you've had cars pull a friend and I won't mention what kind of all but a lot of great power and uh you got to have a different kind of break on the current like that well the same is true if you've got a vehicle like that excursion they've got tremendous weight\nBecause of the stretching of it by several the it's a huge vehicle and it's got to have\nSufficient breaking power and to to stop a vehicle like that and those are the kinds of things I'd like to know uh you know what the what happened during an inspection they the last inspection the words did any of them touch upon as such vital issues is that\nTrue or do you have any concerns that the\nThe um Cuomo's integration which is notoriously secretive might try to hold back any information that might be in the files saying that the state department of transportation warning not only about this company possibly but boarding a more specifically about that intersection which apparently into Harriet thirty and thirty a\nHas been a notoriously dangerous\nDeveloping would nothing would amaze me at all about government on any level I'm gay and government bureaucrats I don't know whether you can keep that kind of information a secret though\nI don't think it was a mess and there is less likely it's good that the feds are there is a check with anything yeah\nI yeah I also think this is an election year and the governor wants to find someone in the key to travel on the bus\nThere'd be criminal thing John ... thanks at\nJohn Carroll made a a good point in pointing out the strange connections between his limousine company

involved now there's no evidence of that at all at this point and it may not be the case because we do is Carol pointed out that the limousine was hired only at the last minute apparently and pick out\nA lot of that is the point that I was making or Fred\nAnd I just think that if they had planned to have a lemon scene maybe they know\nThat they had a contract it with another company for this

contract it with another company for this bar that they might it's supposed to take and at the last minute or one of the last minute\nI had this week drawn upon for this company and to take this excursion instead I I Would think that that puts it beyond any any doubt that there is that this is nothing more than coincidence but again it depends on whether all of that information is correct\nThat will be fine you know that I'm sure it let me ask you this is a final question or a line of questions on this terrible event that occurred in ... on Saturday from your own experiences over many years is journal is\nWhat this kind of a large number of deaths I mean it's not that common but you've seen it or what vested in a community and small communities in upstate New York this is
