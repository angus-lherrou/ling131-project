Arabs and\nFinancial investors came into the picture and the quality of care became the ideal model now to day in Westchester County alone so we're only talk about talking about our county there are over thirty and you're living a places [noise]\nSo let's get into it let's talk about independent living\n[noise] so if you think about this is the homeless and maintenance has become overwhelming then independent living and could be a good option\nSo independent living is really was really designed to simplify things an independent living provides meals and it could be anywhere from one to two to three meals a day housekeeping transportation social activities and a room or ... or an apartment or a cottage something like that\nSo if you think about it independent living really provides recreational educational and social opportunities for the senior\nUh there could be fitness classes travel educational cultural opportunities so when we think about independent living on the next question comes to mind what or who is independent living good for us to think about it\nThink about the person that you may know it could be a loved one a mom or dad a neighbor a friend\nSo the person who no longer wants to maintain a home on no one wants to hire the painter or the gardener and doesn't want to be involved with that any more [noise]\nThink about the person who wants and needs the socialization so we all know seniors to\nBe close perhaps their families no longer around or their family works during the day so they're alone during the day this person may be at home\nPerhaps they're friends will passed away or maybe they're they're friends they're not in the area and there alone all day sitting at home there watching TV they're really not socializing they're not living\nSo really independent living is wonderful for someone who really would enjoy that socialization [noise] think about the person who\nReally can't cook their meals or doesn't really want to cook the meal the person who's losing weight or maybe they're just eating\nSo the person who no longer wants to maintain a home on no one wants to hire the painter or the gardener and really doesn't want to be involved with that any more [noise]\nThink about the person who wants and needs the socialization so we all know seniors who\nBecause perhaps their family is no longer around or their family works during the day so they're alone during the day this person may be at home\nPerhaps they're friends will passed away or maybe they're they're friends they're not in the area and there alone all day they're sitting at home there watching TV they're really not socializing they're not living\nSo really independent living is wonderful for someone who really would enjoy that socialization [noise] think about the person who\nReally can't cook their meals that doesn't really want to cook the meal the person who's losing weight or maybe they're just eating junk food fast food [noise]\nThink about the person who can no longer drive or should no longer drive but yet they still need to be taken to medical appointments they still would love to go to shopping off or to the theater and things like that so you think about this person who\nDoesn't want to rely on family or can't rely on family right then independent living could be the right choice but I Want you to think about independent living does not include here have chair is would actually be separate [noise]\nIf you live in an independent living place and you need assistance so let's say you need some assistance bathing or dressing or something like that most of the independent living communities in the area will let you hire an outside license agency to have you with the care\nAnd keep in mind if you get to a certain point where you're hearing aids have increased for example if you live in independent living and you become wheelchair bound or your nature from chopped the community I may ask you to leave\nSo it's really the independent living she meant that decides at what point you're right no longer independent enough to stay it really depends on the community and the person so I Want you to keep that in mind\nFor example Alzheimer's or any cognitive impairment so if you think special needs and in the um round we're talking about in senior living that means dementia\nAnd a special needs assisted living residence provides all of those really good things you talked about previously meals and housekeeping and care [noise]\nNow some of the assisted living in the area only have that special needs license in other words they have folks who have dementia and their potential building their community only houses folks if cognitive\nFor example Alzheimer's or any cognitive impairment so which do you think special needs and in the um round we're talking about in senior living that means dementia\nAnd a special needs assisted living residence provides all of those really good things you talked about previously meals and housekeeping and care [noise]\nNow some of the assisted living in the area only have that special needs license in other words they have folks who have dementia and their potential building their community only houses folks if cognitive impairment\n[noise] all of the assisted living some Westchester have a floor or Wang or an area for those with cognitive impairment so if you think about the senior living in the area the Kensington atrium sunrise things and more\nAll have a separate area for those with cognitive impairment\n[noise] now let's throw a little wrench a monkey wrench in in this plan [noise] we also have what's called an assisted living program A L P P. isn't Peter assisted living program [noise]\nNow according to New York State Department of health it with an assisted living program\nThis is a program that accept Medicaid so everything else that we've been talking about previously does not accept Medicaid in assisted living program an A. L. P. except medicate\nIt's assisted living and it provides all of those wonderful things up meals and housekeeping and transportation and things like that and it's for those that are on Medicaid hey [noise]\nAccording to the New York State Department of health website there were only three assisted living programs in the county including Chris manner\nThe rest of the center for independent and assisted living and Yorktown assisted living residence that's it so think about it folks if there are over thirty assisted living human and he's in Westchester County Ninety nine percent of us do not accept Medicaid only three except medicate [noise]\nOur next definition cc or see and that stands for continuing care retirement community [noise]\nThese are fee for service places for seniors that offer one contract for independent living an access to the continuum of long term care services is needed\nSo they probably including most include independent living assisted living with dementia care and skill nursing all in the same campus\nGenerally you have to meet age and financial requirements and it varies from ... in the community\nIs usually with the safety or see with a continuum to their retirement community it requires a significant financial commitment anywhere from an entrance fee of a hundred thousand dollars ... million plus monthly fees on anywhere from two thousand ten thousand dollars a month and more\nAnd there are several different types of contracts within these communities\n[noise]\nOur next skilled nursing home which I'm sure most people are familiar with skilled nursing facility skilled nursing home this is the highest level of care for older adults outside of a hospital so I think that his\nBeing assisted living with dementia care and skill nursing all in the same campus\nJesuit we have to meet age and financial requirements and it varies from ... in the community [noise] usually with the CDC or see with a continuum care retirement community\nIt requires a significant financial commitment anywhere from an entrance to have a hundred thousand dollars ... million plus monthly fees of anywhere from two thousand ten thousand dollars a month and more\nAnd there are several different types of contracts within these communities\n[noise]\nOur next skilled nursing home which I'm sure most people are familiar with skilled nursing facility skilled nursing home\nThis is the highest level of care for older adults outside of a hospital so think of that hill were going up and we're increasing care starting with independent living assisted living enhanced assisted living that includes especially for those with dementia right and skilled nursing\nNursing homes provide what's called custodial care and that really is assistance with activities of daily living in a very high level on medical care so skilled nursing facilities are licensed under the department of health\nAnd they provide things like more care tracheotomy here and if you provide ventilator care and much more\nDifferences so the assisted living so we've been talking about independent assisted in enhanced really cannot provide care for those on a ventilator but skill nursing homes can and there are several in the area that actually have folks with ventilator\nSo skilled nursing homes provide skilled or medical care services\nShort term rehab and long term care so what do I mean by short term ... we will either ourselves and we know folks who\nMay have had an injury a hip break an ankle they've gone to the hospital for surgery and then they've gone to a skilled nursing facility for short term rehab that's really part of what skill nursing homes do but they also help folks that live there permanently long term care\n[noise] so now I Want to get into differences between independent assistant hands and when you may need one versus the other so\nIf if you or you have a friend neighbor or a loved one that is permanently wheelchair bound and cannot gotta you can't really live in assisted living you can live though enhanced assisted living [noise]\nLet's say you chronically require physical assistance of another person to walk\nYou cannot win in assisted living but you can live in in ... assisted living let's say you're dependent on medical equipment like oxygen\nAnd you require frequent assistance from medical personnel you cannot live in assisted living but you can live in an assisted living\nLet's say you require as I said previously a ventilator you've got past the stage for won't you can live in enhanced assisted living with the wound or with the ventilator a nursing home only\n[noise] now one and we went to ... within the scope of the specific license of independent living assisted living or enhance delivered assisted living each community has its own model of what it can and can't do with him that license so for example again\nWhen he's got sixteen enhanced assisted living places in Westchester right [noise] but only\nFrom medical personnel you cannot waive in assisted living but you can live in an an assisted living\nLet's say you require as I said previously a ventilator you've got passed to stage for one you can live in an hamster assisted living with the wound or with the ventilator a nursing home only\n[noise] now what everyone to ... within the scope of the specific license of independent living assisted living or enhance delivered assisted living each community has its own model of what it can and can't do with him that license so for example again\nWhen he's got sixteen enhanced assisted living places in Westchester right [noise]\nBut only the Kensington can take care of folks require intermittent feeding tubes and any stage ruined the other enhanced assisted living communities I think there were Fifteen\nCannot provide care for folks require intermittent eating and more it's their model is not good or bad it's just that it's their model another example\nWhere enhanced assisted living a male only take folks that have stage one or two wound well another enhanced assisted living will call it may may take only stage one won't [noise]\nSo really looked up to you the consumer the wealth spouse is on the daughter the neighbor to do your homework to figure out the best fit for your loved one if you're seriously considering senior living\nMy suggestion is that you do your homework go on their websites learn about the communities\nAnd if you're a senior you can ask yourself a couple of ... the phone question wouldn't why healthy was my health be at risk if I had to spend a few days alone in my home I think about it if the answer is yes you may need assisted living\nAsk yourself there and my relying more on my children to run errands or address wage eliminates\nAgain if yes assisted living may be able to bridge that gap [noise]\nNow I did want to touch upon how to pay for senior living because I Know that comes up and it's very important question\nHad to pay number one private pay income in savings\nSo you're using your personal income and your savings I'm again as I said previously Ninety nine percent of the senior living in Westchester County do not accept Medicaid [noise] another way to pay for a living if he's got long term care benefits if you've got a long term care policy\nSo for example at the Kensington I've got several residents that are living in our community\nAnd their long term care policies pay for them to live at our community veterans' benefits called aid and attendance\nAnd again you or a veteran or the spouse of a veteran and you need care you could take that money you would get money and it's the way the government pay for care to live in a senior living community [noise]\nAnd just as a side note that actually will be the discussion on my next show on November twenty first is going to be about eight in attendance and how you view as a senior in need assistance to get money from the government [noise]\nAnother way to pay for senior living home equity or if you've got a life insurance policy beliefs or not it may be able to convert your life insurance policy\n... and their long term care policies pay for them to live at our community veterans' benefits called aid and attendance\nAnd again you or a veteran what the spouse of a veteran and you need care you could take that money would get money and if that's where the government pay for care to live in in your living community [noise]\nAnd just as a side note that actually will be the discussion on my next show on November twenty first it's going to be about eight in attendance and how you as a senior in need assistance to get money from the government\n[noise] another way to pay for senior living home equity where you've got a life insurance policy beliefs or not it may be able to convert your life insurance policy to pay for assisted living\nPooling family support maybe you've thought six sons and daughters perhaps they could pull some money split it and pay for you to live in their living\nAlso reverse mortgage and finally as we talked about previously medicate so again those three communities in the county\nAlways a an activist or less the agenda for the Democratic party they used to be a group called the end of the city new democratic coalition new democratic coalition that used to harass\nMy father because he wasn't liberal enough believe it or not [noise]\nUm most people would say uh he was a great liberal or many people would say he was too liberal but\nThere was a left to my father who complained that he was a not left enough [noise] ah he would say they were professional uh liberals or professional\nA political people meaning that uh they have a valid point of view but it's a\nProfessional point of view or as opposed to a populist point of view I think that's actually exacerbated now and if I can just take another second on it you have a group of\nPolitical people who are are\nEngaged on a daily basis for one reason or another they're running an organization with it\nA political reporter or blog ...\nAnd the communication and intensity of ...\nProfessional uh liberals or professional\nA political people meaning that ah they have a valid point of view but it's a\nProfessional point of view or as opposed to a populist point of view I think that's actually exacerbated now and if I can just take another second on it you have a group of\nPolitical people who are are\nEngaged on a daily basis for one reason or another they're running an organization with it\nA political reporter or blog ...\nAnd the communication and intensity among them is much higher that is ... Instagram and the energy they generate among themselves is much higher\nThan it has been in the past than some of them then believe that is reality uh it's not reality are that's their own political reality reality is what\nAre people live day to day who aren't reading blogs because they have jobs and they're trying to make ends meet [noise] uh and uh when it came to the primary uh this state is the most progressive\nState in the United states of America not because of blogger whole pines but because people know it they know that we passed marriage\nOr ... it was a very big deal they know that I passed the gun safe the law they lived that they heard that they saw the controversy [noise]\nAh they know that I raise the minimum wage to the highest in the country because to point three million people got a raise or that's how they know they see it in their paycheck\nOr they know that we have uh the best free college tuition for middle class families in the country because they're looking at it for their child [noise] so\nUh I understand the academic attack but you're not going to tell the people in this state that I'm not a progressive because they know differently\nFor governor I Want to label you forgive me or that are you a centrist or a progressive ...\nAm a pragmatic\nProgress [noise] whose definition was that bill those your father yep of yeah let me ask you but let's let me interrupt her first I can think about that for a second pragmatic\nProgressive now this is Mario Cuomo right the the greatest a liberal or the greatest intellectual politician pragmatic\nProgressive why an IT I hated the term by the way I used to [laughter] you know one understands without me and he would say as only if they're not smart enough\nTo know where it means I don't hear [laughter] pragmatic progressive\nIt almost sounded like an oxymoron but his point was\nYour father yep of yeah let me ask you but let's let me interrupt her first I can think about that for a second pragmatic\nProgressive now this is Mario Cuomo right the the greatest a liberal or the greatest intellectual politician pragmatic\nProgressive why an IT I hated the term by the way I used to [laughter] you know no one understands without me and he would say I was only ... if they're not smart enough\nTo know where it means I don't hear [laughter] pragmatic progressive\nIt almost sounded like an oxymoron but his point was you cannot be a pro aggressive if you want and not pragmatic there is no academic\nProgressive politics progressive ... politics happens in actuality there is no you're right or go progressive\nPolitics either you made in my life better or you didn't either I have more a bread on the table or I don't\nI don't want to hear your theory and your intellectual exercise and your academic political analysis I Want progress in my life because I needed because I'm poor because I'm a working family because\nI'm disabled because I'm a victim of discrimination so I Need progress so his point was\nProgressive needs a model\nFire and the model fire is the word pragmatic\nNot because [noise] it is a an oxymoron or inconsistent but days as a model fire it is the practical\nProgress it is the actuality and the concrete accomplishment of the a progressive a theory that was his point and when you are an executive\nAh you realized very quickly as opposed to a legislative branch or\nA an academic a there is to make actual will change that is much harder bad it often involves compromise ah it ... it involves nuance it involves fashioning\nA specific solution a to a problem\nAnd it's not as easy as just old pining\nOr pontificate ing about absolute ideal is some of the pragmatic\nTakes you to a different place we now have to get it done that means I Need to get a piece of legislation passed that means I have to talk to Republicans that means I have to talk to conservative Democrats that means we're going to have to shift a little bit from the ideal\nBecause we live in the radio and that's the pragmatic\nPart a and he would voice this or in the on growing debate he had at that time with the ...\nFashioning a specific

look it's it's very easy to be a\nPurist ideologically if you don't have to get anything done right there boil it is is about\nA writing a paper on it or giving a speech on it then it's easy to advocate\nFor the perfect uh but if you have to get something done as an executive or because you believe people actually need help ah and because you actually want to improve the situation that\nThan introduces the element of pragmatism so he was a pragmatic\nProgressive uh and that's what I Would call myself\nGovernor or what first of all the clock is ticking or the Democrat [noise] your party they got to pull up somebody again\nPresident Trump's first of all a I had a ... car friendship of many many years is it possible to like Donald Trump President Trump and Governor Cuomo\nAnything is possible [noise]\nAh the can you like both a theories both philosophies or no [noise]\nUh my philosophy my theory of government\nIs a diametrically opposed [noise] uh this ... this president the lights in division or he thrives\nIn division it's not just that he thrives in competition or he thrives\nIn confrontation he thrives in division\nUh he he looks to energize people through anger I Believe\nUh I Try to do the opposite [noise] uh I Try to appeal to people's better angels now it's much easier to appeal to fear as opposed to love\n[noise] uh he he looks to energize people through

very pleased and wrap this up you've given us some youthful\nBuff so wonderful stuff of the book on Andrew Cuomo governor Andrew Cuomo is that he's\nHe's respected even your credit respect a that he got dynamism he's a he nobody knows the levers of government\nLike Governor Cuomo he's the door\nA he's in the Catholic\nOr you were the son of a man they called the great philosopher states one of the American ... Boston Globe's that and I hear that day I hear it in your voice\nI hear it in your thoughtful comment why the hell is going to talk more like this [noise] you know bill [noise] with all due respect nah\nNah it was ... [noise] the it was a different time when my father governed [noise] they don't give you more than thirty seconds they there's no the the intelligence\nThe substance of government that theory of

I'm very concerned about the minor parties\nTake a look at the working families party they don't like them and they did this ridiculously arrangement of\nThe kids in the ... Nixon off the ballot that was terrible the rank and file a working families party or progressive they don't want\nA Andrew Cuomo there had to give it to him and he played hard to get well maybe you want to cook well of course he took it 'cause he had to take it and he's angry at them because they didn't give it to them and the first place\nI'm just telling your now uh that uh that grow in a and but they're still going to be an awful lot of people\nLooking at everything in that administrator because when you take a look at some of the people who are going to jail right now and why they're going to jail and leaves a lot of unanswered questions\nLegislative ... the political observer Owen church on candidates for statewide office were required this week to disclose how much money they have on hand for the final month of the twenty Eighteen election season once again governor Andrew Cuomo who is seeking a third term is far ahead of his challengers we get the latest numbers from the legislative because that's Kamron to with\nCuomo has over nine million dollars a pill available to expand on broadcast television at social media hats and get out the vote effort and he's been spending liberally so far in the general election I thought that highlight his opposition to President Trump\nWill leave me alone we all have\nA large financial advantage helped Cuomo into September Democratic primary where he was challenged by actors Cynthia Nixon karma began the primary season with over twenty five million dollars and they spend up to half a million dollars a day in August in early September on ads on TV and social media\nCuomo one by two to one margin\nThe governor's nearest challenger and the general election Republican Mark ... has just over two hundred thousand dollars

money still matters\nHe has no money fifty six percent of voters right now five weeks before election day\nFifty six percent of voters you don't know mark more narrow at all or don't know enough about 'em to have an opinion it takes money takes money to get known to New York electorate we are a big state with many media markets including the most expensive media markets in the nation\nAt the same pointed the twenty fourteen race for governor the Republican candidate for governor Rob asked to Reno had one million dollars more than ... narrow does now\n... campaign has his fundraising has been hampered because Cuomo is threatening potential donors to keep their wallets closed they offer no proof of their allegations Cuomo's campaign denies that\nCampaign communications director Danny lever says ... it's just having another bad day she called the charges the static and desperate\nLarge amounts of campaign cash can bring its own troubles so there can be an appearance to pay to play politics when companies get large amounts to an elected official and receive government grants or lucrative contracts\nCuomo's own administration has been rocked by corruption scandal involving large campaign donations from companies and the awarding of economic development grant is former closest aide faces prison time for bribery well other former associates were convicted of bid rigging government contracts for Faber donors\nGOP candidate Molly narrow despite his more limited resources has produced its own at highlighted the corruption scandals\nAndrew Cuomo top advisors are going to jail dealing your time dollars\nBut because of money constraints the ad has a limited reach the other candidates in the race have also not raised a lot of cash independent candidate for governor Stephanie minor has just fifty five thousand dollars and her account\nThe Green Party candidate how we hawking has just over thirty one thousand dollars and libertarian candidate Larry sharp has twenty four thousand dollars they are relying on news conferences media interviews and mentions on social media to get their message out in Albany I'm Karen too wet\n\n\n\nWhile listening to the legislative visa program about New York state government politics on due to just you know [noise]\nAn environmental\nGroup in the Hudson Valley has released a study on the risks of oil spilled in the Hudson River sheet of cuts and commissioned a study that looks at threats nine locations between Yonkers at all but I but what would it be a good job wasn't done as more\nHighly car lock and seeing the cops and environmental advocacy director\nNever been a comprehensive study of the rest of the consequences of an oil spill in the Hudson River which went we discovered this has sort of shocking to us that's been done for a lot of water bodies\n\nYou are listening to the legislature to the program about New York state government politics going to do [noise]\nAn environmental\nGroup in the Hudson Valley has released a study on the risks of oil spilled in the Hudson River she cuts commissioned a study that looks at threats nine locations between your personal but it but we'll just go to the Joe Wilson done has more\nHeavily car lock and seeing the cops in environmental advocacy director\nThere's never been a comprehensive study of the risk and consequences of an oil spill in the Hudson River which one we discovered this was sort of shocking to us it's been done for a lot of water body is you know all around the United states and around the world\nScene cops in how commission report from environmental research consulting while the U.S coast guard proposal to establish up to ten encourage sites from Yonkers to ... and was on the table\nNot proposal was shelved in June twenty Seventeen since the coast guard directed a study on safety along the river and there is the Hudson River safety committee that met most recently October second in Hyde Park ... participated\nOne I Am hopeful ah and listening to captain Thomas words from the coast guard at the Tuesday meeting that there will be no a new Anchorage proposals and the Hudson River you know any time in the near future that's what he said on Tuesday and you know I I Believe him so I'm hopeful that is not going to happen but\nIf some proposal like that does a car or a proposal for a new oil terminal or a different type of oil to be transported on the Hudson River that this document and information and that will be the first place that people go to say wait a minute let's\nLook at what the consequences can be let's look at how that should influence our planning and whether we would allow this type of thing to happen at all on the Hudson River\nScenic Hudson studies suggest that the coast guard designate the Hudson River a high volume port area which would require enhanced spill preparedness and reduced response time a spokeswoman says the U.S coast guard is aware of that study and looks forward to reviewing it car Locke says the study evaluated Seventy seven scenarios that twelve locations\nWhat was most shocking to us was looking at how long oil would remain in the water for some of the scenarios obviously though is that um\nHave a larger volume of oil\nOn you know over twenty eight days and some cases and in some of the scenarios you would have oil a at different times you know you'd have a scenario that would have car perhaps at the port of Albany or maybe and cook psyche so in the upper Hudson River area and during certain weather conditions for certain types of oil that\nOil from that spill would make its way all the way down to New York harbor\nYou know it's that's included worst case scenarios in four locations Albany Kingston Newberg in Yonkers\nWe looked at a scenario um where there was a an explosion and fire resulting from a spill of Bach and crude at the port of Albany\nWhere I'm a boxing would be coming out of a tank into a barge and there was an explosion which has actually modeled on an actual incident that occurred not in New York state I think it without in Michigan on\nAnd that you would have severe damage for you to have an explosion zone that would go um you know over five miles you would have um potentially areas that are you know how to leave residential near the port of Albany that could be impacted by that so\nThey're not looking at the ecology of the river as much because if there's an explosion and fire less oil is going to get into the river but you know severe human health safety and casualty um concerns obviously\nUp inside of a formerly proposed Kingston encourage the scenario was one hundred and fifty thousand barrel home heating oil spill\nAn explosion and fire resulting from a spell a fucking crude at the port of Albany\nWhere I'm Bach and will be coming out of a tank into a barge and there was an explosion which has actually modeled on an actual incident that occurred in New York state I think without in Michigan on\nAnd that you would have severe damage for you'd have an explosion zone that would go on you know over five miles he would have um potentially areas that are you know how to lay residential near the port of Albany that could be impacted by that so\nThey're not looking at the ecology of the river as much because if there's an explosion and fire less away I was going to get into the river but you know severe human health safety and casualty I'm concerned obviously\nAt the side of a formerly proposed Kingston Anchorage that scenario is a one hundred fifty thousand barrel home heating oil spill on the Newberg waterfront that study examines in eleven thousand barrel Bach and crude spell from a train accident and for Yonkers a one hundred and fifty five thousand barrel gasoline spill was analyzed\nFast response is as critical to protect a river\nThat strong Lipscomb he's river keeper boat captain and vice president for advocacy and says the total volume of petroleum moving along the river has increased yet the capacity to respond to spill is limited with data technology let's come says he hopes the report helped to change that\nCould discussion over spill response and recovery is much needed in some valley aside from the Anchorage the beach there's petroleum moving on the river everyday refined product is coming up from the coastal refineries to criminals and various communities and in Albany\nWe have to do is to have a name recognition doesn't guarantee roast\nNo I'm saying if by name recognition right now is about thirty three percent with that I poll at ice Coppola Thirteen percent which means if I get my neighbor mission to a hundred times three times Thirteen times three that's thirty nine percent of\nAll I Need is about thirty percent to win so it is winnable it still crowing about ... right I'm not saying it's a simple thing that it's gonna happen I'm not guaranteeing it of course not but is it possible of course\nA lot of weight and that ... percent showing a show up I missed that\nPaul took rabbits marketing pulled up we will be put out a last week okay\nI mean I haven't seen in Sienna or marriage or Quinnipiac already out there who you\nSee the ad out that does a poll with several people that call landlines back their poll please\nCall a cell phone yeah well you know\nI I don't even have a fan of I'm not I'm not I'm not a big fan of polls that purposefully up more than one have by the way to not ... third parties have gotten not help anybody I I'm not that I don't mind the reality of it is this is an anti establishment climate that's a fact one of them\nTimes three that's thirty nine percent of\nI Need is about thirty percent to win so it is winnable it still current on Everest right I'm not saying it's a simple thing that it's going to happen I'm not guaranteeing and of course not but is it possible of course\nA lot of weight and that ... percent showing a show up I missed that\nPoll to grab is marketing pulled up we will be put out a last week okay\nI mean I haven't seen in Sienna or marriage or Quinnipiac\nOr any other way you see the end of the does the poll with several people that cold air landlines back their poll please go a cell phone yeah well\nYou know he's a fine without a fan of I'm not I'm not I'm not a big fan of polls that purposefully up more than once\nHave gone way to not ... third parties have gone not help anybody I I'm not a federal and the reality of it is this is an anti establishment climate that's a fact one of the major reasons why\nAnd not the only reason but a major reason why Ocasio Cortez what amazed by truck on was because they were anti establishment that was a major factor of why they want\nAnd that really a major factor in why have why have impact ... or what\nHave you set up for debate a schedule was Andrew Cuomo's people had been in touch with you to establish\nA a leads the reality I've no idea when debate um the league of women voters have said they want to debate and they want everybody to go to stage including me and how we all can step in butter and and even the Republican they want them all on the on the debate stage\nAnd so if it happens great I'm there I'm not counting are like cats I've got to keep up with I've got to keep meeting people have got to keep chicken has got to keep kissing babies and let people do my message and if they are by message\nI see one people here want to have to say they start voting for short because they see I'm the only guy who actually has plans I have plans to fix education of actual plans\nTo fix our criminal justice has pledged to support our law enforced I plan to support our teachers I I plan to do to raise our services without ever raise any taxes I actual ways of providing tax relief for everybody that's a real quiet\nAnd I'll tell you what was their second yard I'll give you I'll give you several minutes to spell out some of the year plan so do you think are most important how would you ah reasons for instance how would you reduce taxes without reducing services is up and you said\nAbsolutely yes I Want to waste I talk about talk about time there sure is the idea of raising money without raising taxes on one of those ways is\nI'll go down state and upstate downstate the MTA\nThe NPA owns several bridges lots of bridges which we're paying for a little your tax money over six pain dolls or from a lot to say go to the MTA every single year just because they're terrible why aren't we instead releasing naming rights to bridges probably have a Mariel Cuomo praised that's not all about empty but that's a good example we have a Mariel Cuomo bridge\nBut nobody said after that access to all of us\nThat's correct yes we paid literally billions of dollars that is correct or how about instead we have that as a ... and bridge or the Apple Google bridge and now they least naming rights to it they will easily pay us fifty or a hundred million dollars a year for that how I Know that well number one they already paid twenty million dollars for a stadium that gets used the weekends\nNow having situation where you have a break that gets cross by hundreds of thousands of called every single year every single day and gets mentioned hundreds of times every single day on the radio during rush hour\nHow do I know that's even viable because I already have bankers asking you about that because of Manhattan that asked me about ... already\nA magic during that time twelve downstate imagine doing that with the Erie Canal upstate naming each lock over five hundred miles down about three dozen locks and everything now naming each lock and turn them all into into tours parasites for all people use the canal again\nWe could reinvent and reinvigorate infrastructure radio money without having to raise their taxes\nThat's an interesting idea give us another one that you're as part of your your\nAbsolutely NPA also has rail lines that go into and out of the city\nNew York a little bit I I mean we hit the NCAA ones\nTwenty million dollars for stadium that gets used in the weekends\nNow having situation where you have a break that gets crossed by hundreds of thousands of called every single year every single day and gets mentioned hundreds of times every single day of the radio during rush hour\nI Know that's even viable because I already had bankers asking you about it because of Manhattan that after about ... already\nA magic during that time twelve downstate the magic doing that with the Erie Canal upstate naming each lock over five hundred miles down about three dozen locks and everything now naming each lock and turn them all into into tours tourist sites for all people who use the canal again\nWe could reinvent and reinvigorate infrastructure radio money without having to raise taxes\nThat's an interesting idea give us another one that you're a part of your your\nAbsolutely MPA also has rail lines that go into and out of the city of\nNew York a little bit I I mean we hit the NCAA ones about upstate that's losing population in the eighties or as soon as they're grading and jobs are fleeing\nYep so let me talk a lot of that and find what do they do here is right now we have things like IT one which is falling apart people say Larry Hi going to fund IT one and I say I'm not gonna funded so what do you mean I don't want to fund or invest if you hear fund or the vast\nThat means taxes Republicans say invest Democrats say fund same thing it's it's it's it's your taxes\nI'm saying you want to fix already won the worries\nHow 'bout that open space alone id one how about the Google road and there are one of those crew a back their tracks one of those things were going to pay for that the company Google will pay for that road\nAnd how and how do we least that wrote out maintenance for IT one\nIs what is what they have to do to maintain the rent for that wrote in the middle now what happens you have the option you can use the aerobic their driverless cars or whatever they want to put on that I get a caller is whatever they use or they're or they're rail line ... ... if they're saying they can do it or you can use the highway whatever you prefer\nBut does that mean we have more options and we're not paying friday one so again it's another idea that pops up he devised with running right now they are literally career politicians they can't think outside the box at all they can drain the swamp because they live with a ... they they burn their own house down it's impossible\nBut I'm not I'm not a government I'm a business guy so I Would think as a business I Can't just make more money I had to do more with less that's how I think that's about all of these ideas\nYour party the Libertarian Party of your kind of a classic libertarian group that wants to deemphasize government's involvement really in all aspects of our lives and would encourage individual liberties to the point maybe of even the you know pulling back services from people who just can't handle life and and therefore you know it's kind of\nI have never advocated for that ever are never one time have I ever advocate that in fact the burgers I'm the one who has said I Want the government to facilitate more people getting better services constantly\nI just don't want to raise your taxes in any way shape or form libertarian hate taxes I hate taxes I Am never going to raise your taxes ever do matter what but I'm always going to facilitate ways of raising money and getting better services every single time whether that's education whether that's taxation but that's because that's\nA property tax law enforcement it doesn't matter even in law enforcement area and I talked often about reforming prisons and what we've done with President ... worst option we keep bringing in people from the outside to try to fix the situation while punishing our corrections officers and not even giving them a contract\nInstead be should be embracing a corrections officer who work with these people every day in prison to try to figure out a way to reform it that's already happening in Massachusetts and we're not copying and they have a ... Humvee program a program where a couple of corrections also CEOs\nThey helped select and pick and manage the prisoners who have a chance at getting out and being productive citizens that volunteers come in\nGoing to raise your taxes ever do matter what but I'm always going to facilitate ways of raising money and getting better services every single time whether that's education whether that's taxation but that's because that's\nA property tax law enforcement it doesn't matter even in law enforcement area right I talked often about reforming prisons and what we've done with prisons ... option we keep bringing in people from the outside they try to fix the situation while punishing all corrections officers and not even giving them a contract\nInstead we should be embracing a corrections officer who work with these people every day in prison for trying to figure out a way to reform it that's already happening in Massachusetts and what not copying and they have a hung Humvee program a program where a couple of corrections also CEOs\nThey helped select and pick and manage the prisoners who have a chance at getting out and being productive citizens\nThat volunteers come in and they helped together almost separations program\nThe recidivism rate in Massachusetts right now it's about Seventy five percent in that program it's less than five and I've talked to crunch losses all the time there are tons of them would happily joined in to make this happen because what I Know in prison\nThere are three after people there are those who are really bad as you've probably never should get out and then those who made a mistake should pay their debt to society and when they're done paying their debt\nThey should have a second chance at life those probably shouldn't be it appears the problem I don't know which ones which the CEOs do they work with them every single day they're the ones who could help me make this happen they are part of the solution and guess what we're already paying them we don't have to pay outsiders or get grants or the federal government volunteers will help and they get we get better\nService we get a fair treatment for every body for the crushes officers for their families corrections officers are suffering poverty in this day and even for inmates there it makes it did get the chance of this epidemic let's do that became make everybody happy without paying one extra dollar\nHold on for a minute let me know we're talking to Larry sharp who's the Libertarian Party candidate for governor in New York we've got the five candidates out there\nRunning and of course I Andrew Cuomo and mark on our the major ones\nAre let me ask you this in terms of the anecdote I open the show is I've heard from more than one person that I was talking about one in particular about Republicans who are disaffected with mark bone marrow going to you that they're looking for a safe harbor alternative are you hearing that at all you hearing from Republicans are unhappy with more narrow all\nOver the place is look there are to walk away movements that the Democrat what we're looking for people who don't like well I didn't actually they all ran to the next which makes sense because they just didn't want to crumble but they feel like the Democrats and they want to follow their party to rush off an exit\nBut now when Nixon was on I'm seeing a bunch of them float above me and how we ... that flow into both those people who are much more stronger laughed tend to go to ... how we can do tend to be far more or less than I Am and\nThen the miners getting some of those as well I Would note\nSome yes but she's also very localized because it seems to be the mayor of us are hers is much more localized I'm Talking statewide rather localized global you're correct a lot more locally in meetings are accused but when you go across the state not as much more people know myself and how we hope and her so state wide you find that\nAnd the other thing you find as Republicans to coming to me by Republicans don't have anyone else they realize the conservative party sold them down the river by taking him and other puffing a buddy how does the anything and sixteen years I said is all the time the Democratic party has run this date for sixteen years the Republicans have not won a statewide election period governor governor anything senator nothing\nIn sixteen years for the Democrats are going to fix the state they would have the Republicans have watched this happen where's their plan\nWhere's their movement zero they got nothing I've been doing this one year and in one year I have plans if you don't like my plans awesome helped me fix them I'm open but at least I have plans I'm shift in this state the right direction the ... the the other option\nA lot of localized global correct a lot more is going to her locally in meetings are accused but when you go across the state not as much more people know myself and how we hope in her so state wide you find that\nAnd the other thing you find as Republicans to coming to me by Republicans don't have anyone else they realized the conservative party sold them down the river by taking him and then on top of your body has anything and sixteen years I said is all the time the Democratic party has run to stay for sixteen years Republicans have not won a statewide election period governor governor anything senator nothing\nIn sixteen years for the Democrats are going to fix the state they would have the Republicans have watched this happened where's their plan\nWhere's their movement zero they got nothing I've been doing this one year and in one year I have plans if you don't like my plans awesome helped me fix them I'm open but at least I have
