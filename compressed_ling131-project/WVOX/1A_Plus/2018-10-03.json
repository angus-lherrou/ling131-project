B. O. X. on this first Wednesday of every month to talk about what's happening at the maritime aquarium and to give you behind the scenes insights into the aquariums operations in this our thirtieth anniversary year\nAs I always like to say every month although we're just across the line in Connecticut\nThe maritime aquarium considers itself to be Westchester counties hometown aquarium\nAre focused on Long Island sound certainly makes it relevant to Westchester because your activities can and do impact the health of this important body of water and also the health of the hundreds of marine species that live in it\n[noise] speaking of Long Island sound you may have seen in the news last week that the organization said the sound released it by an annual report card on the health of Long Island sound and good news there were improvements throughout nearly the entire one hundred and ten mile length\nThe biggest improvements came in the western end of the stand with the area that is also the most challenging because it's more like the back into the bath tub with all the stuff that flows off the land in this densely populated area and without a lot of title refreshing what goes into the end of the fan tends to stay in the sound and that reduces\nGraham considers itself to be Westchester counties hometown aquarium are focused on Long Island sound certainly makes it relevant to Westchester because your activities can and do impact the health of this important body of water and also the health of the hundreds of marine species that live in it\n[noise] speaking of Long Island sound you may have seen in the news last week that the organization said but the sound released it by an annual report card on the health of Long Island sound and good news there were improvements throughout nearly the fans entire one hundred and ten mile length\nThe biggest improvements came in the western end of the stand which is the area that is also the most challenging because it's well it's more like the back into the bath tub with\nAll the stuff that flows off the land in this densely populated area and without a lot of title refreshing what goes into this end of the sound tends to stay in the sound and that reduces the water quality but thanks to residents doing their thing like maybe you folks listening not over fertilizing girl on baby end\nIn large part to upgrades to municipal sewage treatment plants the western end of the south has shown improvements saved the sound gave the area between Yonkers and dairy in Connecticut a B minus which is up from a C minus just two years ago\nAnd the segment of the sound from Gary in Stratford, Connecticut the sheer got a great of a minus up from up beat two years ago\nAnd only down or was the grade of asked that was given to the fire fire western end of the sound and we're talking about the area of the sound that extends out to the East River like around the rocks that bridge white stone bridge where it's very desolate developed heavily populated and just get to know exchange of the freshwater some of the Atlantic so\nPositive news from say the sound last week about the sound and obviously there's still work to be done so especially in this western end here of West Chester in Fairfield counties but today on shark radio we're going to let you know about two movies coming out of this month to the maritime aquariums giant screen IMAX movie theater\nAnd one of these is two thousand one a space odyssey Stanley Kubrick sigh fry ethic that is especially the available district for the first time ever in the spectacular IMAX format\nOn the occasion of his fiftieth anniversary we'll also talk a little while today about how to come behind the scenes of the maritime aquarium this Sunday Morning to watch and maybe even help a little\nAs our educators and animal husbandry staff makes the morning feeding grounds but there's a lot going on with sea turtles sea turtles in Long Island sound and\nOne special little sea turtle inside the maritime aquarium as well as with abandoned lobster pots and the sound in here to talk about all that is a staff research scientist for the maritime agreements Dr Davidson good morning date welcome back to morning Dave thanks very welcome you back sure so it seems like in the last two months it's been a case of good news bad news regarding sea turtles understand we're\nFinding out they didn't beat sea turtles are here and the sound again this summer but we're also we're finding out because now for sea turtles system and found dead killed by getting hit by boat propellers so going on with us so to first of all kinds of ... what kind of turtles have been getting killed\nSo all four of these have been a loggerheads sea turtles which are ... you know we we that's actually the same kind of turtle will be releasing in out in mid October ...

G. at at ten Nineteen and a lovely Wednesday morning we're all sort of like bringing ourselves out from storms\nIf you're just tuning in a day where you are listening to shark radio with the maritime aquarium at some of the segment here on fourteen sixty WB elects a Whitney global media station\nThat lets you in on what's going on in the ... it's just a short ride up I Ninety five indoor rock Connecticut that's David ... back in the long hair and said you recently were involved in getting a bill passed through the Connecticut state legislature that will help the aquarium do a special kind of cleaned up by the sound and probably costs about that\nAbsolutely so ah the the law is a little different in New York and Connecticut was a to point where\nWhen it comes to getting after a band and our derelict lobster traps um another fishing here you know typically when when in any active fish are you there is some loss of gear\nThat runs in a minute or two and five and Fifteen Percent of the gear so there's there's there are a lot of traps out there just from that alone\nAnd we weren't really able to help all of them in Connecticut deep he was not able to haul them um before this law was changed so he worked with the war on some sound keeper ... Lucy to to work towards that end\nOK so these like can you I Can't if you find some like you know abandoned a lobster pot why can't pull it up\nThere was someone's property that someone's property so when it comes down to um making sure that you have it so we didn't have a ... of legal mechanism at that point to uh be able to to clean up something that he was even Fifteen or Twenty years old for the car they're bending car on the lawn\nOr able to continue sitting there and if I add up light yeah or we want to make sure that we're we're cleaning those up a look there's still an active fishery out there so folks that are that are fishing active tags chef certainly make sure that they're you know they obviously they would like to make sure that they're fisheries health is healthy so that their um their business is healthy\nBut again I'm I guess I'm Still struggling so it's a it's a it's a lobster pot that down there that doesn't have a line and a boy on it anymore so you find how do you even know I mean yeah I'm like someone's property but how do you even know who it is\nSo the the tags that's on it so we are so if there's a tag on it all we were so the the law basically have any ... it so it has to be you have to be designated by the Connecticut deep to do this you can't you can't just be anybody\nSo they they want to make sure that this is being done all are on the up and up so you have to hold it for thirty days and uh obviously once we get this started will will provide a both are the number on our website and uh to Connecticut deep so that if ah we do encounter anybody's traps\nAre clearly those will be lifted so they can come and claim them okay\nYou mentioned like the ban in car in the front yard which has some sort of a visual life like you know one can see these hot so what's the ... why is it a big deal that they are down there\nSo the the ... the Cornell extension out on Long Island has done this in eastern Long Island sound and they've found that that some of these traps are actually capturing animals and uh they're they're killing animals so that that's actually\nA probably having a significant dent on our fisheries which has an economic effect so there's been some work that's been done in other estuaries there's work done in Virginia that found that if you even if you remove nine percent of their trapped down there they would see at Thirteen thousand five hundred metric tons of increase in the ...\nWhich is an incredible number when you're thinking of just the sheer number of animals but also the value of that fishery\nIs or how many ... so I think yeah I've heard you mention a number of like thousands there maybe some of the Cornell a work that's been done has said that\nTo a place like you know one can see these five so what's the ... and why is it a big deal that they are down there so the the ... Cornell extension out on Long Island has done this in eastern Long Island sound and they've found that the some of these traps are actually capturing animals and uh they're they're killing animals so that that's actually\nA probably having a significant dent on our fisheries which has an economic effect so there's been some work that's been done in other ... work done in Virginia that found that if you would if you remove nine percent of their trapped down there they would see a Thirteen thousand five hundred metric tons of increase in the fishery\nWhich was an incredible number when you were thinking of just the sheer number of animals but also the value of that fishery right\nSo how many ... so I think you do mention a number of like thousands there maybe some of the Cornell a work that's been done has said that there's anywhere between a seven hundred thousand and one point three million traps out there in Long Island in Long Island sound although we'd like to get a feel for\nWhat's going on specifically ... sound because maybe that number a slightly different um we'd like to get a little bit more information to\nI I Would think with that number I was gonna ask you how you possibly can find them but it sounds like you'd almost trip over there [laughter] so you would almost trip over them but they and we we do kind of ... are we encounter cruise comes up with one or two a week or they do the same this trauma same exact place every single time they go out there\nSo that to have that many traps out their means that\nUm we would actually see some of those falling into our troll areas\nSo so the aquarium and I assume other institutions that will will be starting to try and go out and started cleaning these things yes we'll we'll probably be the the guinea pigs for deep and then we'll probably be working with a bill Lucio at the sound keeper cool very cool or we gotta keep moving David and uh hey Oliver you devoted listeners the shark radio are you more curious now about how the maritime\nA crane cares for its animals or maybe you visit the aquarium a lot and wish you could deepen your experience\nWith this Sunday October seventh day crime is offering you the chance to go behind the scenes to watch and even help sometimes as our educators and marine biologist do their morning rounds practically crane opening for the day is one program is called feeding time and it takes you back staged the the quality of care that we provide to our animals\nYou join in and you'll get the chance to hand feed the race and our second rate touched pull the the really unusual way that horseshoe crabs eat\nFeeds them adorable diamond back to her up and turtles and attend a private sealed feeding and most exciting ball you get to go above our big ocean beyond the sand exhibit to watch the feeding a seven and eight foot sharks prowling just below you on the other side of the railing it's a really fun and memorable thing for parents and kids to do together\nOr even grandparents and kids especially for budding little marine biologist but please note the children must be at least five years old feeding time starts at eight thirty and costs forty dollars for adults and twenty dollars for ages five twelve these prices include aquarium admission at ten am maritime academy members get a discount of course\nAnd if you can't do it this Sunday Morning another feeding time is being offered on Sunday November fourth\nAdvanced registration is required those so called here's the claims number it's too low three eight five to seven hundred or you can register online at maritime aquarium dot O.

R. G. it is ten twenty five\nAnd we have to keep moving here it is time for our regular segment of shark radio is called Sandra unsound opinion I'm Dave Hudson I'm going to read you a series of statements to you and you'll tell me whether you agree or disagree with each one and why\nAnd I ... my opinion as well but rather than saying agree or disagree in honor of Long Island and we will say sound opinion or sand opinion ready\nI'm ready to Dave he's done these before so All right so here's the first one and a ... I'm going to be ... the question is I Would swim without hesitation\nOn the base side of Cape Cod but because of the increasing presence of great whites I Would think twice before I went in on the Atlantic side now I have to tell you I asked that question this is one of our August or questions back that two months ago\nWhile you were not here for this and this is sort of done not in the sand or a pianist supposed to be sort of light hearted in a fun but now it's gotten really serious because we had a gentleman from Scarsdale or who got bit seriously been in August and the sad to go through some ... uh I think a couple of surgeries and then we had a death\nTwo or three weeks ago or a off of wealth late so this has now become a joking better anymore and I and my answer back in August what they're even then before these things happen I there's no way I Would go swimming on the Atlantic side off Cape Cod anymore how about you are oh back to the question I Would win without hesitation on the base side of Cape Cod\nBut I Would think twice before going in on the Atlantic\nSide for me it's on sound because I'm a marine biologist it's kind of a occupational hazard um but I always make sure that I one don't look like a seal and part of the big deal out there is that there is an increased seal population\nUm so ... will get confused and it turns out that their way of telling what things are is to bite them into a really the biggest thing is usually ... use your judgment right\nAnd we know that the the young man who at first it was killed was had a boogie board so he may have ... you're talking about cutting that silhouette of something that looks more like a seal and the food and unfortunately with the great white sharks sometime as this one bite is all that really takes\nAny need to just keep an eye on what the the lifeguards are saying\nThat All right okay I mean this lately to another discussion sometime I I I saw the number thirty to fifty thousand gray seals now populate south eastern Massachusetts and so that's what's driving all these sharks coming closer to shore cetera so now the question of maybe come we have to do something about all the seals\nWhich well that's a that's another that's a whole other level than baby next what's question but you know their their federally protected and I'm a fisherman are unhappy about this population at football games enter distemper\nVirus too so I mean there are a number of things that are going on with that population come successful wrong so it's really figuring out how we can still interact\nWay up to an order he just like at your that provides but like how how many seals kinda population Cape Cod and even I Would stand before it has to clap during the solstice because there's too many deals right or if they have to move off\nThat's a good question All right so you're saying ah unsound opinion I'm saying sound as I did in August there's no way I Would go swimming on the Atlantic side of\nOf Cape Cod right next question lobster will never again be a viable industry in Long Island sound who you're talking about the lobster pots and so many of them and I've been cut loose or a band end or are you as you mentioned before like stored people are just like some of these may just be stored in the water or per se keeping but lobster will never be a viable industry and the sound again\nBut it's unsound because it currently is a viable I'm not merely to levels that it's it's but the folks that are currently making a living out there are are making a good living um I don't think you can certainly withstand the number of of lobster of lobster companies that were that we had\nThe population like Cape Cod and even I Would stand before it has to collapse around itself just because there's too many bills right or if they have to move up\nThat's a good question All right so you're saying are unsettled opinion I think sound as I did in August there's no way I Would go swimming in the Atlantic side of\nOf Cape Cod right next question lobster will never again be a Bible industry Long Island but we were talking about the lobster pots and so many of them and I've been cut loose or of abandoned or or your as you mentioned before like stored people are just like some of these may just be stored in the water rose per se keeping but lobster will never be a Bible industry and the sound again\nBoyd's unsound because it currently is a viable I'm\nNot merely to levels it's it's but the\nFolks that are currently making a living out there are are making a good living um I don't think you can certainly withstand the number of of lobster of lobster companies that were that we had before um but for now it's\nI Know that doesn't sit in the headlines but that might be a more appropriate and it's important that we are thinking about the words that reporters and editors are using because those words which I say a lot matter\nThis conversation is reminding me and the Americans with Disabilities Act which was adopted back in the nineties\nAnd in reporting world we used to use wheelchair bound when we talk about people who use wheelchairs but when the ADA came around then we changed the language to say someone who uses a wheelchair and the same person first kind of language so it seems like that's moving forward when the media is deciding how to name things\nI thought the most interesting media decision journalistic decision that stop me if I've got any of these facts wrong but the story that the New Yorker ran on the second victim for accuser\nAnd the New York times which was on the story but chose not to use the story the New York times believing that it did not have enough to go with the story having essentially the same information that the New Yorker had and the New Yorker did go with this story [laughter] right I have that right\nThe article but yet the article I Ronan Farrow in Jane Mayer who you know have written significant to I mean they're bylines carry credibility and it's an important factor the decision by the New Yorker had to do with the fact that she was willing to come forward to speak specifically I think personally and\nThe times decision was made in a somewhat different time context I think the New York ahead a little more time to develop it and therefore it got a little bit deeper into the story you might remember correctly\nIn the New Yorker had the ability to talk to the woman who was making these claims they New York times didn't have access to that woman and that was a key part of the story\nIt was interesting that the conservatives are those who are very strong advocates for Brett Kavanaugh tried to turn that into the fact that the New York times I think this was the story that was not what was happening that they just didn't have enough to run all our Sunday\nHave that right the article but yet the article I Ronan Farrow in Jane Mayer who you know have written significant to I mean they're bylines carry credibility and it's an important factor the decision by the New Yorker had to do with the fact that she was willing to come forward to speak specifically I think personally\nThe times decision was made in a somewhat different time contacts I think the New York ahead a little more time to develop it and therefore it got a little bit deeper into the story you might remember\nCorrectly exactly in the New Yorker had the ability to talk to the woman who was making these claims they ... didn't have access to that woman and that was a key part of the story\nIt was interesting that the conservatives are those who are very strong advocate for Brett Kavanaugh tried to turn that into the fact that the New York times I think this was a story that was not what was happening that they just didn't have enough to run all of a sudden\nThey liked the failing New York times that if I was actually about the New York times doing its job and recognizing they couldn't confirm that story and when the time's couldn't confirm that story that was the end of that they couldn't choose to publish this story they couldn't confirm\nRight sounds like it's a little different from the controversy with Ronan Farrow story and NBC the story that he broke that they wouldn't publish you know earlier that seems to have been an NBC cold feet decision\nWell they claim they didn't know they didn't have enough but the same amount that they had which ultimately published elsewhere so but I I think to Judy's point\nThe New York times never said the story wasn't true right contrary to what the conservatives say they did they just said we don't have enough to go with on this story it had they had the interview with the with the accuser they probably would've run the store\nAnd one of the difficult things that emerges is that once a story like this is published by the New Yorker it becomes a part of the conversation it becomes newsworthy and itself we put that story on the front page of the times union and\nI had an attack from a reader who said you published a story that the New York times didn't think was good enough even so left wing New York times wouldn't publish it and yet you did\nBut of course the story it out there and it becomes a part of the news even if you didn't think that the New Yorker headed enough content to publish it becomes\nA element worth publishing in this context\nBy the way you know that the joker going around is that the last thing that a CEO wants to hear as his secretary buzzing humid and say Ronan Farrow is\nYeah absolutely that used to be Mike Wallace [laughter] worse now Ronan Farrow absolutely you know one of the interesting developments also was a Supreme Court nominee giving an interview in real time to a TV network of Martha ...\nOf Fox News to the interview she by the way a an upstate product or graduate St Lawrence university\nI just passed that law and she did a fine\nJob with that in ... yeah she was thought fall and measured and she asked probing questions I thought that she asks questions that were relevant and she didn't like the judge off the hook I thought she conducted herself professionally and like a true middle of the road reporter with no bias with our little dry which probably\nSurprised cabinet and his handlers because I'm sure that they felt they were getting to a safe haven at Fox News\nAbsolutely that's why he was position that Fox\nAnd but there was a lot of blowback here to how Guerra Supreme Court nominee go out in the public and talked to a reporter I didn't have a problem with that I I think that they should be more available I don't think it demeans the court for potential deaths from ... to talk to reporters to get more out about\nWho they are and what they're doing [noise] of course this was a controlled setting and there was a motive behind that but I think the interview process for Supreme Court nominee needs to allow more probing by the news media yes\nThought that she asks questions that were relevant and she didn't let the judge off the hook I thought she conducted herself professionally and like a true middle of the road reporter with no biased with our little dry which probably\nSurprised cabin on his handlers because I'm sure that they felt they were getting to a safe haven at Fox News\nAbsolutely that's why he was position that Fox\nBut there was a lot of blowback here to how Guerra Supreme Court nominee go out in the public and talked to a reporter I didn't have a problem with that I I think that they should be more

and there was a motive behind it but I think the interview process for Supreme Court nominee needs to allow more probing by the news media\nYes interesting late so of course what\nShe didn't ask because it wasn't the context the interview and what he would not have answered would've been anything about his judgment about legal issues\nThe same questions that he wouldn't answer for senators during the confirmation hearing\nIt she wouldn't even ask him because we know we're not going to get a real answer so it was not at all illuminating about what kind of a\nJudge he would be on legal issues if he's on the Supreme Court he was only limited to the very narrow area of what happened and what are your opinions now in saying that that did not happen I I Would\nImagine we've all had the same experience whether it's the Supreme Court which we have not had the experience but when we've interviewed county court candidates city court candidates\nThey are very quiet on any kinds of opinions regarding judicial matters and I make good virtually impossible for us as an editorial board to assess them and I don't know how the voters assessed them other than looking at what the initial is next to their name because there are so you're ...\nOr the extensive ... precedents they sat and that requires a very legally tuned to mind that can that through precedent setting cases and determine what the judge ruled them why not things a lot of work\nWhich is why I Believe the AIDS around the country were asked to pitch in and help do research on behalf of the Justice Department when they were vetting him yeah ...\nMe the only gets to find out whether they're qualified around ... does not seem like a good amount of information because the voters before they were appalled\nIf

of course view this through the lens of their own experience and we've all had the experience of dealing with readers listeners viewers who come to us and accuse us of bias\nVery interesting new study out into the question of where bias complaints come from and it has to do with is that those who are most distrustful of the news media those most likely to accuse the media bias\nTend to be the most biased readers I guess this is is not surprising but we now have research that suggests that rather than having so much bias in the news media there is actually by us on the part of those who are receiving the news\nThis is a fascinating study that people should check out one of the reason that they think that people can three high level by us that they actually consume highly by US News and that just towards their frame of reference\nThey found for example people who regularly listen to Rush Limbaugh tended to be more ... than others out so MSNBC roads listeners or that audience tends to be more perhaps we should give a shout out to NPR and Wall Street journal ... those news sources had belief I ask consumers\nWhat's really interesting about this study is that it mirrored scholarly research where they did blind reviewing so that when they [noise]\nThey presented the group the cohort of people that they were studying were presented with news articles\nWithout the origin of the news article and readers did not know where they were getting the news from they were more likely to be accepting of the content more so when they did not know where it came from on both left leaning and right leaning readers so that's interesting that people were more accepting of content if they did not now where it had come from\nI loved the studies link to the way that symphony orchestras

apparently true ice at somebody in a bar fight\nYou know and I'm not going to dwell on it although our guest may talk a little bit about it but the idea that Brett Kavanaugh graduated first in his class from Yale University and I think from college as well but from Young University law school I should say\nOr is just sort of somebody who knows anything about college and grad school and uh the pressures and an Ivy League school first in his class I mean that's an extraordinary accomplishment\nAnd somebody who was up falling down drunk or a blackout drunk in my view could never do anything like that\nAnd I'm sure that's being factored into consideration of honest brokers out there and they may not be a whole lot of honest brokers sad to say but there are some and then that ought to be a figured in amongst many other things but the guy's level of accomplishment to sort of breathtaking especially\nCompared to I mean just think of your own experiences in school\nTo be first in your class is a big deal but to be first in your class and also\nUh be at a school like yell and yell university's law school which was framed as one of the find this law schools that there is out there really says a lot I'm just finishing up the third volume of a series of books has one of the comments of people's attention\nUndesirable and that's what the Democratic party has become an elitist party that lives in an article a bubble and if you dare disagreed with him a particularly the polls and you're not fit to be a voter are fit to be a citizen you're a deplorable you\nKnow we're talking to George moral and of course who many years ago ran for mayor of the city of New York as a conservative party candidate the guy's an active in the New York conservative party in the past he's written about governor George Pataki and\nThe Catholic vote in New York and nationally it was a good deal about New York politics that I mentioned that now because I Know or at least I Believe you had a chance to take a look at yesterday's Sienna college poetry is very bad for Republicans in New York let me know\nUndesirable and that's what the Democratic party has become an elitist party that lives in an article a bubble and if you disagreed with him a particularly the polls and you're not fit to be a voter fit to be a citizen you're deplorable\nWe know we're talking to George moral and of course who many years ago ran for mayor of the city of New York as a conservative party candidate he's a guy who's been active in the New York conservative party in the past he's written about governor George Pataki and\nThe Catholic vote in New York and nationally it was a good deal about New York politics that I mentioned that now because I Know or at least I Believe you had a chance to take a look at yesterday's Sienna college poetry is very bad for Republicans in New York\nAnd let me know that right after my show ended yesterday or the um mark bow and arrow Republican candidate for governor campaign put out a statement really ripping in to the CNN poll let me just read a little bit of it because it was unusually strong\nOn this show over several years I've raised questions about CNN Maris a Quinnipiac CNN Quinnipiac I think in particular\nAre partly for the questions they don't have in their polling which I raised the possibility was politically motivated for instance how can we not have had one poll in New York that has asked the question of voters in New York\nUsing governor Andrew Cuomo was corrupt we haven't had that I think it's because they don't they don't want Cuomo coming Donald down on them for asking a question like that but here's what\nThe ... campaign said we reject the CNN poll is part of Andrew Cuomo's corrupt rigged system\nWe are in commenting on a specific results today more fundamentally we are questioning the independence of the pollster\nWho I say to ... which I think to be a reference to the Greenberg the factors CNN address or dramatically all through the historical polling scheduled to favor Andrew Cuomo\nAllowing into spent enough words and twenty five million of his dirty pay a pay to play money in the midst of the worst month of staying governorship the head of a general election poll then they go on to make the case even further CNN has denied it\nUh of course if it were true they wouldn't admitted what'd you make of the polar George you want to make a claim that maybe the other of colors pulled out there really do kind of ... the polls in favor of their own political agenda sometimes\nAre there any truth\nSometimes the polls that done on the cheap and they don't have a large enough sampling and that has been a problem I had would Maris Sienna from time to time\nWe know in primaries you can do all the polling in the world is generally doesn't matter much because you just don't know what the turnout is going to be having subtle that I agree with you that they should have been some questions on the character and the corruption of the Cuomo ministries human interestingly and it's been left out but\nDespite the fact that high level officials including his closest said had been corrupt I mean one thing if you're asking it gratuitously 'cause there's obviously unhappy just neat there's a clear needs to ask that question yeah\nAnd yeah into sections matter in politics as we know in a deep beyond that you're right to a couple of his closest buddies political powers\nAre going to be spending time the slanted so but even with all of that you still have this poll says wrong direction and New York forty four percent right track forty two percent that's not good for Andrew Cuomo\nA coma do you have a favorable unfavorable opinion forty six unfair both ... the favor of ... that's not exactly you know a resounding endorsement off of that is a question here about what kind of job you think he's doing\nThey have a fair ... good thirty two excellent nine percent thirty two percent good but fair twenty nine percent poor twenty nine percent I don't know what your definition of the areas but when I was taught by the ...\nAsking it gratuitously 'cause there's obviously unhappy Disney there's a clear nice asked that question yeah\nAnd yeah and two sections matter in politics as we know in the ... the beyond that you're right a couple of his closest buddies political powers\nAre going to be spending time the slanted so but even with all of that you still have this poll says wrong direction and New York forty four percent right track forty two percent that's not good for Andrew Cuomo\nA coma do you have a favorable unfavorable opinion forty six unfair both ... the favor of ... that's not exactly you know a resounding endorsement of that is a question here about what kind of job you think he's doing\nThey have fairly good thirty two excellent nine percent thirty two percent good but fair twenty nine percent poor twenty nine percent I don't know what your definition of the areas but when I was taught by the nuns in Brooklyn many years ago if you got fair on on the paper and exam or something\nThat was a charitable term for lousy and my parents were not happy when I had something that said fair on and some people would fare in Port together\nThat's close to sixty percent I don't think very highly at the job he's doing so\nAnd there are regional differences and you see their doors down in New York City that's where he gets the strength shelf said that's where there's a great deal of hostility in the suburbs it's a little of both\nBut let me point out something else why\nFour years ago at this time Rob asked Reno is also about twenty eight to send these polls and he got approximately thirty nine point exactly thirty thirty nine pointing to sense in that November elections so let's get forty percent but he is an interesting thing four years ago\nA ... and the other leftist candidate got exactly a total thirty seven point zero eight to send\nIt was raining critical to the other guy\nThat's right a coma got three hundred and sixty one thousand votes so they got a total a of a hundred and Ninety two thousand votes so\nWhat is interesting in November the green candidate who for years earlier how we talk and got one point zero eight percent of the vote he suddenly got four point eight six percent a hundred and eighty nine thousand votes almost identical number that a vote of his teacher\nUnhappy people with Cuomo four years ago voted for the Green Party candidate this year that number went up to five hundred and twelve thousand votes against them two things are going to happen in November first of all the turnout in New York City is going to be down why because the election is really not the primary in New York City\nAnd in recent times it's you know about twenty five percent of the voters ... that come out so you're going to see a drop they about what's going to come out once again\nAll the people who don't like Cuomo so it is very possible instead of having the green candidate Stephanie mine uh I don't know Cynthia Nixon is going to be on or off\nBut there could be easily a half five six hundred thousand votes of people like Cuomo voting on these other line so that could bring his number down and got fifty three percent last time he certainly is fifty in this poll which is nothing get excited about for a guy wants to run for president but if you factor in\nAll things being equal this extra anti Cuomo vote that could bring him easily down to forty six percent mile an hour and forty percent\nYou're maybe unfairly wrongly minimizing the anti Donald Trump so that may turn out in New York City in particular energized Democrats even though\nThere aren't any important contest as go see it in New York City will want to make a statement and Cuomo will as we've already seen the running millions of dollars in ads thing he's the guy fighting against Donald Trump\nHe's running and Donald Trump basically I agree with you there are a hundred percent but two things uh Donald Trump got two point eight million votes um that's presidential election off year elections numbers like that dropped dramatically\nHis number down and got fifty three percent last time he certainly is fifty in this poll which has nothing to get excited about for a guy wants to run for president but if you factor in all things being equal this extra anti Cuomo vote that could bring him easily down to forty six percent mile an hour and forty percent\nYou're maybe unfairly or wrongly minimizing the anti Donald Trump so that may turn out in New York City in particular energized Democrats even though\nThere aren't any important contest as go see it in New York City will want to make a statement and Cuomo will as we've already seen be running millions of dollars in ads thing he's the guy fighting against Donald Trump\nHe's running and Donald Trump basically I agree with you there are a hundred percent but to think a Donald Trump got two point eight million votes um that's presidential election off year elections numbers like that dropped dramatically so you can also begin to gin up you know it could backfire were huge up that\nAngry Trump folk to come out again and the one and number two we can second guess it's all we want but I'll stand by my stand that even with this anti Trump New York city vote\nIs depressed in General Electric they came out this time out to dump state Senate is to punish him who Cuomo\nAnd I think the angry anti call people will come out but you'll see it dissipate New York city 'cause it always does it's just it's because it's so them the general election is over there the election as the primary so they're not ginned up to come out in the fall and nothing Andrew Cuomo was going to do is get people excited\nYou know in in Queens is just not going to happen so you know it'll\nBe ... and he says America was never that great again you don't think that's going to fire up voters\nWell yeah it it it fires up Trump's people up to fire up Trump's team in\nSuffolk County and that matters and that helps a ... mile an hour of the more important\nIf he gets under fifty percent of the vote I've said this before and I'll say it again on your show it could kill his presidential aspirations because a candidate who can't get the majority of the votes in his home state can't be expected to get a majority support from the ... for\nYou to that they come out just stick it to them the time\nThose are cheated after we see in the Sienna college poll and that Cynthia Nixon and it's pretty remarkable I think you can see if the polls accurate that she's still getting ten percent of the vote or we get is projected by Sienna\nYou know what that means in terms of the conservative party it would mean that the working families party would have row seat because that would be five hundred thousand votes or so\nThat has four hundred thousands that\nBut let me let me just point it may very well be the case you're absolutely right\nI mean they've stayed in quantum always under fifty percent in my view so that would suggest he and his people will do all they can to buy the working families party off and I'm sure the parties for sale don't you see that happening\nOh yeah ah if they get her off okay there you have some on the state committee who may say never Cuomo but I'll go back to my original point\nFour years ago when he wound up on the working families party line the Terry Teachout vote them to teach our vote came out anyway and voted against him on the Green Party line and that can happen again\nThis although CNN show that he that the mall and that the Cuomo's jumped six points from fifty to fifty six and ... I think John's\nTrying to think what he's actually I think he jumps pinpoints with her out of the race that was one on one but there certainly Cuomo's going to pick up some of those Nixon probably a majority of the Nixon voters don't you think or do you think there's only a no I don't think so because\nHe didn't get a majority of the stuff to teach our vote for years ago well that's a good point going so this and they are a lot more angry people\nAnd I'm Out there you know so uh I Am of the opinion that he will get under fifty percent of the vote regardless Cynthia Nixon as in or out because they went to how he Hawkins\nFour years ago when he wound up on the working families party line the Terry Teachout vote them and teach our vote came out anyway and voted against him on the Green Party line and that could happen again\nThis although CNN show that he that ... that the Cuomo jumped six points from fifty to fifty six and ... I think John's\nTrying to think what he drove actually I think he jumped ten points with her out of the rate if it was one on one but there certainly Cuomo's going to pick up some of those Nixon probably a majority of the Nixon voters don't you think or do you think there's only a no I don't\nThink so because she didn't get a majority of the deputy traveled four years ago well that's a good point going so this and they are a lot\nMore angry people and I'm Out there you know so\nI Am of the opinion that he will get under\nFifty percent of the vote regardless Cynthia Nixon as in or out because they went to Hawkins last time they weren't getting his vote went up from one point one up to four point eight and you have Stephanie mine are out there who will take some traditional democratic votes out of the city of uh Syracuse have nothing else\nSo my prediction is he'll be under fifty percent he's gonna try to gin up to get his eyes he can but he only got fifty three percent last time for goodness sakes [laughter] and here we have four more years of and plus the corruption plus the indictment spokespeople going the jail\nYou know Mike along very well he was a guest on her show I I wrote a history of the New York yeah I'm Glad you mentioned that every fact book called the good fight\nI mean what's the big story in the nation of courses judge Kavanaugh people or a line of polarized on it and of course the other big stories of Donald Trump himself now you have as a candidate for the Republican Party in New York for governor mark mowing arrow who are early onset I didn't vote for Donald Trump\nYou know I voted for Christmas gifts and among I don't I don't take a stand on Trump\nWhich must have alienated I Know it did alienate many Republicans but then last week or so on the question of Brett Kavanaugh which is around who is a rallying point certainly for many on the political right conservatives Republicans on Brett Kavanaugh their egos again mark Marlon Arab refuses to say\nIf he believes Kavanaugh order to be confirmed as a judge justice on the U.S Supreme Court yeah here comes the conservative party yesterday my long which in that party isn't doors mark bow and arrow of course during a commercial\nSaying you've got to support Marc Mauer narrow and we the conservative party we stand with Trump sort of saying you know the true conservative party is with Trump the saying vote for a guy who was not what the Trump to me that was obviously a back handed attempts or a a convoluted attempt to bring back\nTrump supporters and Kavanaugh supporters I Would say to to mark mile and arrows campaign by the conservative party\nBrett Kavanaugh which is ... who is a rallying point certainly for many on the political right conservatives Republicans on Brett Kavanaugh their egos again mark bow and arrow refuses to say\nIt's easily have in order to be confirmed as a judge or justice on the U.S Supreme Court here comes the conservative party yesterday my long which and that party is indoors mark bow and arrow of course during a commercial\nSaying you gotta support Marc Mauer narrow and we the conservative party we stay in which Trump sort of saying you know the true conservative party is with Trump the saying goes for a guy who's now with the Trump to me that was obviously a back\nHanded attempts or a a convoluted attempt to bring back\nTrump supporters and cabinet supporters would say to\nTo mark bow and arrow campaign by the conservative party in a a appeal I've never seen the likes of before\nAnd wondering if you've seen that and if you heard about it what you make of it and then the more general question of how can a especially conservatives be comfortable with mark bow and arrow when he won't support judge Kavanaugh or the president of United States\nWell first of all hey I I've seen the and I have a copy of the text in front of me secondly for the record I did not vote for Donald Trump doesn't mean I support his policies when I agree with them as soon as the ... and I've been very pleased and happy reading today about the\nThe ah the death of the nap the treaty and the new treaty that will be coming in its place so and I also am a great supporter cabinet and uh I was not familiar the mowing narrow has refused to speak on I think it's a mistake on his part so\nWe'll put out there having said that first of all Andrew Cuomo is running as saying basically if you're against Trump vote for me right\nI'm leading a site in New York\nThat's the campaign I'm leading the fight against Donald Trump\nThis ad is a conservative party is about an hour away from the party and the party which endorsed Trump is saying Cuomo wants you to vote for him because he's anti Trump if you're pro Trump namely the two point eight million people that voted for Trump in the last in the ... election\nCast your protest vote in favor of Trump on the conservative line\n... for a guy who's against trial and while he or a guy who was born in from the kid I don't I don't support tried and support Trump pilot what about the only come out with our\nOwn I'll vote against Cuomo because of this ridiculous campaign he's running and saying if you follow me you're against you know you for me because you're anti Trump it's absurd on his part so I have no problem countering that because if we get up\nAnd get out the Trump spoke to point eight million people that voted for Trump two years ago this will be a completely different landscape so this is a party and it's\nAlready hardy at eight and I'm like I don't know among other things that he uh he may not\nParty had it's a party ad aimed at voters to vote for a guy who's about based on their support for Trump to vote for a guy who doesn't support Trump I mean they're just trying to think of handling it\nSaying go to the conservative line to vote for him and all and that's how you do it gay you vote for the top of the ticket and you know I agree with you I think he's made a mistake on Capitol but I'm Still going to vote for him because\nI Want the conservative party remain our road seen I think it's a strong message when you vote on the conservative line it sends a message state why not only to Democrats but Republicans as well such merely mouse for God's sake so I you know I I have no problem with a party ad that's the\nPart of learning I understand that but I'm sure the mile narrow people knew about the ad I mean that's the way it\nWhy not and he may not like it and quite frankly I don't care [laughter]\nLet me say the election is it a month from tomorrow member third today's October second this Sienna college so we were talking about earlier\nBased on their support for Trump to vote for a guy who doesn't support Trump I mean they're just trying to think that the editor\nSaying go to the conservative line to vote for him and on and that's how you do it every day you vote for the top of the ticket the you know I agree with you I think he's made a mistake on Capitol but\nI'm Still going to vote for him because I Want the conservative party remain our road seen I think it's a strong message when you vote on the conservative line it sends a message state wide eyed only to Democrats but Republicans as well such merely mouse the God's sake so I you know I I have no problem with a party head it's\nThe part of learning I understand that but I'm sure the mountain Arab people knew about the ad I mean that's the way oh why\nOh not and he may not like it and quite frankly I don't care [laughter]\nThey let me say the election is it ... a month from tomorrow member third today's October second this Sienna college so we were talking about earlier\nHas fallen arrow with a generic vote there's no evidence in that poll and we haven't really seen anything in terms of a reliable poll I Would say that to counter that Mullen arrows caught on with anyone or has a single issue that's grabbed anyone UC am I wrong on that from what you're saying\nHands to Reno was a twenty eight percent as well four years ago and got forty percent of the vote right so I just I just wonder if Trump\nThough he's a loser and I'll let you may get ... percent of the ... you're saying\nWell he may get forty percent of all marry an angel may only wind with forty fourth forty six forty five forty four out and if you're not a huge Trump focus paranoid about cabin or they're annoyed Cuomo running against Trump ... can tighten up\nI agreed to how do you turn out to a strong Trump vote for a guy who was against Trump and won't even support cabinet and then he goes back to them as\nAngry people come out to vote regardless of who's on what's it\nLook they are likely to come out of supporters brought on\nHere and um popular guy but a lot of people may just vote for him to send a message to Washington about Trump festival or do I think it's rational not necessarily but I understand the anger that's brewing on both sides and it you know\nAnd Andrew Cuomo is not the paragon for these liberals who may that's for sure be annoyed to Trump but they may vote for him and Cynthia Nixon she's still on line or the minority can't they just send a message\nSo even though mowing narrow the eyes of some conservatives not the perfect candidate if they're overriding issues to show the pro Trump it doesn't matter to them\nAbout the kind of your life and you're really making the calculations from them and are among the narrow slash Kentucky side which is that if they present bow and arrow is the guy is not for Trump\nWho's moderate so called more close to the Democrats on a number of issues doesn't indoors cabin or that that will allow him to pick up voters who may be uncomfortable with Cuomo but it was kind of liberally oriented moderate voters as they would be described that this will offset the loss of conservatives this is obviously their calculation where do you think about it so I don't\nI don't think it's a good calculation personally you know the upstate vote as the angry upstate voters are economic issues\nOr it's over gun issues\nUm fracking issues so this is what turns out people and you're going to strike back cord and that's what he's supposed to be doing in my judgment sad to say where I disagree as as you you're ... them all in our campaign has re hire the old retreats from Pataki land right who buy into something that\nI don't agree particularly worked back in Nineteen Ninety four even though Pataki be Cuomo\nThey try to run on the campaign when I was no issues they before they Pataki was forced to put out that tax cut plan because the club for growth crowd that initially supported and put up the money for most of that campaign said we're taking a walk unless you put up this tax cut program\nAnd personally you know the upstate voters the angry upstate voters are economic issues\nOr it's over gun issues um fracking issues\nSo this is what turns out people and you're going to strike back cord and that's what he's supposed to be doing in my judgment sad to say where I disagree is actually when you're ... them all in our campaign has re hire the old retreats from Pataki land right who buy into something that\nI don't agree particularly worked back in Nineteen Ninety four even though Pataki be Cuomo\nThey try to run on the campaign went almost no issues they before they Pataki was forced to put out that tax cut plan because the club for growth crowd that initially supported and put up the money for most of that campaign said we're taking a walk unless you put up this tax cut program\nHis campaign people they're moaning company didn't even want to do that they thought anybody but Cuomo ABC candidate was enough to win\nAnd work but they mistake was ... back in those days on the independents line of spending millions of dollars that strategy could have\nBackfired so you're dealing with the same old crowd that believe if you don't talk on issues you're not going to know anybody well you know wanting a lot of annoy people out there and you've got to appeal to them on the issues that matter to them so that's my free advice to the ... mile an hour of campaign\nIf they want to get that forty percent of the vote\nAnd really just up the the the pro Trump votes in the state upstate in the Long Island so that's my free advice that aren't\nGeorgia's then as time remaining let me ask you as a student of history to give us your reflections on the Brits having a situation I frankly never seen anything like that the closest analogy to me is Nineteen fifties\nMcCarthyism communism where anybody who was accused of having any association with communists or communist front groups could lose their job\nYou socially ostracized we condemn and you are guilty before or you know ... or the presumption was a guilt and we now have\nDemocrats and even the ACLU saying that the presumption of guilt really is what they start out with the facts be damned but what's your take on\nIf you if you just sum it up it's a new ... and the only honest guy and the left has been Alan Dershowitz who's been ranting and raving about how the ACLU and others have walked away from the presumption of innocence or of any person it's accused of something but there's more to this\nFor the left there are no rules they will destroy anybody the other day they try to jump on Lindsey Graham because he did to speak out like applying well he's a homosexual\nWell that's homophobic you know but it's okay when the left does that's crazy but more important\n... vote someone on the home oh\nYeah yeah that's not forget that ah when you go back to the Clarence Thomas hearings they try to lead tried to turn him into like the bad image of the black guy who will go after any woman you know have multiple children from a multiple women and walk away from being a father\nWith cabin or now an Irish Catholic suddenly they're trying to make them into a drunk so it's the stereotype he drank in high school oh boy oh boy he drank in college oh boy well I went to a Catholic high school and a Catholic college and let me tell you Fred I drank a lot of beer\nAnd Irish
