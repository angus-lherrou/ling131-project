one right here in Rochester county anytime you want to do it I'm sure we can get the venue for really quickly governor doesn't want any part of that but I'm sure mark wood for sure but I mean it's really so disrespectful\nWho everybody north of I Will call it the Tappan Zee bridge everybody north of that bridge doesn't get counted at all anymore by our by our government uh and it's really unfortunate for those of us that are doing our best to make this place better up here it's an unfortunate slap in the face that continues to happen so\nYou're a hundred percent right and they say they don't pay a price for it though if they paid a price they change their behavior\nSomebody to eat out I read the tweet on the air yesterday\nThat you've got the Albany Times Union and the Buffalo News and other papers that are going to New York times going to be critical of Cuomo and written some good stories about him and then again they'll just indoors than they'll say he's lucrative they'll say the administration is corrupt they'll say upstate is dying but then it only there were some in the end\nYeah it it it's it's really almost comical but sadly comical the business council same thing I mean we have the worst business climate or third worse whatever you want to call it worth the bottom that's for sure uh business friendliness and taxes and everything else or at the top of taxes but you\nKnow what is the business council them they endorse them anyway\nSo I wandered squandering credibility I mean that was one of the most ridiculous thing that anyone has ever seen the worst state in the nation for his business climate and they don't even have the courage to say that and to say you know ... remain neutral was the very least\nYeah you could have issued known doors minute right but they turn around and endorse and by the way this isn't like the first time out of the gate this is the third endorsement I think we know the pattern here what's gonna happen so I I just think what you can do as a voter\nDo not let this opportunity you pass you by and if everybody in upstate votes that's where our power comes in if every gun owner votes that's how you change the outcome but if people accept\nThe foregone conclusion that the press is trying to write out there then we're going to get what we deserve but if we get out there and say there's no way I Will let this go by and get out there and vote make sure you get all your friends to do the same\nThat's really that's that's how we show respect to the process\nWas talking to save a glock Clinton rents are kind of executive a Republican who some have suggested might be a good new Republican state chairman depending on the outcome in two weeks and the outcomes on looking too hopeful for a lot of Republicans but summer doing reasonably well let me ask you Steve as I could about the poll that came out yesterday from Santa\nOn uh the congressional race that's so tight apparently in the nineteenth congressional district John fast so against Antonio Delgado what'd you think of at one point race you think it's accurate to what's your sense of how that's going\nYeah not sure that it's accurate no disrespect to see and that's a great institution but the polling leaves a lot to be desired very often and look at the polling\nRight out there then we're going to get what we deserve but if we get out there and say there's no way I Will let this go by and get out there and vote and make sure you get all your friends to do the same that's really that's that's how we show respect to the process\nWe're talking to Laughlin rents are kind of executive or a Republican who some have suggested might be a good new Republican state chairman depending on the outcome in two weeks in the outcomes are looking to hopeful for a lot of Republicans but summer doing reasonably well let me ask you see if I could about the poll that came out yesterday from Santa\nOn uh the congressional race that's so tight apparently in the nineteenth congressional district John fast so against Antonio Delgado what'd you think of at one point race you think it's accurate to what's your sense of how that's going\nYeah not sure that it's accurate no disrespect to see and that's a great institution but their polling leaves a lot to be desired very often and look at the polling for the for the presidency a couple of years ago so so far off it was it was incredible there's a lot of folks that aren't willing to answer those questions or or just give false answers\nAre and then or lots of just sit quietly\nWaiting to go vote and I think we saw that when President Trump got elected or I Would say that the race is tight for shore ah and again that's why we need to get our folks out there to vote or but I think John's house was going to be successful in the end\nAnd I mean she looked at what Delgado just said about Israel I mean this guy to describe this sketch it shouldn't nonstarter you ... and ... where is the press\nPounding him on that saying how dare you say that Israel is not a democracy you know what I mean he did what his statement was was just so off the wall and he gets away with that as well\nYou know during the call yesterday I was just sitting in during the debate you know helping ... I'm Sorry I'm Sorry I talked to over your head\nYou know I'm just saying he parachuted into this district no connection and I've even seen the far left his how wiped out they are ... what thirty forty years raised his family here served in the assembly as minority leader statewide candidate a couple of times\nThey're calling him a carpetbagger in Columbia county the guys lived here for decades\nDelgado has never ever even voted in this district and it's really an empty suit I think the more people take a look at what he stands for the more empty he becomes\nAnd now we're sending all of that that I think it's a hundred percent accurate and I would also add to it that fast it was known as one of the most substantive public figures out there really knowledgeable whether you agree with him in our new shoes he knows issues\nBet you in the end most of the newspapers in the district wind up endorsing Delgado because they're all liberal and they just want to Democrats and when they want an anti Trump statement\nYeah that's true but that's why so many of our folks are just turning away\nFrom the mainstream media than I Am not dealing with this nonsense I Know I'm being lied to and John fast so I think it would admit this willingly and an openly\nHe's a policy walk that means you're very studious he understands issues he knows what he's talking about isn't that what you want a congressman as opposed to somebody that doesn't support Israel one of our main allies in the ... the main ally in the middle east probably are only real ally over there for somebody that has a\nCarpet bag is weighing parachuted in has zero connection and want to say he was born and raised in Schenectady when\nHe was born in Schenectady he lived there for a while\nHe's in he's a product of New York city being\nPut in here to try to steal this election we're not going to let that happen\nBut I'll tell you though you know what I'm saying is that we used to take for granted that the voters would weigh the merits of individuals would look to see what experience I had with knowledge they possess\nA you know the uh commitment they've given to their communities no longer really hold true for a lot of voters it's argue for anti Trump for anti abortion maybe one or two other issues and that's it\nI mean that the fish reality of the assessment now in politics has to be\nWhat you want a congressman as opposed to somebody that doesn't support Israel one of our main allies in the ... the main ally in the middle east probably are only real ally over there for somebody that has carpet bag is weighing parachuted into has zero connection and want to say he was born and raised in Schenectady ... he was born in Schenectady he lived there for a while\nHe's in he's a product of New York city being\nPut in here to try to steal this election we're not going to let that happen\nWell hey there you know what I'm saying is that we used to take for granted that the voters with the way the merits of individuals would look to see what experience they had with knowledge they possess\nA you know the commitment they've given to the community is no longer really hold true for a lot of voters it's argued for anti Trump for anti abortion maybe one or two other issues and that's it\nI mean that the fish reality of the assessment now in politics has to be disturbing to people who believe in an informed electorate to have a vital democracy\nWas absolutely and it's sad ... you know it's amazing to me to see the amount of information literally at our fingertips but yet people seem more uninformed than ever there are about politics and about so many other things they get these snippets and soundbites\nAnd there'll be an ... around by oppressed in far too often as not honest with them not honest brokers they're trying to dictate outcomes and\nBe more editorialists than than reporters so it it's it's us trading for some of us but\nWe just keep going and going in and make in our case out there and I do think that the silent majority is going to speak I never believed in this blue wave I think it's nonsense and I think that well we'll see pretty quickly whether right or wrong but I think that our folks are going to show up and get their job done\nYou know I just have to as an aside a mention the headline in the New York times today the New York times it become I think a national embarrassment even though it keeps enjoying the prestige position of being supposedly the greatest newspaper in America this is a headline see even I don't know if you sort of not in today's New York\nTimes on the front page dealing with this massive army of five or eight thousand Central Americans marching towards our border this is on a news story that headline here's the headline Trump intensifies intensifies GOP effort to use race and immigration to sway the election\nI mean at the very least at or divorced it's a good story oh I'm a headline but for a news story to be headlined Trump intensified GOP effort to use race and immigration to sway elections have you seen Trump doing that\nNo not at all in any sane world what's coming at us from that border will be called an invasion but it is\nAnd the threat to the nation\nIf people think that those folks are marching along they are not they are being trucked they get out and walk for photo ops George Soros and his\nI mean probably the worst person in this country may be George Soros he's funding this nonsense and you know what if you don't have borders you don't have a countryside support the president on this I don't see any indication that what the times what the times is saying is true but I Would say the grey lady has gone senile because they are ah they're out of control\nCould learn just quickly you have a very interesting it's a district attorneys race in our rents are county Joel label awful was indicted but then the second was thrown out Cuomo was behind it there's no question about it the Democrats would love to get rid of your DNA Mary pat Donnelly the Democrat how's that going\nNuts height you know I I think Mary pat Donnelly nice enough person but zero prosecutorial experience has never tried a case here in New York state is not from what we can tell us support of the second amendment will not even answer the question of whether she'll enforced the safe or not which\nTells you that she's going to enforce it all your gun owners out there make no mistake she's going to try to enforce this and you notice how she runs from the governor you don't see the guy\nSo I support the president on this I don't see any indication that what the times what the times is saying is true but I Would say the grey lady has gone senile because they are ah they're out of control\nCould largest quickly you have a very interesting it's a district attorneys race in our rents are county Joel label awful was indicted but then the second was thrown out Cuomo was behind it there's no question about it the Democrats would love to get rid of your DNA Mary pat Donnelly the Democrat how's that going\nNuts height you know I I think very pat Donnelly nice enough person but zero

the government anywhere near that raised no endorsements no support none of that because they know how popular he is over here\nHe's worked uh I think as a contract worker for the department of health State Department of health they'll ask them about that\nIs active uh locally in the community and ah he with his wife and I'm a a Tiffany have three children and joining us right now is a Republican candidate for state Senate running against the old ... and the Albany and part of Troy district is Chris and Chris thanks so much for being with us\n[noise] morning Fred thank you very much for having me on it's a pleasure they're\nGood to have you I didn't realize you have a PHD where did it come from\nI have a PHD in epidemiology I got that uh you all so um it's a public health field a study of spread of disease in our communities [noise] um and with that I've been working with the state health department I'm On various contract assignments over the last ten years so uh working in science data and also policy here\nWhat kind of an issue before we talk about the center is just I'm curious uh I've always been interested in epidemiology used in the area of science what a folk focus or are you involved with right now in the work that you do\nRight now I work on our states prevention agenda so it's a series of about a hundred different health indicators that we have targets for over the next five to six years you know smoking rates drinking rates a mental health screening of violence in the community things like that targets which we feel um experts in public health across the state\nAt our local health departments are hospitals should be working on along with their community to try to address 'em at lower overtime to quote help our community so it's very important work that we do your own people healthy um it saves money on the healthcare side Medicaid side things like that\nUm studies are very clear that every dollar you invest in public health you save money on the back in the treatment so somebody that's very important to meet all personally professionally on politically\nWell as a PHD in epidemiology let me ask you to\nOf science what a sole focus or are you involved with right now in the work that you do\nRight now I work on our states prevention agenda so it's a series of about a hundred different health indicators that we have targets for over the next five to six years you know smoking rates drinking rates a mental health screening of violence in the community things like that targets which we feel um experts in public health across the state\nAt our local health departments are hospital should be working on along with their community to try to address 'em at lower overtime to prove help our community so it's very important work that we do your own people healthy um it saves money on the healthcare side Medicaid side things like that\nUm studies are very clear that every dollar you invest in public health and save money on the back into treatment so somebody that's very important to people personally professionally comment politically\nWas a PAC epidemiology let me ask you to put it on your politicians had an answer a question of policy as a candidate for office dealing with marijuana I Do you feel about the possible is likely legalization of recreational pot and the implications epidemiological early that\nBomb so there's a few things there first there's the medicinal side of things um I did have the pleasure of working early on here at the state health department and the medical marijuana team back from governor Cuomo's actually called for clinical trials of medical marijuana or just something that's kind of outside the purview of an executive agency that's something that's more in the private\nSector so I got to read up a lot of literature\nAnd really see the benefits of um you know the CBD components of uh of marijuana\nAnd how it can benefit things like epilepsy\nPain management Parkinson's and the data was pretty clear that there's definitely a positive benefit to marijuana for medical leave something that I definitely supported now turning to the recreational side of things in outlook marijuana's been outlawed for a long time for the data's very clear that\nYou know tobacco smoke is more unhealthy than marijuana I think is very clear that alcohol is\nMuch more dangerous than marijuana and we also see states around the country now legalized when you've got Canada which is just legalized I'm I'm personally in favor of legalization and taxation look at the economy in Colorado right now is\nAbsolutely booming I Know people who have left New York to move out there not because of the marijuana but just in general a sense of marijuana become legalized out in Colorado\nReal estate market jobs it's absolutely booming you know the death\nAnd there's no connection as far as I Know and if you look there's no connection as far as I Know and if you look at death rates from automobile accidents there up significantly and oh there's every reason to believe or it's likely to believe believe default based on those statistics that it's related\nWell that was going to be my next point is we have to also set up a side where Smith so we have to look and see just like with\nDrinking we need to be able to check and see if people are under the influence somewhere how there so that is one of the downsides of their ... products like this is it opens up the opportunity for people to be under the influence operating heavy machinery just like they would under prescription opiates\nOr alcohol so there does need to be the enforcement side on that side of the the equation\nWell let me ask you if you were talking to our Chris Davis who's a Republican candidate uphill fight of course we're a state Senate\nIn um a district that's represented by a new president it's a part of Albany county and part of the city of Troy view it give us a summary of what your campaigns about and why you think you'll resident after more than Twenty years in office should be defeated\nWell here's the thing this is my second time through Iran and twenty sixteen as well and we're running his campaign more like you would run for a city council or county legislature race really grassroots really door to door really rely on volunteers the reason I'm running as I've lived here my entire life and I've lost for the last\nTwo three decades this area go downhill all one needs to do\nIs walk down the street from the city Albany and see all the rednecks is on the buildings that they can store ... it's a mess small business\nThere does need to be the enforcement side on that side of the the equation\nWell let me ask you if you would and we're talking to our Chris Davis who's a Republican candidate uphill fight of course we're a state Senate\nAnd I'm a district that's represented by a new president it's a part of Albany county and part of the city of Troy view it give us a summary of what your campaigns about and why you think you'll resident after more than Twenty years in office should be defeated\nWell here's the thing this is my second time through Iran and twenty sixteen as well and we're running his campaign more like you would run for city council or county legislature race really grassroots really door to door really rely on volunteers the reason I'm running as I've lived here my entire life and I've lost for the last\nTwo three decades this area go downhill all one needs to do\nIs walk down the street from the city Albany and see all the red access on the buildings that they can store fronts it's a mess small businesses are getting crushed homeowners are taxed to death\nThe roads are falling apart beneath our feet it's a joke to the taxpayers of this state so I decided to step up and run because I have a family these I'm tired of seeing people leave the state for opportunities elsewhere and then this government's answers to turn around and say gee\nWhy are people leaving we should raise taxes on the people that have stayed here that is absolutely the wrong formula\nTo climate people as well and the governor says the climate\nFiled the governor has been known to make false since before and so this is a sad excuse to say that people eat for better weather sure there is a better way by their down south and it's one of the bonuses to leaving New York state but make no mistake people are doing it for better opportunities outside of New York state and that's why we need to work to address the corruption issues that we have\nThink we need term limits and one of the things that I'm going to do to help address corruption\nExplain every single vote I make to you on social media no one else is doing this there's going to be logical thousands of people deserve to know what the representatives are doing and what they are voting on and I'm going to be the first representative to explain every single vote I make sure you can hold me accountable no one else is doing this\nBecause let me mention that used to be I'd probably still around an old joke in New York City and political circles that the difference between the New York city council and a rubber stamp is that at least a rubber stamp left an impression\nAnd I would say the same thing about Neal Breslin that the difference between new president a rubber stamp is at least a rubber stamp leaves an impression ... think of anything then you'll Breslin has done to address the problems that you just outlined which I think are a hundred percent accurate that people in your district that deserves the communities in your district face\nAnything positive to be said about Neal Breslin\nWell I'm Neal is a pretty nice guy that people will show up to your ribbon cutting still show up to the Democratic the next but that's not what being represented as about being a representative as being a fighter for the people of your district and for the

cutting away from so even the president's favorite network which is really sort of you know a closed system with the White House\nBut there is something to be said he is number one he is the president\nAnd every time she changed Trump said on there and she yells out things like\nI hate you I'm [laughter] I'm like no matter Allen does it says that the ... at the television you multiply her by a couple of million and that might really affect the way in which this next by a lecture and goes and is very good chance by the way\nThat you're going to have a huge turnout am I talking too long it back to the media\nIssue at hand here rather than the political and please don't use it but there's not immediate intent here and I would point out that as we pointed out last week even Fox News is no longer carrying wall to wall coverage\nOf these these rallies that Fox used to carry entirely they are now even cutting away from so even the president's favorite network which is really sort of you know close system with the White House\nBut there is something to be said he is number one he is the president and so that is different from somebody who is aspiring to be president so you'd do pay more attention to the president if you're a journalist except\nFor X number to call and say we do equal time do we do not no no we do equal time on the president's weekly address oh yeah we give the Democrats the chance to respond or if the Democrats to present a week so I think that the earlier remarks by my distinguish panelists fellow panelists\nFellow panelist [laughter]\nI don't know I put a put out there is correct I mean there should be that way to put a Bernie rally on her second\nThere are not in fact rallies like the president's rally is being done by Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren and ... they are doing some political appearances and speeches and the like but they don't do mass rallies the ways that President does and the president is more newsworthy you know when he goes out and\nI think that the media have an obligation to as their reporting what the president had said or the snippets of what the president had said or has said for the hundredth time too at that very point also say but climate change is real\nScientists around the time or whatever it is about immigration or whatever it is about women's rights whatever whatever the issue is that he needs to be called on for not telling the truth\nIn a way that the media have never had to do before\nYeah real time fact checking yeah that's really hard to do and\nBe ready you know we can be ready with our list of\n[laughter] well I've actually seen them do it I mean I think CNN come on and say a president or just not wrong and I mean immediately real time as it you know isn't happening\nI think you're exactly right and I don't mean to say that I think that the media were fault less in the last election to one of the ways that Donald Trump succeeded was because of the relentless coverage that he got because he was so much more interesting and all these cable networks just laughed at that price which is why we should stop talking about\nHim now right [laughter] well like I had enough intend to do for them to another politician and that Ted Cruz and said oh walk 'em and here's an electric now\nHe's gotten a ton of money he's still running nine points behind Ted Cruz in the election\nBut nine points is nothing compared to an election we saw in Queens recently with the pollsters got it wrong by fifty percent what's interesting about that it's that we know all this because the extensive media coverage about the races that are certainly being micro managed by the press and Mike Rowe paid attention to\nBecause of the importance of them in terms of the things I like about the coverage that I've seen about that race is how I've repeatedly seen the clips of white cruise has said about Trump in the past what Trump is set about cruise in the past\nAnd how you can't believe anything any of them say because they're going to say nasty things and then there's suddenly in bed with each other\nKnow what you know what you're saying is that CNN wanted to do a debate who they invite\nAnd here's an electric now\nHe's gotten a ton of money he's still running nine points behind Ted Cruz in the election\nBut nine points is nothing compared to an election we saw in Queens and leaving the pollsters got it wrong by fifty percent what's interesting about that it's that we know all this because the extensive media coverage about the races that are certainly being micro managed by the press and micro paid attention to because of the importance\nOf them in terms of the things I like about the coverage that I've seen about that race is how I've repeatedly seen the clips of white cruise has said about Trump in the past what Trump is set about cruise in the past\nAnd how you can't believe anything any of them said because they're going to say nasty things and then they're suddenly in bed with each other you know what\nYou know what's interesting is that CNN\nWanted to do with debate so they invited both of them for an hour of course crews who is ahead like all politicians who are ahead there I'm not doing a debate\nAnd they said okay but then we're going to just have one person on and they've been announcing it all day every day that they're going to have made or walk on and that they're not going to have cruise on course he's not coming he's decided not to come that's pretty unusual isn't it\nAlso unusual is a single US Senate race in one state getting this kind of nationwide exposure\nWhy do you think that is well I think Democrats hate crews for them they hate him so much that they're sending a ton of money more money than has ever been raised in a senatorial election has gone to Iraq\nBut CNN is filling its job as a media outlet by providing listeners viewers readers however they are getting their audience is because I think they get those all those platforms with the opportunity to hear the candidates now the fact that one of the candidates chose not to participate\nIn a media endeavor that would have exposed him to probably

and said just because your head and that doesn't mean you shouldn't be beat your opponent should debate your opponent the New York times that it also\nSo that's another service with the media can provide by pointing out you know who's chicken and who's not everyone who which\nBy the way we think is not going to happen is we record this program that I don't think there's going to be a good bit of troll debate in New York we tried but he tried to joined it's illegal in voters and get a debate and I presume you to to uh WAMC\nBut we were unwilling to do with CNN is doing we decided we didn't want to have a debate just with the four challengers as a governor it would be a real debate if the governor there\nBut why would you have a debate for second place a great question and it makes sense that won its not held one yeah yeah but it gives him the deciding vote really and that's not the way it should be so so you tried to apply pressure as you said Allen with your opinion pages and see if you can get him to come out and\nYou can report what the candidates are saying and and their positions on things in writing for print and online without having the format of the debate and people who come to attend to be supportive of each party that right\nWell but you know are just so I think rex just raise them very interesting point which is in New York state we have a Republican Party Democratic Party that's the way it's going to play out but then we have an additional third party candidate\nShould they be allowed in the debate the league of women voters I Believe that said okay if you're pulling more than five percent and I don't really know if this is what they do but then you can be in the debate otherwise your cat were public radio station and when we\nBut it gives him the
