about hate\nIn America and you know I did we keep hearing it every time there's one of these things and I've been hearing it for the last three days we never thought it could happen here\nEvery time one of these things happen and we hear that over and over and over again because we all go through our lives and we all think oh these things are terrible but of course it never happened here well it can happen here and it does happen here it happens there and it happens here\nAnd it seems to be accelerating the pace seems to be jumping up just looking at the headlines this morning we have male bombing suspect Caesar say ... will be appearing in Miami federal court this morning for hearing ... he's the guy who was sending apparently or at least is accused of sending pipe bombs to people he disagreed with politically\nOver the weekend the FBI arrested a fourth member of a white supremacist group on charges of inciting violence at protests in California and also at last year's deadly riots in Charlottesville, Virginia this was a thirty eight year old guy\nOr the social media websites are full of a lot of this stuff and that's just that's just something I find it amazing that they allowed to happen now a ... yesterday was a beautiful day here in Washington DC area and\nIt was at the marine corps marathon which is an annual event\nAnd I was just struck by the difference between what I saw there and what's happening in the headlines\nYou know you have thousands of Marines and um folks from the other branches of the military running in this marathon and also a lot of civilians joining together and I saw a lot of Marines are in in their in their khakis a ballerina running the site and taking care of traffic and there I mean there are thousands and thousands of people there it's a very big deal and\nAnd I I'm always struck by what a diverse group they are because of course the military ever since President Harry Truman\nUh got rid of segregation in the military has become one of the best places in America for ironing out problems between the races\nMixing people together and they get to know each other they work with each other they have each other's back they save each other's lives and it's been one incredible positive influence in American Life I I really believe that going back now some Seventy years and uh and just watching the um [noise]\nThe the people who have come back from the battlefield missing limbs arms and legs competing in a marathon and of course there are people without legs so some of these uh you know heroes from uh the the borders of the last twenty Thirty years or you know it was so using their their arms to power themselves or with wheels to the finish line [noise]\nUm I was uh in the VIP area there and not because I'm a VIP but because somebody who is an invited me there because my wife was actually running in a part of the marathon they have a ten K. part and my wife who was a runner was running of that so I was invited to like it'd be right there at the finish line to get a good look at her as she came across the finish line\nBut I was standing next to a General Joseph Dunford the German of the joint chiefs of staff and a couple of times I stole a look at his face he was so proud\nOf the men and women around him on this diverse diverse sea of people in uniform and out of uniform wearing runners are all working together no thought of race or class or religion or any other distinction sexual orientation none of that they were all together it was just wonderful to be around that for a day\nAnd then of course you go home and you turn the TV on and you're seeing all this sickness\nAnd hatred in America there's a social media app called gab uh they finally taking it off line because apparently the gunman who shot to death eleven people in Pittsburgh over the weekend was using it\nAh to spout his anti Semitic hatred and they were described as a they tried to describe themselves they caught free speech alternative to Twitter and they had about four hundred and eighty thousand users but they took it very passive approach the statements that there were racist or hateful\nA they're a domain provider go daddy finally told notice a good gave notice to gab to you know what go find another server because there's too much or promoting encouraging violence there and just a few hours before he took off for the synagogue in Pittsburgh the tree of life synagogue on Saturday\nSuspect Robert Bauer is posted several anti Semitic statements including one saying\nA Jewish immigrant pro immigration nonprofit quotes likes to bringing invaders that kill our people I Can't sit by and watch my people get slaughtered I don't know who you're talking to maybe maybe white people but I'm white is not one of my people\nHave said screw your optics ongoing in right there on line basically you know a warning I'm going about it about to do something really really terrible 'cause a lot of that happening what do we do with this how do we deal with this\nAnd if you just start digging out in the social media sites it doesn't take much effort to find a lot of racism and anti Semitism and a bunch of

days we never thought it could happen here\nEvery time one of these things happen we hear that over and over and over again because we all go through our lives and we all think oh these things are terrible but of course it could never happen here [laughter] well it can happen here and it does happen here it happens there and it happens here\nAnd it seems to be accelerating the pace seems to be jumping up just looking at the headlines this morning we have male bombing suspect Caesar say I will be appearing in Miami federal court this morning for hearing he's the guy who was sending apparently are released accused of sending pipe bombs to people he disagreed with politically\nOver the weekend the FBI arrested a force member of a white supremacist group on charges of inciting violence at protests in California and also at last year's deadly riot in Charlottesville, Virginia this was a thirty eight year old guy\nOr the social media websites are full of a lot of this stuff and that's just that's just something I find it amazing that they allowed to happen\nNow a ... yesterday was a beautiful day here in Washington DC area and I was at the marine corps marathon which is an annual event\nAnd I was just struck by the difference between what I saw there and what's happening in the headlines you know you have thousands of Marines and the folks from the other branches of the military running in this marathon and also a lot of civilians joining together and I saw a lot of Marines are in in their in their khakis\nA ballerina running the site and taking care of traffic and there I mean there are thousands and thousands of people there it's a very big deal and and I I'm always struck by what a diverse group they are because of course the military ever since President Harry Truman\nUh got rid of segregation and the military has become one of the best places\nAmerica for ironing out problems between the races mixing people together and they get to know each other they work with each other they have each other's back they save each other's lives and it's been one incredible positive influence in American Life I really believe that joined back now some Seventy years and uh and just watching the uh\nThe the people who have come back from the battlefield missing limbs arms and legs competing in a marathon and of course there there are people without legs so some of these uh you know heroes from uh the the mores of the last twenty Thirty years or a you know it was so using their their arms to power themselves or with wheels to the finish line [noise]\nUm I was uh in the VIP area there and not because I'm a VIP but because somebody who is an invited me there because my wife was actually running in a part of the marathon they have a ten K. part and my wife who was a runner was running and that so I was invited to like it'd be right there at the finish line to get a good look at her she came across the finish line\nBut I was standing next to a General Joseph Dunford the German of the joint chiefs of staff and a couple of times I stole a look at his face he was so proud\nOf the men and women around him on this diverse diverse sea of people in uniform and out of uniform wearing runners are all working together no thought of race or class or religion or any other distinction sexual orientation none of that they were all together it was just wonderful to be around that for a day\nAnd then of course you go home and you turn the TV on and you're seeing all this sickness and hatred in America\nThere's a social media app called gab they finally taken it off line because apparently the gunman who shot to death eleven and people in Pittsburgh over the weekend was using it\nAh to spout his anti Semitic hatred that they were described as a they tried to describe themselves they quote free speech alternative to Twitter and they had about four hundred and eighty thousand users but they took it very passive approach to statements that there were racist or hateful\nA they're a domain provider go daddy finally told notice a good gave notice to gap to you know what go find another server because there's too much or promoting encouraging violence there and just a few hours before he took off for the synagogue in Pittsburgh the tree of life synagogue on Saturday\nSuspect Robert Bauer is posted several anti Semitic statements including one saying\nA Jewish immigrants pro immigration nonprofit quotes likes to bring in invaders that kill our people I Can't sit by and watch my people get slaughtered I don't know who you're talking to maybe maybe white people but I'm white is not one of my people\nHave said screw your optics ongoing in right there on line basically you know a warning I'm going to button about to do something really really terrible there's a lot of that happening and what do we do with this how do we deal with this\nAnd if you just start digging on these social media sites and doesn't take much effort to find a lot of racism and anti Semitism and a bunch of reports people who are studying the chef shown an up tick an anti Semitic rhetoric in particular on sites like Twitter and even
