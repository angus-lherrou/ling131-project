we'd like to know what you think about this topic you know it used to be a way that parents used to have to dread talk\nYou know the one about the birds and the bees but now there's one that most parents probably dread even more especially in African American communities where the talk\nOf especially with a young young black boys is about what to do if you're surrounded or approached by law enforcement of becoming a big thing all across the country\nAnd a trust me I Am not picking on the cops here at all because both sides have their uh have their issues to deal with the police you know they never know\nWhen they pull over a car who is going to be in that car how they're going to come out what might be happening as they approach and they take their lives in their hands every single time they do that we all understand that but there are differences between dealing with adults\nAnd dealing with kids especially teenagers and that has been leading in many cases around the country in recent years do on a forest\nThat things happening when both sides I don't know necessarily how to deal with each other so right now in cities all across America\nA there are people who deal with law enforcement and deal with kids are trying to find a way to make interactions between police and kids a lot safer or their training police officers to remind them that you know teenagers in adults are different\nUh officers are asked to make a list of words that describe themselves as teens and that sort of gets officers thinking about what I like to be inside the brain of a teenager so that maybe when they respond a certain way and helps the officer understand that they're learning that the brain is still\nA bobbing until we get to be about the age of twenty five years old and\nA teens can make poor decisions they can react badly some of them might have a smart mouth that gets them into trouble\nAnd the officers have to learn that the you know there's violence mental health substance abuse issues that all contribute to these problems maybe in a way that didn't happen when they were younger\nAnd so the police across the country are getting training to deal with this and also kids are getting training to deal with this situation when they're pulled over by a police officer or if they're approached on the street now we've had a lot of focus on the black community because of a lot of high profile cases where officers have 'em\nHave used weapons and sometimes they shouldn't have sometimes maybe it's defensible you know every situation is different and of course you always have to understand that police are making split decisions but I don't have the uh\nThe the nice a situation where you can think about it the day after no they're right there on the spot and they have to make a decision do they protect their life do they protect somebody else's life of what was going on there\nSo there's a lot of training that's going on a police are are are being I'm\nTold that they need to spend time with kids and a and that the the more familiar kids get were found that perhaps it all the downplay any kind of a an ease when they come together [noise]\nUh there's there's something called the civilian interaction training program is a project that the Texas commission on law enforcement has produced it's aimed at teaching kids how not to have problems with the Texas law enforcement officers now going through these training materials is mandatory if you want to graduate from high school in Texas\nThe bill's author Texas state senator Royce West says the
