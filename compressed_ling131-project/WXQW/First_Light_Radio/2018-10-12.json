three minutes before the hour on first light it's a friday morning that weekend as here weekend is always a good time to curl up with the book especially if the weather is a little a shaky where you might be this weekend well you know [noise] uh reading is just one of those things I started\nReading that are very very young age and I love it\nReading probably spend too much time alone in my bedroom reading when I was a little kid instead of outside playing baseball and running around but you know what it has a I think helped make me the person that I Am I Love to read one of the problems for me was when I went to college by the time I got into college I had to read so much for school work and then after college\nWorking in journalism and having to keep up on things that I had to read so many newspapers in periodicals and and books about current events I didn't have time to read for pleasure and for a long time I did not read for pleasure I only read for work and I lost my my love of it it was a it became part of a job\nAnd I almost never got to read fiction for a long time until\nI discovered back then it was called ... books on tape and you get these little cassettes in a box and they would come in the mail and you'd have to uh\nI think I don't remember how we ordered them to address was even before the Internet I was really around and it would it would come in the mail and it'd be a box and you can you listen to them in the car which was amazing and I when I discovered that I'm not going to listen to music any more than a car I'm going to listen to books and I've been hooked on listening to books\nEver since I hardly ever read anything um in terms of uh novels\nI Would never get to read a novel and enjoy being in the world at an author creates for me and losing myself in that\nWithout being able to listen to it so now and I'm not driving to work or I'm making dinner or cleaning up the house or doing yard work I've got a book going\nAnd I get lost in the world of the novel that way and I find I have better attention if a book is read to me than if I read it myself which is interesting I guess I'm a more\nUh bought a Tory person and then in a miserable person\nUm I Do still read books occasion I've always got at least one hardcover book in the family room that I Will pick up but most of my reading comes from listening right now I can tell you what I have in my phone which is how I listen I'm listening to a Doris Kearns Goodwin is a brand new book or\nA leadership and she talks about the events in the life of four presidents that she has devoted her life to covering a theater Roosevelt Franklin Roosevelt Lyndon Johnson\nAnd Abraham Lincoln and it is fascinating I mean just in in one day yesterday just driving home from work I was thrilled I was having such a thrilling experience running up San Juan hill with Teddy Roosevelt and the rough riders and the Spanish American war and then by the time I got home and I was making some lunch in the kitchen I ... I was cheering up\nAnd and having goose bumps and listening to her account of Franklin Roosevelt coming back from polio and having to make a national uh parents at a democratic convention to place the name of somebody in nomination to run for president the Al Smith\nWho is had been the governor of New York and he had to practice for for months to be able to walk\nFrom the back of the stage up to the podium and it was it was an incredible overcoming of this disability that had taken over his life the disability that changed him and made him the man who became one of our greatest presidents\nAnd you know I it was to both of those things thrilling and and being moved immensely ball by the same book and the space of an hour only books can do that for us but are we still reading books well the Pew Research center says that\nUm overall Americans read an average of twelve books for a year but that's kind of misleading because the real figures show that a lot of us are reading a lot of books and a lot of us don't read it all so when you average it out", "show_name": "First Light Radio", "year": "2018", "city": "Fairhope", "day": "12"}
