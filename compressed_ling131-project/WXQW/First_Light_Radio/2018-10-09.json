purpose speaking publicly about paintings medical condition the hospital did release a statement do saying it realizes that families who bring their children to cook children's for treatment but their trust in them and then\nAnother hearing it set for Wednesday Michael\n... thanks Clayton level in Dallas Fort Worth for first live it's a twenty two minutes before the hour now and you may be wondering how we got to this point how a hospital can decide what to do with the life of a child\nAnd even if a child is brain dead and they say there's no way this child is coming back the only thing keeping this body ally but it's the fact that we're pumping the longest up and down up and down and keep the I guess the heart beating the blood flowing well how does this happened while there's a law in Texas a\nIt's a it's kind of a unique law all around the country it was a put into effect in Nineteen Ninety nine it allows doctors in Texas to withdraw some forms of this life sustaining treatment even if the patient's family doesn't want them to as long as the physician has the backing of the hospitals ethics committee\nOr doctors in Texas are also protected from any civil or criminal liability meaning that if you're a grieving family member you can't take them to court\nAfter they've taken your loved one off a ventilator now there are states such as a ... for instance where doctors are explicitly forbidden from withdrawing life sustaining treatment without any agreement from the patient or the patients legal surrogates\nI think are just two other states California and Virginia offer abroad greenlight protections like those in Texas so most states don't allow this but we have a California Virginia Texas I guess [laughter]\nUm which which uh you know has these complicated laws dealing with this unbelievably complex situation\nAs I said there's a little girl at the center of this now we don't know if the little girl is still in there get doctors say she's gone there is no brain activity girl the little girl little Payton is no longer there just the shell is left\nBeing kept artificially resuscitated they're artificially room for me having respiration by a machine they say it's cruel to the child\nTo keep the body in that state the parents say we need more time now what is happening here they they had some legal action is back and forth over the weeks and they were given two weeks to find another place to take the child\nAnd that's proving to be very very difficult it seems to me that you might want to have if you're going to have a law saying that a hospital has that kind of awesome power over the wishes of the parents than that there must be a way to deal with the parents' wishes as well there should be a way to mandate that another facility would have to take that child I Would think", "year": "2018", "show_name": "First Light Radio", "city": "Fairhope", "day": "09"}
