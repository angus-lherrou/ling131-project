this morning call us at eight hundred seven three six three six six six because we'd like to know what you think about the job Congress did not only with the cabinet nomination\nBut with their work this year we have one party rule on Capitol Hill and both chambers how do you think they're doing either getting everything past that you want\nOr are they are not coming forward with things that you are are happier about so there's a lot to talk about there we also have a lot to talk about in the aftermath of the Brett Kavanaugh nomination than our justice cabin on a as a heading toward the Supreme Court I assume your lab at first work day to day\nAnd uh get set in the office set all set up in the office there had his first launch as a justice where the uh other associate justice is and the chief justice John Roberts so that's checked off on the\nOn the list of a two new items for the Republicans on Capitol Hill but there's a lot of work left undone and they've only got really a few days or a work schedule between now and the election which is coming up and about four weeks and then there'll be a lame duck session as such and after that\nLet's find out from Linda in Kenya and our Capitol Hill correspondents or how the dust is settling on Capitol Hill this morning good morning Linda good lawyer I Know there's no dust on you because you haven't stopped moving for a few days I guess\nYeah [laughter] everything that's going on out there\nSo uh so we got through they they got what they wanted and ah it seemed unusually bitter at the end where they were a lot of Democrats surprised by Susan Collins a voting the way she did or even the speech that she made which seemed unusually partisan for her\nWell she did telegraph several times throughout the process how she was going to vote people I think uh who were hoping she wouldn't vote that way we're we're watching her speech on the Senate floor and and and parsing every word until she finally said\nShe would vote chicken for Brett Kavanaugh but she she went through a a a litany of\nOf her a justifications for why she thought this and then why she thought that and then she seemed to go back and forth and back and forth until she delivered the punch line and so it was a\nIt was probably extremely disappointing to the to the Democrats but then again not exactly surprising either although\nShe did break the mold this time she does have a reputation for being a bit of a maverick within her party um she does have a tendency to vote against a lot of things that the party does vote for but you have to keep in mind she's a main Republican she's not if you will and Arizona Republican\nUh she is a a a a demeanor so I have a tendency to be a little bit more independently minded and so she she speaks their constituents whether they like what you did on this case it remains\nTo be seen I mean people are already talking about putting Susan Rice on the ballot to challenge her two years so\nBut that are real things Susan Rice just playing around by saying you know a big indicating sort of teasing on uh on on Twitter over the weekend is there anything real happening there\nWell she did kind of surprised people and she said that she would she would someone said let's put put someone else up against ... and a ... attack against us his college which is why she went out\nTo me [laughter] and everybody's sort of took it seriously um for about a New York minute until she treated again it said you know basically you know I'm just I'm just kidding but she may not be she may not be\nShe knows her parents or your family has a hole in Maine so she does qualify\nThat's interesting role you know there's there are a record number of women running for Congress this year so I guess it would be no surprise of Maine has a another woman running against a woman senator Collins who's been there for quite a few years now\nSo you know on television we can see what was happening on the Senate floor things look fairly normal\nUh I guess the TV cameras up in the gallery looking down don't really pick up a lot of interpersonal relationships and how that works what was it like up on Capitol Hill are are people that do they do they have contact with each other across the aisle do they swap each other on the back or is all that just gone right now\nA little of both um this particular vote on a confirmation was unusual in that well in many ways but it was unusual in that the senators all were in the chamber at same time and they were voting from their seats so everybody could hear their gays or nays\nNormally they just go to the recording clerk and uh you know just to talk to that person or raise their hand a thumbs up or thumbs down and then they leak or chamber this was one of those very high profile votes and everybody was required to be there\nWe're coming up on nine before the hour with the weekend wrap up piers Robert workman what sport's\nBaseball and the national league

first lied good Monday morning to you Michael Toscano here will do so happy that you had decided to join us this morning call us at eight hundred seven three six three six six six because we'd like to know what you think about the job Congress did\nNot only with the cabinet nomination but when their work this year we have one party rule on Capitol Hill and both chambers how do you think they're doing either getting everything past that you want\nOr are they are not coming forward with things that you are are happier about so there's a lot to talk about there we also have a lot to talk about in the aftermath of the [noise] Brett Kavanaugh's nomination than our justice cabin on a as a heading toward the Supreme Court I assume you'll habits first work day to day [noise]\nAnd uh get set in the office set all set up in the office there had his first launch as a justice where the uh other associate justice is and the chief justice John Roberts so that's checked off on the\nOn the list of uh to do items for the Republicans on Capitol Hill but there's a lot of work left undone they've only got really a few days or a work schedule between now and the election which is coming up and about four weeks and then there'll be a lame duck session as session after that\nLet's find out from Lyndon Kenya on our Capitol Hill correspondents or how the dust is settling on Capitol Hill this morning good morning Linda good lawyer I Know there's no dust on you because you haven't stopped moving for a few days I guess [laughter]\nEverything that's going on up there so a true they they got what they wanted and uh it seemed unusually bitter at the end\nAnd uh where they were a lot of Democrats surprised by Susan Collins a voting the way she did or even the speech that she made which seemed unusually partisan for her\nWell she did telegraph several times throughout the process how she was going to vote people I think uh who were hoping she wouldn't vote that way we're we're watching her speech on the Senate floor and and and parsing every word until she finally\nSaid she would vote chicken for Brett Kavanaugh but she she went through a litany of\nOf her a justification for why she thought this and then why she thought that and that she seemed to go back and forth and back and forth until she delivered the punch line and so it was a\nIt was probably extremely disappointing to the to the Democrats but then again not exactly surprising either although\nShe did break the mold this time she does have a reputation for being a bit of a maverick within her party um she does have a tendency to vote against a lot of things that the party does vote for but you have to keep in mind she's a main Republican she's not if you will and Arizona Republican\nOr she is a a a a demeanor so I have a tendency to be a little bit more independently minded and so she she speaks her constituents whether they like what she did on this case it remains\nTo be seen I mean people are already talking about putting Susan Rice on the ballot to challenge her two years so\nThat a real thing Susan Rice just playing around by saying you know I'm indicating sort of teasing on on on Twitter over the weekend is there anything real happening there\nWell she did kind of surprised people and she said that she would she would someone said let's put put someone else up against ... and a ... attack against us his college which is why I just want it\nTo me [laughter] and everybody's sort of took it seriously um for about a New York minute until she treated again it said you know basically you know I'm just I'm just kidding but she may not be she may not be she knows her parents are family has a home in Maine so she does qualify\nThat's interesting role you know there's there are a record number of women running for Congress this year so I guess it would be no surprise of Maine has another woman running against a woman senator Collins who's been there for quite a few years now\nSo you know on television and we can see what was happening on the Senate floor things look fairly normal\nUh I guess the TV cameras up in the gallery looking down don't really pick up a lot of interpersonal relationships and how that works what was it like up on Capitol Hill are are people that get do they have contact with each other across the aisle do they sloppy each other on the back or as all that
