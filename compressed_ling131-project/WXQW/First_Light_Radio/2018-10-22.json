of those names and there's about twelve different ways to pronounce that so we've settled on ... just in case you're wondering but other people have different versions of that I'm not really sure what he called himself so we're going with ... which seems to be the one that the people who knew him or are you using well\nThere's a lot going on this morning right now there are Turkish employees at the Saudi diplomatic compound in Istanbul they're giving statements this morning\nAnd they're considered witnesses or into the killing of a ... ... ... ... who is a\nThought to have been killed and dismembered inside the consulate building Marron Istanbul that's technically Saudi Arabia and sovereign territory a part of a diplomatic compound in another country there are a lot of phone calls over the weekend Saudi Arabia's crown prince Mohammed bin Salman called a ...\n... son and a two I guess what offer condolences or his father king Solomon likewise called the sun whose name is ... Sala\nPresident Trump was on the phone over the weekend with the president of turkey or to won discussing or the investigation and what they would do there and the president air to won pledged to shed light on all aspects of the incident the secretary of state Mike Pompeo is on the phone talking with the Turkish foreign minister\nAnd said that the U.S stands ready to assist in the investigation at any time that that's wanted so there's an awful lot going on they're also trying to find the body because that shouldn't give them a lot of information in terms of tracking down actually the the who what Dan wins of this uh apparent murder\nA window why will be another matter maybe there'll be able to trace that back uh although the government of Saudi Arabia is trying to put distance between the king and the crown prince who does operationally in charge of the country or a line between them\nKind of a barrier between them and the supposed rogue operation\nBoy for a rogue operation there was awfully well planned with very high a level operatives and equipment being sent in a private plane to Istanbul apparently just for this purpose there within ... dried out so\nThat doesn't sound like a rogue operation that sounds like something was planned in the way back country works\nWell at least most world leaders to condemn the king and the crown prince saying it could not have happened without their direct participation\nWell what's happening here in Washington is that lawmakers on both sides of the aisle they think that the Saudi crown prince Mohammed bin Salman is personally culpable and the death of the journalist and they want to\nCancel this pending arms deal between the United states and Saudi Arabia for the U.S to sell another batch of weapons to the Saudis which is something that's been going on for decades\nA correspondent Linda Kenyon tells us what's happening on Capitol Hill this morning Linda\nMichael senators they're talking about sanctions expelling the Saudi ambassador and more\nThough I think he did it yeah yeah I think he did it\nPowerful words from Senator Bob Corker the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee he CNN's State of the union he believes the Saudi crown prince this story defies belief\nBut it's just not a credible story for somebody to walk in with other people and get into fist fight and lose our live\nSenator Rand Paul towns Fox News Sunday he doesn't believe it either\nAbsolutely not I think since it's insulting to anyone who's in analyzing this with any kind of an intelligent background to think that oh this slight lead to a December met with a bow and saw so no Saudi\nArabia's foreign minister again allows you there and get them the crown prince during the Fox news interview\nConferences and this is another winter this even the senior leadership intelligence service was not aware of this\nHe goes on to say this was a rogue operation conducted by people who exceeded their authority and responsibility\nAnd the Saudis have set a whole bunch of crap but right after ... we know that Senator Ben Sasse on CNN's State of the union I think the cover story for the Saudis are they don't bring 'em and bowling and saw to an accidental fistfight\nSenate minority whip Dick Durbin tells NBC's Meet the press the crown prince has his fingerprints all over the gap and ...\nAnd the fact that he is
