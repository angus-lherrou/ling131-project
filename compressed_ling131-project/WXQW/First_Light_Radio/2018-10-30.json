hundred and seven three six three six six six and tell us what you think about voting this year\nIt's very interesting what is happening this year [noise]\nAbout um forty four percent of U.S companies say that they're going to carve out time for their workers can vote this year because you know one of the problems with only voting on one day basically during daylight hours is a lot of people can't make it to the polls they work jobs they have kids\nThey have to take care of it they have all kinds of things to do and the only get one shot every other year or every four years to vote seems kind of like a precarious way to run a democracy\nYou know one day and it's such an odd and lead time day the first Tuesday after the first Monday in the month of November why isn't it on a Sunday or a Saturday when more people are off work and couldn't get to vote why isn't it both Saturday and Sunday you know why is it not a national holiday you know\nMost of the modern democracies in the world I think just about every one except the United states hold their elections on weekends are mixed election day a national holiday\nAnd uh you know once again we're behind are doing things and the two hundred and fifty year old way rather than the modern way\nSo uh maybe if you work for companies like uber or Lyft or Tyson Foods or Patagonia you'll get the time off because your company's your stores are closing down that day on election day sort of all the employees can get a vote\nAnd I'm Glad that the companies are doing that but I Wish we as a society we're making it a little easier to vote right now some thirty seven states\nIncluding though is that in the mail ballots to voters\nAnd the district of Columbia let citizens vote ahead of election day now this has been a a growing trend back in Nineteen eighty about four million ballots are cast ahead of the actual election day last time out for the presidential year and twenty sixteen more than forty seven million people voted early now that\nThe case for early voting for people who liked the idea of simple you provide citizens are more options to vote whether by mail or in person the head of the election makes it easier for them to do so they can avoid long lines on election day [noise] um [noise]\nBut uh some say that well maybe if you do it early people don't have all the full information that they would get by paying attention to a campaign now I'm not sure what they mean by full uh information unless you're talking about what political commercials which have all the\nAll the informational nutrition of a grain of sand in them for the most part they usually just negative ads anyway with false information from both sides so you know where do you get your information from I Would think that by uh you know we could do before election you should have a pretty good idea of what candidate you like or don't like and if you want to vote\nAnd um you know and now of course there's been a backlash and it's twenty sixteen some legislatures because\nWhat they discovered after the election was that Iraq Obama's lead and many of the close states was made in early voting and he actually lost the vote that happened on election day and that of course makes the point that for a lot of working people having an only on one day during basically daylight hours is very difficult for some of those people who can't get to the polls\nAnd so some of the Republican legislatures have been trying to curtail early voting\nA especially on days for instance on Sundays when the black churches would would uh you know take their voters to the ... to the to the polls but but you know where it seems to me that the more chance we have to vote the easier that we make it to vote and especially now you know there's so many ways of\nDoing it electronically and with all kinds of ways of\nKnowing who the people are and they're they're all voter ID laws and a lot of states which are\nWhich some people complained makes it harder for people to vote other people say well you know now at least we know who the person is so as long as we get make sure that we get those ideas to everybody you know get battle that's not such a bad thing where you have case there's a lot of cases this year where [noise] um and this is this is one of those corks in our system where once again you have the people who benefit",
