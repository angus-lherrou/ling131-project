society that we need to do this are we are are those are are there people among us who are so lonely\nThat this is what they are forced to do is a therapeutic for them or will it make whatever problems they have a worse especially as they become become this is really object defying sex isn't it you're turning the female form a into an object at this point because in this situation it is an object\nAnd I don't see any information here that says that this is something that women would go to I don't see anything about male dolls that seems to be more\nOr something that attracts man looking for female companionship of some sort\nSo I I'm not being sexist by concentrating on the male part of this but uh you know I think we can imagine that it would be mostly a bad thing that men probably

Nineteen eighties when the VCRs first started coming out\nAnd and the people who make porn movies realize well they could close down all these leaders are which are expensive to operate and just you
