here oh\nYeah I put up with a bustling with the whole the whole phone and then the Internet it's it's it's over two hundred bucks so they're kind of on a fixed budget and I'm just trying to see if I can help them out a little bit with that [noise] um I was looking at a major carriers a plan of one of those on the limited data [noise]\nUm [noise] my parents to watch a lot of TV uh so I'm just wondering if it's something like that would work for them as far as choosing the limited data on that kind of planned for being able to watch a streaming attorney service\nYeah and I are you there really are parents past fifty five yes so they're eligible\nFor the fifty five plus plans that both T Mobile and sprint offer bit or Seventy dollars a month total with T Mobile I think it's a little higher was sprint\nAnd it's the talk I normally go ahead\nTo the polls on it or they were looking at yeah\nYeah so with T Mobile bay we're the pioneers even before on limited data that allowed unlimited streaming and so yeah the thing with the streaming though is if they're going to project from their phone to their television\nIt ah only streams standard definition\nA late I've gotten\nReally into the high def pictures they're not going to have that unless they pay for a more premium plan with T Mobile\nGoes that if I remember right his streams that four eighty pee on this standard fifty five plus unlimited plan but Seventy a month is so cheap maybe they get used to the pictures not being as good on the TV\n[noise] yeah that's the thing they do watch uh you know my dad has limited mobility these days so he watches a lot of tea so yeah I was just wondering how that works at the end up watching a ton of myself\nI don't really so it wouldn't really be an issue but ah yeah it ... it kinda got eastern bloc type cash than I Do watch a lot of that\nYou'd have to have them on a higher price plan with T Mobile album streaming in high death and I and I think it's twenty

not going to I'm not going to follow what do you any more\nSo with T Mobile it'll be confusing at first but then it will become more clear what they offer with each of their unlimited bundles and
