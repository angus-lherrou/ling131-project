something like that\nAnd he's correct the real reason to hate Trump is headlined the real reason they hate Trump he is the average American in exaggerated form blunt simple willing to fight mistrust full of intellectuals and that begins the story he says\nIn short speaking of President Trump he's a typical American except exaggerated\nBecause he has no constraints to cramp is style except the

part can do spirit seeing New York\nSo alive and so dynamic is it is all over the city in fact if you go to the what they refer to as the outer boroughs\nThe vitality of Brooklyn now the Seventeen years ago Brooklyn was still a backwater\nAnd it's still alive and then there's this area\nCalled Long Island city in Queens which was a industrial kinds of slum area and now they're all these gleaming towers they're probably thirty high rises there and that area's become my hip kind of area\nAnd you see\nIs so fantastic about our nation and that is the spirit we have in a time as we approach the terms that we in one respect\nHave lost our way and something that it's so frustrating for me and that's a bit those among us that are part isn't that are political\nLook at those they disagree with is their enemies ... uh dehumanize them and act like\nThere are lower form of life for the people of either perspective look at the other left or right look at the other\nIs if they're not good Americans I mean this is nuts\nBecause we are all privileged as Americans to live in a land where we are able to disagree and we need to remember the thing that Ronald Reagan and Tip O'Neill one Republican one Democrat\nSo eloquently stated so many different ways so many different times the concept of disagreeing without being disagreeable I saw\nWith my own eyes in a visit I did to the Pentagon or a few years ago to give a speech and he may not know this but I worked in the Pentagon has a civilian employee at the end of the Vietnam War\nAnd then I was back to speak at an event at the Pentagon and\nIn between of course in all those years where was the attack on the Pentagon is well on September eleventh and I saw there that the people more than their losses rebuilt\nAnd the Pentagon is there as it was before to provide for our nation's defense and security I mean what what I Want you to really reflect on\nIs what a great country we have the privilege of being part of and how we as Americans\nAnd as a people showed that we would not be defeated by those who wish to rain evil upon us and death and destruction upon us we lost\nThousands of our fellow Americans that day\nWhat we found afterwards was our strength as a nation\nAnd our ability to move forward and succeed in spite of others who wanted to bring us nothing but failure\nWe showed and a time of adversity what we were made of and that makes me so proud to be an American\nMartin is with us on the Clark Howard show oh Martin\nTwelve o'clock now are you today\nGreat thank you Martin if you've been to New

that but I didn't care all night where there's lots of other places I'd like to go here in Florida so I wanted to see him of always wanted to see them but I don't care when I go but I Want to go at least expensive time\nAnd I was searching the Internet age is difficult to find a care when you go how do you find when is the cheapest on together\nSo you've got different tracks here or so in the case of hotels depending on the city you can figure out that pattern really easily it's like I had this question from someone who wanted to go to Las Vegas with his girlfriend and I was talking through\nHow you can go to these price calendars for the big casino hotels and you can see the week by week month by month when they're at their cheapest right and you can do that same kind of thing\nWith um any city in America not as easily as you can do it in Vegas hotel [laughter] but you can you can go to let's say you go to a trip advisor\nAnd you put in a city you're interested in going to\nAnd you put in um whatever level of hotel you're interested in three four or five star or whatever it is ... this year level you put on you put it and and then\nYou can put in the dates and put in try different dates over the course of many minds and you'll see the prices move up and down like crazy\nOh I Know over many months but I don't it's I don't care who had over the next two or

a shame have more in my article is\nNice places to visit and I don't care when I just you know over the next six months you know she got the location down that you choose Quinn which I Would think most people get to choose when they go well if they don't care whether they go let's go with the least expensive time and\nNo Clark some others do have time to do certain week by week trip or something so much trying days just cheaper health actually [laughter] you know if you don't care it went over the next year let's say you're right and that's another thing European overseas travel\nIt'd be nice there 'cause you you know of course no one the one the off season is in all these places well I have I mean I'm here in Pensacola I Know one of the off season is here but I Can't tell you ... years ago I didn't even know what else he is also the rest of the state of Florida in a different than a year [laughter]\nWhat what you could do is Whitey strategy that might work if you sign up for the hotels specials at a there aren't that many big hotel chains anymore if you did it and Mary odds website helping this website and high arrives site yes I've seen\nThat and they send you those that would be a way that would be and the work who prices are really low right now to blah blah blah [noise] on the air fare yeah inch and patterns so the cheapest time to travel\nTo Europe is November to march except during Christmas\nRight as far as the cheapest time to travel anywhere in the United states it is the first two weeks of December\nRight after the Thanksgiving holiday closes out except for New York city everywhere else on the area because of the cheapest two weeks of the year so I was\nTraveling to allow silicon driving you know a couple of states away to a town a lawyer you know just for a few days ... is frustrating to find the cheapest time together\nAnd and there is nobody doing that yet maybe someone listening I'll think think ooh that's a new bargain thing to do is have the technology where you could shop hotels to find the cheapest season nobody's done anything like that for hotels like is done with the airlines\nAnd maybe there's a business there for someone maybe it's a business for you Martin and that spare time\nYou come up with the software code that would allow people to search the cycles for the cheapest time to stay in places
