my call absolutely Jim how can I serve you well\nIt was high and low a few years from a retirement for non charity or a non profit and um [noise] I have a full throated me and a traditional LA\nAnd a couple of other sources of income that will lead level and I'm retired but I keep getting emails from an organization that uh\nIs pushing something called an Internet banking concept and I can't find out anything about it except for looks like it's tied to a [noise] a David and paying whole life insurance\nYup yup got it and they'll\nPut a lot of that sort of you know that for insurance and I just didn't know it was a viable thing for retirement income\nYou know I don't like this at all and it's something that has been patched so many different ways in recent years I've had a lot of calls recently that people have referred to it as a seven oh two Jay ... and things like that where\nWhere the people pitching this stuff make it sound like it's magical that it's like a loophole in the tax code or whatever and life insurance\nDoes have a in certain circumstances some tax advantage to it but the problem with using the whole life insurance\nIs a vehicle to find some amount of retirement is that the expenses and commission so involved with the whole life insurance policy are so gigantic\nThen the fish and sea of your money is not very good there's such a focus on if you do this you're going to avoid tax\nBut that's the whole big pitch but one\nThing you mentioned you said you're doing a regular IRA do you know what so superior\nTo this strategy that it's being pitched around the whole life insurance and on any time somebody calls me and asked me about using whole life insurance as a way to pay for retirement and I'll ask for you fully finding a Roth IRA\nRoth IRA feeds any life insurance policy three hundred and sixty five days this year because there's only three sixty five is not only pure\nPure and beat at three hundred and sixty six days so you're doing you're doing good strategies the only modification I Would make\nHis instead of contributing to a regular IRA anymore I always instead contribute to a Roth IRA\nPull out or if if I only have like two years or so to retirement is going to pay off [noise]\nWell I don't know how much money you would put into a whole life insurance policy and say\nWell I'm not going to do that at all\nOkay but if you worry if you were considering and\nAnd you were thinking of doing that whatever money you would have potentially put into that put that instead of into a raw human put aside up to your past age fifty so you put in up to sixty five hundred dollars max but you know whatever you can afford\nInto a Roth and the fact that you're approaching retirement\nDoesn't take away from the advantage of a raw because where a Roth is so great is its flexibility you put money in it you retire you're not working anymore but the money in their can continue to grow tax free\nFor years and years and years to come until maybe later in retirement when you need it and then you spend it tax free\nClimb such say so that's why the Ross partly so you're a man\nThat I could put in sixty five hundred a year and the traditional what would you recommend that I'd just stop that if I can do the stuff that included in the last\n... okay\nThings because you already are doing that for three beep plan you're doing a lot of ... tacky stuff\nI Want you to have some post tax money that will not be tax later and that's why doing the Roth IRA in my mind would be preferable option to doing the traditional i._r._a. but anybody's pitches about how the magic\nOf whole life insurance is going to create this term as well for you and you're going to achieve that government because you're gonna have to buy him any tax code words

get as many questions about resumes as I used to and there's such a change in how particularly larger companies treat a resume\nCompared to how they were treated in the past also job applications bitter filed electronically how they're treated by employers or is this weird weird weird\nBigger companies that either except electronic applications written ones or resumes\nHave them scanned by software almost exclusively on at least the first round never reviewed by human\n'cause big companies that people know of an are aware Rob get zillions of applications and they don't want to spend the time or the labor working through them\nScanned for key words base generally on the skill set of their job they're hiring for\nAnd so and you can find lots of this information online about how the key word should be position\nBut you want to make sure you're using industry terminology gave it relates to the job that you're applying for if you're doing something in the IT field or attack\nWhatever I'm\nCertification initial if you have whatever skills you have whatever training you've had that kind of be prominently and clearly\nWritten on an electronic application a written one or a resume to be picked up by the scan to get through the first cut\nBut here's a dirty little secret you need to know particularly with larger employers\nFixes in most jobs are what's called why are the applicant they intend to hire for that job is already known before their job is posted you are given false hope\nIn most cases they're actually interested in you even if you make it through the electronic cuts may be a human review somebody calls you for a phone interview or cause you in for an in person interview and you think wow this is great I'm On my way to working here and all on\nTheir playing you because they're just trying to meet the requirements that HR is laid out for them at these big companies\nThat they show that they've had a diversity of applicants before they made their final hiring decision who's the person they intended to higher before the job was ever posted in any way\nThe key thing for you when you're looking for a job for a new opportunity people hire people\nForget that machines is the rare exception that somebody makes it through that climate or to get a job when it was not a situation already wired you need to be the one that jobs wired for\nAnd the most important thing when you're looking for work ignore the giant employers pay or slow growth entities many times actually reducing headcount overtime the larger company gets the less dynamic it becomes\nAnd the
