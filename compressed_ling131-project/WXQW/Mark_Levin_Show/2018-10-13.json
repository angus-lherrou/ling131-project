half hour ago it's not complicated and this is the way the shutdown drop the Mike arguments you have a\nFifteen Percent of Americans on Medicare right now is patient insolvency an eight years\nFifteen Percent ... percent of folks at work or on our contributing to Medicare insolvency in eight years what happens when you but the other eighty five percent on back to you okay so that\nIs the greatest financial fraud would ever be perpetuated on this country and it is a disingenuous dishonest argument that is perpetuated on people by virtue of the average adult being financially illiterate and now my opinion\nProven by Ventura sixty percent of adults are financially illiterate all part of the problem that we've got to overcome informational year but here's something else\nIs a fraud but it's perpetuated on people I talked about the benefit of the tax cuts and how the average person take home pay this year\nUp six point seven percent which by the way when you run into somebody ... seen any benefit from it well\nThat's just because you probably haven't done anything about it most recently we've seen in a at a report that came out showing that about thirty million Americans never made any adjustments either their employers in ... and for the tax cuts\nSo it's all going to be reconciled when they filed their taxes they wouldn't be saying that money right now if they had actually made the adjustments with their employer so that's what's going on with almost everybody so I haven't seen it all just because you haven't done anything\nNow the next part that fraud comes in with companies you hear how awful\nThe tax cuts are because evil corporations you know the the ones we worked for evil corporations they're using it to buy back all their stock and you know do what a rich corporate fat cats do to screw the little guy\nAnd all that stuff except that bad\nA fraud as well as two sons to its ally the a scene but you say you know the vast right wing media CNBC\n[noise] badly a CFO council and they get research from them constantly on what's going on with any number of different issues and so on the tax cuts CNBC what their CFO council\nHave found a few things that are interesting for example one is the the most common way to has been the biggest beneficiary of the corporate corporate ... personal the corporate tax cuts\nTo share buybacks right it was horrible shareholders of what you probably are one\nActually the employees get this according to the CFO council CNBC is now thirty five percent thirty five percent\nOf all tax cuts savings has gone to a combination of bonuses and then pull you raise is thirty five percent twenty percent has gone to Dan reduction which makes sense we've seen interest rates rise companies that have dead they should paid off that helps the company become more stable essence their debt burden with rights rising\nFifteen Percent Fifteen Percent on share buybacks ten percent upgrading software five percent upgrading to a upgrading equipment and five percent have increased the evidence so all in the combination of share buybacks in David in payouts twenty percent that's it\nAnd even then you probably benefit because once again something that is not perpetuated information only by our friends and media generally\nFifty two percent of Americans own stocks and by the way despite the volatility of the past few days way or the greatest wealth creation machine the history of the world is your United say stock market so I don't apologize for that anyway but the biggest beneficiary is you\nEmploy but [noise]\nYou know I I guess conveniently ... message has just been miss I'm sure that any day now it's going to be a big story that will be reported on\nAnd again CNBC they're the ones with that story interesting how even NBC with no other news outlets has decided to actually run with their own story from their own CFO council\nOne of these days I'm sure it's just oversight All right let's go to
