President Trump has told the Associated Press that the international condemnation of Saudi Arabia over a missing journalists as another case of guilty before being proven innocent correspondent are with daemon reports the Saudis are continuing their pro\nTurkish authorities are getting increasingly impatient now with the Saudis with regards to the investigation they still haven't heard a a proper telling as the Saudi accounts I think ... what happened we're all waiting for that Saudi at investigation to reach that conclusion and for that statement to come out\nDay I had to listen to pin heads around their\nHours he's he's out after the first is going to be impeached but who would never be reelected I mean people already\nSeen the mistake at me like you you you really just do not get it the first thing is when you're putting that in context you have to take a look at what it would take for someone who\nOh did for that President not to vote for them again\nI mean yes you can have new voters that come about over the course of four years and if all those new voters leaned heavily in one direction maybe just maybe you could move the needle and by the way I keep track of that and I'm going to give you a little piece of a story I'm actually working on for my local shows here tomorrow\nJust wrapped up the research on this little while ago chicken and on the state's voter registration and from and so they're interested to know how Florida has gone over the past couple of years since the twenty sixteen presidential election well yeah it's a four to did break for\nDonald Trump beyond that\nSince the twenty six same presidential election through today there are thirty thousand fewer Democrats registered to vote\nYeah thirty thousand fewer registered Democrats in Florida for the past two years we have fifty one thousand additional Republicans registered to vote oh by the way\nProbably not going to make the news anywhere even stateside\nAnd do we do have quite a few independent set of registered to vote over a hundred thousand there\nMy point being even to the extent that we've seen people from a point of partisanship registered to vote like they're all Democrats even though you would think that every young person you hear all the time all the young people to go to a certain amount and they're all Democrats well we heard from Joshua\nTwenty two years old Washington DC in biology last hour\nWho's a thoughtful conservative so that can happen in DC well it can happen in other places too and so don't be surprised that part of the story beyond it you've got to think about what's happening here and there is a lot a lot to feel good about\nFirst he is you take a look at the economy we have the best academy and the generation I never voted millennials are buying into the hope and change bull crap\nThey didn't know better they went through school here in front of a bunch of people who didn't get in the education establishment they get out there and do yeah this really does suck your Obama and the guy who I guess he's right until last year given an opportunity to see what the US Economy is capable of and then he got some eyes that are up\nAnd that's the God of me in the generation\nBut we have two Supreme Court justices tax reform the end of the Affordable CARE Act mandate Lewis unemployment rate in forty nine years in by the way the current unemployment for all demographics except Asian and white men yeah remember how it's all about the white males white man\nAnd Asian men they will only demos out there that are not at a record low unemployment right about oh by the way\nBut\nYou also have the biggest increase in the take home pay and thirty two years by the way I mentioned that I Believe on friday and everybody seems to notes from some angry folks on the left always happy to try to deal with him but I Want to\nLay the groundwork for that one once again because not hard to get there is a little math and it's easier than calculating the Pocahontas math if you're the Boston Globe listening\nWorks like this you take the overall salary than the average person was making last year you take a look at what it is today by the way it's pays about two point eight percent base salary a year over year okay All right then you\nTake a look at the average bonus that has been paid out so far this year when\nYou do that that gives you a little bit over three percent\nAnd then you take a look at the average net benefit of the tax cuts which happens to be for the average fulltime employed person about Eighteen hundred bucks this year you put all that together and boom you get six point seven percent\nAnd complicated two sides to stories on the backs Israel and by the way and the events that you're the angry left as that goes yeah but I see a benefit for the tax cuts well\nThat's because you know where your employer probably David about which by the white personally thirty million people who are in that situation where employers that might get adjustments you didn't make adjustments to if you're not saying that there'll be reconciled when you file your taxes and congratulations you'll have likely given the government and interest free one but\nIt's still there because of well over Ninety percent of people do benefit from the new tax law\nBut that's all the cool stuff right I mean all of that progress that I just decided\nTo ask yourself well if you voted for Donald Trump why wouldn't you vote against that and two years is or is there anything he probably has attracted more votes if he didn't nothing else no other accomplishments they always status quo from here until twenty twenty he probably gets re elected\nAnd again sixty five percent of presidents who run for re election in so that the word less successful than he is he would still likely be reelected and twenty twenty but here's the the next point and this is the under stated point\nI'm going to work on something conceptually before I give you some facts will do that and a little bit\n\nHow often or are we talking about domestic terrorism\nThing about that how often did we have radicalized domestic homegrown terrorism in the United states\nPrior to Donald Trump becoming president that was a fairly regular occurrence wasn't it now when you take a look at not having that problem\nYou take a look at not having Tea Party and and white people\nSpecifically all these are angry white men men are singled out by the Obama administration as the number one focus on the watch lists and instead you have people that do fit the profile or potential Islamic terrorism that had been number one domestically under the Trump Administration gets what\nDoesn't make the news if they stop it before it happens which happens a lot\nWhich happens a lot\nAnd the foreign policies success and I'm not just talking about North Korea\nAnd the fact that to date we've released cat to Russia at bay or that Syria as much of a mess as it is has been dealt with about as peacefully and with as little damage to the United states in our interest as we could have hoped toward the spotlight even talking about all that\nMight even targeted all the trade deals that had been worked out this far to our benefit that are often under Scott's\nI'm Talking about the eradication of ISIS but also the implications for other parts of the middle east now one of the amazing turnabout and all of this had been Saudi Arabia we actually had Saudi Arabia under the Trump Administration\nSay that they are with us with Israel a Middle Eastern country saying there with Israel against Iran that's holy\nCow material now that's where this whole situation Wednesday or you got this journalists to buy their way you know has a interesting history of his own that goes into a consulate in Turkey we have some uh folks from uh the the Saudi regime that enter\nAnd a few hours later they leave and you know probably not putting his foot beat up by eating bond bond so we we have a missing journalist okay\nThat's where this whole situation gets complicated because we've made some progress with Saudi Arabia but the problem is back to my sliding scale morality if you are\nNot there anymore all at the started your compass you can become pretty evil at the root of it and it's important to know who and what these people are that we're still dealing with and I'll bring you the rest of the story as the late great one would have said I'm going to bring it back up here on the other side I Am Brian mud and for\nThe gray one month\nHim and

president was even talking about that today he said that for the record I have no financial interest in Saudi Arabia but he also said that he spoke with the gang and he denies everything the nice sized everything so\nThis is difficult it's difficult for a lot of reasons\nWe don't know the exact quote was obviously\nAnd you had a lot of folks is that yeah you know wage shoot sanctions bring it on I mean let's just whatever with Saudi Arabia the first thing is one be thankful that we are very close very close to energy independence of his country by the way did you know that we are now\nThe world's largest producer of oil\nAnd not Saudi Arabia or Russia is\nNot a great we're actually facing the get there in January we got there a little bit earlier it's also good about now because it's

spike in prices obviously that could hurt the economy boom used you know what happens there so that's one thing we got to consider and this entire process but the mayor one again as you do have this

alien but for the last week or ten days the media is in overdrive the blame Trump\nOr Jared Kushner or some relationship there saying somehow we did it that were responsible that Trump somehow with ah with um Mohammed bin Salman so called M B. S. that MBBS is somehow\nConsulting with Trump to decide what to do at a time which is a bunch of crap nobody's in favor of this we have a western mind a Judeo Christian ethic we believe in due process at least Republicans do so we\nIn fairness and and so whatever happened to a Saudi Arabian\nButter Saudi Arabian government\nIn a Saudi Arabian consulate in Turkey is interesting but hell we got ten thousand murders in this country every year not being investigated by CNN or obsessing by the New York times in the Washington Post where he worked as a contributor can we let it go a little bit and see what happened and when it comes out\nThat the M. B. S. directly or indirectly heck his show the murdered in a horrible way because he was a dissident and it's a ... billion offer regime and Saudi Arabia that's what's going to come out\nAgainst Trump's responsible for that to it never stops it never ends I Can't take it anymore it's awful and so can we move on from that the answer of course is no this is the ah\nThe event does your the event this week and next week they keep coming up whether it's Kavanaugh or Julie sweating ache or Deborah Ramirez or a bunch of other incidents that have arisen in the past several months the Trump Trump Trump Trump Trump Trump how can we use this event\nHow can we take Christine afford how can we use this event that didn't involve Trump at all and some how large this upon him\nAnd stain or smear him with some news event that Trump it nothing to do with doing nothing zero sales nada didn't happen as possible\nBut it goes on and on I I tried to watch for hours\nWolf Blitzer and others on CNN it's impossible to watch ... MPs his own speed dial with Kushner and Trump taking orders assuming he did it what does that mean what might be behind it is is\nThere are many in this country in the media who thinks the Iranian deal was wonderful for our country\nAnd that ... Hussein Obama delivered one point eight billion dollars in cash on governmental palace can be used for terrorism by Iran man that was a great idea we ought to do more of that and so because Saudi Arabia is a pitch the enemy of Iran\nMaybe those in the media wants to get back to the Iranian deal and weak in Saudi Arabia in the middle east\nSo that Iran takes over larger chunks of the middle east Iraq and Syria not paying enough maybe that's what's behind it plus as you may know if you've been paying attention Israel and Saudi Arabia have become brothers they become sisters they become friendly with each other because their enemy is Iran there\nFor the enemy of my enemy is my friend so because Israel and Iran are enemies and because Saudi Arabia and Iran are enemies now Israel and Saudi Arabia are working together and lots of areas so there may be parts of America that wants to get rid of that uh that budding friendship between Israel and Saudi Arabia\nBy weakening the Saudis\nBut whatever it is we don't have a dog in this fight you may want to strengthen Iran and the media does or weaken Israel which the media does\nBut by doing that were hurting our country after nine eleven which I think Fifteen of the Nineteen hijackers came from Saudi Arabia we will get a little sideways with Saudi Arabia for a while but now we're back together and they're spending\nI think the president said the other day something in the range of a hundred and ten billion with a total cost of five hundred billion dollars\nA of taking our military hardware to upgrade their military to fight Iran who's our enemy they'd been our enemy since ... since we help get rid of the shah of Iran look what happened there\nAnd so whatever happen happen\nIt occurred let the Saudi Arabians deal with it if the government ordered the killing of someone which by the way America itself has done on a regular basis countries to these kinds of things if Saudi Arabian government decided to murder Jamal could show gay and stupidly they decided to pick\nA consulate in Turkey to do to dash to lead and if that's a violation of some criminal law somewhere to the Turks are their sides you know what I say have at it\nBut according to diplomatic law the consulate Israeli Saudi Arabian territory and so what happened there stays in Saudi Arabia so whatever happens happens hit is what it is can we move on\nAbsolutely not you see the mid term so now only about what twenty days away twenty days from now the ...\nAnd so things are heading toward\nThe Republican way in many states especially in Arizona Nevada\nAnd a Montana president it's going to make a greater parents there in North Dakota Heitkamp that lousy thing was the disclosing the names of sexual assault victims\nSo the red wave appears to be building and the Senate and that was the big news story so the last several days the news media said wait a minute this thing is heading toward the Republican sale Trump\nWe can't have that so they started this other thing about ...\nWho was killed\nIn Turkey and he's a Saudi now as we speak the last several days there have been hundreds of Americans who have been killed a few dozen ... illegal aliens there was a horde of some two or three thousand Central Americans making their way up to America paying their passage them as Thirteen\nWith are girls being raped and men being killed it's happening right now\nAnd so there's other news stories going on in the world and because it was kind of going toward Trump's direction\nAnd his Rasmussen approval rating was up to fifty one percent the media might have said you know what\nThis is going the wrong direction\nIf we can go after some out the sides and you and in their place putting Jared Kushner and Trump somehow responsible for the murder of cars shaggy maybe that'll be a good thing maybe we can stop them building red wave in the Senate what's going to happen in the house I have no idea so so let's continue

of the great American in for the great when mark Levin way of teeth and Chris and Josh and many others to lines\nAre open gym you know the number if you'd desire to join his eight seven seven three one two three one one last night before I go to you I keep babbling but that's a good look at it this way Tony days from now\nAnd uh I met with the president or two or three days ago we are going to share with you some of his thoughts later on\nThat ah it appears to me that the number one issue right now is the court system is I just told you Seventy percent of the judges are appointed by Democrats great majority of the cases Ninety nine point nine percent never get the Supreme Court\nAnd so if and twenty days the Senate flips to the Democratic party Chuck Schumer will hold back and not confirming any\nAny of the White House's judicial nominees through twenty twenty which really is January twenty Twenty one\nAnd then at that point and Trump has reelected which most of us believe he will do this and the state's democratic is not going to be twenty Twenty one it'll be twenty twenty three he will not stop\nThey will not nominate nominate but when I come from one judge so what's on the ballot and twenty days is the court system and whether the destruction of our constitutional several more rights than traditional values will continue on or else we can make the turn some out back to the middle\nSecondly all the investigations that the house of becomes democratic which is appears to be very likely\nThe investigations of every aspect of Trump's life his wife's life Jared Kushner's live everyone's life for the White House will be laid bare and the next two years or not be about legislation but rather investigation so if you want the mob rule that you've seen the past several months where Republicans are shot\nRun off the street cars blown up and beaten than incentivize the mob by giving the mob power by putting their house back in charge of Nancy Pelosi and watch what happens it's going to be unbridled is going to be unbelievable another aspect of course his foreign policy right now\nDespite the efforts of CNN and others to destroy our relationship with Assad's things are pretty good North Korea's not shooting missiles anywhere right now Iran and Iraq\nHer somewhat quiet right now Syria is heading toward a conclusion horrible war incentivized by the Russians by the Iranians and vibrant Hussein Obama who allowed the Russians and the Iranians to come into Syria foreign policy wise things are pretty good that's on the ballot the economy\nAccording to some national international expertise the American economy right now is the greatest ever been in American history how were the stock market react and man see below sea begins investigations from every aspect of the executive branch of government it won't be good\nPlus she got the impeachment issue is there any down your mind that the Democrats who wants to eliminate Trump from office\nSo if you went to the next two years not to be about judges\nNot to be about er and only about investigations and impeachments hurt the economy then that's what's on the ballot\nSo when Trump comes to one of these states and he came to Cincinnati a few days ago I spent some time with them on and play some of his thoughts later on\nIf that happens do they're just don't talk which is all we do go they're physically in confront and say yes I Am here as his testimony to what this country can be and should be do I like all the tweets do I like the horse had comment about the strip or no\nBut the policies and procedures what's happening with the court system what's happening with the economy what's happening with Foreign Relations you know is damn good it's really good\nAnd so I think about what's on the ballot and twenty days because the Democrats are has incentivized says they've ever been and it's going to get more ridiculous they're going to be more incentivized interview incentivize the mob by buying them off or paying them off is going to be nothing but difficulties so let's go to your calls now\nWe have a case in Los Angeles and Chris in Atlanta one becomes available you know the
