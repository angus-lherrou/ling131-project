Missouri [noise] and uh he got an excellent Republican candidate Josh Hawley versus Claire McCaskill Josh Hawley how are you sir\nI'm doing great thanks so much for having me\nWell it's my pleasure every election cycle Claire McCaskill tries to remake herself into some kind of a moderate\nI just solar interviewed on Fox where she says hey look I with Trump half the time and I love post Kavanaugh because of his views on foreign money in campaigns and now are the people in misery going to buy this trick one more time\nYou know they're not you know Senator McCaskill is trailing in the polls is she the little desperate to be honest with you\nMark and as you should be because listen I mean she is out of step with the voters of the state it's just that simple I mean they told her that they wanted her to get with the program they voted for two thousand sixteen by twenty points by the way President Trump wanting to stay by twenty\nAnd Senator McCaskill turned her out to vote no on Neil Gorsuch to the Supreme Court no justice Kavanaugh no on the tax cuts no on border security no on rebuilding the military I mean it's just as she could not be more out of step\nWhat does she running a New Yorker Missouri\nExactly well most of her money comes from New York and California that she'd be a great Center for one of those places but for this state hardly and that is ... that's our big problem about why she's down in the poll or she is just out of touch with the people of our good state\nI mean she really is a left us to be perfectly honest with you and her votes really are not much different from a Bernie Sanders or a Chuck Schumer and of course she will vote to make Chuck Schumer the leader of her up of the uh the Democrats in the Senate and she does that every time right\nAbsolutely she votes with him about Ninety percent of the time she has accepted twenty six million dollars and expenditures from Chuck Schumer he has spent more money in Missouri than anywhere else in the country trying to prop up a center McCaskill ended up by her seat\nAnd you know that's the kind of thing that Missouri's just don't take too well I mean they they don't want anybody coming in and tell them how to vote and they have Chuck Schumer come into our state and try to buy the seat but just as lying\n[noise] the the top three issues in Missouri or as far as you see them what are they in what are your positions on them\nI Would start with pro constitution judges and what happened to justice Cavanaugh is a big big issue in this race really exposed I think the left thirst for power the radical nature of their agenda and the fact that they have not accept\nIt and are not willing to accept the results of the two thousand sixteen election and the rule of we the people you know they want to do everything they can to try to get their hands on power to undo what we the people have said\nAnd that is a huge issue in this race and immigration is a huge issue in this race border security especially with this caravan as it continues to master the move towards the border Claire McCaskill is sponsoring\nAnd open borders bill in Congress the most radical open borders bill ever introduced and a bad is a huge huge issue and then I think a a economic growth wage growth Senator McCaskill voted against the middle class tax cuts she's voted over two hundred times to raise taxes\nIn Congress and the people want somebody's going to go be a fighter for the middle class and workers and not just another big government liberal\nBut you know these big government liberals think they found an issue you know that's pre existing conditions on the health care and they keep running around the country and every state by the way including your state was McCaskill saying\nYou will oppose us a methods of protecting people who have pre existing conditions is that your position and she just trying to make that your position\nOh she's just trying to make that my ... that's a total and ridiculous fall so she knows it and I've called her out on many times an hour debates I support of forcing insurance companies to cover folks with preexisting conditions on the same terms of everybody else here's the difference mark I don't think we need Obamacare to do it and I think that we should stop holding hostage\nPatients who have pre existing conditions and everybody else too by the way holding them all hostage to Obamacare in my state\nIncluding health care prices have increased a hundred and forty five percent on those health care exchanges that is the national average things a hundred and two percent which is terrible but in Missouri it's a hundred and forty five percent families just can't afford their insurance that's\nBecause of Obamacare it's because of Claire McCaskill she won't support any plan but is it Obamacare because she's a she's a big government liberal\n[laughter] no she going on about Medicare for all or is she duct that one\nWell see if she tries to duck as he says he's open to it you know she's hoping to of course we all know that that where this is headed and we all know that that this she'll never vote against her party I mean she never does on edge any major issue an issue of consequence and\nYou know my worry is look they cut seven hundred and sixteen billion dollars out of Medicare in order to pay for Obamacare\nImagined what they'll do to pay for their government run health care scheme so you know it it is just a ... it will devastate a folks who are who have paid into the system it will devastate families who are just barely making it now and and trying to get\nA hold of private insurance and uh this is part of the radical Democrat agenda Claire McCaskill's on board with\nAnd investigators said it's unclear if the gunman intended to Rob the store or a plan to target an employee who worked there police of the father wouldn't face charges since the shooting appeared to be in self defense you think would Donald's employee Marcus, Washington told WBRC that he and another worker here in a freezer when the shooting started\nThey recounted hearing more than a dozen gunshots during the exchange Washington said he was busy making quarter pounders when he heard the first shots than another worker sought refuge in the freezer and figured the gunman was looking for the Washington set of the man he's my hero because I can only imagine\nHow it would have gone if he was an armed or we might not be having this interview right now thinking about that for a second so here again the protocol for an active shooter this McDonalds is to hide in the freezer and wait for the government to find you and kill you\nOr fortunately there was a customer who was packing heat and he killed the gun now why wouldn't this be all over national news or you can imagine why wouldn't be\nBecause we had a guy lawfully carrying a firearm who actually stop somebody who may have killed who knows how many people we don't know whether he was there to Rob or whether he was there to kill all the employees but he didn't do either because an armed citizen took him out before it even started\nAnd exchange of gunfire imagine what might have happened had he not been there see these are the scenarios that you talk about\nIn an active shooter thing\nHiding in a in a freezer is not active shooter protocol\nIt's not going to keep you alive the freezer obviously is not locked and it's not a lot so you don't lock yourself in a freezer so this guy just goes around going from room to room closet closet freezer the freezer find some folks in the freezer boom shoot some limited so what is your protocol\nI don't think the synagogue in Pittsburgh I had one and that's the that's the lesson to learn from this we can say oh and here's what they're saying to we all need to come together to stop this well the only way we're going to come together to stop this is to kill the guy before he kills too many people\nAnd if you're not on board with that then I don't know what else I can do\nMe sitting here in Nashville, Tennessee I Can't do anything it's not anything that I did that caused it but the insinuation is well we need to tamp down the rhetoric the rhetoric had nothing to do with it folks this guy was a nut case who hated Jews any of that enough as a matter of fact\nIf you want to say what put him over the edge it's the fact that Donald Trump hadn't Jews in his administration so we're going to do something about this maybe maybe Trump should fire all the Jews fires daughter fire his\nSon in law fire all the Jews in the White House is that what you want of course that's not what you want\nBecause then you acquiesce to the crazy nut out there who want you to do what he wants you to do so it's not our problem it's a problem with people that don't protect themselves QuickTime out one eight hundred six one ape so we're back into [noise]\n\n\n\nCredit card debt ruining your life now you can have a

believes that he can issue an executive order and stop it\nTall rhino in Congress says this is a nonstarter he get he doesn't have the authority to do this or this is something in the constitution and there's nothing you can do about it\nAnd so this fight has been going back and forth for for many years and it's in the constitution so if if it is a constitutional issue they only remedy that he would be to amend the constitution and that's a long drawn out process and I don't have a problem with that I Would I think it means to be remedied\nBut here's the deal\nI already have a solution to this and if the president wants to listen I'll be led to tell them and I was telling Jerry brought this to some of you folks who have been with me a long time that I've heard me say this here's the way you deal with the anchor babies let's just say okay\nConstitutionally your child is a citizen of the United states congratulations new just gave birth to a U.S citizen\nNow what you're going to do because you're getting ready to be deported\nBecause you're not a citizen you just because you had a child here doesn't mean you get to stay your child can stay or your child can go with you you choose the option if you want to take the child with you fine you take the child you leave the country if you don't want to take the child when you will be glad to put it up for adoption\nAnd people said well that's cruel that cruel they came here to circumvent our laws they broke into the United states and they had a child here have we're going to say their child's a citizen fine but you are not so you're going home\nAnd if you want to take the child with which we would prefer you do then do but if you don't then we're going to put the child up for adoption so none no more of this business of thing you can come across the border and have a child and then you get to stay with a child you're not a citizen you broke and you're a criminal you're going home\nAnd that ends the whole\nAnchor baby problem but that's cruel it's not cruel because they're going to take the baby with them well what do they don't then it's on them but I mean what if they don't\nIf they have the baby here and there are citizens of Mexico Mexico already recognizes their child as a citizen to Mexico as most countries do\nMatter of fact if my wife were pregnant which she has been by the way [noise] speaking of

you'd think when their kids are born in a hospital in Beirut or somewhere that the child's going to be a citizen of Lebanon I don't think so\nThey're going to be a citizen of the United states\nSo that solves the problem\nThese people come over to have anchor babies and the anchor baby means the layer anchored into the United states those babies are automatically citizens of Mexico because Mexico recognize that just like every other country does if both parents are citizens of your country in this case Mexico or Guatemala or pick your country\nThen their citizenship maybe as a citizen in that country to we just have this strange thing and we're only one or two countries in the developing world that do this where we allow you to come here and have a child and you're not a citizen but you get to stay with a\nChild and we called the child is citizen most other countries would never call that child a citizen\nSo problem\nSolved as far as I'm concerned you don't need an executive order you don't even need a constitutional amendment when you tell the parents that when you come over here and have a child the child gets to say but you don't they'll stop coming and that's not that were ripping babies from others that can take the child home and the child becomes a citizen to Mexico when they come home\nMatter of fact the child is a citizen Mexico from the second he was born\nI just don't you know I [laughter] and now people are going why is Trump doing this now\nI asked the very same question today is it to stoke up the base perhaps but will it anger or the other side of the point where they get out and\nVote on November sick I don't know I don't know the issues even going to matter to a lot of folks\nBut I Will tell you this is an easily remedy the problem without having to do an executive order or go through the constitutional amendment process all we got to do is kicked the parents out and they stopped coming into discussion by the way it juicy rats mice and do we have this song I\nWant to make sure we get all this on a show for it because I tell you that everything we talk with his own show prep\nA we have now a new high in there and then we have a new
