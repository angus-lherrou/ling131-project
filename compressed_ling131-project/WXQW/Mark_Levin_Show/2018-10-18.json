Korea [noise]\nMillions of jobs have been credit and you were told a year or two ago by Gary Cohn and others that you know the candidates that was probably not going to happen Mexico's too tough NAFTA is ingrained what did you do that costs Canada may not be real happy right now in Mexico may not be real happy and then South Korea\nTo kind of play because we're the big dog in the kennel but they don't treat it that way what did you do with the trade\nDeal and we're also the piggy banks that everybody wants to come in and Rob\nAnd uh Mexico we made a deal and we tell them look otherwise we're going to have to just actually car industry which would have been bad for them and frankly I wouldn't have wanted to do it but we were going to do it and\nWe made a deal with Mexico we could not make a deal with Canada that just wouldn't make a deal that was fair for us because NAFTA was a total and complete disaster you know that better than all of that you saw what happened over here with you still have building's empty with just everybody moved out [noise]\nI don't know what they were taken so that's why I refused to call it NAFTA I said the deal with making I refused so we call it the U.S embassy a and its works good but we made a great deal is with everybody what happened then is candidate came along in the end\nWe were unable to make it I said we're going to tax you cars coming in and then what happened and they made a deal they made a deal they made a deal and it's a deal that we're very happy with the help they are very happy with I Hope everybody is but it's a fair deal for us and\nWe have now or just to deal with South Korea which is fabulous much much improved approved deal you know improved I Will say that Hillary Clinton to remember she made that deal and she said it's two hundred and fifty thousand jobs and she was right for South Korea so they got two hundred and fifty we didn't get two hundred and fifty [noise]\nIt was a terrible deals so essentially we terminated that deal and we made a new deal with South Korea\nSo we're president jobs and talking to my Everytime I cannot Mexico we're talking about a million\nWhat you're talking about millions of jobs ... don't forget we've opened up countries that were just totally close to a night\nLook at Canada we couldn't sell our dairy products out there and if we did it was a three hundred percent of people don't talk about that you know if I put on a ten percent or twenty percent Arab they make a big deal of if they have three hundred\nActually three hundred percent two hundred and Seventy five percent two hundred and eighty five percent these are the terrorists they charge so essentially that's a wall because if you have to pay a tariff like that you can't sell the product is so expensive so we've opened up Canada\nWe have a very good relationship now I think they respect us more than they did before\nBut now at least is fair and are farmers are in love with it you see what's going on it's beautiful now we're working on China and we're working on the European Union which of absolutely taken advantage of our country and the European Union has been brutal and the way they took advantage of the United states for many years\nI mean they were formed just to take advantage of the United states that was a reason they were formed how can we\nHow can we take from the United states so the European Union they formed and they have their very unfair to us they have barriers where we can sell into their and dip into their countries\nThey have tremendous tariffs that make it impossible\nAnd yet they still Mercedes Benz and BMWs by the millions they come in their hands and we charge him essentially no tax just sort of ... percent but for the most part they don't even not elected\nSo we charge them virtually nothing and they send millions and millions of cars if we want to send a a piece of grain [laughter] okay we want to send a piece of grain we can't do it in to the European Union so it's unfair uh we met with them I told them I'm going to start\nTaxing because because Obama they wouldn't even talk to them right they said we're very happy the way we are and that's that was that Obama just went away and then a with us I said look we want to talk I didn't hear from them I said we want to talk I didn't hear third time I said listen we're called me back but\nAre going to give you one more chance than it has said that's okay I'm going to actually cars at twenty five percent coming in which is frankly more money right and it's devastating to them but it's more money and they immediately have a plan and came over and talk and now they want to make a deal I I don't know that we're going to make a deal with him I can tell you they want to sure but we're going to make it one way or the\nWay of under ... year five trillion or pretend we felt Shanghai we built Beijing at some point we got to start building America that got the new airports we

watching some documentary oh I Know it was there was a Monday I tie ins and America American attack it was very eye opening I didn't know a lot of this stuff because\nThe times that came over at the beginning of the twentieth century a lot of them were coming from Sicily and southern Italy where it's primarily poor\nAnd I really never thought about it I mean they weren't coming from Rome in Florence and you know Venice and places like mad and they were coming from those southern areas\nBecause their life bank there weren't many opportunities and so they came to America and the irony I found about this was that they came to places like New York\nAnd then they got into like factories in situations like this and they they started raising ... that's when they you know that's when the economy's came along started organizing everybody\nAnd they were interviewing somebody and they said well you know they didn't have any choice I mean they had to go to work in these factories and the conditions were horrible and I'm thinking you just got on a ship and\nCame three thousand miles across the Atlantic ocean to get away from your conditions in Italy and you won't go thirty miles up the road to find a\nBetter gang the hell's wrong with you I mean I'm thinking oh but you you saw your for all these you know I'm thinking the conditions are deplorable to\nThe way you change that is the saying nobody at work here we got him we got to improve our conditions when enough people say I am doing that job is too dangerous I'm going to uh work somebody you don't have to stay in New York\nI mean you got on a ship and came from Italy to America you're not glued to the Bronx\nFor crying out loud and there's a whole big country out there and get on a train and go I don't know an hour\nWest and find a better life are there better jobs where they're not making you work in a sweatshop\nIt always just puzzled me then we have these people that had so much courage\nAnd so much drive that they're going to escape the horrid conditions of their native land and then they get over here and they won't go an hour to find a better job it's like all of a sudden we're stuck we can't do anything else do you mean you can't do anything else\nI thought\nFive hundred miles to find a better gig when I couldn't find a suitable job in Greensboro North Carolina it's just what you do but we've gotten a now in our minds that oh no no no we got we got to make the man pay and now my gosh we don't have air conditioning and UPS trucks\nThis is this is this was like oh my gosh what it's like we were

plans to sell the FBI Headquarters in Washington than previously thought\nHow Democrats say they have new documents that suggested more expensive plan to rebuild the FBI Headquarters in Washington DC rather than relocate to the suburbs was approved during an Oval Office meeting in January with the president\n\nNow all of this I say to go back to a core point here I don't hate people that come to this country legally I've said this coming in from art before a mini that know me I I play tennis in college I was ... almost every one of my roommates in college was someone from a foreign country\n\nMy best friend is from another nation [noise] one of my other best friend just from a another nation they both came to this country the student with a student visa legally they didn't break\nIn and they didn't come in a caravan they didn't chant they didn't you know and\nThey love America and the both of them are still here and both of them who of this country\nIn respect our laws that make sure that all their visas and everything are in order they did it the right way I have no problem with anybody from any part of the world coming into America as long as you're doing the appropriate and the right way and you wait in line and you do it the way it's supposed to be done I have a big problem with people that just say I'm going to break into your house because I Want your TV I'm not going to go buy my own\nThe president's tweet today was what a strong advocate for a civilized nation says\nYou know you look at what the media has done the last twenty four hours Donald Trump is standing with an evil nation in Saudi Arabia\nAgain he hasn't stood with them he said we're investigating we're taking time he said the day before he got on to that helicopter go into a campaign rally it ... it seems that he was killed and if that's what the facts they're out\nThere will be a very strong response from this country to Saudi Arabia more than words remember don't trust somebody some actions not words when it comes to stuff\nAnd of course they say where's the outrage from Donald Trump it's one of the most irritating things about all of this story with with with Saudi Arabia and I'm using as a compare and contrast to what we're talking about with the with\nHow the media is treating him with his caravan of of of illegal immigrants coming to America\nYou have a president that they say must be outrage and there's an outrage enough done this one story but then they say this president being outraged over the immigrants coming here legally shows that he's ... he's a terrible person a she calmed down and she'll be loving\nWhich one is it to the media which one is do you want a president that defends his country and fight for the country's interests like he's doing with these illegal immigrants care of anything to the United states and then when he does that you criticize them for doing it saying he's on hands these crazy and he's mean and even when he was so many of these poor little people meanwhile he says about Saudi Arabia which again\nI hate this journalist was murdered\nI also hate that the media acts\nLike journalists are somehow more important than average people I'm In the media I don't think my life has any more important than anybody else listening I don't think my life has any more unique than any other person's listening I don't think that my job is he makes me any more significant in society\nOr should make me any more significant in society compared to someone else is just doing it normal hard day's work in something else that maybe doesn't get you quote famer or notoriety or whatever you want to call it the media is so self righteous that if one of their own gets tack they all come into ... and they all freaked out and they all go into overdrive over\nIt\nAnd and the fake outrageous have you not been paying attention to the human rights abuses with Saudi Arabia or do you not and realize that they\nHave killed women because the women were raped they may give lashing to women who were raped because they were sexually and pure do they just allow women to drive and the only reason when they allowed women to drive in Saudi Arabia is because they were taking so much heat for human rights abuses against women they're like All right screw let's give them a license that will shut up the world\nEvery president in my entire lifetime has had a relationship with Saudi Arabia I didn't ... and Saudi Arabia has been brutal you still in Saudi Arabia they ... they were literally take\nOff a limb\nThey will cut off fingers they will cut off risk they will cut off farms it will cut off legs they will\nCut our feet as part of punishment they will give lashing\nTo old people and young people in the hundreds and hundreds of lashing ths they will throw people in prison who are dissidents or do criticize the government they been doing that for as long as I've been on this earth\nAnd I didn't see any of this fake outrage from the media when Bill Clinton was having relations with Saudi Arabia and I'm not talking about sexually I Know we have to clarify what Bill Clinton\n\nNo one was freaking out when Obama had relations with Saudi Arabia\nThey weren't riding these articles they weren't they weren't demanding more out of ... Brock Obama with human rights\nMy point is the only reason why this one has gotten headlines and has taken on his own because it was a member of the media and it's terrific what happened to him but his ... ... ... ... media who's acting like this is something we must\nWere I mean the media saying we we demand sanctions basically because of what Saudi Arabia did to this guy that's been happening to other people in Saudi Arabia for as long as they've been alive who are writing these articles it's fake outrage\nI don't\nHow Saudi Arabia does things I also know why we are an ally with them because they're extremely tough on terrorism and that part of the world and they do things that we don't do\nWe also need a place that we can land we also need a place that we can fire we also have it for oil interests whether you like it or not Democrats or Republicans have agreed that relationship with Saudi Arabia is incredibly important\n\nThey agree that it's important they all said it's important Obama agrees with Trump and Trump agrees Obama and Obama agrees with Bush in both strays with Clinton Clinton agrees with the other Bush and the other votes agrees that Reagan Reagan agrees with\nJimmy Carter we've always had these relations with them\nAnd so now because they do something they've been doing my entire life and it was ... towards a member of the media now we're supposed to put in sanctions and change American foreign policy\nWhen we've known that this is the only been dealing with all along\n\nSo I gave you that compare and contrast to now how Donald Trump Seville and because he threatened to send US military to protect America's border and they say this is too strong it's there's two main meanwhile they're saying we want you to be mean oil is trying with Saudi Arabia because wait a minute because one of our hours ... was murdered which one is\n\nHow is it the same demeanor from the same guy can be one eighty from one another all based on your perspective although I'm a journalist and I'm going to be bigger and better than you are and most journalists believe that they are better that their life is more important than your life\nMost journalists are self important I Can't use the word I Want to use or\nI Would argue that most journalists in this country especially those that you know they they throw the word journalism around like they're better for example didn't even talk shows were commentators well I'm a I'm not as commentator I'm a journalist I mean get over yourself\nI hated this happened I hate to this journalist was killed\nBut make no mistake about it if you're writing articles freaking out over the commanding sanctions you as a journalist have not been doing your job as a journalist paying attention to what has been going on in Saudi Arabia your entire life\nSo spare me the fake outrage\nAnd I think the president it's America threatening to send the military to walk to the migrant caravan are legal immigrants heading towards America is what the president should do\nRegardless of party you don't welcome operate because you don't you don't I mean what what what is the media want Donald Trump to do what does it and I know what the left one Sunday but I'm saying this directly the media do they want that will turn to go down the border and and and making a great sense\nWith big doors opening those doors in hand these people blankets in waters and say please come into America\nAnd break our laws and be a drag on our society and don't go through the proper steps\nAnd have no respect for this country and let me give
