Queens\n[noise]\nYou know I have this tendency to kind of want to understand how liberal see the world I mean again I was never a liberal I'm up I was an independent most of my life but what really opened me up to conservatism was that this saying a moment\n\nAnd then they said I was a moment for me it was when I was a police officer in New York City\nAnd I saw how again I'm not suggesting every single time a cop access to you know there are a listener unfortunately are bad cop cigarettes I'm telling you the overwhelming majority overwhelming I worked with were great guys and women who really just gave a damn they weren't there to get rich trust me there ain't no money in policing and he is a word in that case\nBut when I was a cop and I was an independent you know again sometimes sometimes even kind of see it the liberal way from being surrounded all the time by Democrats\n\nI remember how some cops in use of force incidents who I Know did nothing wrong they acted according to how they were almost viciously and immediately attacked by the media activists out there without even giving him a fair shake I'm telling you that was my that in a moment\n... said something's wrong here this is this isn't right I mean if you can just attack someone a police officer without even hearing your story in an unquestionably tragic incident no use of force incidents are no one goes out

six\nDemocrats are now trashing\nYou judge judicial supremacy again had to Dan Horowitz has a great piece on this a conservative review today\nFolks this is not a bad thing\nNow all of a sudden the Democrats that day of lost their bid to take over the majority on the Supreme Court they thought they'd have a six three majority where the president Hillary Clinton right now I'm ... and quite work out that way\nNow that it is a five for conservative majority and the swing vote is now John Roberts rather Anthony\nKennedy who is a I Believe more reliable conservative vote I Hope in the future\n[noise] the liberals are now attacking the course that listen attacking an institution in the United states because you lost is not a good thing but her which makes a really good point here\nFolks liberals for years have any really hard time doing one thing\nThey can't seem to get a national mandate for any of their hard left proposals to pass through think about it\nNow I'm not saying they haven't had big wins they had they had the stimulus Obamacare let's not put her head in the sand the pretend that\nHappen but the big ticket items that liberals are abortion on demand\nBob ... a basic income Medicare for all these are big ticket big monstrous platinum and gold winning items for the liberals they have no national mandate for they\nOne of the national mandate for gay marriage wherever you stand on it they couldn't get it states were knocking it down they were putting it on referendum they were losing\nLiberals as a backstop have always relied on the courts and legislators in black robes who pretend to be judges to pass those items why it's very simple when you think about it\nIt is a very simple mathematical equation do you want to have to convince a hundred million Americans in a presidential election to vote for your candidate along with your house representative members and your Senate members or do you want to convince one or two judges and a black robe ... consider themselves swing voters to do it for\nYou the answer is obvious they have always relied on the courts because the the you're just get a bunch of liberals pretending to be judges on the court you choose to legislate from the bench and you don't have to do\nHard work knocking on doors getting elected in telling people why you think government controlling their health care when they can't even run the damn the Ovie a DMV excuse me or whatever the deal for years they can't run\nThey're they convincing them that that's good for them you can't there is no\nPopular mandate for it so now that that avenue to the Supreme Court has been cut off for them\nThey're starting to now I Want you to screen shot all of their tweets when you're out there on Twitter them saying the Supreme Court it's not legitimate screen\nShot all of this because there may unfortunately become a time when they take\nBack the majority on the Supreme Court and I want you to fire all those screen shots back at them on Twitter hey look at this remember when you said judicial supremacy in the Supreme Court didn't matter\nNow it's not going to matter you're not going to change your mind these people don't stay in for anything on the actual principles are principles power they worship the golden calf of government that is what they do their national pastime is gender you fly thing before the author of big government whatever means they have to use to get there doesn't matter\nBut another lesson learned from this is this the Democrats are going to attack judicial supremacy we as Republicans to say is only to make this personal the courts do have a constitutional role but you know what\nLabs you don't think the court should be deciding things [noise] [noise] yes welcome to the party piles Bruce Willis and die hard cubs PY obey\nBrandt\nYou're welcome we don't believe that either we believe in a\nConstitutional republic to do the hard work of legislating you have to

stuff abortion gay marriage onto the course why\n\nBecause folks where do you think taking a liberal vote\nOn a national gay marriage referendum or abortion referendum no matter where you stand where do you think that what do you think in in in the heartland America that there's overwhelming popular opinion for abortion on demand out there across the heartland of America outside of say a Illinois

slash communist but he uses capitalism against it doesn't matter of fact he almost singlehandedly wrecked\nThe British pound several years ago and they did that on purpose because he wanted to make a point that capitalism illegal and so you use capitalism against it and and he's made a ton of money doing it which is really odd I mean this is how he funds all of these organizations they want to destroy capitalism and does it through capitalist\nSo [laughter] it doesn't make much sense but no there's not a whole a window by George Soros except for\nThe call 'em out and let them know let

science experiment in history\nNo other even comes close to its combination of size experience linked in detail of analysis and as they were counted the experiments planners are providing a minimum income would encourage work their worst fears realized when the results show the opposite\nEvaluations of the experiment from the negative income tax reduced quote desired hours of work by nine percent for a husband is twenty percent for wives and twenty five percent for single female heads of family for single males who were not heads of households throughout the experiment the reduction in work hours\nPer week was forty three percent\n... lost their jobs during the\nExperiment experience significantly longer spells of unemployment compared with non recipients more than two months longer for husbands almost a year longer for wives and longer still for single mothers for every thousand dollars and additional benefits there was an average reduction of six hundred and sixty dollars in earned income\nThat meant that three thousand dollars in government benefits required to increase the net income by a thousand so we're spending three times as much\nTo actually get the the results\nStudies also made it clear that the receipt of unconditional aid not phased out of benefits which led to the reduced work for and losing ground Murray concluded that the fact of the negative income tax on reducing ... was unambiguous and stronger to his credit\nHe's acknowledged that such disastrous results should be expected of guaranteed income as an add on to rather than a wholesale replacement of the existing system of welfare and social insurance in fact he asserts and losing ground as the true negative effects\nAnd the negative income tax experimenter understated because those effects were over and above the effect of the work disincentives in the existing system but see what's happening with the universal basic income\nIs you really don't have to work you just get a basic income now how many people are going to try and live off than scam as they do on other things to hide any other income coming in this we've already seen this with welfare searching imagine if we give you a living wage danger just for breathing\nThat we're going to give you a disincentive to work\nAgain I go back\nTo raising children and of course I'm no expert on obviously those are those those you know me my family my kids know this but so I'm not claiming that I've got the\nAll the answers all I Know is this and with my kids and we would we told them you know you got to do this we push 'em we push him and we put I was to be male and back and forth with a gentleman of the kids or kid who went to school with my kids and he was somewhat his kids are up to ... to ...\nAnd I said it's interesting that you know when you push them out of the nest to see them fly or sometimes they flap around a little bit before they fly but eventually they're going to fly\nBut they're never going to fly if you put their wings and bring them home and put them in a cage and is that the most humane thing it's like putting the four hundred pound guy on a donkey you don't do it it's not humane\nSo are we shouldn't be doing is trading our fellow citizens as we would treat the ones we love our own family and that is to say hey I Love you but you need to get out and make it on your own\nAnd if you make it on your own you're going to be happier with yourself\nTo give you some sort of a universal basic income no matter whether you're working or not\nIs not a long term solution and I'm not saying we don't do this for people who are first starting out we've all had kids and they need this that or the other and maybe mom dad can you help me with this until I you know really get my feet out you know my feet under me\nBut I'll tell you with me and even then you know you you wonder whether you're doing the right thing\nI Know with me when I decided I was out on my own I was out of my own uh my father had the means but he didn't have the he didn't he didn't have the intention to give me any money my right my um my wife\nAnd I were talking about this is one of the best things for both of us now her situation was she really didn't have the means that they were poor or anything but her parents were schoolteachers and you know my father was a lawyer so he had the means anything just wouldn't give it to me and I knew this\nBecause I asked [laughter] and uh you know I've told her to\nThe story about the sport because matter of fact I told him that on his deathbed and I said you know I just want you to know before you go\nAbove a you know I've told a lot of stories on some some of them not but I'm I have told that sport coat story of thousand times on the radio and it's one of those things that are left a lasting impression because I fall for the longest time you were a bottle\nOr but you were actually doing what was right for me I give you the\nThe abridged version of this I had been working in radio got blown out in the format change and so I lost my job and I\nWent to work for an ad agency selling jingles of all things and as my father committed to my brother one time uh after I got this gig and it cleaned up clean it up but he didn't he says I'm\nA Phil couldn't sell sex on the troop frame so I'm\nHe and he knew me and he knew me better about that than I did I'm not a salesman\nLong story short if it's I'm not too late for that I um\nWent to work for this ... and seeing as strict commission and uh so I came to him when I first got this gig and I said I Need to buy five sport coats and it was going to be five hundred dollars a hundred dollars a sport coat I said I made a difference for cove where every day so I can go and make me sales calls\nAnd he says I'll be glad to co signed at the bank for you\nAnd I said are you kidding me they said no I'm not\nKidding you I'll be glad to go there and co son and I got off at him I said you know we can't give me five hundred bucks go buy some cults I'm going to pay you back of course you know you never know when in that situation [noise] they said well you pay the bank backing off coast signing they'll set up on payments and stuff and you know be good for you\nAnd I got hacked off at him\nAnd so I went around the corner 'cause he was in our little town of Nashville North Carolina he was right around the corner from the bank so I went right around the corner walk in and one of the guys one of the ... a loan officers I knew he was several years older than me but I knew him and I said man I Need\nI Need five hundred dollars for some sport goats in my old man said he killed sign but you know screw him he said he'd only romantic ... and I'll give you the five hundred dollars right now just with your signature and so I got the check for five hundred dollars and I walked back around and my father is all of a sudden I walked in and I should check it I said\nSee I don't mean to you and then I turn around and walked away and I thought he was a bottle for not give me the five hundred dollars [noise] let's see I don't\nNeed you was exactly what he wanted to hear from me it's a hurtful thing for a parent to hear that from a child but that's exactly the point was he wanted me to get to a point where I didn't need him and so I did and of course I made a hundred dollars and three months [laughter]\nAnd then I had moved to Nashville with no job and that's what I did that spurred me to do this I had to make payments on a five hundred dollar note from the bank and I'd made a hundred dollars in three months and I had no money\nSo as it is a with a lot of folks who have no safety net I knew if he's not going to give me five hundred dollars a sport 'cause he's not going to give me money or anything the only choice I had\nWas a pack up everything I had in my car and moved to Nashville, Tennessee where I wanted to live and I want to live for a couple of years and then find a job\nAnd make it work because there were no jobs around where I was looking not for me and I knew that I almost had a job in Nashville working at a radio station but somebody else had gotten the gigs so I'm thinking\nMaybe I can at least get a part time job working at the radio station they liked me enough to where I was in the top two and that's what happened so I came to Nashville got a job due in part time got a fulltime job doing uh selling memberships that health club for twelve thousand dollars a year\nAnd within three months\nThe afternoon guy moved to Atlanta got called up to Atlanta to the ... the night guy seven to midnight moved two afternoons and they put me and it's seven the midnight I was back in the game I Would never have done that and my father taught me up back in North Carolina I may still be in their living off my father\nWell if that's the case and he loved me and I told him on his deathbed and I told him many times or that that was some of the most danger device in the ... and the greatest example\nFor a father again when I said you know don't ever feel bad about that you did exactly the right thing that's what's bird me to even moved to Nashville and look you know if I had and [noise]\nIf if you feel that way about your child\nThat you're not gonna give them the five hundred dollars\nBut the judge will help them get the five hundred dollars why don't we do this all these people that are on welfare that we're not love them but when you say no it doesn't mean you're mean it doesn't mean you're cold hearted conservative when you say we're not gonna give you a universal basic income\nWe're going to expect you to work for it and if you can't find work here you're gonna have to move you got to go where the work is is that means well
