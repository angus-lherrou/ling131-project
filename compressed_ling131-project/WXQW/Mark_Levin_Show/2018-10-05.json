Nineteen eighties Leland Kaiser told investigators that Monica McLean now this is interesting Monica McLean who's a retired FBI agent and she was in the court I mean in the Senate Judiciary committee\nWith Dr Ford it's interesting isn't it and then we get an FBI investigation so I don't Neal\nHad urged Leland this this uh McLean woman had urged Leland Kaiser to clarify her statement now\nCharles Cooke is explaining why it would be hard to make this into a witness tampering case and I think the ... the thing is the the optimal word is clarify\nNot ... not necessarily change your statement but clarified in other words\nShe joined you're saying that you believe Dr forward but that you don't\nThe Julian ... and that you've never met Brett Kavanaugh can you clarify that that's what it could be I think what it meant was can you clarify this so that we get our way and we got to have somebody over here because this woman's out she's sucking ballet or I mean she looks like she's a nut case over you know by all these people including you and nobody remembers it\nAnd that's what I think they meant by clarify but for the life of me who has been telling you since day one since to tell us testimony\nWhy they didn't call Dr Ford on texting back and forth whether it's legal in Kaiser woman in that witness tampering I think that's far worse than anything that Mr McLean woman could have done McLean woman contacts ring says well maybe can you clarify this you've got the actual woman in question\nWho is texting back and forth where they're constantly she says this testimony why is that now witness tampering as I told you before and I told you the bay of Thursday a week ago Brett\nKavanaugh had set in his testimony while you know mark forward in a in a minute I mean mark judge mark judge and I was getting hard judge and I've been a you know texting back and forth he was telling me you know he was really supportive of them at all oh oh\nDid you say drugs that you were texting with one of the witnesses and the doctor for to solve things but we're going to demand to see those text messages\nCan you imagine they wouldn't say that I Can't imagine they wouldn't 'cause I Would want to see him to what did you say to mark judge and the text message\nWell the same thing should have been asking Dr Ford what did you say the ... to a ... you just said you text messaging back and forth what were you saying and they\nOh nobody knows 'cause nobody subpoena the text messages\nWe don't need to rehash those forever because it's now a moot point or at least it will be tomorrow it looks like but going forward we need to set some ground rules here\nAnd this is basically what it boils down to folks and I hate to say a ... and again I Would caution Trump from saying something like this and I would caution him even though I'm I'm with the Republicans out there on the trail they don't need\nTo anger the other side but I don't give a crap so [laughter] I'll

way I'm just trying to put timeline and stuff together because a lot of things going through my head on motivation here yeah I think it was um it may have been September twenty six or during the day before\nThe testimony from a Dr Ford because I'm thinking because you remember we have the story that\nHe\nHad been punk by some money on for a chain or something you remember\nObviously not being true because he is suspended his Twitter account or had you know the\nI guess kept people me or to publicly follow what what are we bid\nAnd I guess that's 'cause he was putting a bunch of stuff on it about this thing and then he was in public again and it was going to go forward\nAnd the suspicion was really doing that but they've been punk by somebody who knows I told you you know you get these things with a room full of salt but what I'm saying is the irony is as Susan Collins in her impassioned speech on the Senate floor today\nEssentially said that it was the sweat Nick allegations that changed her mind to support judge Kavanaugh how ironic is that so we give these people enough time and they do something stupid enough\nTo where they actually don't get their way and Susan Collins didn't go the way who knows what will happen I don't think they have the votes without Susan Collins we'll see now if they have more votes tomorrow or whenever they vote over the weekend it's probably

who delivered a speech and among the things I never imagined that I Would be saying at any point today\nOne that oh my God Chuck Grassley doesn't use less who goes by so spooky\nAnd Susan Collins Susan Collins this afternoon delivered the most remarkable speech I've ever heard a senator deliver who the heck happened a year at a at a lot of interesting interesting things going on\nBut in the context that there are two sides to stories from one side effects by Thursday he has so many people including the aforementioned Susan Collins who is unbelievable today who said that you know what she\nWas really credible really credible Christine forward you know really believable and ah you know so it was Brett Kavanaugh how many times did you hear that from people\nBut yeah you know they both or no and they were not no day we're not going to be bring somebody was lying\nSomebody was committing perjury\nSomeone testifying\nLast Thursday was really really committing an act of evil and that person based on all the information available as Christine for say filling out people are treating her with kid gloves\nBut in this moment where by a to vote margin weird advancing to the final votes tomorrow and Brett Kavanaugh approximately five o'clock eastern time\nIt's also important that Christine Ford saying that she is one hundred percent certain that Brett Kavanaugh sexually assaulted her but she is not allowed to just\nWent off into the sunset as though she never made those claims now there's not going to be any accountability there's no way in the world of the Senate Judiciary committee is going to pursue her for poor drink\nThey should they should there should be a full investigation of her but as long as I have an opportunity to do so what she did it's an act of evil Christine for\nTrying to ruin a man's life say she is one hundred percent certain providing witnesses none of which corroborate anything she said it's wrong that's wrong and it's important that when we are confronted with the axis of evil in this society be false accusations by someone like Christine forward\nThey are called out for what they are and she is made to to have to account for what she is\nWhich is a perpetrator\nA woman who committed an act of evil\nBut there are some folks that go yeah but she might really be a sexual assault victims okay and I'm not saying she is and possibly and sexual assault victims let me ask you\nIf you have someone who is a legitimate victim of sexual assault and they go out and the murders somebody down the line or they had accountable for that murder because they were a victim of sexual assault somewhere in their life\nOr he held accountable for murder right the one where she tried to do the right cab and I am one hundred\nPercent certain it was Brett Kavanaugh was seen not trying to effectively ruin that man's life his family's life\nHow old do you have to do that so I don't care if she wants to sexual assault victim somewhere along the way does not give her the right\nTo do what she did and it's important once again\nBut we don't just wide off because break out I was going to make it through this thing and ignore people who are perpetrators like Christine bored because there are all the others we ended up a thorn in the\nBiggest issue we could have had in this country which is due process just go in the way of uh I dunno know Chuck Schumer's credibility for the Chicago Cubs things and I'm not trying to rub it in my dorm just pointing out that if I were a leftist in Chicago I wouldn't show up to vote because I mean just by you know\nNot and things aren't going you're way right now and ... what's the point\nBut that's where we are [noise] that's where we are we're on a razor thin edge and if you are someone who believes and right and wrong if you are someone who believes in the constitution if you are someone who believes in the premise then we all need to acknowledge what happened here\nAnd who the perpetrator was and recognized in our own lives should those people come about the bay as well will be called out he made accountable for who and what they are a couple of things because we were

the great one more couple up and and uh\nGet sort of some of your calls here and just a moment by the way the phone lines are not to be confused with the uh the Chuck Schumer sexual assault allegation line which also has been known to have the exact same phone number so just to please do not share your Chuck Schumer sexual assault allegations\nOn the Marco then show just to go straight to the FBI place\nNow a ... right before the break\nMentioned persuading people how to persuade somebody politically or over the course of my career it is the single most common question I have received\nAnd the easiest way to tell you how to persuade someone to tell you who you shouldn't be attempting to persuade people are closed minded if somebody is genuinely not open to information odds are you're not going to get anywhere\nAnd that's the problem they most people in this is real conservatives to by the way it's not like this is unique to liberal there are a lot of close minded conservatives too but you got to be open a new information and you need to identify who those people are in your life\nYou know I mentioned the Kavanaugh polling firm Gallup start to finish everything that's happened over the past three months everything\nPublic sentiment I'm Brett Kavanaugh only shifted by seven points the entire time puts it\nIn other words most seven percent of the country was even persuadable and Brett Kavanaugh\nSo what does that tell you when you go to the average person and that opposes your thought process and expect to get some way somewhere now union is all you're doing is banging your head against the wall and you're going to make yourself on happy\nSo if you want to be persuasive the first thing I find the right people people are open to information not the loudest people who will fight with you politically and the next thing is credibility one of the biggest mistake people make just by liking it\nBecause once you have to give up your credibility why is anybody going to listen to you for that reason operate with facts\nOperate with information that he just operate with opinions independent of the facts and the information somebody who is otherwise open to that information they're just going to be you you as someone who is highly political trying that can communicate or your your emotion rather\nThan principle of because typically what you'll find for those that are\nTruly persuadable uh is that they are analytical and that they genuinely are inquisitive and looking for more information and by the way\nThis surprises a lot of people but I find that common link that millennials\nAre a number of reasons and it starts with the economy\nA lot of folks have given up on the millennial generation which by the way the youngest one eels are\nClosing in on being illegal to drink but youngest one's oldest one's like thirty five thirty six now\nAnd I have not blame them right along because when was it that they came of age\nThey came of age and the great recession rain so here they went through the education establishment they worked at a bill of whatever the education establishment feed them and then they come out and the economy's terrible\nAnd they weren't able to get opportunity and so it made sense to them yeah you know what capitalism this economy doesn't work we need change you know Obama probably made sense because hey that was what our teachers told us that here we are and things are working\nAnd never seen a good economy never seen a good economy we finally have it\nRight now is one of the most important window of time we have two really good opportunities to reach people especially younger adults that now do have opportunities three point seven percent unemployment are you kidding me right\nThere is getting the wage growth the
