appropriate to do yeah I agree with you know there was a bad thing to say but I didn't say it Hillary set it\nHillary said yeah I Know\nThey all look alike\nAnd of course now she does say well I was just talking about what the Republicans would say you know I'm sure this is the ship they color on this list is you know I was just I was channeling a Republican you know 'cause this is what they would say I didn't know this is what you said\nAnd then one day it'll be scrubbed from the Internet you'll never you'll never see it again you never know exist you know we need we need to record bed

because I what I did was I found the transcript and it wasn't exactly what it was something to the effect of\nListening to the campaign who's going to explain our houses who's going to be talking about the illegal aliens you know I'm going well\nThat sounds rather presumptuous white privilege and racist you're assuming that everybody who comes here to the ... well she was talking about\nHispanics in general but specifically the illegal aliens and\nYou know if if somebody like me said that he wants to racist comment you something that everybody who comes it's going to clean your house or Moe you're alone well I mean the the sad fact is that most of them are I mean they're going to come for\nThat type of labor but they hear it from somebody like Hillary Clinton news out there talking well ... you know what she thinks of the illegal aliens cause and and by the way this is why she and who's going to vote in our elections she should have put that in there too but\nThis is what she is concerned about if we don't have any legal immigration who is going to make our beds who's gonna who's gonna who's going to play in our houses who's going to more alone you Hillary\nThought about that\nI clean my house my wife and I clean the house and then we have somebody that comes in ... along because there's quite a bit along the mall or but I actually do a lot of the Bush rocket myself on the rest of the proper day but\nI make my own band I wash my own sheets I change my own ... what's your wife doesn't do that no my wife my wife I wash my own clothes or we have a deal with the dishes is she on loads a dishwasher and I loaded\nAnd so the dishes or start piling up in the sink it's on me and a new show off by saying are you on strike [laughter]\nNo I'm going to get to them in them and so that's sort of what we ... we don't you know or the gates anywhere to go on ... ... you know something to do it anyway\nThey all look alike really they all look alike I mean I'm just sitting here thinking I'm just imagining if Trump it said that\nSay he's at a rally and somebody said yeah did you hear a year ago what Cory Booker\nSaid that oh there are all they all look alike can you imagine I mean think about that for a second and saying oh my gosh the news media folks all\nFemale downfall absolutely nailed down and I guarantee you you've not heard\nThis one place in the mainstream media well this is what I'm Talking about what does not go Phil teach you media bias is not necessarily what they tell you what they don't they're not telling you that they're not telling you that and if Trump and said that they would be not ever stopping telling you that\nSo is there fake news absolutely this is another example the woman on CNN Today saying that Trump has radicalized more people than I says\n\nI mean what what a stupid thing to say to start with but this is one of those deals where you're talking about fake news and there's a prime example I mean not a day goes by that the president doesn't have some example of fake news out there so\nThe synagogue thing and maybe we can get a montage of this too because there are mainstream media folks after mainstream media folks as if this is the president's rhetoric that causes synagogue she and the guy hated Donald Trump\nHe thought Donald Trump was a Jew loving global list he hated him because he had all these used in the White House\nAnd he said Donald Trump's not going to ever do anything about this either Jew lover and do this so I'm going in so he went in and shot and killed eleven folks six people wounded and somehow that Trump's fault\nSo what's Trump supposed to do because it's his fault he supposed to stop criticizing everybody on the left especially the fake news media well that's not how it works\nAnd Trump's not playing the game and you still you hear people from October we hear from Fox News saying\n[noise] well you know in light of all this he really needs to tamp down the rhetoric\nTamp down the rhetoric\nIs he saying go shoot up a synagogue is he saying go send a pipe bomb to a\nMajority sorrows for Obama no taste criticizing people legitimately and the mainstream media is the biggest target because they're doing it every single day and you notice they don't tamped down the rhetoric about him\nThey talk about he's a he's a racist sees a bigot he is or not the he's a ... I mean everything else you don't see them Tampa to not at all so\nWhat I'm trying to tell you is this is not how it works it doesn't work that you get to exploit some idiot or some lunatic out there and then silence the people on the other side that's not how free speech works\nDonald Trump talking about the mainstream media has nothing whatsoever to do with a shooting in a synagogue or a pipe bomb\nIt only has to do with the fact that he's pointing out the fake news media every day and we have example am everyday none of that goes by we don't have an example of these folks stretching the truth ignoring the true completely fabricating someone you're not telling you the whole truth\nAnd as I told\nYou in the summer you folks were listening to the interview with NPR and apparently they didn't get what they wanted they ... they weren't the ambush me and they didn't and so I and I told them in the interview I said look you know I Would love to have some outlet out there that actually it was the whole story\nAnd I'll tell you Fox News does this sometimes too they they only give you what they want you to know what you know there's sort of their slant on things\nWe don't feel you do this no I I comment on stuff now I Will tell you the whole story you know when I find it but sometimes I have to piece it together like a jigsaw puzzle\nAnd when you put all the pieces together you find the truth\nAnd the truth and I ... I've called the ride out on this many times when they have gone overboard about someone someone I trying to think of an example right there right now but they have called out a certain person for saying something and I'll be on [laughter] well that's not actually the context\nAnd so I gave you the contacts and I say this is not a big deal I remember ... I I don't remember the instance but I remember coming home when everybody was going nuts on\nOn a social media and everything about something somebody said and I said whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa that's not exactly the full story and I tell you will and some people get mad at me for what you do that\nBecause it's not fair it's not it's not honest\nEnough legitimate nothing is coming from the left so we can criticize them over that's where I always said about the um [noise] birth certificate was with a\nWith a bomb on the people were just harping on I mean of course seeing the folks at the world and the daily over and over and over I got so I couldn't go to W. and be a anymore and grab come back to them a check them from time to time but it was just like every day it's everyday boom boom writing books about a writing articles but he's not a citizen going look\nI don't see any proof they're talking about somebody in a village and can you just said what he was born eleven meaning anything I'm not going to rehash the whole thing some people got mad at me\nThat is what I said was to you is as far as we know\nMorocco bomber was born in the United states now I Will tell you when when they put out that\nThat birth certificate that looked fake uh well I I may comment on that and I said my my wife was born in Hawaii\nHer birth certificate looks another that birth certificate looked like one that my boys got that were born in the nineties he was born in the sixties and my wife was born into why so I pulled out her birth certificate ... nothing it looked like the old mimeograph thing you know like a negative ... look like\nBill Nelson faces a challenge from governor Rick Scott and what are the most expensive in\nClosely watched Senate races in the country Richards mayor is urging the city council to vote again do approve the purchase of two new fire trucks the council voted yesterday not to purchase them they are getting a gardener says the trucks would cost the city over a million dollars over nine years the next council meeting at that\nOr Thursday little ice cream it's bringing back a Christmas favorite\nStudents door breeders will be home for Christmas cookies ice cream\nSweet treated a combination of holiday cookies like chocolate chip maker doodle and sugar getting Walsh that like you can already\nLately it seems like everything we use every day is getting an upgrade when the bad we sleep in the raid that we use when we wake up that we've neglected one of the more impulsive products in the daily routine that old worn out toothbrush I'm Simon ... and I'm a product designer after I learned how important brushing your teeth is overall health\nI worked with a dentist the crap that sort of a toothbrush that makes brushing most simple affordable and surprisingly enjoyable\nQuit a sensitive stomach vibrations that a gentle on your gums and a built in time and the pulse who's the guy do around your mouth all packed into a beauty pretty slim and dies Eli medium design we also to live a fresh brush heads on a dentist recommended schedule just five dollars for three shipping our attention to the section an quip the time magazine distinction\nOne of the best inventions that they get upgrade your cat\nAnd stop brushing better with quit\nQuit start to just twenty five dollars and it's guaranteed for life with a regional plan sign up now I'd get quip dot com slash W W O and you'll receive your first rebuilt pack free with a quip electric toothbrush that's your first rebuilt pack free at G.

spacious\nBars\nClose at ... ... talk what's that voice now eight seven seven three one tree eight to one one what's\nIn order to have the ambassador to the United states from Israel with us unfortunately under these circumstances run drummer first I'd like your general take on what has taken place here and secondly I Know you've been in Pittsburgh who did you meet with and what did you see there are certain\nOil which you know how to act towards that but it's a medic attacking and us history they claim to weather wise I I was in Pittsburgh yesterday\nI got to meet with the members of the community you got to meet with the mayor with the county executive I'm with Senator Casey was there we had a a congressman Republicans and Democrats and talk to a lot of people have to tell you mark it's a very very strong\nCommunity and I think it's special community and squirrel hill a Pittsburgh they're they're very very tight it\nIt's not just by it among the Jewish community but also the Dodgers community supporting and I thought what part of it last night\nUh that really brought out the entire community faith leaders are Christian or Jewish faith leaders of most from leader who actually spoke there as well and spoke very well and uh I think the whole community is just trying to support 'em the Jewish community there and everyone told me the same thing we never thought it was going to happen here\nAnd I think they were just shocked at star and a and what I wanted to do with Israel's ambassador to the United states is just tell them to Israel stance without that they're not alone\nAnd in Israel yesterday morning our government may taught Sunday cause some days like Monday and Israel the first day of the week and the government meets every day and there was just a moment of silence for the entire government of Israel ... because we are the one and only George state so we feel are\nSpecial sense of solidarity with Jewish communities around the world and that's why I was for me to be in Pittsburgh yesterday\nYou were born in Miami and just when people do this you're born in Miami your father was the mayor of Miami your brother was the mayor Miami Miami Beach Miami Beach\nStickers about were the ones that I speak\nThat that's true so you know the United states very very well\nObviously you were in Israeli citizen and you are you're very close to the prime minister of Israel so when you look at this we see grooming anti Semitism throughout your him\nOr the FBI put out a report to the latest report you see growing anti Semitism or hate crimes as I called in the United states what do you make of this\n[noise] or we kind of it is as you say a growing problem or many people want to say that it began in two thousand sixteen with President Trump's election that's simply not true and you look at the FBI statistics that you mentioned ah in two thousand fourteen and two thousand Fifteen a hate crimes against Jews accounted for over half\nOf hate crimes against religious groups and the United states Jews were only two percent of the population mark and their accounting for over half\nAnd by the way there were periods over the last Fifteen Years was about Seventy five percent of the number of uh uh attack the crimes against Jews were actually much bigger than I was in two thousand fourteen of two thousand Fifteen\nI really think what you have mark is is the rise of anti Semitism over the last couple of decades what you had was about a half century after the Holocaust where it was politically incorrect to attack choose\nAnd I think what you've seen happen over the last two decades\nIs that it's once again become fashionable a compact cues and it's no longer politically incorrect to go after Jews now most of the attacks actually hide themselves\nBehind the mask of hatred towards Israel to one and only Jewish state but at the singling out of Israel is very much like they used to single out the Jews for special treatment so I think you've seen this on the rise it's not just in America it all around the world are you seeing attacks against Jews in Paris attacks against choosing blues attack\nAgainst Jews in Copenhagen attacks against Jews in Brussels and in London and even in the United states this is not the first attack\nThere was an attack in two thousand six energy federation in Seattle there was an attack in two thousand fourteen Jewish community center at outside of Kansas Kansas City with I think claim free lives\nAnd this is just the worst attack but this is a growing problem and I think one of the issues is social media\nBecause you know you can have a very very small fraction of the population that are these are you know these crazy I don't know if I'd call them crazy but evil people um you can have a tough one one hundredth of one percent could be thirty thousand Americans\nUm and there's a stream is saying I can be people like David Duke it could be neo Nazis that could be white nationalist all sorts of people but on the line they can actually build communities of hate in a way that they couldn't do before so I think as you get more and more people going into social media\nAs you have this rise of abuse online hate groups I think it's extremely dangerous Senate dangerous and it it has given them a sense of community of haters and I think it's important to take action against that I Will tell you marketed in Israel\nWe monitor the Internet now we're a different country and you have constitutional protections here I Know that you're you're a great defender of them we don't have a First Amendment second to Fourth Amendment\nBut hopefully your law enforcement authorities can figure out a way within your laws constitutional rights that Americans have\nTo figure out a way to monitor this so they can see what sort of this kind of hate pops up and then be able to take action before the crime takes place that's what we have in Israel\nUm and it's been very effective at preventing a lot of these types of attacks I mean I Would love to believe that this was going to be the last attack but I think given that these all these haters are communicating with each other I ... I think it's important for your forties to see what they can do to prevent\nThe next attack and uses armed guards at many of your scenario\nA is the day when CNN and MSNBC and these these used to be reputable organizations really focused on reporting the news rather than driving the news and creating the news the news conferences now the White House you glean nothing that's newsworthy nothing I'll be right back\n[noise] much love\nAnd you are listening to the next day W execute out when you and your news that the information station\nDo you all back taxes to the IRS you may qualify for the first start program civic tax relief can give you free information on how the program works there professionals have over twenty five\nYears of experience negotiating with the IRS they know the proper steps to save you the most amount of money they won't negotiate you're taxed at and protect you from bank ... wage garnishment goal for your free fresh start information\nNow eight hundred nine five they rural wage that's eight hundred nine probably five eight four oh wait eight hundred million five five eight four oh wait\nAdopt us kids presents what to expect when you are expecting a teenager learning Dillingham\nToday I'm going to tell parents translate teams play\nNow when a team that something is on this week is exactly like saying that threat\nRemains that something is awesome\nAnother one is\nNothing like say just short horizon\nI coach rubble into the mall\nIn other words you might share your\nJolie is a shorter better way to a job at a higher than what we I Am like Joe ... unicorn bone case\nYou don't have to be seen to be a perfect parents\nNow says he's an author Campbell thing here I'm\nJust saying\nTo learn more Mitt Romney us kids got Oregon\nPublic service announcement rocky by the U.S department of health and Human Services down you can't do any counseling\nUse credit card debt and ruining your life now you can have a large portion of your credit card debt forgiven\nGet relief today wants to give you free information that shows you how this program has proven to work for credit card debt medical bills and department store dad\nWho's of people have used to have a portion of their credit card debt forgiven call now for free information and their consultation or\nWe'll give you the sequel to this money saving program absolutely free and get all your opening information that could save you thousands of dollars a year or a mom depending on how much you owe wrecked the more you over the more you can say all you needed to oh ten thousand dollars or more in credit card debt and medical bills or department store dead to qualify to go for free\nDebt forgiveness information mail that eight hundred you also have an eighty five fifty eight so you don't drink do oh seven eighty\nFive fifty eight discovered the secret to having\nYour credit card debt forgiven goal eight hundred euro seven eighty five fifty a hundred ... seven eighty five fifty eight\n\n", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Mark Levin Show", "city": "Fairhope", "day": "29"}
