Seventy you were listening to\nFeel Valentine show ... ... email us ...\nCheese\nBut he made it\nSo I Want to change I'm looking at a map of Mexico my little long way from on high but I'm In Honduras\nWhere we're actually flew we didn't we didn't take a flatbed truck I Wonder how long that actually pigs\nSo you've got it'd be just give you ... your Nicaragua and then just north of Honduras than just north of as you get a mother\nAnd then you've got Mexico Mexico is a long way down there so somebody was saying you know instead of having them set up the refugee camp and the Mexican American border happen to the Guatemalan Mexico border happening on the Mexican side of Guatemala haven't settled up down there and will help pay for it\nI mean and I know you still have paid for it well I'm just saying anything that keeps them from coming here if we can help facilitate it and held the Mexicans throw these folks back into Guatemala [noise] we have got to make these countries responsible in Trump's doing the right thing he's saying where did you start cutting off your foreign aid\nYou're in Honduras in your city law allowing these people leave your country in Guatemala and your Guatemalan you're allowed to leave a New Mexico and if you're in Mexico you're allowed them to come to the border we're cutting off all your foreign aid screw ya and if you want the foreign aid back then ... then start fixing this\nBefore it comes to us a machinery in Alabama you're up next to Jerry wants to\nTry and sell 'em just a story about the military on the border\nIn Nineteen sixty nine I was stationed in Okinawa with third Marine Division pulling out of Vietnam I was young lieutenant on my way to Vietnam but the ... were writing too often\nEncouraged control of the island going back to Japan rather than being a territory [noise] they would use long snake line dancers in front of the game show our military bases on the island which were protected by Marines from third Marine Division\nAs\nThey were snake around in their dance periodically you'd have a big group of break off and head for the gates\nThe Marines were stationed at the age and as soon as they shift over the line of the ... they were met with harm to follow by strokes from the ... and fourteen rifles or Marines were armed with\nCharm times to the chair somebody sometimes to their head but it was a very effective alternative to keep them off the base\nSee that's that's what I mean we live in the military up there and I right across the border for these people are and say you ain't coming across period\nRight and you know politically correct I don't know how well it would be and now they hit a wall man the chest with a bunch of him for Kaine rifle but it sure as hell stop them from getting on the base and we could do the same thing today\nYeah I Know we had one guy who's going to get them back to our border library with when it was one guy saying when he started shooting them we can't you know you can do start start picking off folks\nAre with rifles who are on on but you can stand there and say we got a human chain link fence ... you're not coming through us and if you come up to me and try to knock me down you're attacking me and I will fight back with the bottom of my gun\nBut you know this could all be avoided if we had the cooperation of the Mexicans the Guatemalans and Hondurans and saying don't let these people get this far I haven't even seen where they are now I don't know how far out they are\nBut you know the the goal is to be here before election day and if you don't think that's political you've lost your mind the mainstream media and then President Trump saying today you know there are some folks from terrorists countries that are in in the industry and we know this happens all the time\nAnd so one of the reporters says ah ah how do you know he said go down there and investigate you'll see we're talking about well\nThere have been some ... investigative reporters tend to be for more conservative outlets and they have talked to folks who were there from terrorists were were were there are hotbeds of terrorism in different countries and the mainstream media will pick it up\nBecause they don't want that narrative they don't want that story up there but that's part of the problem to the problem is we don't know who these people are we can't just let them in the country said Pensacola Europe next said what's up\nOh fill it real quick here are a lot on the head as far as it were up in a foreign aid and everything else but they get a step further and I think that it really you know I mean obviously everybody that the best way to go to them in their pocketbook\nBut what how does it start department the monitor the no go zone for American than an all American backed away out on the back like fake that includes all foreign aid workers everything out\nOnly handle down all the other writer that's probably why I'm probably like ... was hurt or something like\nThat but I think all of that on the phone or a worker and everything and all of a sudden how nurses are going to change their mind real\nThat sooner than that is a great I mean can you imagine I mean not only that but you know the the uh the dollars they make from the Americans that come you know I went down there with a church group church groups given all the time and I'm not saying that the church groups should not go down there but if you want him in the pocket book that's the way to do it ah\nThat would be very interested in you no longer

remind you of his nickname for primary rival Ted Cruz lion head\nSays\nIt off to Texas was a lengthy border with Mexico should the president is threatening to shut down its thousands of migrant care of and make it all the way through\nMy mind is\nTo this controversy over social justice protests during the singing of the national anthem which is really act when these guys making multiples of millions of dollars a year and they're talking about social justice\nDo you ever see these folks on their own time and going and protesting in front of a police station man who uh me neither do I as I've always told you this the issue was very simple you do not have a right to protest their work\nYou just know what am I just started ... okay I'm not going to do the show I'm just going to stand here in front of the microphone with our placard and started shaming stuff I Want me to think I'd keep this big\n[noise] not long\nFormer members San Francisco forty niners one of the first players alongside cabinet to me all during the playing of the star Spangled Banner Jenkins also sees his own former protesting made teammates raised their fists in the year during the national anthem [noise] uh well both Reid and drink and degree the mayor was reason to protest they did not agree on that\nThat ... degree to stop praising his fist in the air after the NFL agreed to commit close to a hundred million dollars toward advancing social justice issues so sure makes me ... social justice issues last year the agreement\nWas struck between the league owners in a group known as the players coalition which was founded by Jenkins and retired NFL start a and one mold and but there were players who we are not on board to\n... and Miami Dolphins safety Michael Thomas said they were withdrawing from the agreement they were limited but because they claimed that mold and drink and purposely excluded Kaepernick from their discussions were the owners say they won't miss guy back in the league\n[noise]\nUh and they are all these people saying well you know we need to protest until they hire capital somewhere Kaepernick is not that good that's the point if he were good it wouldn't matter what the news doing they would have him on the field somewhere plane but he's just not that good\nSo he moves on I'm here in the new if some of these teams are losing Ewing John Gurdon wouldn't put them on and trying to say did they lose again yesterday I wasn't paying attention\nOr are they even play yesterday or\nSome of these teams that they need a quarterback but they barely don't think that the ... up to snuff they also think he might be a huge distraction because his whole thing is is that\nProtest thing instead of actually winning football games and if you're out of actually winning football games he'd still be the starting quarterback for the forty niners\nBut he's not know the caravan ladies and gentlemen\nThe gear bans on the way and the question now is what is going to be\nDone about it well\nThat remains to be seen we don't know exactly what the president has a mind for this but he says he's not going to stand my understanding is well just from reading his tweets and things like this is that he is allowing\nThe diplomatic the diplomatic avenue\nTo play out he's a he's working and threatening Honduras Guatemala\nAnd even Mexico a with cutting off funding and if they don't\nDo something about this so we'll see if that plays out let me let me go to a halt on as always instructed been fun to go to the president's tweets so let me go to today's tweets his stomach to some folks he's campaigning for then he does this and this is from this morning\nSabbath looks like Mexico's police and military are unable to stop the caravan\nHeading to the southern border of the United states criminals and unknown middle Easterners or mixed in I've alerted border patrol and military that this is a national emergency misspelled emergency though must change laws and then he tweeted this right after it\nEvery time you see a caravan or people illegally coming or attempting to come into our country illegally sync up and blamed the Democrats for not giving us the votes to change our pathetic immigration laws remember the midterms so unfair to those who come in legally and the nature of this\nWater Marla Honduras and El Salvador were not able to do the job of stopping people from leaving their country and coming illegally to the U.S we will now begin cutting off or substantially reducing the massive foreign aid routinely given to them\nAnd that was his three tweets about the care of and this morning he's been on to a ... between this and this is a story we had several weeks ago shock\nReport us paying more for illegal immigrant birth than Trump's wall and that was from several weeks ago and it's true\nAnd this is just in a year\nWhat we're paying for illegal alien birth can you imagine\nThe subsequent money we're having to pay to keep these people because a lot of these you know these folks are supposedly citizens and so then they get benefits because their parents can't take care of them and so we give the Medicaid and all sorts of things\nAnd then they may actually grow up to be on welfare so there's no telling what the final ticket is on some of these folks who come here and her birth in the United states by legal parents but it would be a lot cheaper just to build the wall and keep 'em out but start with\nAnd is looking more and more and more like say this is what I'm saying is going to happen\n[noise] these folks on the left they were when during this family separation thing if you look at actually the polling envy the sentiment out there with the folks\nI think seeing all these people are massing of the border scared scared people they're going my gosh look at all these folks because usually the invasion is a trickle we don't see that and they come in you know ten twelve fifty at a time we don't see 'em all coming in together when you see 'em\nA mass of humanity a mass that the um at the at the border then uh\nI think it it it backfires\nOn the Democrats and the liberals out there because they start looking at the school and well we sure don't need that we don't even know who these people are a really accentuate the point of why we have legal immigration you're going well who are these people\nWe have no idea who these people are\nBecoming here illegally now I'll tell you this the ones who come through the border checkpoint there will be processed and the legal way\nThe ones who come across the border because this is what happened they said well it was too long of a weight so we went down you know a few miles and then we've just cross the border and the rest of those folks and they were the ones that were thrown in detention centers the ones coming across legally we are not thrown in detention centers and they didn't have any kids that Trump him\nIt was the ones who came illegally so when the American people see these folks show up right before the election I think they said actually backfire on them\nIf it creates a humanitarian crisis of the border and people go and we got to have a wall my gosh and trucks going that I tell you now look what's happening if we had to walk here we wouldn't have to worry about these people just running across the border they would all go through the processing ports and we wouldn't have to worry about all this stuff give me the wall\nAnd that may be the plan ultimately are as well anyway\nQuickTime I've got to talk about we got other things the Democrats and this is what they've said that they take control of Congress I get a repeal Trump's tax cuts and they're going to give a bunch of money to the poor\nCory Booker wants to give 'em fifty thousand dollars so that they can\nBy the time you hit a adults so that Eighteen that you'll be able to put fifty thousand dollars down on the house and I'm going\nOkay I Love some of that action myself when I was coming up when you this the craziest thing so what they're going to do is killed the proverbial boosted lead the golden egg which is the tax cuts which give us a wonderful economy which gives people jobs\nAnd they're going to reverse that so we go back to high unemployment\nAnd people with low paying jobs so that we can turn around and Rob from you folks who are producing and give it to folks who aren't so they can afford a house that makes perfect sense doesn't it\nAs long as they're showing their colors I think we got good uh we got good news on the rise as
