Kavanaugh percolated and she told a therapist that there were four boys who tried to rape me when I was in my late teens and their mid Nineteen eighties you know what I Believe that happened\nI Believe something fundamentally bad happened\nFirst team forward which is why she has been seeking mental health for all these years and probably what she told the therapist incentivized to do to do so to get help was accurate that four boys try do rape her in her late teens and the Nineteen eighties I Believe her\nBut somehow in her mind she had recovered memory and set of four boys it became one instead of her late teens and became the age of Fifteen instead of the Nineteen eighties and became Nineteen eighty two because Brett Kavanaugh was available and Marilyn in Nineteen eighty two to be around Christine forward\nBut you see the media doesn't pursue that angle do I think something happened to that woman yes and I think what she told the therapist and twenty twelve and twenty Thirteen was accurate when she sold a therapist who rented a room in our house\nThat cause sort of put the second front door in our house so patients come in and out of her house she accurately\nTold the therapists six years ago now for Bush tried to write me in the in my late teens and the Nineteen eighties then sell 'em out in our mind to get fame or to get money\nShe decided to switch it up a

I may try to impeach Kevin Oh of course you can only impeach of federal officer\nFor high crimes and misdemeanors committed while in office so he's been in office one day this morning that his first couple of hearings and the Democrats already wondering peach and they don't want to teach them what they want to do is raise money\nTo use and Heidi Heitkamp strays and North Dakota for example or Joe Donnelly in Indiana that's what they want to do it they were threatening to impeach when they're never going to do that because it wouldn't fly you need fifty one percent of the of the house and two thirds of the Senate it would never happen\nTo end up guy there's a God and having the Republicans will keep the Senate for weeks Trump tonight will know better\nThat are so that the federal judges the pipeline can't continue but imagine the absurdity of the modern Democratic Party having had his first day on the bench and the Democrats want to impeach Brett Kavanaugh\nUnbelievable let's

the ones who declared civil war on my country and killed about six hundred thousand total soldiers so that immigrant party is the part of the Ku Klux Klan and it's a party of Jim Crow Democratic Party so party of lynchings\nThe Democratic party is the party of the destruction of public education currently and the welfare system itself responsible for most of the criminal disasters as say like in the city of Chicago the Democratic party from reconstruction the Ku Klux Klan Jim Crow lynchings collapse of public education in fact\nAbout eight percent of Detroit or Chicago public school students that are African American or read the appropriate level\nAnd so you're talking about a massive dumbing down of the population to keep them on the modern plantation which is the Democratic party\nSo sunny the reserve behaviors thing for Democrats has been repeat it for the past hundred and fifty years some cold and the demon rats they're not Democrats or the demon rats and what what we're seeing the restaurants in the\nIn the airports in the elevators today it's mild compared to what the Democrats did in the Nineteen sixties burning down about a hundred American cities so I wouldn't put a lot past them because Democrats are now shooting US Congressman a Republican\nSo wherever I look I see the disaster of the modern Democratic Party not covered by the mainstream media sunny do you agree on\nWhat the\nSenate we gotta run thanks for your call is continuous more let's go to Jim in Brooklyn I Love Brooklyn Jimmy in Brooklyn welcome to the Mark Sullivan show Jimmy go ahead and\nGreat to hear your in the ... when we hear about the radical left the far left we see what's going on in the schools they see the crime you see and paid for this is the result of liberalism now let me give me some quotes from the communist training manual for\nThe communist right your system to destroy the system the communists right the best way to help the costs\nThe communism is through the liberal wing of the Democratic party the communist right yesterday has left us today center today is left will be tomorrow center that talking about the whole American political system moved to the left\nSo they have a highly organized well trained group with in the Democratic party that the strategist tactician\nThere are a lot of our professors there are a lot of our teachers are a lot of our congressmen and senators so what you see the Kavanaugh hearings you see the Russian pro to see the violence and rise by a team for all this stuff\nThat's part of the left movement which is anti American it's Marxist and it's also largely anti white\nJimmy let me explain this to also in the beginning you might recall the first few weeks the Trump Administration was traditional temp telephone calls with world leaders\nAnd so they organize laughter inside the federal government\nWould release transcripts of the president's private telephone calls with world leaders in order to debase him diminish him\nAnd to marginalize our new president he never had a chance to get his feet on the ground to do the traditional things than for presidents had done because the radical left inside the federal government worked against them from day one\nRight and that helps that helps Iran and North Korea Russia and China\nAnd in fact the senator from Beijing which is what Dianne Feinstein known as in New York by the Chinese hair the senator from Beijing this his foreign influence in our government\nA foreign agent of red China like congressman Dianne Feinstein she ended on that started this big hoopla about a ... as a judge Kavanaugh's judge Kavanaugh allegedly raping and all that stuff\nSo they influence is more than the numbers and we are actually I think at a very big trouble and out of nowhere comes Trump\nI I never thought I Would embrace a political guy as much as I got a lot of Trump\nDoor and in fact the job and saying look at it this way\nThat radical Democratic Party has United the Republican Party I never thought I Would ever say good things about Senator Susan Collins I didn't think it was possible for me to enjoy Mitch McConnell\nOregon Lindsey Graham those three and Chuck Grassley had been fabulous I Can't believe the benefits that the Republican Party has gained because of the activities of the Democrats and I think Trump is going to be blessed to have a Democrat run against him\nBut like Pocahontas or Cory Booker with the crazy eyes are Kamala Harris in adolescence sexual affairs with mayor Willie Brown shoe slipped away to the top is going to be wonderful to have those kind of people running against Trump if there was a Bill Clinton in his prime\nBut instead we want to prop up people do stupid things whether it's car manufacturers or whether it's banks or insurance companies or whatever when they get too big there's no such thing as too big to fail\n[noise] you know I hand um\nI'd alone with countrywide they were one of the bad actors out there and I remember\nWhat they were doing I mean they were giving loans you know a hundred and ten percent of the home value and things like this I had some buddies who were in the when the mortgage broker business and I told you I came across I used to well I still do from time to time I keep a journal clean I write stuff down\nAnd I had gone with them on a trip and this was in two thousand seven I Believe and they were trying to explain to me on the trip about a subprime mortgages and I said what\nThey said that it's called the subprime mortgage and they were telling me about country while they say countrywide is pushing this stuff when I was all the time they want us to the subprime mortgages and we don't do it\nAnd and now they're trying to pull some of our business away from us 'cause we won't do subprime ... because it's a higher interest rate obviously because you don't have the credit\nAnd then you know but they're giving you all the money you want and you have no credit they charge a higher interest rate and they make a killing until you don't pay which is exactly what happened so these guys saw this coming year or so before it actually hit\nAnd they were trying to explain to me what was going on\nAnd the problem with countrywide and then there's all these that we are too big to fail was they needed to to say a long time ago\nBut I had my I had a um a a a home\nLoan within so what was going to happen if countrywide just went belly up that means that I just tear up my uh my mortgage note and don't pay them anymore and I got a house for free I don't think so\nYou know what would have happened some other entity some other lending institution would've come in and bought the paper for pennies on the dollar and then they would have called me up and said hey fill this is Bob ... mortgage company we now own your mortgage and you've got to start paying\nUs I'm not going to just walk away and not that bad to pay for my house anymore the market would have corrected but no way after prop folks up and when you prop folks up they don't learn lessons\nAnd here we are right back when you see the advertisers all the time we'll give you one hundred percent of your loan value we don't worry about your credit I'm going what the hell are these people do when they're doing exactly what they did before ten years ago we're right back to where we were

saturation\nPoint where it takes two hours to get the work and it fixes itself have you noticed is where the population we told you the story the other day and now they're worried about sperm count because they think now the population is going to start to go down dramatically and now they're worried about extinction of the human race\nBecause sperm count as going down by two percent a year they're saying well you know what that is that's nature taking care population you'll see this in the animal kingdom and I know where technically animals but you see we've got a farm\nAnd they are deer on it and you would think if we didn't go out there and killed some of the deer they wouldn't have free thousand a year but we don't because nature takes care of it the beer will be as many beer as\nThe land can sustain and then they'll start well some of them will\nAnd then the rest of them all eat and then that's the way nature is well that's the way it is that's the way it is with everything it's a natural equilibrium and when you're talking about a city and affordable housing\nYou know the the government doesn't need to build affordable housing if you build up and they and only rich people are there and then they can't find somebody to clean their house or to wait on them at a restaurant or whatever the case may be or build something we're construction\nThen what happens while the market starts to dictate bad and all of a sudden the rent starts going to go down because you know people start moving out as\nYou can over billed everywhere what happens is we've seen this I mean I've been around Nashville except for two years in Philadelphia since Nineteen eighty five I've seen this go up and down and I've seen the condos go I remember in the Nineteen eighties uh this was probably eighty or eighty eight\nWhen I got here in eighty five they were building condos like you wouldn't believe their condos everywhere everybody got to know got into condos everywhere and they were going on and I had a friend and this is back in the day\nHe paid a hundred thousand dollars for his condo which was an expensive condo back in the day this was in the eighties he moved to LA and what you were to buy an eighty\n... eighty eight eighty eight eighty nine he sold the condo for fifty thousand dollars because the\nCondo market and got over saturated and the prices went down what do we want to do have the government come in and prop up the condo owners know you bought a condo or the wrong time you lose your shirt that's just the way it is what what a bail everybody out no\nQuit screw in the market and that's basically what Trump is saying about the interest rates today\nThe market corrected them it was probably due for correction because it's been flying high for a while but they're saying that part of it was is that the fed raised interest rates well why is the fan in charge of raising interest rates why don't we let the interest rates\nBeing dictated by the market in other words have I got a bank over here and they want to charge for ... percent interest and you got another bank robbery and they say I tell you what we'll do will do three and a half percent interest in you know maybe a little reminder three and a half percent and then you get to a point where they can make money and then that's where\nThe sweet spot is only the fed coming in and I know mortgage rates and the fans they're all different and it's you know different things controlled different interest rates I get told in\nA mud\nOh here's another discussion I'm having my case too I get to kids that are\nOut of the test and uh I said\nAnd this is suddenly now till the rest of you folks to this is just an a a lesson that all uncle village learned along the way and sometimes to trial and error\nMake sure your credit is good because\nYou never know when you're going to need it because if you want to buy a house and then the interest to the difference between ... somebody's got six forty and somebody who's got eight twenty is going to be tremendous and so you'll be able to afford more of a house because the interest rate will be lower same thing when it comes to an automobile\nYou know you want six percent interest do you own twelve percent interest it depends on what your credit is and people that well that seems to be used a rich boy\nWell see that's the whole thing credit has nothing to do with wealth\nBecause I Know a lot of rich folks feel horrible course it because they overextend themselves credit is all about not biting off more than you can show paying your notes and paying them on time making sure and this is what I stress in my case uh look this is going to be very very valuable thing for you in the future [noise]\nWell now we got a lot of folks night Mexico's about the whole economy thing and they're going well there's a disproportionate number of people of color who have bad credit\nSo that's not fair well this is exactly how we got no housing market thing they said well it's not fair that they have bad credit whoever it is so we're going to give them a house even though they got bad credit will bad credit shows which are probably not going to pay it back and guess what they didn't pay it\nBack and then the whole thing came collapsing around this when you leave\nThe free market alone and don't monkey whether it works just fine\nIt's when you get in there and tried to tinker with it and try to adjust the interest rates artificially or make people do this or make people do that or build affordable housing and none of that stuff ever work so you let the market decide here's the thing if you happen to me and minority God Bless you\nI think that's great\nBut don't make that an excuse to say I don't have good credit that stupid you don't have good credit because you're not paying your bills yeah but I don't have the money won't look you know I got money but I could go out and buy some more crap and not pay that off either\nI mean you know it's like a cork in water it's all relative if you're making twenty thousand dollars a year then live on twenty thousand dollars that's all it boils down to if you're making two hundred thousand dollars a year live on two hundred thousand don't try to live on two million\nBecause if you do that you're going to ruin your credit but then don't turn around and tell me it somehow racist if you didn't pay your bills\nThis is something else and I and I'll get off on this and then we'll move on to something else and I'll probably go off on that too much\nAbout keeping places straight we had a way out of work and may\nMy boys ... day but it was a work thing\nAnd uh no I didn't pay him I have my three boys in and we works on Saturday to clean up around the cabin because\nWhat happened was and this you know and so I'm as guilty as anybody when\nWe did the construction of the cabinet I did a lot of it you know as folks but we had stuff you know building materials and things like this and just sort of just stay behind the cabin you know\nAnd then over the years they're rotting and it's it's just it looks like trash course nobody ever went back there but me but it was buying the cab and I knew was there and I said we've got to clean this up [noise]\nAnd they use the cabinet a lot and\nAnd I feed them and I pay their tuition so I figured I'm do a work day\nAnd so we rented a truck and we got all that stuff and we cleaned it all out it's a it's a matter of taking pride\nAnd another ...

Lewis a writer at the Daily Beast he's never Trump\nCan Republicans aboutcom Republican but he actually I think is no longer identify as Republican but he has to be a Republican he used to read at the

know that for a while he's on with Brooke Baldwin Mary Catherine ... friend of mine also an never Trump Republican she has not renounced the Republican name she writes the federalist she's also um they're both paid CNN contributors\nAnd they're talking about the instability that we're seeing in this country and we're talking about the violent protests that we saw in the streets after the

know what your point of view give us a couple of lines as the host knows what's gonna happen\nAnd she was ready for the mob word right she jumped right on it and then she had her written joined her she had her one rejoined her well we saw a mob in Charlottesville I mean honestly if if Matt had been a little less politically correct he could have easily immediately said well now which is that are you talking about the white nationalist racist small which was a mob\nOr the antifa mob which was also a mob I remember two mobs in Charlottesville [noise]\nUh but he did not do that and the way the media reports on these things though you know they all whenever there's a protest from the left\nMy friend Chris clients who was also a radio host national radios\nHe uh he pointed out that uh they always report these as mostly peaceful in the mostly peaceful protests it's always a a left wing protest is described as mostly peaceful and the mostly peaceful protests abducted up at a peaceful protests on the campus of UC Berkeley and the mostly peaceful protests following the inauguration of Donald Trump in the ...\nIf they're mostly peaceful that means there are a little bit violent trite\nBut I mean that just by definition if you're mostly peaceful means you're not entirely peaceful and that means you're actually a little bit non peaceful or violent so I mean maybe Matt Louis would have said well yeah we did have that poor woman lose her life down in Charlottesville but you know the protests were mostly peaceful\nThat was mostly pays for mob in Charlottesville but I don't think pro ball one would have taken it the right way because listen to how the conversation continue\nWhat we saw chance they don't know why it\nWhat about the people who were at the Supreme Court
