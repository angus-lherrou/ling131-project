race up every chance they get the white liberals particularly bring up race every chance they get [noise]\nTell me do you think the vast majority women in this country or left wing that the vast majority of the women in this country agree with them and how was it that they did they presume to speak for all the women in this country on the left how is it that Kamala Harris speaks for all the

tell ya it's frightening here on the left coast I went to a study of and that was run by the ex president that Planned Parenthood and April\nAnd San Francisco let me tell you that was a frightening

path\nBecause even though she doesn't fit into their narrative she went to like it started it's fantastic movement but what brush her aside well forget about her put her in a little jar until we need her\nAnd she gets a path and I just hope that the conservative and these Republican lawmakers wake up and get it I I don't think they have\nThat title secrets you and eight to ten million other people we have had very few conservatives running this election cycle even asking to be on my program\n\nWhat do you think of that you know I don't understand it and he learned that are running scared how

today and that's my news feed that takes the place of the wire like we used to have except for the apartment\nBy by by by by by ... you know coming across\nThe thing was loud you mean living in the new roller yes I was wondering how the newsroom people even with that thing going on in the back of my main thing is\nThat\nEveryone could grave shift and bishops handed me okay we got an active shooter in Florence South Carolina\nFive law enforcement officer shot and an active shooter incident and we are here and folks\nKnow this is now that we've got a sponsor that does this and I'm not going to mention um because you know it's outside of commercial matter and I don't want to be that guy\nBut I'm just going to tell you if if you don't if you're in charge of people uh then you need to be taking care of your people if if if if you don't have a plan and I you know I'm not telling you to call\nBut I'm certainly if you don't have a plan in place at your workplace if you're if you're the c._e._o. or you're the manager or whatever you are\nWhat happens when a shot rings out I mean we got plans for everything is a fire where we all know we do there's a fire get you know we all are we all know people do fire drill loses the school all the time there needs to be and you need to have an active shooter plan\nBecause I'm thinking right now I mean I Know what I'm going to do I already got a plan I mean I you know because you know who knows with me\n[laughter] it may be inevitable\nBut if I hear shots ring out right now I Know exactly what I'm going to do and and and you need to ask yourself same question but really it needs to be on the shoulders of the boss they need to be going okay\nHere's what we do here's one thing I learned at new sponsored by went to they had a big meat up\nThe other night with a bunch of our listeners and one of the things they said and and and this is something I hadn't thought of to do you know where you are in the building are you on the north side of the south side are you on the east or west side northeast side\nDo you know where you are because it was shot brings out and you need to call nine one one they're going to ask you where you are in the building\nAnd you're going to go well I'm over by the window I mean you know I'm a mother copier I'm I'm In my office I mean ... you don't know you need to be able to tell the police what part of the building you're in when you're calling\nThis is one of those important things or more importantly what part of the building is a shooter in so you need to know the lay out of your building right you need to know if I'm sitting here on the north\nSide and that obviously way over there is just outside the east and west\nSo that if a if you hear an active shooter in your building say there's an active shooter on the southwest corner that's where I think they are so today that gives them a lot of information before they come to the place otherwise as we saw\nAnd they were showing videos of this to a in Vegas you know the police got there but they were at the opposite end of where the guy was and so you know the seconds matter and I'm Talking about you know this damage is done\nSometimes in Fifteen twenty seconds when this thing and there's really nothing you know there's not all of the police police can do about that\nBut if the guys running around and you hear in shots in the building you need to be able to say hey he went to the south side of the building I heard him running down the hall towards the north side of the building that when the police when they get there they know about or they have a good idea of where this maniac is but there are a lot of things like that you need to know\nI'm just wondering if you if you're out there and you're over folks and someone like this does happen and you didn't plan for what are you going to say sorry\nI mean we've had enough of these going on we got one in Florence South Carolina there will be following the rest of the afternoon\nWhat it was you know who knows you know what would what the protocol was if there was a protocol usually the common denominator is it's a gun free zone I don't want to jump to conclusions on this one in Florence but we'll see\nBut if you whatever it is maniacs get into the building\nAnd maniac starts shooting so what are you going to do you need to have a personal plan for what you yourself are going to do for instance if you carry a gun then you need to have a plan of what you're going to do with that gun if you don't you need to get the hell out if you can and that's the most important thing people linger around and get shot\nYou know they're curious to see coming down the hallway don't worry about to be coming at all what you do hear shooting in that direction you're going in that direction and you're getting the heck out and when you leave the building ... no one in a straight line don't give them a chance to get a bead on you\nGet out and cut to the right cut the lap and get away\n[noise] I'm just telling me this is happening far too often for us not to take all shows\nUp at five year old has found has gotten to know about it\nI heard on the news about fourteen year old girl who was bullied on line for like a year she couldn't take it she got her dad come from and I\nRemember coming from a guy from\nKevin in the home she killed herself\nYou own if you have a full time responsibility you weren't using this\nIssue it can get into the hands of curious children troubled teenagers or anyone else who might misuse in\nYour

the balance the right to ...\nTo ... the FBI is expected to send its findings investigation into sexual assault allegations against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh to Capitol Hill seal three moderate Republicans who could be pivotal in determining whether the Senate confirmed Kavanaugh\nGuess you could maybe use by ... by two points the libertarian Lucy Brenton is taking six points and you can imagine she's probably taking away I Would say I don't know what a libertarian take more away from the Republicans I Would think so when I don't know but if you know\nWho knows what it would be if she were in the race but anyway it's forty three forty one eight percent are undecided but\nThat's a reversal from early September when the Republican had a to point edge or forty five forty three will fill where's the good news well the Missouri Senate races all tied up this is going to Fox News now we go to the other poll Moses scouts and Missouri\nThey hand Claire McCaskill down by two points this has it all tied up at forty three of peace with Claire McCaskill and Republican challenger Josh Josh Hawley\nWhile the other candidates growing or eight percent and six percent are undecided\nThree weeks ago Claire McCaskill was up by three points now they say it's tied and of course you're going pulled a poll this\nYou know apples apples you're comparing another Fox News poll with this Fox News poll and I think that's probably at least the way this is going to say well that's a fair way to do it [noise] suburban women are more likely to back McCaskill ... plus Fifteen points voters under the age of forty five\nPlus six the gender gap is somewhat diminishes McCaskill's advantage among white among women than that for pulling can you imagine that she's a woman she's innocent and she's an incumbent she's only up women plus for that's down from nine points\nLast month so she's um she's losing ground with women only has the edge among men plus five in rural voters plus twenty two are they taking a picture Jeremy okay that's awesome turn all the lights on in North Dakota\nDemocrat Senator Heidi Heitkamp\nIs one of the most vulnerable Senate Democrats this year long with Missouri Senator Claire McCaskill and Indiana Senator Joe Donnelly survey shows survey shows hike camp may be the most difficult position the Republican challenger North Dakota\nKevin Cramer now leans by twelve points [noise] last month he was up by for now the Republican and in in a North Dakota's up by twelve points\nIn Tennessee and this is a I mean you know I'm just giving you I'm giving you the news folks\nMarsha Blackburn is ahead of Phil Bredesen forty eight to forty three five points forty to forty three\nBlack burn spy advantages inside the polls margin of error they say last month she had a three point edge over bred this and so she seems to be widening that a little bit and then of course competing for the seat or being vacated by retiring\nRepublican Senator Bob Corker a welcome back to them is a bow\nWomen go for breakfast and plus five men or ... black burn by Seventeen what\nFolks\nI Can't believe this wherever women not going for a woman this is a woman who wants to be in the U.S sending you women don't want you would rather have a an old white guy\nI Can't believe you all that stride she's a Republican so she doesn't count she's like an old white guy to these folks you know doesn't matter if she's a Republican woman and then we're not for women's rights and and giving women power\nAnd you you are you white folks the white men out there to you've had too much power you you've got you've got\nPrivileged power power privilege and all that stuff and he just shut up unless you're Marsha Blackburn who showed up to\nWhat if you're a liberal woman we need to hear you but if you're if you're not we don't need to hear from you\nAnd the governor's races in the Arizona governor's race Republican incumbent dug deep sea lanes fifty five to thirty seven percent or a Democrat David Garcia\nAnd Tennessee voters are backing ... fifty three percent over Carl Marx dean thirty six percent of Seventeen point the advantages of building has had a debate\nLast night to fourteen percent of those backing Brett is and and the Senate race have defected to support lean the Republican for governor so you actually got Democrats that are coming over in voting for Billie\nFox News poll is conducted among the girls don't even remember assess the oldest some other things and oh yeah\nOh yeah that's what I Want to look at it was um where was that they had Trump's popularity and some of these states which I thought was interesting in for some ... says it's not showing how long ago saying\nHere's Trump's new job approval so this will give you an indication of how things might go in Arizona\nRight now his job approval is fifty one percent forty seven percent disapprove that's Arizona in Indiana fifty two percent approve forty six percent disapprove\nIn Missouri fifty four percent approve forty five percent disapprove citizen can only help the Republicans in those states have been Trump keeps coming back because he's above\nFifty percent and every one of these states\nAnd North Dakota sixty four percent approve of a Trump thirty five percent disapprove and in Tennessee sixty percent approve of Trump's performance thirty nine percent disapprove [noise] the habit folks so if it's\nYou know I'm not saying that it's it's it's going to be a just a wonderful day for the Republicans but some of these things\nI think the most troubling to me from from my standpoint and has got to be Indiana because not only is still topping the challenger by fifty three forty free to forty one now that's not that much I mean he was a bad but he was up by a\nMore than ... was a triple a K yeah there's a Republican was up that's what was troubling me\nThe Republican wrong was up forty five forty three now but flipped now Donnelly the Democrat is a forty three forty one so that's the one Indiana I Would think with my parents being vice president\nAnd what I say Indiana was as far as Trump's approval is concerned about tell me they had been [noise] they don't ... yeah they do at fifty two percent approval for gr for Trump so you were saying they may be able to pull but I'm just saying in any of these states where\nDonald Trump was above water and the Republicans certainly has a chance and it would indicate that Trump needs to become an ... has been a little bit more what she's doing now I didn't quite understand why he was in Mississippi last night\nI think men that may be for some house seats or whatever so you know he's helping those folks and you're not far from me I was ... going what the hell are you doing in
