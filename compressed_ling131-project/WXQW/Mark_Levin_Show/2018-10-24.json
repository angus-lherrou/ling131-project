on the left doing it because the momentum was going with Republicans and then when I heard what you said about the bond expert describing that these people were pretty much mailing the equivalent of a Warner Brothers Wylie coyote\nBig black bomb fuel sticking out of it and everything but ... you know exactly\nExactly and and the fact that\nYou know the Clintons in Obama the secret service detail nothing's going to get to them so I don't know I I honestly believe I mean like you said it could be some right wing lack of but I Am leaning real heavy this was the left the way trying to get a little charge right before the election\nThat's the first thing to me too and then when you see this you know when you see this bomb experts seeing all this I mean he says is none of it makes sense and who who stands to benefit from this and obviously you know who that is they're already gonna hashtags it'd be interesting to see when that hashtags started wouldn't it ... bomber\nIt probably started sometime last night before they even knew about some of these things\nHappened right after the Trump rally where they were rolling out the jobs versus mobs a science and all of a sudden we get this\nYeah it's interesting I mean it it does seem rather coincidental\nIt sure does I think a lot I think you appreciate the phone call if you didn't hear that then we everything we re tweeted that the guy didn't ... there's\nNot a website we can link to on this but since he's brought it up\nIf I have it again that I you know I'll I'll go through this and this is Tom ... our I don't know Tom Sawyer is a ... hour\nIs president founder of MacArthur group he's the navy he owed ... veteran and he's a bomb squad guy\nAnd he's been tweeting all day about this and it's interesting what he has to say about it as a matter of fact when me a ... and bring this up for you to a few observations from former\nBomb disposal officer I eat me\nOne the proper pipe bombs don't have wires connected to both ends that's dumb to you can find time or a slasher remote control receivers way smaller\nThan whatever that white boxes a proper timer\nWould best be stored inside the pie making it fully encapsulated\nThat thing is just silly looking number three hoax devices are far more common than real wins in which case we should ask ourselves what the motives of the bomber are and who benefits go ahead think deeply and critically and then number for the bottom line\nWhoever may bad wanted it to be painfully obvious anyone and everyone that it's a bomb this is nearly the same as a bundle of road flares wrapped together with an old time he alarm clock ticking away in other words this was not meant to go off\nThis was meant to send a message that this is a mom\nAnd I would be really curious to see if there's anything in there that could have gone off because all we've seen is the outside now on and you're not going back and check my Twitter feed on that too to see the latest in the greatest from what I was going on out there but it's going to be interesting to see one would think\nIf it's just a bunch if it's a pipe and a bunch of wires\nSome device it may be very hard to track what would make it easier to track and again I Know bomb disposal expert but\nJust from reading about this kind of stuff it's the ... the bomb ingredients themselves what makes it go boom and that kind of stuff whether it's safe for or gunpowder or whatever that's the that's the easier stuff to track\nTo track wires I mean good grief you could have gotten into the back of a out of the back of an old TV you know if this thing was if these pipe bombs were just meant the looked like bombs and scare folks and the send them to Obama and Clinton and George Soros and get the\nSome left all ginned up thinking that the right wing coming up to kill everybody was leaving the leftist movement\nOr you could put ... you could put wires from all sorts of pipes that you can find on the side of the road stuff it with or who knows what have some wires coming out of it\nAnd you know there's your so called bomb I'll be curious to hear what the\nExperts in the FBI and the rest have to say about what was in it as an I. E. could this thing actually of going off was the gunpowder and so I well there is some sort of explosive inside of nine months we find this out\nI think it would be a pretty simple thing for them when a simple but it'll be easier than just wires and the pipe it'll be easier for them to find out where this thing came from who may have manufactured now what's gonna happen if we find out there to scenarios\nBut I mean really only two scenarios I I think\nThat this is some crazed Trump supporter who's either trying to scare these folks are trying to blow them up\nAnd we need to figure out the ... you know who that person is what's gonna happen if it's the opposite\nWater but to some cranes left this lunatic\nThis trying to garner sympathy for the left by putting these bombs together and leaving them at the Mayo facilities or wherever the one at CNN was actually delivered by courier that looks like that would be the easiest thing to track you got cameras of the guy I assume a guy maybe girl don't\nCommunist sexist\nDelivering this device is this the person who put it together or does this guy get it from somebody who is it because we're told it's not UPS has not FedEx is not the post office so who's the courier quote unquote is it a legitimate courier service if somebody went\nAnd uh and signed up dropped off a package and then paint forwards\nOr is it just some guy on the street and this guy hired to go take this over to CNN or you could you know pretty much follow this guy back to whoever drug role as he doesn't know what I'm saying is there's so many unknowns and way too early\nTo be hashed hanging mango bomber you know we didn't have a liberal shooter passion and liberal shooter after the Steve ... shooting midway matter of fact in the mainstream media but the level best to downplay any of the political motivation and we knew where the political motivation was there was a craze liberal\nBut went up there trying to gun down Republicans and they got one and fortunately he didn't kill him but you'll notice it in the days weeks and months after that the mainstream media CNN MSNBC all the all the rest of 'em but Fox were not even mentioning this guy was a liberal\nRand Paul\nMentioned just a week or so ago why didn't the mainstream media tell what I told them that this guy was screaming out of this is for health care or whatever was he was saying\nThey ignored that too and Rand Paul says I sold every media outlet to want to hear it and they never put it on the air that's going above and beyond that do to to to to conceal Mike in Alabama you're up next to Mike what's up\nTill I'm you know back and prior to or to what it was trying to gain power skim the chancellor he set fire to the white\nBuilding right exactly the kind of thing that and he always blame it on the comedies\nAnd by well pointed out in the first one that that try\nThey weren't they weren't capable of doing it that they are stupid in history that they wouldn't take is one out and besides what I Know about this particular bomb us why worried about it it was black\nPowder and there's no way to detonate it in of all these bombs that one went off at any time\nThat was my point LA and good grief I mean how many ... we had like six of these things are so and not one on one off what the deal with that\nNow I'll bet you can't always do something like that to draw attention away from the care of an issue and stuff because that was back firing on him and now now they do this in order to try to garner step even sympathy for George Soros\nSays can you imagine

to ask them about the stressors of college life classes significant others funds and the state of politics\nIn times past we have assumed that politics have little to do with our personal lives however college health care providers are finding that many students are in a significant amount of distress regarding the twenty sixteen presidential election\nAnd related event yeah two years later\nThere's widespread discontent with both candidates the unincorporated election outcome and heightened inner group conflict may have heightened emotional distress following the election this according to a study from San Francisco State University\nSubsequently the researchers sought to study the perceived impact of the twenty sixteen electric on close relationships\nThe prevalence of electric related distress symptoms and the demographics I e race gender religion or those who reported more symptoms so this study looked at seven hundred and sixty nine college students enrolled in an introductory psychology course\nAnd have them fill out the questioning or two to three months following the presidential election in November of twenty six team\nThen the question here was validated by a violent validated psychological to use to evaluate the self reported stress related symptoms following the event and some of the symptoms to ask about we're avoidance and intrusions associated with a stressor\nSo easily found\nThe overall result was at twenty five percent of students question reported clinically significant stress symptoms related to the election\nYou need to get a life ... twenty five percent a quarter of the students had clinically significant stress symptoms after Trump won\nThis means that these students should talk to their doctors about their symptoms

James Woods yeah I mean we we may have a presidential ticket right there is any way the sheriff's on the line to chat with us about the caravan and other things in the news share of how are you\nGoing to blow things for you guys for them to go to a load of your listeners\nDo good to talk to you know let me ask you a question for we're getting this care but in saying [noise]\nAs a law enforcement guy and the ... the suspicious packages when the bombs that\nShowed up what's your take on this is\nNot enough information to really make an analysis a law enforcement the FBI and others are still assessing gathering evidence trace evidence will identify who the perpetrator of this thing as\nWell that one's going to ask you this we're going to find out who it is I mean as as much evidence is left around the mound found that find out who this person is run\nSure the only thing I could say right now about who might be some coke\nNo doubt about that in some crazy person whether they're on the rider on the left remains to be seen by the Twitter folks I'm sure you've seen already the hashtags leading to may ... bombers so they're already jumping to conclusions there's gotta be some right wing crazy person who was inspired by the angry rhetoric of Donald Trump\nAnd went on the side of the realm of possibility but I highly doubt that I wouldn't put my money on that of course Philips going to seize on it\nThey said nothing about the political violence a that was spun exhibited um some members and and and movements so their side or they stood their silence and all of a sudden they see they see this opportunity a bunch of opportunities but who knows in the end of may be some\nBuddy underway but it may be some looney lefty too and if it is you know these are these individuals will be cruel\nYeah if it's somebody on the level never hear about it again that them and they'll just move on and that was the year was ... I mean you know this was obviously a left wing nod\nWho shot Steve ... and the media folks never never talked\nAbout the rhetoric of Maxine Waters or main see below sea or anybody else they just said oh well this is just some loan crazy guy has nothing to do with politics and that everything to do with politics I'm not saying that they should stop voicing their opinion if you're a Nancy Pelosi are mad magazine or any of the rest of them\nBut uh you know what's good for the goose is good for the gander if they're going to prematurely call this the magnet bomber then why didn't they call that the man Maxine shooter\n[laughter] you know this is kind of stuff that goes on especially in public and cyclists close we are to the midterms\nAre the the weather gets more inflamed rhetoric gets more irresponsible\nYou know people like Maxine Waters Nancy Pelosi Clinton you know there are positions of responsibility and I'm a huge platform and they have to be responsible and and and words matter for them to put a dog whistle took it in their faces and no civility until we went elections\nHighly irresponsible and it said sort of rhetoric for people on their side who can't process said like everybody knows about you and I should say we hear that we don't think that's a call\nTo arms but many other there are people who can't thinking process or they don't see if they were they see this call to arms and they act on it looking at the top one Democrat leader has condemned the antics of ... or any of these other uh crazies\nThat uh you know carry out the political violence in the ... to me when you don't condemn it\nLike the ... test approval for their behavior\nNo law is even worse than that and there was a couple of years ago CNN had this headline ...\nThinks peace through violence

how are you\nA pretty good how are you doing to choke Stu how are you\nI'm I'm pretty good hope you are too I'm super you sound pretty good you know I Wish tickled if that's\nThe right word but I Wish I Wish\nPushed to hear you use the term a sexual minorities ... even though you're recording shopping but I I didn't know we can get away with that picture permanent I've used for years and I've also used the term sexual missteps I Wonder if ah if I could still use\nThat they probably don't know [laughter] I don't mind doing\nIt seems entirely appropriate I mean it pretty much wraps up a good description don't you think\nWhat do you look at selling yesterday we heard this\nI saw a lady with a bumper sticker on a truck and she said a proud mom of a gay student and I'm going well you know I mean I don't know what's to be proud about it I mean they're not that you should be ashamed I'm just saying what I put proud band of a straight a student on my on my car\nI just don't you know see that's that's the kind of mentality I don't understand so we're supposed to be proud of your love your sexual orientation I mean why are we proud of that and it's like you know I'm proud to be black which can't be proud to be white well just you know these are not things you're supposed to be proud of you just are\nBoy I'd be proud of being a deviant\nWell yeah yeah I Am\nAlso when you were talking about the uh the guy who broke off a date because you know want to know who to who are\nReally all your\nTires to do that you know back in the days I mean I'm old too old for this now but when I used to do computer dating and I had a profile posted a my profile shed um if you are a a liberal liberal progressive Democrat any of those uh you can stop breathing right now\nBecause um I don't want any part of this not\nNo yeah I really don't but the funny thing is that I'm a no less a percentage then she'd going Modi who is one of my heroes or um he once told me personally said don't ever let a political ah matters stand in the way of a sexual encounter\n[laughter] [laughter]\nSo energy use or more on the terminal yet um but\nThat was that was his restaurant you but you know I I just can't um I just can't do it I I just want um you know I Can't believe what someone whose politics I have no respect for\nSo stew you don't do the other way huh is that what it is better than the other\nTeams you know the funny thing is do see I'm a I'm a single guy I've never been married uh haven't\nHad imagine that the romance\nOf my life and in many years and um you know show on paper that's kind of suspected and I am I'm thinking about\nAre waging a when I have to have my epitaph written for certain you know old girlfriends to be called on to testify that um you know despite my having never married or you know any of that that I really am still work you know red bud Shaw\nWhile I Would just have this and you will lose to just put this on your tombstone I'm not gay honestly\nYeah in the in my neighborhood in New York you know if somebody called you that it was before we even have the term gay but um you know if you if you were accused of anything like that we used\nTo say hey your mom or your sister around and I'll show you how\nOh yeah that's right yeah well you can't do that I enjoy\nFashion George ... standard that watch you know and the but there is you know not that there's anything wrong with that episode\nRequests script showed me you know he said that to come on do you want to have sex right now come on sex right now\nJust proves that well maybe that's maybe that's a big line is when you're out you know somewhere and you say hey you think you'll ... you'll have sex right now maybe that are well and\nYou know and and the funny thing is if you're if you're the guy you can get away with that just like you know Trump's comment about grabbing women you know that was a comment about the women that if you're the right guy you don't even have to pretend to be a gentleman\nThat is right now and what that was too was that was the truth I mean he was telling the truth now it was not meant for public consumption that was crude but it was something that he said to Billy Bush said he never expected with anybody else is going to hear it and you know guys tend to talk a little rough\nWhen they were just talking amongst guys and people to turn this into something like oh you did you see the guy yesterday that was totally grow the woman on the airline and civil Trump says you've written by the private bar come all play yeah that that's a I live out there trying to get away with it\nBut Trump's comedy actually said more about women than it set about Trump\nThat's exactly look not only women but gold digging women in Hollywood and that's what he's talking about can you imagine you're worth five billion dollars that many women are throwing themselves that you and he says you you know they let you and that was the\nThat was a key part of that whole thing they let you grab them ... Heather you're up next Heather how are you\nOh I'm fine thank you um I just wanted\nTo say about that may be that that guy from the outside and honestly what struck me now why plan and then why am I going to be respectable abortion clinic or down there than it whining they're cleaning compassionate math and\nYou know in contrast to die off\nA lot just had the most profound effect on me I don't want to spoil it for anybody to have family that that that was a powerful\nMan the whole the whole thing was power foreigners\nOr if you're familiar with um if you watch the movie there is a scene in there where they show a picture to the jury now you've never seen the picture again this is not a gross movies rated PG Thirteen\nBut they show a movie or a picture in the movie to the jurors and ... said those reactions were real because they had never seen the picture before and we wanted\nTo get them on film their first honest reaction so what you're seeing is not acting that actually reacting to the real pictures of it\nThere's something in the pictures you can't\nHere I think I\nRead in the world or anything\nLike a lot of our to\nCreate a new thing\nMouth and publications wanting labor carbon dioxide to\nImagine\nWhat I live in I\nThey call it or something\nWe call it like\n\nHe's your news source for news and information six sixty when you were executed when you better hope Moby\nI get death threats\nRush gets death threats Hannity gets death threats but I Know I get death threats\nIt's not fun\nIt's not fun and you worry about your family you're worried about you you look over your shoulder from time to time it's not 'cause you're paranoid she had to be a little bit more careful\nAbout one in ... out there in ... filled with violence it's the most violent organization I'm aware of in politics today it was downplayed by most of the media downplay same what black lives matter downplayed\nAnd I'm not saying this is exclusive to the left\n\nNot saying it's such closer to the left at all we want to know who did this as soon as possible\nAnd I believe the FBI we'll figure this out\nBecause nothing exploded so they have these uh these packages and these devices are in their ah original form\n\nWhich will make it much easier for them to track a download they'll get the guy or gal the guys are ...\nAt least I Hope so I think so based on my past experience with the department of justice they have a ton of evidence now\nAnd they're going to be able to use different methods of tracking this down\n\nAnd they begin to pull strings and then the strings begin to pull the fabric the fabric begins to unravel and then the\nTable to track people down but they need to find this person or these people because they may do it again they may do more of it that's all we know we don't know their motives\nWe don't know their motives well we know the motive uh obviously is the threatened if not harm if not killed the people they targeted\n\nBut there's a lot of speculation out there now why\nWhy can't people just white particularly in the media\n\nNow you can see that Christian building that somehow this is Donald Trump's fault because the way he goes and speaks at rallies and the language he uses about this that or the other I Am so sick of this you have no idea the president of the United states without question faces death threats all the time\nIs it because what the Democrats say about him as a because what Joe Scarborough says about him or Don Lemon says about hammer Steve ... says about him\n\nThe other day the president center rallies in a rally I think it was used in a says he's at national less well I'm not a nationalist but not for the reasons the Democrats on the left say he's a nationalist now we know what he means America First and so forth\n\nAnd they try anti attend Nazi as of ... part the style of these this is in the media\n\nNational socialist party notice when people proclaim if their socialist they don't try to tie them to the Nazis it is nationalist socialist right\nThey didn't say that about Bernie Sanders hey he's using Nazi language he's using style and his language no of course not\nMost of the\nMedia in this country they revealed themselves so for them now the sit back\nFor the most radical among them on cable TV on MSNBC and CNN for the most radical among them on the today show good morning America for the most radical among them now point a finger at Trump absolutely nothing to do it this is really just further\nEvidence of how outrageous they are\n\nThe person or people who are responsible for this are responsible for this\n\nAre responsible for this\nDo you think the media in this country over the last two years have been responsible do you think the media in this country over the last two years have been measured\nYou'd think the media in this country many in the media in this\nCountry cross the line with their references to Hitler Stalin and racism and all the rest of it\n\nDo you think Joe Scarborough was cross the line or make emergency or Don Lemon are Chris Cuomo on the list goes on and on do you think they cross the line with their heated rhetoric what their point of the language\nAnd now\nThey're going to tell you shoot calmed down stop the rhetoric\nThe heated attacks we must bring it down it's too much having stoking the flames now they're the firefighters\nAnd same with ... the things that she has said and same with Schumer the things that he has said and the things that they did to a guy like Kavanaugh guy like Kavanaugh\nTo create the tensions in the
