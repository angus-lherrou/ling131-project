on the mark of in Chauvin burgers and filling in the Knight hello\nAnd thank you so much and I get an excellent trapped on and mark thank you I appreciate that\nThank you um have two comments one I Want to let you know first of all that I suffer from depression and I had a suicide attempt the number of years ago I Am doing somewhat better but I'm a couple of years ago I realized that I was probably living a little bit ahead of my time and that society was going in this direction as a whole\nUm even though I had depression I didn't have any kind of psychosis or thought disturbances but when I started winning and mental health housing and I spoke out about for many of you see that we're going on\nAnd from ... you know the rules and what have you all the sudden I seem to have like thought disturbances although no one could that explain to me what it was prior to that no one ever thought it had anything but you know mental illness Trump's depression and uh then they made up story that I was violent and I got kicked out of the two places\nUp to the age of forty four years old I never had any kind of a history of anything on there and the homeless twice I've lived in my car but it's also suicide prevention mine\nAnd I think by making it sound is Kanye West central kind of mental illness but and he got it but it's not even the issue because as you said they had nothing to say that about him before he spoke out about Bush\n[noise] it makes it very difficult I think for young men in particular\nWasn't it wasn't that day was it yesterday if I'm not mistaken mental health awareness day\nIt's a whole month you know how it is unfortunately a lot of there's a month to everything now there let's be honest you know but it's supposed to be\nTechnically we're just in just that people know that we were only make it\nClear what it yesterday was world mental health day two thousand Eighteen World Health or a world mental health day uh eight states on October the tent that's the reason I say that says where's the compassion and and I say that first of all thank you for your sharing your story and I'm so\nThankful that you were unsuccessful in your attempt to take your wife or I ... my best friend in college um took his own life and it is something that sticks with me and and all of our close friend group ever since then I have\nGreat compassion for\nThose that suffer with mental health and it's something that we shouldn't make fun of but to to score political points with Kanye West\nHas left his doing saying you know clearly in again they say that the president's taking advantage of a man who clearly has mental health issues as a token or a black man uh and and there and he's taking advantage of using him by putting them out there today no one said any of that\nWhen Kanye West came out and said George Bush doesn't like black people\nBecause it was a narrative they wanted to be out there it was the narrative that they want it they they they were OK with that narrative then you are on the mark of an show Ben for some reason I go ahead\nThen stole my thunder but there are a President Bush hates black people man I was like I was all part of the hit that um hey check this out so now Russia walkers going to be the Lex token negro because he says the limit ...\nUm I think it's horrible what is left these are doing but that's a whole other thing supposed to talk about or colder Eric Holder\nNot only here my will first she's the only attorney general to be a\nContempt of Congress but that's a whole nother issue\nWhen the Obama's going to really you when you know you really gone too far in show probably grabbed her by the errors and said you can't do this for quite yet we're not there yet um\nPut him Hillary Clinton Maxine Waters are Democrats our base that's all they do their inciting violence and then they say it in the in the means of\nCow and then and then they act like they get they get all you know their paintings in a wide when they when you say they're acting like a mob\nMentality when you have people screaming and beating on the doors the Supreme Court because they didn't get their way that's that's a mob mentality when you surround a senator or like Ted Cruz at dinner a that's a mob mentality when you go in and you can you do these eat in and sit ins and screaming in the hallways and you get famous people to show up and then they're asking\nDo you want to get arrested and you say yes that's a mob mentality\nCan deal with it I mean if you want to talk about being honest and be honest with it yes we are acting like a bunch of children were acting like a mob yes we're out here to seek out and destroy people when we think about this a district mob mentality you have to have\nTo ... to ... to first of all\nYou have a woman that doesn't and Mrs Ford didn't want her name to come out and you do it anyway so you say we don't care about you were going to use a canary we're going to force you to defend your story about sexual assault so hopefully we can find others it will say the same thing about Brett Kavanaugh\nAnd then what we're going to do is we're going to find people to say well you had sex we got a boat in the eighties well way we've got to recant destroying their mind never happened while he he he actually in high school\nWas was every weekend making parties for gang rapes and gang banging and enjoying trains on a whim and no one else to say and shit but we got a porn star lawyer nab analogy that will that will act like it's a legitimate animal throw it on the news to try to find other women out there\nThat this is what I mean this is the left this is what they're doing right now this is the normal for them and the reason why they're doing this as I go back to when I said earlier\nThan there is not a single issue that Democrats can actually run on right now except for personal hate\nAnd and to turn people into villains so that you hate them\nThat's the only way you can't scare people on the economy you can't scare people on the war in Iraq and Afghanistan you can scare people on on health care because you you are the ones that we create the health care disaster\nYou can scare people on Social Security Medicare Medicaid so the only thing left for you to do right now is to say this guy's a racist and you don't want to raise it to me in the White House Kanye West is mentally ill so you shouldn't listen to him if you're a black person\nYeah I mean it's terrible it they they really have no platform although they also have to take away the tax because we have to take away your problems away um we also got to have open borders and\nI'm abolish ice high crime I mean that's what they have to stand on you know what I'm thinking about the mob mentality I challenge any of these people to walk down I'm downtown Portland or a I've got friends that are such as you go to parks down there and it's nothing but a answer for and they will beat the living heck out of\nYou you will get the antifa protesters this week they were directing traffic and yelling at white people is that none of my mentality is the Democratic party not endorse antifa they do because the Democratic party not endorse black lives matter saying after the police and what do we want dead cops and when we want him now that's a mob mentality\nEverybody knows that it's a

some of these dictatorships or kingdoms you know like Kuwait Saudi Arabia and some of these other ones ...\nWell you know are the people upset about it\nBecause farming from us to assume that everybody wants to live in a republic like we do so I can see both sides of this\nBut will this not open our eyes to the fact that most of the hijackers on nine eleven were Saudis alone I don't know how that happens without the Saudi Government being involved in it\nAnd of course we've heard the stories about the Saudi royal family they some of them that we're here in the United states that were given safe passage by the Bush administration right after nine eleven\nAnd some right before it so I mean I don't want to end of the conspiracy theories but Saudi Arabia has not been a good actor and they're also part of OPEC for crying out loud listen jerk and are chain on the gas prices I don't know why we\nCount town to these folks but apparently this may be the end of that if Trump as a thing to say about it so we'll see how it ends up but it takes killing a Washington Post columnist\nSo we don't want to look into the fact that Saudi may have been the Saudis may have been behind nine eleven I'm not diminishing don't get me wrong I'm not diminishing the brutal murder of a columnist for the Washington Post but it seems rather\nSelf serving on the part of the media that this is what gets them upset and not the fact that most of the hijackers on nine eleven were Saudis and there's good evidence of the Saudi Government knew about it\nBut no you kill one of the journalist oh my gosh can we held a pay\nAgain I'm not ... that I'm just saying\nYou got a wave is all I think that the nine eleven hijackers being ... was a lot bigger story than a columnist from the Washington Post but this is going to be what separates ties between the United states and Saudi Arabia not the fact that they may have been involved in killing three thousand people on nine eleven\nBut I'm just saying

was out when I first moved here ... to Nashville that's why I Am\nSo special ... shot and then we'll promote it on the radio and people do it I'll put a link to that Phil Valentine dot com and we'll get some business she too good just to be staying at home ... wasting our time yeah she is well this is something that I talk about all the time with folks and\nYou know I have managed to swindle my way through this life on mediocre talent\nAnd [laughter] that's precisely why are your brother and it's just it's\nYou know I have made it through on goal you know I have no shortage of goal\nAnd something else as I have no shortage of a I guess galling gumption are very similar but I don't mind failing and it doesn't faze me one Mitt when somebody says oh you suck you know go okay well I'll come back and show you so\nAh what I what I lack talent I make up and and goal but she's got talent and no goal\nWas she needs to have some golf so she needs if she's not going to have a goal and this is a problem with some artist out there\nThey need something that's why you have those sleazy agents you know that's right [laughter] that sort of like a man 'cause they don't care they'll pass through the hell out of everybody and they don't have any friends anyway so you know they just go in and day to day but they got money you know money\nAnd they passed the heck out of everybody and get him to come you know to to the ...\nWhether it's to our show or whether it's a a show or whatever the\nCase may be and they just make a dent in general nuisance of themselves but they uh they get the artist expose the naturally so that's their talent you know their talent is mugging the hell out of you and so you you need somebody like man that or a and then once you do what we might even get any may pay\nAnd they will be the goal issue and then she'll run off with that guy and then I end up knowing my history [laughter] well yeah you didn't have a history I'd say\nNow all the big stuff folks we got several crave a left wing people out there that are attacking and they're mostly pro life activist or near several stories you can check by the way the guy who kicked the pro life woman\nYou remember when we had that and then we showed the video that guy all that just made my blood boil I wanted somebody to hold and I wanted to hold him down and beat the crap out of him but he's been arrested and he struck by the way that wasn't the first time he's vandalized stuff and they got him doing it on several occasions\nSo he may be going to jail for a while I Hope so but we also have this thing with the Turks saying that the Saudis killed his Washington Post columnist\nAnd I'm sitting there looking at a National Review story today the desert kingdom keeps turning the United states government and the wires talking about the ... mall cash Yogi\nA well known Saudi political activist and journalist last week he went into the Saudi conflict in in its than bullets in\nTurkey to get a document for an upcoming marriage\nAnd then he disappeared Turkish authorities are searching for the Saudi hit squad they believe murdered him and then dismembered him whatever merit day is a work they say it's now becoming another special moment and the very special relationship between the United states and Saudi Arabia\nWe can add it to the other special moments where the president ... golden orbit where America's ... columnists praised Mohammed bin Solomon as a great reformer and when the U.S assisted the Saudis in creating the worst cholera outbreak in modern times\nWhen asked whether he might retaliate and stop a hundred and ten billion dollar arms deal with the kingdom President Trump says I don't like stopping massive amounts of money that's being poured into our country why the jobs\nBut now Trump is saying today he's taking a serious look at this he says\nWe may have to rethink our relationship with these people they say the truth is that Trump is doing the selling job on himself\nThe hundred and ten billion dollar figure is more like a menu of deals the offer the Saudis not a done deal the salaries of purchase a terminal high altitude area defense anti ballistic missile system\nFor about Fifteen billion that's be and the state department has announced four billion dollars another completed and approved arms sales\nTo Saudi didn't complete every\nArms deal the President Obama offered them either one can understand that the practice of geopolitics means that you don't always get to choose your allies\nAnd a superpower cannot conduct business my beaming only with nations like Switzerland and Lichtenstein\nSo we're going to have to deal with some bad actors out there\nAnd they of course the the point is made that when you deal with some of these folks then you have more chance to influence them I think a lot of times that's a cop out it depends on what they're doing for instance I mean we have no business dealing with China no business whatsoever but of course\nThe market is so huge that we can't ignore it and we want to ignore it\nSo we're going to be with a shame because of the money so it's not about doing the right thing\nIt's about doing the prudent thing and the same thing happens with Saudi Arabia now I don't believe that they mentioned in the speech from National Review it's called Saudi Arabia is still a lousy friend\nI don't think they mentioned the fact that the almost all of the hijackers on nine eleven were Saudis\nAround April Hi today low eighties tomorrow\nIn mid eighties on Sunday with cool

his life and this guy was out the door for me as I was coming in and I thought to myself well you know that kind of looks like he's really got together and he looks from here\nAnd saw my mother or whatever you want it out\nAnd then sit up get solved that are like that every body jail as I said no way that awful failed\nSo I held the door for you here it is a bad day and that's why like fail males that no woman said you don't have an awful failed said yes I Do know that well I'm Glad to hear that\nYeah that I can see why that Harward may pay for jail or so\nIt keeps you yeah that's why you know I got\nTo make people jealous oh\nYeah well one one other thing that I won't say there was some Russian and fall at some of the election everybody was Russian over to the polls to vote for Trump\n[laughter] I don't know why they didn't think of that before that must have been it huh\nWell God Bless you all and the ... of the more\nI appreciated the most the breach in very much so I held the door for him\nSomewhere and want a guy you know on the limerick seemed like a ... I remember some delivery person I held the door for the other day\n[laughter] I don't remember where it was I just do so much good work for the community so hold doors you know why hold doors should remember\nA I'm not going to bust amount of Airbus but one of the talk show hosts here his wife\nShowed up and I held the door open for ... you just walk right and there was that or you know I Know that he will do that some members said hell when they're used to it and when they ... yeah well I mean I didn't even expect to thank you I just thought hey how you doing\nWhat was funny was she then she turned around and and flipped him a quarter so I'm [laughter] even do that that was another one of the word that you know and then she says look and you bring my car around [laughter] and uh\nWell also one of the talk show host here we were doing some kind of a benefit and I went out to relieve him and he didn't recognize me until I was one of the listener\nSo do so I thought well maybe you know to do another hour and he was relieving I don't even want to go to a\nWhen a child play to block the skills to the future engineer rocket scientists contractor an architect of developing a child on the playground is practicing the hill to the teacher athlete when a child creates art the skills that the teacher illustrator author and artists are being discovered in first class\nPre K classroom children do all these things and discover a lifetime of learning for more information on pre K. go to children that\nAlabama dot Gov against Google pre K. and Alabama sponsored by Alabama department at early childhood education down on the broadcasters association station\nI'm Joe ... number twenty to discount tire Ford Mustang under inflated tires put your car out of poets properly inflated and maintain tires here car can be insane and ready to rock\nKeep your car humming along smoothly by second tier pressure each month before every long journey you enjoy it better ride better yet but I always get the most out of your tired\nFor more information visit the tires Martin God or income message from the rubber Manufacturers Association\nSays your news source more news and information now six sixty got what you were executed when you ... on cumulus station\nTimes people will go you know how is it that this friend I've had over a year\nTurn around and stab me in the back\nThat's all part of the sliding scale morality and I'll tell you how it's playing out you've seen in your own life no doubt maybe with your friends certainly with anybody you discuss politics with that you might disagree with and just the overall frustrations you might have about politics in the country let alone\nThe moral outrage still moral outrage by the media on back of ... I mean President Trump here's how the tiny scale morality works\nUnless you're potentially responded saying you're probably not evil so how hold out the possibility on oh Chuck Schumer I Believe it so maybe you know as long as you're not the responder saying or or maybe took humor you're not pure evil and none of us are perfect\nSo out of scale wanted to say though one is the evil tennis perfection we're all too is to knives and therefore at our best were really having\nA good day and where our best versions of ourself we're going to be at the upper end up whatever our morality is let's say you have a really honest in decent person really honest and decent person might\nBe in a maybe on their worst day there are five and what does that mean well it means that\nI'm not going to hurt you even when I'm at my worst I'm not going to hurt you because I'm a decent person more than not well let's say that you start out and unless sliding scale morality your sex\nAnd so you're a decent person throughout much of your your life but when you first any strikes when something goes south what happens you slide back three not just suddenly or three oh shield you're going to hurt somebody if it means taking care of yourself if it means putting your interests first he will take others down\nThat's how the sliding scale morality wars that's how people will stab others in the back when you thought they were your friends are right kind of get the idea here so\nLet's talk about the sliding scale of morality a little bit so many people so many people have been reaching out and frustrated how is it still\nThat you have people\nBack to fend Christine Ford how is it that you still have people that will say that Brett Kavanaugh's rapists when he wasn't even accused of rape by the way\nWell I mean by anybody other than an Audi I guess\n\nThe answer comes down to the sliding scale of morality if you don't have a real moral compass you don't start out in a high place them around to begin with\n... you can make it up as you can go every day you view of things through the prism day you create\nA little bit later in the show I'm going to talk about UN's climate science and what frauds bay are along with Medicare and the fraud that is Medicare for all its financial for on the conversation\nMe reality it's fraud bunch of people lying to you but it's all part of\nMorality today to where I can lie to you\nIf it suits me and when politicians do it and it works you're going to get more of it and people will embrace it to the extent that it makes them feel good or to the extent that justifies their existence and I'll give you an example\nI've always had this rule that if somebody reaches out to me and they don't use profanity I'll get around and respond to them this was a listener talking about Christine for\nAnd I mentioned that hey she committed perjury\nAnd see I Believe should ultimately been trying for it now\nI add somebody saying well her witnesses the ones that ended up feeling her claims made me maybe they were the ones who weren't being honest and this'll asserts that\nThere may be many reasons why they refuted the claims one of which could be they didn't remember another might be that they didn't want the death threats to their families okay cool cool so you can get mad felonies\nWhenever you feel like as long as you're reasons are good enough\nTo fit sliding scale of morality\nAnd when we're talking about this sliding scale morality and we're talking about Kanye West and the moral outrage by the media\nAre you kidding me are you kidding me Twenty years ago today what what are we talking about and what did you think of when you heard Oval Office\nCertainly wasn't about the president of the United states it has something to do with what was on that blue grass\nAnd so for the very media that sucked up to William Jefferson Clinton to have moral outrage over profanity being utilized by Kanye West and the oval office\nThat is one heck of a sliding scale of morality and that is the world we live in today and so more than ever before it's important to know\nWhere your and moral compass happens to me\nAre you\nFive or six or seven and eight where are you where when you're at your best where are you when you're at your worst when you are inviting people into your life who are they\nDo or they\nAre they fix is not a good day and three is not a bad day\n\nYou know last week I was talking about beating your head against the wall a lot of folks want to know how to you become more persuasive how can you convince people\nOf things politically\nAnd I mentioned the unfortunate reality which is you have to find people who are open to a Jew information the first place and the problem is that\nOpen minded people out there as I pointed out with a cabinet deal there are only seven percent of both top to bottom ever had their opinion changed about him seven percent throw everything that's it\nSo you got to find people that are open minded and open to information as I pointed out a lot of them happened to be younger\nBut at the same is true when we're talking about who are engaging in in our lives if you don't want to be frustrated if you don't want to be damned in the back\nIf you want to find people that can make you feel better about yourself an add something positive to your life you got to figure out where their morality is because any more\nA morality is on display each and every day and it's being perpetuated by a political party each and every day including by a former attorney general who happens to now be saying well go ahead and kick the opposition that's the world and we now live in\nSo ... and well look at how far we've come and just Thirteen Years remember the last time we were talking about Kanye West and the president\nThat was a little bit of a different story and over the past Thirteen Years a few things have changed and ... who is working right now and a few things about the economy
