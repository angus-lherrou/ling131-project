migrant caravan time and came to leader of turkey says Washington Post columnist democracy she died as a result of premeditated murder at the Saudi Arabian consulate and as temple and that the killing was no accident President Trump says he still wants to get all the evidence before taking the next step adding that the middle east can be dangerous\nYou take a look it's a rough part of the world since last see places and mess he fought in the world but if what had happened and the fact check out take something that's very bad at the same time they have been a very good ally of ours\nThe president as efforts to hide ... one of the worst cover ups in the history of cover ups Southern California is bracing for a possible influx of Central American migrants as thousands make their way

in April arrived in Tijuana many of those cases are still in the asylum process and this much larger group\nSaid Trump used an economic nationalist agenda the when it's also a word that means different things to different people whole being Miller a senior fellow with the Atlantic council's Scowcroft Center for ... energy and security told CNN they're different definitions depending on whose nationalism you're talking about\nScholars generally differentiate between siblings and ethnic slash sectarian nationalism is between rooting American identity and the ideals of the American experiment\nVersus ruining it in some aspect of our cultural heritage history language or ethnicity\nCivic nationalism is the same as what I Would call patriotism and it is essential to a healthy democracy\nThe second kind of nationalism sectarian nationalism is pernicious in dangerous but raw Heene ...\nA former senior advisor to break the leader ... rejects the second more negative definition of nationalism nationalism is not inherently ugly he says it is in fact inherently beauty\nWell he's currently a ... a fellow at the middle east for him\nHe told CNN nationalism is a philosophy based around either of the nation state what we know locally as countries or around another identity factor which will be religion ethnicity geography or even interests and the case of President Trump is no doubt using the word to outline his belief\nIn a nation of people unified by believes interest in a common history\nThis is typically what nationalism is meant since the earliest references to it in human history though there have no doubt been periods where nationalism just like socialism or other philosophies has been used a divide rather than unite which is ironically the antithesis of its purpose so they want to know what\nThe nationalist believe in how about the the country that's a good place to start nationalist\nPrimary belief is if people in similar societies benefit when they are United by shared values and a common belief system because some says uniting people whether under flags banners anthems or constitutions is conducive to a more robust civic society and stronger communities\nSo it's not the love about it oh\nBut Miller dismisses that as incoherent ideology Miller says no one has ever been able to agree on what defines the nation it is impractical because there was no feasible way to make governments overlap exactly with all the suppose that nations in the world today\nWell they're missing the point entirely we're not worried about the other nations and what they may call nationalism nationalism is what you call nationalism in your own\nNation that's why they call it nationalism instead of international ism but let me explain to you just briefly a ladies and gentlemen of the audience what we have in common as Americans\nIt's called the constitution you can read it it'll tell you exactly what we have in common\nWe have a income and the rights to free speech the right to freedom of the press the right to practice whatever religion we want to practice\nTheir right to keep and bear arms the rights to redress the right to all of these things that are in the bill of rights and all through the constitution but what it is the means to be an American\nIf you're going to be a Christian you named to read the New Testament Old Testament would help but New Testament is where you live\nIf you want to be a Jew you need to read the ... if you want to be an American you need to read the constitution it's as simple as that it is the life plan for people who are citizens of this country if you're going to be a citizen of another country and be a nationalist there then you're going to be looking at another document\nBut if you're going to be an American and you call yourself a nationalist and I agree\nThat the people on the left have made this a dirty word but it's rather funny to me that Trump is tweaking them with it because they look to the dictionary definition and the dictionary definitions as a person devoted to nationalism a a devotion and loyalty to one's own\nCountry\nOne is there to argue about what that\nWhere you are probably a native is too yeah I probably am if you want to get into basic definition of a negative if I Want to put the people in this country first and it doesn't it's not about a race it's about people\nThe people of America come first you know why because it's where we live and we pay taxes so that we can have a military defense that protects all the people in this country so yes we come first and ... and we come first when it comes to an illegal invasion coming up from Honduras\nSo if I'm against the folks coming in from Honduras illegally am I Am an actual is absolutely I Am\nAnd my native is sure\nWhy in the world would I Want them to be better off at the expense of us or doesn't that make you a\nGreedy doesn't that make you a cold hearted conservative no it's a reality I Can't save everybody in the world\nLet me ask you this are you more concerned about the people living in your house in your family than you are the neighbors next door well of course you are\nSo if mayhem breaks out what are you going to do you gonna run out the front door and make sure that John and Mary next door you okay you got everything you name or you're going to hunker down with your own family and make sure that the bad guys and the ... don't get them\nOr what's wrong with that I don't think there's anything wrong with that you take care of your own first and then if you go help John and marry after you secure as your own family than you do\nBut there is nothing in the world sinister about Trump saying he's the national that's where all nationally nor we shouldn't be unless you're one of the socialist international is and what you want to do is you want to screw up this country and bring everybody in here that has no business coming in\nHere and the expense of everybody was already here what does that make you an idiot that sort of makes you\nWho in the world wants to take care of everybody else in the six million or seven billion whatever we got at the expense of everybody in the United states\nI think that makes you trader actually\nWe are in the United states for ... and some of us were born here some of us immigrated here some were born citizen some shows to be citizens but we're\nAll in the same boat and it's a life boats and what do you want to do drill a hole in the bottom of it\nOr what do you want to try to do swamp it with all the other people that that are in another life both they want to get an hours it's not like they're drowning it's just that they're voting as nice as ours\nBut we can't take all those people in our motives it won't hold all of them it'll sink our boat it'll destroy our boat now what we can do with our boat is we can go help these folks that are falling over the side and get back up in their boats\nWe can maybe throwing some supplies and stuff but if all those people in that ... we're all gonna die\nAnd that's the whole point of legal immigration Hewlett everybody in the world who wants to come here just stream into the country it no longer is the United states of America we can no longer help the other folks\nWe've got all of this wealth all of this large as not because we're greedy but because of our system of government if we let people come in that aren't producing energy just wanting to climb on the boats they're going to sing it\nAnd for their sake and I say we can't let them do it and that's the whole point about the care of and\nOh yeah I'm sure there are a lot of folks who are running from violence and poverty in Honduras\nBut they're also running from violence and poverty in all over Africa and in Bangladesh and in the NBA and every and some of those folks over there\nAnd the care of it we can't possibly take every body in those countries in but couldn't if we wanted to and we shouldn't work to what we should want to do is to keep our boat strong and keep it floating\nAnd keep it secure so that we can help them secure their own boat\nDoes that make any

this must have\nBeen [noise] today a barely a enjoying that would have been with this is a Wolf Blitzer I don't know who the chick is she's the one you're first going to hear ... okay CNN White House correspondent Caitlin Collins okay that saying they'll do some\nSo the key I think she's the one you're going to hear first and of course they're talking about a dog whistle blower this is about nationalism okay and Trump\nLast night at a at a a rally in Texas I Believe it was said I'm a proud nationalist\nLook up the word for crying out loud it means that you love your country you want what's best for your country now I'm Jeffrey tubing who is a huge liberal\nBlue shooters lose its chief legal analyst for CNN\nWolf Blitzer wanting to bring him in on the argument and this is how this all went down\nThere weren't meant and that's very concerning coming from the president of the United states there weren't matter\nYou know a Jeffrey I I Know you've got crushed for drunk or this is not only that he's a proud nationalist these very happy about saying he's a nationalist even though he says you're not supposed to be used that word but then he says these international as these global as soon as his view or they frankly don't care much about our country\nAnd I got to say you know I I doubt and no one I talked about Donald Trump's racism from day one starting with his allies about wherever aka Obama was born\nBut I don't think there's anything wrong with the term nationalism and I would hate to say it co-opted entirely\nA by um these these reactionary forces Theodore Roosevelt program was called the new nationalism in the struggle in American foreign policy between international it's in isolation is sometimes called national is\nA rather than isolationist I mean that's a real thing in this country and I don't think nationalism\nIs a ... it's just a code word or the other ... look he does so much actual racism I think we shouldn't criticize him for the actual racism rather than a what I think is is an unfair criticism for the sun\nDiving getting to change the definition of war and he had not racist but it's not the kind of have the right has that doesn't mean that that's what race it's nice to have you on a national I have had a negative connotation it has for here they're they're raising people and president specifically avoid using a campaign threatening you love your country if a white guy\nBeing a national thing do you love your country and no matter what it means something it doesn't mean whatever the president said that name says that he had that means something to try and that is not what that word means and just as President Trump said that and put their name and then I get I mean he gets it at\nThat rally last night it was unclear I was there the crowd really didn't know how to react\nTo that necessarily so it was a dog whistle I have no doubt at all part of his long list of things he's doing to fire up his base that is the core of all of this we cannot talk about this and\nThe timing of this we are two weeks before the midterm elections that's why he is saying that it had nothing to do with helping a Ted Cruz had nothing to do with helping the house a candidate you know in suburban Houston um he was trying to fire the sub so regardless of the definition of it he knew exactly what he was saying\nAll right so there you go so dog whistle\nYou know I've got a lot of experience in that only dogs can your dog whistles so just keep in mind let's go back to what this shit was saying whoever she is again this is
