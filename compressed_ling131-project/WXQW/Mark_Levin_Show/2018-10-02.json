you've got another Peters struck involved but I think\nWith Chris Wray in at the helm of the FBI and their battered reputation I think that the FBI hierarchy is making darn sure there's no politicizing this with the agents that are going out in the field and conducting the investigation and I can guarantee you they put these people through the third degree to make sure they didn't have a\nPolitical axe to grind against Trump for for Trump they don't want anything political so they send their people out\nThey ah interview the witnesses they do the investigation\nVast afternoon hand me something [laughter]\n[noise] [laughter]\n[laughter] this\nIs another indication that uh they're imploding bath stamped tells me CNN has dropped their Kavanaugh wall to wall coverage and are now going wall to wall with is\nThat the New York times as President Trump used dubious tax schemes to make a fortune in the Nineteen nineties [noise] and I was trained on this today I said you've gotten up and folks\nMeal ... says this is a little bit suspect I mean here we are now all the Kavanaugh things not going like we want to let's wipe it off the front pages and get it off the news we gotta have something else to put down people's minds before November Trump\nGot four hundred million dollars from his father and they they shaded people to get it and that's how he made his fortune that was a supposedly back in the Nineteen nineties well Trump made his fortune in the Nineteen seventies and eighties it's going to be really really hard\nTo make this stick plus I Would think that the statute of limitations on anything like this long expired here's what the story says when the New York times\nTrump earned the equivalent of more than four hundred million dollars by setting up a sham corporation to hide gifts from his father\nHad also claims Trump helped his father take millions and improper tax deductions\nTrump's parents allegedly transferred over a billion dollars of wealth to their children but they just a fraction of the required taxes a lawyer for the president called the allegations faults and defamatory well it goes beyond that it's we gotta have something now but why the Kavanaugh thing all Trump pages because we're getting hammered [noise]\nMeanwhile back to the Kavanaugh saying check this out\nWe now have a Republican senator who is referring Julie sweating to
