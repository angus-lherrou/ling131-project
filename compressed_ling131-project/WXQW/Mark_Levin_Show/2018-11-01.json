Obama era they tried to put a lot of organized for profit businesses out of work and certainly they went after fossil fuels I get up and I said no to that nonsense when I saw those lawsuits and President Trump\nWell he's just finishing the job I was basically the bridge to President Trump who's done so many great things for our economy and for energy jobs in West Virginia\nWe need to continue that approach of lowering our taxes and then ultimately deregulating so that regulations fulfill a more basic purpose\nMarkets you know were meant to be a free people that means we should try to solve most of our problems either\nIndividually or within our communities on the local level when you have federal regulations in place there has to be a very compelling health\nSafety well for aspect to it and it obviously must comply with the constitution and that's part of the problem with the Obama era\nOr they went so far beyond the pale President Trump is doing it right and we know unfortunately Joe mansion his first vote and the U.S Senate would have power Schumer and that radical team that was on full display of obstruction and resistance during the judge Kavanaugh nomination\nAnd the people of West Virginia [noise] they need to understand that when Hillary Clinton and her bunch talking about deplorable they're talking about people hardworking men and women blue collar men and women like the wonderful citizens the west Virginia\nTell me what the Democrats done in the last forty years for coal miners I Can't think of a single thing you know than trying to put them out of work", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Mark Levin Show", "city": "Fairhope", "day": "01"}
