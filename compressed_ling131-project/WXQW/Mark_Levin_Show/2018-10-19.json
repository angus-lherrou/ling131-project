says that\nAmerican families that are making less than a hundred thousand dollars a year should be eligible for a month ... tax credit a five hundred dollars\nThat six thousand a year\nUnder new legislation they announce today by the Democratic party this democratic US Senator Kamala Harris of California she then went on to say that individuals making less than fifty thousand dollars a

that that's almost like a technicality like compared to what I'm about to tell you Harris's\nOffice as she rolled out this plan today cited a two thousand seven teams survey\nFrom the website bank great dot com that found that more than half of Americans cannot afford a five hundred dollar\nUnexpected expense such as it rent increase a medical bill\nFor childcare\nNow bankrupt survey came out

it because of a website called ... dot com that found that more than half of Americans cannot afford a five hundred dollar unexpected effects pets\nLet me just explain to you how warped this logic is this idea is I'll go\nBack to her first part of our proposal she said American families making Ninety nine thousand nine hundred nine dollars a year\nCould be eligible for a monthly tax credit of up to five hundred dollars or six thousand dollars a year [noise]\nAnd the reason why she wants to give me that money every month is because she says you don't have you haven't saved a five hundred dollars for an unexpected bill that could come in with a rent increase of medical bill or child care so she wants to give you government subsidized money so that you making nine hundred nine thousand dollars a year\nHave an extra five hundred dollars so that she can pay for your call expected expects\nNow my my quick question for you is this\nWhat makes you think that if you give somebody who's making nine hundred and Ninety nine\nThousand let me make sure I say this summer correctly 'cause I said it wrong a moment ago so people on the left will freak out so that said it wrong so all correct it right now calm down\nYou're making Ninety nine thousand nine hundred dollars a year\nAnd you can't save for five hundred dollar unexpected expense you're an idiot\n\nWhat makes you think that idiot who's making that much money is going to take your government money and then go Oh thank\nYou you just said me for my unexpected next expense of five hundred dollars I'm going to save that money because at the same dumb a has a say five hundred dollars of is Ninety nine thousand dollar a year job\nRemember\nWhen we had the tax credit that came out the Bush tax credit member that what happened everybody took their tax money and they were they do with it they went out and bought a ton of crap and boost the economy and George Bush and those economists around them are right people to save that money they got extra money and they went out and spin it right away\nDon't look at the stats\nAirs she knows that they're not going to say this money for five hundred dollar unexpected expense they're going to take the money immediately just spend every dime of every single month on average\nThe idea that some of making fifty thousand dollars a year if you give them an extra two hundred and fifty dollars a month to the government's money which is our tax payers our subsidizing be able to make under a hundred thousand dollars a year and they're now going to save that money every month for an unexpected medical bill or child care you're an idiot\n\nTwo hundred and fifty dollars a month it's not going to save someone's life it means that they don't know how to budget\n\nThis is nothing more than buying votes this is not about\n... and the fact that you're doing this under the under a survey from bank great dot com is the reason why we need legislation in this country which she announced today\nIt is going to same America's middle class by giving them extra money among subside from the government that they are they're going to save that money and not spend it on whatever the craft they're spending their money on now that they're going to become more responsible with that money compared to the other a hundred thousand or making the year ... is just liberal and competency at

you let me borrow two hundred bucks I don't have it my dad would tell me to drive on the darn spare and get my house in order in my life in order and stop being a screw up\nHe would not loaned me the money because if I'm making Ninety nine thousand dollars a year he would say you're in the idiot for not saving any of that I Am thousand hours here if I was making fifty thousand dollars a year to use her other example\nThan I had a flat tire and I call my dad or my mom and I said hey mom cook I'm only making fifty grand\nI just had a flat tire I have no extra savings I Can't deal with this unexpected tire expense can you please send over five hundred dollars or two hundred and fifty dollars to use their math\n...

when Trump was making a joke about that candidate but the um\nThe body slammed a reporter you know in Montana and of course he was obviously joking about it but the mainstream maybe they'd go nuts over there today and then the uh\nThe White House correspondents association has issued a damning condemnation of Donald Trump's remarks on that same that he is condoning violence against journalists that coupled with\nLayer saying that he's the he's saying that the media\nAre the enemy of the state which has never said that he's always always said fake news as the enemies that because you know he doesn't think Fox News is the amazing thing the Daily Caller is the enemy of the state of the hill as the enemy of the state he's talking about CNN and BS NBC and the rest of these folks who spoon feed you ... on a day to day basis\nSo they're going to take that they're going to take the body slam thing they're waiting until they can make their case that it's because of Trump that a journalist like this was killed and dismembered in ah in Turkey in Istanbul because Trump has made this acceptable\nAround the world to do this and he is responsible needs to be impeached over to I'm telling you when this story first broke and the media were all over and I'm telling you there's a reason they're all over\nIt it's not just because some guy got killed and the and the consulate in Istanbul

have with U.S intelligence delivered a hit list enemies with the crown prince the NBA or Saudi Arabia\n[laughter] he goes on international TV and delivers that and then when everyone starts screaming

Castro [noise] uh I understand your statements saying that you didn't intend\nCan you tell us what you didn't tend to say because it seems pretty clear what she said\nAnd and and here's the best part of his denial that\nNever got any follow up and never got any challenging as just accept that oh well he's a he says he didn't intend to do that so let's just take him in his words they didn't do it he then said all I said was there was reporting\nTo the fact that Jared Kushner may have done that and Congress needs to investigate you see and now and now that's that's the crux of it because they didn't see everything that happens in this town Washington DC everything\nThat's happening down at the border right now everything that\nYou're seeing on cable news night after night after night\nOf it has to do with the midterm election that Kavanaugh hearings that was all about the mid term elections\nThe the the the way the media and the Democrats and some Republicans are reacting to this
