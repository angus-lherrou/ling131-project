quality matter when you spend your own money on yourself and your\nFamily what's another way to spend money less going down the efficiency scale you spending money on other people Friedman would make the argument there that when you spend money on other people the cost of what you're buying matters because it's your money but if I'm buying a product for Mr producer\nDoes equality matter well I like grits so maybe but let's be honest it doesn't matter as much as if you're buying it for your wife or your family I Know richest feel a little insulted right now but don't take it the wrong way
