say whatever we want you to say is what big [laughter] it should be in the contract you need to run everything by as you can\nYou can see what you want you can say what you what we want you to say and then you don't have a talk show anymore you don't have a TV talk show you're on a radio talk show you don't have free speech anymore that point when you got some gatekeepers sitting in wherever New

you that would have no problem with with Megan Kelly saying the F. word but when you say the black face word which by the way she wasn't defending blackface well what do you call it I call it somebody dressing as you say black faces ... and the entire year all black\nYou know [laughter] I mean it's not like somebody putting on black base in big white around the lifting the one ... come on folks\nBut again when you asked me to ask people to be offended by it and why should I care good grief you want me to run everything by everybody out there might offend good I'm sure we're going to hear from the Muslims on the pedophile thing\nBut that doesn't change the fact that it's true and it doesn't change the notion that I hand him of free speech\nSo if I think that Mohammed was a pedophile I can say Mohammed was a pedophile and I should not have to worry about it especially when there's documented evidence in the Iran about it [noise] they marry they want a girl when she was six and they consummate the marriage when she was nine what do you call that\nSo I'm I'm not doing this to poke at the ... or anything I'm just telling you this woman got fined in Austria\nFor having

[noise]\nWell this is great I Am so glad that we don't have a plan\nWinging it is not an emergency plan and make sure your kids know what to do during an emergency protocol where to me wanting to visit ready to go watch kids than information public service announcement brought to you by the Miami ad council\nSees your news source for news and information six sixties got what you would execute W ... movie about cumulus station\nI'm mad and lack of civility barbecues that Florida Man fifty six year old ... has been arrested in connection with the Thirteen package bomb mailing sent a high profile Democrats and critics of President Trump the corresponding the casting bomb report the FBI cautions there could still be more packages out their FBI\nDirector Christopher Wray said so far they've recovered Thirteen IDs that were made a PVC pipe o'clock a battery wiring and\nWhat is known as energetic material which is essentially potential explosives and materials\nShe said they were not hoaxes raised said they were able to pick up a fingerprint from the device center representative Maxine Waters and it wasn't a match for say ... attorney general Jeff Sessions\nPolitical violence or the threat of violence is antithetical to a vigorous systems of self government\nAnd so CNN's headline no intention of shootings you just put in their mind like go ... but we might you know you know we don't have any intention of it right now but you don't know\nThey're not going to shoot the camera manners for crying out loud but of course that's from CNN\nWashington Post story ... couldn't shower the caravan with\nKindness and so that's what you're getting now they're trying to build this thing up and it just it ain't happening and it looks like that's the key unless it ... it looks like um\nOh let's say this from the well see I don't get the Washington Post won't be read the headline is Trump considering planned ban injury of migrants its southern border planning do I think that's been the plan all along he was from USA Today Trump threatened to seal the southern border over Margaret Caribbean\nCan he pull this I can tell you can\nI don't think he's feeling the border what are you doing these major the illegals or come across\nIllegal immigration will continue is not going to say okay this is all over\nIt's unclear whether Trump is seriously considering a complete closure of the two thousand mile border with Mexico or if he's using the threats simply to get America's southern neighbors to cooperate\nHave vowed to use the U.S military to close the southern border he's talking about to illegal is not the legal folks there's all sorts of commerce coming back and forth across hey so many you think he's going to use the troops and go closed down every port of entry I don't think that's going to happen\nI don't think that's going to happen\nAnd here's what he tweeted and this was on the Eighteenth of October\nIn addition to stopping all payments to these countries which seemed to have almost no control over their population I must and the strongest terms and Mexico to stop this onslaught and is unable to do so I Will call upon a call up the U.S military to close our southern border\nWhat he means as to the to the illegals we're not going to let me just run across the desert and yeah give it a job\nNot going to happen so that's what that's all about but you don't hear much about the care man because I'm hearing it starting all fall apart and of course we get the bomber today and they may have this crazy guy and now there's a question\nAs to who this guy actually is hits and again I don't want to feed into well you say you don't feed into but you do I'm just saying this guy is like ... ... it's like somebody out of central casting I mean he's got a band it's\nPlastered with pro Trump stuff and CNN sucks and all this other stuff all over it and then there's pictures of a meta at you know with his ... and he's going to a rally and it has everything from a\nBox Trump wine you know I mean it's just in getting got everything said Trump resort to play golf and to at mar a Lago I mean it's you know it's it's really over the top\nAnd what we're hearing is this guy may not be all\nThat we're hearing he is and I warn you about that yesterday if this ends up being some Trump supporter we need to be able to get his social media from several years back not just from the last couple of months and everything I've seen today is taking screen shots because they've\nCut they've closed as accounts down on Twitter and Facebook show it from just October how convenient\nWhat was he ... a year ago what was it twenty two years ago what was he saying the folks we don't have a clear picture of who this guy is and again if it turns out this is a nut case fanatic of Trump\nIt doesn't mean that Trump's done anything wrong\nNo more than it meant that the Bernie Sanders' campaign worker who was representing Bernie Sanders when he shot saves release and nobody in the mainstream media is ever tried to make that connection\nBut every time you turn around that's all they're doing is making the connection with Trump and this guy and a pie or earlier today saying a Trump admits this guy was a Trump supporter but won't take responsibility of course he's not going to take responsibility he had nothing to do with it\n[noise]\nAnyway so the mango bomber hash tag is now the top trend again today as you might imagine and here's what some of these folks are saying\nMrs ah Dennis can Grimes my favorite part of the story is knowing that the mango bomber was mocking Maxine Waters for her low IQ on Twitter just before he left his own fingerprint on the bombing mail to\n[laughter] that is pretty funny [noise] but ah then they've got somebody's got a cartoon in the Trump I'm standing at the podium Trump twenty sixteen the head of Trump is a gasoline can and everybody out in the audience or matches\nI Know they go and Patrick ... says Jeff Sessions has said and mango bomber Caesar say are may have been a part assume you're thanks so Jeff which\nSide so they're going they're going nuts on men and\nReject the regime Gabriel tweeted this can some of them remind me when Trump told everybody to mail bombs to Democrats\nYeah I don't recall that neither\nIs Carrie pennant maker says the far right false flag narrative over the mango bomber of dams was all over the talk radio Jay Webber show given the history of these things in the extreme amount of venom poisoning the left I Do believe a false flag scenario is more likely\nI told you I thought anything could happen I said it's one of two things at some stupid redneck who loves Trump who's gone nuts or somebody posing as a stupid redneck who loves Trump who's going nuts\nBut either way it's a nut so they have it that's what that's that's the ah hashtags mango bomber narrative today and they just oh my gosh they go oh here's one hashtags mega if you killed\nBy the sword you blink by the sword not fake news as real as Trump I'm not even sure what they're supposed to mean okay so we have that yeah I Will [laughter] we have that\nNow we

migrants\nFrom all parts of the world we in Canada we're loving people we're compassionate people\nWe welcome all people hear some thinking to myself I have a solution to all that stuff\nSolution for the illegal aliens who are trying to come into the country illegally a solution for the Trump Administration and the solution for the Trudeau administration here's what we do [noise] president United States picks up the phone and he calls Trudeau and he says\nYeah we got seven to fourteen thousand people coming here legally I Know you support illegal immigration I Know your borders are wide open you've said it over and over again and you said you're very compassionate about these things so here's what we're going to do when I get a whole bunch of greyhound buses\nAnd we're going to have as many of these caravan marchers as possible\nGet on the buses and we're going to drive them you know the way Mexico does it lets these people go through their country and our country we can learn something from Mexico we can and what we'll do is we'll put them on greyhound buses\nAnd will drive them tour northern border and we'll let them out because Canada wants them these people want to leave\nThey ... they come from my lab to say that I mean if you're marching a thousand miles or two thousand miles I assume or ...\nEven\nThough they're carrying their flags and in the United states this president believes in law and order and enforcing immigration laws so there you have your satisfy all three\nThe illegal aliens wind up in Canada leaving their host Canada receives them because their arms are wide open for them and in the United states we enforce our border and our immigration laws I think that's a brilliant idea of us can produce\nAnd on top of that look at greyhound greyhound makes a profit to they could probably use so that's\nMy solution ladies and gentleman for the caravan\nHa a parade of illegal immigrants who are coming into our country supported by left
