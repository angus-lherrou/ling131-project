were his father's tax returns but\nWhy is he attacks she has he been adjudicated attack street now has he been adjudicated attack street administratively or judicial a no\nNo he has\nNow what is the president's supposed to do and I you know full well when you have these kinds of holdings you can't actually follow your own tax returns you hire professionals and you sign the tax return and you submit it\n\nThen of course the goal is to pay as little taxes as possible\n\nI asked Bill Clinton that I seem to recall one year he deducted as used underwear remember that Mr producer [noise]\nBut there's never been a New York times investigation into the Clintons' like this the wheeling and dealing pay and build a damn thing is there a single building in New York or any other part of the
