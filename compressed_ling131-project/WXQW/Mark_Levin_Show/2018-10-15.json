book\nWhere they they have this they passed this law that you can only own one business so if you own multiple businesses then you have to sell them will\nThink about that for a second you got to sell them to somebody else who doesn't own a business so you're going to sell it to somebody who does not only building on the business but doesn't know how to run one and so you have to essentially give

that was obviously important why he is with bin Laden in Sudan in Afghanistan they do but in London but he should mitigate his criticism of the royal family in return home\nOf course within the elite everyone knows each other both came from the same generation and from two of the richest families in the kingdom bin Laden's father was the country's largest contractor gosh argues uncle was an influential arms dealer in addition costs like his grandfather\nWas personal physician to the Saudi king book shocking themself also had sympathy for the Muslim Brotherhood\nAnd what she saw a more modern more democratic form of Islam is them\nFor today's Saudi leadership however the Muslim Brotherhood or their principal enemy in the world\nWhat do you suspect what could have happened to him\nHe says if he was murdered than I Would be surprised if his journalistic activities were the only reason the Saudis only half of the international Arab media they own half of the international Arab media they have generally built up a very effective mediator ...\nAs a journalist and activist he may have been extremely annoying but not a real threat\nBut he knew a lot he was not just the media officer of intelligence chief prince Turki guy\nHe was also one of his main advisors and was said to work for the secret service for a while it was extremely familiar with sensitive issues of the kingdom and he was a member of the super leap he might have known too much so in other words\nThis guy appears to and we don't know till we know as they say we we don't know well we know where we don't know\n[noise] and we do know some things we do know and one of the things we do know\nAnd you know and I know you know I Know\nIs this guy was not just a quote unquote journalists\nHe was he was an operative\nFor some forces inside Saudi Arabia that we're trying to topple\nThe monarchy [noise] now that doesn't make them a bad guy\nBut it also doesn't make him a great guy either and and also can explain why the Saudis may have executed in which they are known to do for a lot less crimes and this I mean [noise]\nYou know I mean the Saudis are famous for laughing people's heads off in the public square and you folks who have actually been to Saudi Arabia where the military and things like this I've heard dozens of stories of you know just walking through a square and then you know they got my own crowd gathering and it's some you know official and they got some guy who's\nMurdered somebody or rape somebody or whatever and they just below up his head off in front of chairs you know it's like we used to do with\nHangings back in the Nineteen ... Eighteenth nineteenth century in this country so who knows what this guy was up to my whole point on this has been from the beginning yeah we need to find out what's going on\nBut it is the worst thing that Saudi Arabia is ever done I mean they may have been mined nine eleven now the question is is it this prince or was it as Dan or whatever and now there was the printing was young is reforming in a way this moving away from this\n\nBut that wouldn't change the fact that there's still a brutal regime is a monarchy\nAnd kingdoms kill people who were trying to topple them much just what they do I'm not saying that makes it right and I'm not saying that they shouldn't be some repercussion but it shouldn't come some big surprise and it's certainly not the first time I won't be the last of Saudi Arabia's done something like this\nBut it just right and this guy was a contributor to the Washington Post and so now you've got all the journalists throughout waves that could be me\nWhile I doubt it's going to be new this guy was obviously involved in something far beyond writing a column for the Washington Post he was involved in perhaps a conspiracy to topple the government such as it is of Saudi Arabia and in fact the case that seems to me to be an internal affair I don't know you know\nI'm not saying that we shouldn't have something to say about it but it's certainly not the worst thing the Saudis have ever done it's certainly not a good thing I'm not saying that at all I'm just saying if we found out that the Saudis as has been suspected were part of nine eleven helped to train the hijackers help send them over here so that they could attack us\nBut nobody seems even want to pull back that um courting to see if there's anything behind at least of all the mainstream media\nPlane I don't know I couldn't tell you what it looks like to me that a a regime that his totalitarian would be the easiest mark for the mainstream media I mean they're all about\nSocial justice and all of this kind of snow\n\nBy the way I was listening to some interview some guy what was it oh they are they ... this guy this this um\nGuy that they say who knows what happened to him and the embassy in ... in Istanbul they called him a\nWhile they call him a social justice warrior yes he was working for social justice well if he wants to replace\nThe government of Saudi Arabia\nWith something that looks like I don't know Iran I don't think that social justice this is the this is a trend we've fallen into so many times all let's help him because he's against this this band regime over here this whole thing of the Arab Spring list toppled\nGadhafi and then we'll put in something\nThat resembles the ayatollah in Iran that's a good thing is meant no that's a bad thing we go from bad to worse\nThe problem in the middle east and the problem in the world generally is there's no clear cut good guy and bad guy it's not likely I'm married but not like the old western somebody's gonna come riding in the white hat and\nTake out the guy in the black candidate doesn't happen that way we can have somebody like a\nWhile anybody\nYou take you take anybody that's running any way you can take the crown prince ... or whatever by the regime by that guy in New York\nThe guys that they said he was a cabdriver I think he's a limo driver anyway he's yelling ... some guy go into the synagogue some are orthodox Jewish ghetto videotaping just beating the crap out of them some other orthodox Jewish guy comes running to is ready to start chasing him on a big deal out of him\nBut in the mainstream media all want to be on that site and we don't know that he was moslem\nOh no we don't\nOf course we do you just don't want to say it the guys are not case months I'm not that all Muslims in a case where this guy's a radical\nIslam is who was beaten up issues on the way that the synagogue\nI've been reading in well I Would say I get down that road and I read all sorts of stuff out there and this is the ... the\nTen I think it's the top ten most important events in history\nAnd number two right now and it's the crusades\nAnd when I was going down the whole road there were nine of them in total if he didn't know about the crusades and what it was basically\nA bunch of blood thirsty moslems taking over Jerusalem and being rounded by a bunch of bloodthirsty Christians\nBasically what it boils down to now I understand people can make a case for both sides and what have you but basically it's fanatics on both sides trying\nTo take over what they what they perceive as being sacred land holy land and uh they see it is only the Muslim see those a Christian so he was ... and then we send a bunch of folks out there that are raping pillaging ... during all their way to Jerusalem\nAnd so they're not much better than the folks who rape and pillows and plunder Jerusalem and then we\nRoute ma'am they get out and then they come back they around us and we get out and we're killing everybody in between it's all the people that are going can we just live our lives to know where to go into you got to make a choice now we have ...

time and the and the poverty is\nThe worst poverty members in your life\nBut I've also seen some of the happiest folks have seen in my life I've never seen they like it\nWhen we went to Honduras several years ago ... trying to sing when that was seen as evidence and the eight years ago about eight years ago I took one of my sons\nAnd we went down there and did some work on a mission trip and it was interesting because I could not help but be taken aback by\nThe happiness of the poor people\nAnd so I wrote a column on 'em because\nHonduras is one of the poorest places on earth has the most and top murder rate in the world although it's got the strictest gun laws that was another thing but I didn't get off on that on that particular column what I did was I looked at the suicide rate and it has one of the lowest\nSuicide rates in the world and you say well maybe that's 'cause they can't get their hands on going I don't know [laughter] I mean you are [laughter] you can always jumping

in college admissions [laughter] is this law in my lease a co pay you know it's absolutely mind boggling\n[noise] she writes eliminating race as a consideration in admissions would cause egregious harm to people of color including Asian Americans now if you don't know about the Harlem and saying\nWhat is happening is you're finding the Asians are getting discriminated against because they're saying that they have too many Asians at Harvard now\nTalking about something that should be based on marriage and you know how it is I don't want to stereotype but Asian Americans tend to be over achievers don't really do you notice that or not and you say there's oh you're a racist bumped small [laughter] I Know we're going to complement folks and now you're raises but everybody knows that\nAsian Americans are disproportionately in universities not because of affirmative action but because\nAnd for some reason they performed very well\nNo I don't know whether it's a family thing or a cultural thing I have no idea it just is and you see them as these you know the smart universities it's like every time we see a Carolina Duke game and they pay into crowded Cameron indoor stadium it's about half Asian\nBecause Duke has a lot of Asians go there and it's not because they have is not because of affirmative action on the nose so and the Harvard thing they say will get too many Asians when he lets them black folks and Hispanics and Asians place\nAnd they're going are you serious ... where are the ones who are making the graves and doing what we're supposed to do now you say we can't come when I Am an Asian who's arguing the yeah yeah yeah that's right we have too many Asians and we're really so they weren't a news buster so ending discrimination against Asian Americans\nWill do agree just harm to them right and the war\nAnd mores piece freedom of slavery and ignorance is strength somewhere the author of Nineteen eighty four was laughing but it was two years\nSo they call them through the column looking for the argument in support of the assertion that ending discrimination against Asian Americans would actually causing great harm and they found

test\nTo diversify New York city specialized schools which are generally majority Asian and relatively few black and Latino students some Asian American parents criticize the proposal as anti Asian well of course they would with me\nSo you got something based on you take a test of you score high on the test you get in and then too many Asians are getting into going well\nWe're this is this test is crap man we got to do something about this so we got to scrap the test and we got to put some black folks and Hispanics and stuff she makes a pitch\nFor Asian Americans quote to imagine and fulfill our own radical futures\nWhatever that supposed to me\nSo here we have a minority which was Asian Americans go now actually finding themselves discriminated against why because they over achieve

it\nMedia he does not accept the premise of the question and turns to question it to an answer he wants to answer not an answer that's already a you know that they they think they're going to get out of abide by about pre existing narrative and trying to advance it he re frames it in his way [noise]\nPerfect example was the question about the Washington DC with Trump starts talking about how bad the media is this to say hey this is Trump's narrative it's a narrative that is true by the way that the media is biased against the American people who are weapon to be conservative or even moderate Republicans this is a that's a that's a\nAlmost total logical Trump knows that\nTrump is comfortable with that territory talking about the media and they're biased towards working class Americans than others right\nSo what does he do we re frames it Lesley Stahl who's smart she's listening she's not them she's very bright she's just the liberal just liberal you know pretending to be a journalist right\nShe automatically census Trump's getting into this media war she knows that works for him and she tries to stop all she caught some off by the way she interviewed him I I saw something on Twitter the sixty four times\nAnd when they interviewed Obama they interrupted him four times but we figured that because that's what they do right [noise]\nShe get the rub some to stop 'em because she knows she's now playing on on on the way a basketball court here\nShe knows that she's playing and his territory she tries to stop him and he doesn't have it\nHe doesn't have it he keeps going and going because Trump knows that authenticity cells and he's going to be authentic even if it comes with battle scars at all that's Trump's ammo he is not going to talk and focus group tested talking points he's going to talk like Donald Trump talks period and the story right\nSo the take away fear\nFor anybody thinking about her every move or interested at all in running for office becoming a conservative activist takeaway number one is you re frame the question to reframe the arguments went answer you want to give not to the pre existing narrative they want to advance\nTrump does it all the time watching you know\nFolks they sell this guy short constantly constantly the liberal media pace this guy as some kind of a buffoon yet he is constantly having them back on their heels\nSo it makes no sense\n\nNow he did something else that's important not just that he turned around and and reframe this thing\n\nHe got the last word and this is critical he would not let Leslie stall that sixty minutes interview get the last word he gets a last word and he did it constantly and he did it one time and what happened what's the benefit of getting the last word and they come on this is simple this is really easy\nTo benefit of getting the last word in Utah class and that's what everybody remembers\nSold tries to stop 'em on when he goes on this uh when he goes on attack with the media right and he keeps going\nAnd then he says at the end and you know ... and then that's why I'm president and you are not and boom that's what everybody remembers at the end\n\nFolks that's what I think this is the tough time the media is having with this guy they don't understand that is the sense of again a battle scars and all and authentic\nNatural way of conversations sometimes it's sometimes it's heated sometimes it's not there are hills and valleys there are the natural vicissitudes of the ... of a kind of the conversation he goes up and goes down but when he hits hits\nHard that people are attracted to that authenticity [noise] so he understands he has to reframe it number one and secondly\nHe understands fully that he needs to get that last word in any did and that's what everybody remembered\nBecause I'm president and you are not\nNow\nThe reason I bring this up is not to just you know law does performance at the point out what he did but to show you how that performance contrast what's what's going on in the Democratic party right now which is a ... of just a litany of frauds in and out of the people who are completely inauthentic who they're they\nBased their entire campaigns around identity politics in class warfare and it's collapsing everywhere exhibit number one Elizabeth Warren today\n... ... I mean who\nWon the other president other than Donald Trump what other forget about president what other Republican anywhere anywhere in the in the entire movement could have gotten a ... a major party presidential\nCandidate twenty or twenty twenty which everybody knows Elizabeth Warren's going to be to actually released a press release indicating that she's possibly one\nOne thousand and twenty fours Native American who else could have gotten so much to do something so stupid folks whoever is running the PR shop in Elizabeth Warren staff should resign for a felony level political malpractice immediately\nI have no idea what you think you were getting out of a press release indicating that your great great great is it for grade so I'm not even sure for three great grandmothers\nBack may have possibly been Native American I don't know what you think you were getting at is but it was quite possibly the dumbest press release in\nPolitical history who else could have done that\nTrump has a unique ability I'm telling you to constantly on the lips by driving them when Saturday\n\n... entirely inauthentic\nElizabeth Warren will not let this go go places embarrassing to understand how this plays\nTo the average working class Americans sitting there toiling for a limited uh whatever kind of a job you're working hanging sheet rock driving trucks\nPlumbing electric work through an architect you got to sit there and listen to a woman who put down on her form to gain some kind of advantage that she had Native American a Native American heritage wrote an entry in a book about powwow\nChow that's real by the way it is and and as\nPossibly one one thousand or twenty fourth America this is not give it a Democratic Party a vise I'll just say you constantly wonder gosh how did Trump beat us how did Trump beat us because he's just a normal\nGuy battle scars and all your people are fakes you got this guy in Texas all bad I'll bet always

is not necessarily without battle scars I'm not suggesting you know anybody here is without sin I'm simply suggesting that one of the messages that resonates with the American people\nIs he's a plane speaking authentic guy says what's on his mind and after fifty plus years of PC politics and focus group tested nonsense these cells\nNow I bring that up in relationship to the sixty minutes interview where I I thought he just dismantle was least all\nI Know it because I've got friends of mine who were union workers up in New York am I going to say who because honest to God I'm afraid they'll be targeted but who texted me during the interview like I Can't believe how great to be quizzed contrast that with the frauds and the Democrats side\nElizabeth Warren putting out a press a press release

they don't want your money they want the whole economy and they try to frame it in\nThis could go to rich people ... people are getting over they're not paying their fair share of really\nBecause I saw a fascinating piece today I got a lot to cover today but I saw a fascinating piece and Bloomberg of all plan not a big\nHuge fan of the Web but once in a while they have good articles on economic and Bloomberg of all places talking about the actual percentages the rich and the very rich of our income tax they actually pay these numbers are going to blow your mind\nHere's the first\nIt's the same as you say something numbers so much it's the comparisons\nYou'll see what I mean in a minute the top one\nPercent of earners that's right earners people earn money top one percent of earners paying astonishing thirty seven point three percent of the income tax load in this country\nI think about that one out of a hundred people\nPay thirty seven cents of every dollar in taxes in this country are\nYou on that one for a minute\nYou may say okay well you know the one out of a hundred people at the top one percent they're very rich\nFolks the bottom Ninety percent meaning Ninety out of a hundred taxpayers the bottom Ninety percent few liberals who have a tough time with this kind of stuff [noise] pays only thirty point five percent of the income tax look\nTo pick up about this for a second this is why I just want to and love about Trump it's not just that he doesn't accept it out of the liberal settled by you're not that much I don't pay your fair share of the ... thing right\nYou don't pay your fair share you don't pay your fair share it's not that Trump just doesn't accept that he turns around and just throws it right out of the guard right on the garbage that narrative teddy starts over with a you know what they pay a lot they actually pay I think they pay to watch let's cut their taxes [noise] gone job\n\nThe top one percent of earners pay seven percentage points more of the income tax load than the bottom\nNinety what the hell's a fair share if that's not it\nYou hear what I'm\n... there's more about this isn't just that there's more of these comparisons in this this isn't a Bloomberg peace again NATO or something right wing website\nHere I mean his son and a negative way but I'm sure liberal listening will be like nah you got that from us some right wing slanted website there there was just trying to manipulate the fact is is from ... okay\nThe top one percent pay thirty seven cents of every thirty seven percent income tax load\nThe bottom line the only pay thirty\nBiases so sensitive to make us liberals are frauds they keep talking about his fair share some as John Kerry doctors boat in Rhode Island to avoid paying taxes what if we at Al Sharpton is tax debacle we uh ... you know Bernie Sanders what do we find out he pays less than twenty percent of his income in taxes to lead by example\nWe by example if you believe in what you're saying\nSee there's no hypocrisy here for Republicans we think taxes suck because we think outside of our military and our courts you flush somebody down the toilet bowl you don't know anything about the economy and you waste it which you prove us right all the time\nWe would rather donate it to charity and let the free market and friend charities handle it who can actually help people locally but no you suck up all our money you get a big tidy bowl flush flush it down to Paul and I'm Glad we got a president who doesn't accept this premise that all\nTheir share
