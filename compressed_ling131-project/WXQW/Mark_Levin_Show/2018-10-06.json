to\nIs the and I have ... from\nArgo then Happy Friday and I hope you have had a a wonderful day and are getting is that foreign amazing weekend it certainly has been an emotional time and no doubt or we're gonna have must see\nA TV going on about five o'clock eastern time tomorrow as the final vote or should take place approximately around that period of time but at this point given that Susan Collins made her speech made it clear that she is going to be voting\nAgainst foreign Brett Kavanaugh and then shortly after that Joe mansion Democrat West Virginia who is a Republican and waiting at this point I'm humans are all it seems like it's inevitable at at this point the mansion is going to go and make the move maybe after the election of but he is a he said that he is also an board so\nI mean it absolutely appears that there are the boats and in fact\nSomething interesting that developed out of Alaska\nLisa Murkowski voted no Republican Lisa Murkowski voted no she didn't want to end debate and again if debate and not end today basically Gavin I would've been dead though to be an aid right there on the procedural vote today absolutely critical to with her voting no uh you know she has come under heat\nFrom her constituents on the right\nAnd what's interesting by when you take a look at that in context is the way they've been going about it not screaming not protesting not people that are chasing her down in elevators but there have been a lot of folks\nThat had been to line up her office our phone calls from them know how can certainly are\nThere have been a pretty good pieces put out including one by the wall Street Journal that was amazing pointing out that hey you know if Lisa Murkowski or to have her way here the Ninth Circuit court of appeals would be kind of the final say if you end up having basically this split court and you had significant decisions that would impact Alaskans\nThe Ninth Circuit rulings ultimately if by their worn a decisive decision that the Supreme Court how would stand for all Africans\nSeems like at least a might now actually be reconsidering or taking a look at the most likely outcome here\nHe looked like it might be in that fifty to vote range and I we might end up there even though we were fifty one forty nine today now something that I have tried to lean on from a point of optimism throughout this process\nIs the positives that can be gained from all this how many people knew how many folks were on the Senate Judiciary committee until the past couple of weeks\nAvenue in many I mean even you and the student listener somebody who cares and is engaged in you know\nThat they were Twenty one members ... okay for twenty in Spartacus but didn't you know how many members of the Senate Judiciary committee there were we learn that line I mean one small detail\nBut for many folks because we don't teach civics in school this has been an opportunity and Canada and particular\nA Batman one he has been through and having a backbone of steel to see this thing through holy cow\nIncredible person definitely a role model a role model that we can all point to suddenly want to think Brett Kavanaugh's role is two fold one I think he taught history\nBy what he went through during this process and having a whole new generation of people engaged and paying attention the second thing is I think we have a new role model that we can point to one of the concerns of course has been well you know Trump's kind of Trump\nDonald Trump has been an incredibly effective president of the United states not necessarily the best role model right\nBut if you want to introduce their kids to somebody that seems to have all the ripe for priorities in the right places is the right way doesn't back down when he's faced with adversity you absolutely can point to Brett Kavanaugh now\nHow many folks necessarily knew how many Supreme Court justices their war before all this I'm sure you did but a lot of folks have learned that a lot of folks have learned about how the Senate actually works and that's important from a point of civic says well how delivered is the process is by design\nAll these procedural votes and everything that's happening now including the thirty our window that we're in as we wait until probably only five o'clock tomorrow afternoon for the final vote\nThere are a lot of things about our government we complain about a lot of things we don't like a lot of things that we should be frustrated by\nBut they're always opportunities and we're in one of those moments one of those historical moment and we can look back on and this could be an opportunity for a generation to learn what they never would have learned and I have an opportunity and the time of his first name was leadership to

and said allegations of sexual assault against him fail to meet what she called the more likely than not standard\nA walk you back real quick to the president's election twenty six thing I've done this for years for years are going back to the two thousand cycle but and he was most notable and twenty six team when I was able to\nEffectively and accurately depict Donald Trump winning the presidency\nBased upon the electoral college in a way I was able to do it is based upon historical trends\nSimply put you take a look at his ... back in a\nTwenty six team we had a full term Democrat who was president there has still to this point in American history never been a full term Democrat\nWho was succeeded by an elected Democrat not ever\nAfter eight years we tend to have enough\nThe only time it has ever happened many Democrats defeated a full term Democrat was Truman after FDR he inherited the office ESE later ran as the incumbent and one but because of that we tend to be incredibly consistent and all during the primary process\nEspecially here in Florida folks were asking me with Rubio running through is that Rubio more electable Trump's winning this can be good this and that ... vote for the person you believe in because the odds are\nThe Republican candidate will win and sure enough there you go now in the context of mid term elections\nYou're probably aware that the incumbent president's party loses generally\nIn fact there was only been three times three times since we had the two party system which started in the late Eighteen fifty is that the incoming president's party has actually gained seats only three times\nAnd they each happened with an inflection point in American history the first time was Nineteen thirty for FDR was president we had the great depression\nThe second time Nineteen Ninety eight we had the bill Clinton botched impeachment effort by Republicans\nPlugs employ American history and then the next one came for years later two thousand to George W. Bush and the wake of nine eleven\nSo it took a greater pressure nine eleven\nAnd the botched impeachment of Clinton to bring about the president's party gaining seats the average outcome in the mid term cycles that the president's party will lose four seats in the Senate thirty seats in the house it's just the average outcome happened this year Democrats regain control of everything now\nThere's no chance whatsoever that Democrats will gain foresee there's a better chance at this point the Republicans gained four seats the Democrats and Republicans are almost certainly at this point going to retain control the Senate man favorable for them Heidi Heitkamp\nHas pretty much done herself in in North Dakota she voted no today and what we've seen ever since she indicated that she was like oh there'd be a no vote about ten points about ten points with the worth of difference in her ways North Dakota and she was already endanger their Claire McCaskill\nOf Missouri voted no\nShe already was trailing slightly in the polls likely to end up being a big time issue for her\nAnd then Joe Donnelly in Indiana same deal voted no these are all big Trump states than you did have Joe Manchin of West Virginia voted yes Joe Manchin by the way is almost certainly going to be re elected on back of this you know when I've been taking a look at for ... and how much\nThis boat and ... and those particular states an average of about ten points ... or nay because those are pro Trump\nBroke having all states so the Senate almost certainly going to say but still the house you can take a lot of getting it have check any of the polls he checked decides to take a look at everything right now\nDoes not look good for Republicans looks like Republicans are facing somewhere in the neighborhood of about thirty losses which will be enough for Democrats to take control the house\nBut I continually have people say that they just don't see that happening they don't see it happening they don't see it happening\nBut my question is and this is what I'm working out because again I face everything off of information are we had an inflection point in American history\nIs this number four is Donald Trump as a catalyst just him being the disruptor as president of the United states then this Kavanaugh situation is that an analogous to what we went through and any of those other examples\nNot the great depression not after nine eleven\nBut if you're looking for a copy absolutely could point to Nineteen Ninety eight right there are so many similarities right now booming economy to what's going on right now in fact our unemployment rate is much lower\nThan it was a Nineteen Ninety eight\nAnd you have the president and well it's not as popular as Bill Clinton but then again he actually isn't specifically the issue here except that they made him he is he right we've had the more investigation we've had the Trump effort since before he even took office\nThat was certainly no it hasn't risen to the level of impeachment yes because Democrats are not in control the house I could be analogous you throw cabin on the mix maybe that is too\nSo this is all something that I'm working on right now is there a chance that Republicans really might gain in Cairo this year is is that moment and to and then inflection point in American history where things are different\nHistorically Ninety two percent chance that Democrats win more seats than not this year\nBut there was an eight percent chance that they do for a reason are we in that window will continue that conversation coming up next I'm Brian mud and for the great one\nMonth\nHim you are listening to six sixty that when you were executed out when you and your news that the information station\nI Can't stress enough that you must

I'm Still shocked by it you find this moment I didn't get any United States Senate or is that at least that I witnessed still\nAlmost beyond belief or if you did not catch Susan Collins her speech\nEarlier today it is definitely a must listen and watch so wide a take it in for sure\nShe really ended up ... down and uh want to get some of your thoughts but let's go to many in Anchorage, Alaska and and then they understand that uh you're you're you're a little higher on ... on to the point\nWhere they're from the standpoint Brian of\nA senatorial moment because I think quite Lindsey there last week it was on the for the Senate and have all the trappings that Lindsey lane do that every member on that Judiciary Committee eighty eight they're skinny [noise]\nOkay ... what they needed the hair I don't think they pay any attention to it but he took a stand in the heat of battle he didn't wait and see which way the wind was blowing\nThat's kind of way I look at it and I think that I'm going to say that um [noise]\nWe never Trump earthquakes in college was why we used to write count skiing with one and Jeff Flake was one I think that they had seen the attendance at Trump's rally safe place and they had four or five I lost count he's like the Energizer Bunny\nI think they and\nEnthusiasm ... rallies when\nPresident Trump was mentioned cabin I think I I'm sure you heard that too um and and so I just I I've been calling for her speech today but I really wanted to say how much I admire Lindsey Graham for really having a party\nIn there to really say what needed to be sent in those memories of that and Judiciary Committee there were acting uh well they are they all have their Spartacus moment I think\n[laughter]\nBut actually that you can be proud of but you know I Would agree with you as a probably Lindsey Graham sinus moment as well you talk about the the ... or ... ... eastern time tomorrow we're going to have\nThe boat and it was ... ... eastern time but Lindsey Graham a week ago yesterday ended up having that particular moment where it's better now\nRespectfully disagree with you just in terms of influencing in this particular case Susan Collins she was so principal and detailed as she laid out I don't think there was anything that she was going to be swayed by by virtue of simply be\nPragmatic yet emotional pull you won the Graham ah but ah but ultimately I not done take anything away from it really was a pretty incredible moment but speaking of Lisa Murkowski I'm interested to get your take a given that you are in Alaska\nSo she voted no today the heat is being put on her ultimately what are the implications in Alaska does she have a chance to uh to win her next election if she ended up going down this path\n[noise] well I I Wish I did\nI Can't say that Brian getting from the very top rated show in the afternoon Frank treated fix health care Iraq had left every day and and believe me that people I Can't\nRemember very many calls for him to run a hand for foreign lean all the other calls have man I'm I'm way how ... our cabin I\nGuess it's going to be interesting to see what happens there I actually think there's an outside chance that she ends up becoming a boat in the formative tomorrow I Know that the earlier today a in addition to her voting no to end debate she also indicated that he wasn't the right person at the right time for this country\nBut then she walked back through comments later in the afternoon after she started getting some of the response in so uh she'll be an interesting one to watch tomorrow although we should the likely be a formality which gives recovered by the way because you can go ahead and ... and vote in the apartment it because it's not going to alter the outcome almost certainly tomorrow\nAll right let's go to Dan Dan is in Clearwater, Florida Dan welcome to the show\nAnd thank you sir [noise] hey I'm I was watching and listening to a center con speech today and at first I was I was stunned I was amazed that was impressed\nAnd ... her speech I started going to damage control [noise]\nAnd I started going wow I mean the American public and and importantly to the Democrats the independents are getting angry and they need to lessen the damage and they were in damage control David lessen the damage to that [noise]\nThat's what I saw I think it actually hurts her speech was scripted she did not speak like the protests were threatened\nSo I don't think it was genuine I I think that they were really running damage control and trying to you know take the anger directed that they ... towards the end and the lesson that [noise]\n... where I Can't necessarily get along with that ... the level of detail starting from the very moment or that she depicted what happened at the time of the nomination ... she's detailed and chronicled at every everything that she thought ran afoul and I don't know that she would have\nHad that level of detail if she were just trying to rally here in the eleventh hour to try to save face for the moderates in the Senate\nI got this and what took place today was truly principal and and really was something that she was dead serious about every step of the way in and throughout the process including as she pointed out with all her other previous votes so I hear what you're saying but I'm just not in on the conspiracy thought",
