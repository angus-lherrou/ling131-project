a nearly two hundred nominees are still languishing many of them nominated over a year ago and they can't get at least the basic dignity of an up or down vote on the floor of the United States Senate\nAlso you just heard that last caller before we went to the break there are David in Silicon valley listening I'm assuming on the great chaos that vote they're out of the bay area uh a laughing at you\nHe's he's he's he's laughing at you he's counting you\nHe's saying we're going to Cape back power use the word power did you hear that we don't we don't use that we're doing\nWe take the reins of the government we assume the majority\nWe we ... we don't we're not looking for power when we get into office in the majority of the house and Senate our goal it's done properly as a conservative is to relinquish power from the federal government and give you the power\nBack\nThat's what you when you see the president's ability to deregulate so many things and cut down regulations in the EPA\nAnd in the U.S in the Interior Department and other parts of the government where they had slowly and in the city was taken so much control from you and your ... your ... or your state's rights to do run your affairs and run your lives the way that you see fit they have been taking that\nAnd holding on to that power in Washington DC that's why he use those words it comes naturally to the left we're going to take back the power\nIn twenty seven days than if not we will take to the streets where we can't let that happen can weigh eight seven seven three one three and one one I've got one more article here that I Want to do share with you\nAbout the insidious nature of the resistance and how it is stopping and and and disrupting the normal function of the federal government but I Want to get you in here as well\nHere on the market within show so let's start with Pete in Long Island listening on the historical legacy W ABC you're on the Merkel didn't show him Larry O'Connor\nPay Larry how you doing I'm could say a couple of things on where you have to take back the government in a way to do this protest I go on the lights to the march on Washington in January ... it's a piece called march\nHow many CNN\nAnd to be teased all those stations cover that much ... it's a piece called march\nYou got almost ... light showed up there this past year yup okay but I've been doing it for a long time okay we should march on Washington case only ... the senators and representatives that tell them when it's going to happen\nOf hedge down there and get and as he ...\nBefore you do and I will let you get your this thing but it's a you know you're so right in pointing out the march for life you know I I live in Washington unable to see the march for life and you're right it happened [laughter]\nUsually a the third or fourth week of January it's usually bitter cold out there\nIt is usually close to a million people use all the a video of the of the streaming mayonnaise in the streets or the Saturday after the confirmation vote for justice Kevin are ... you saw the video coverage of that nonstop on the news or do you know how many people were actually there ...\nProbably two hundred ... a little more than that I'd say it was between a thousand and Fifteen hundred but they had the most generous camera angles on them to make it look like the streets were just you just overflowing with outrage and and and it wasn't\nUm the but you're right you're so right out of the march of what doesn't in March for life doesn't get the coverage here's my question though we don't march I mean we're we're conservatives were good for maybe one march a year and it's the march for life may be a second march\nUh here and there but usually Eaton that's not our style right we don't have the big Soros groups who were handing out walking around money and passing out the pre printed ... sides\nTo march do you think we have it in us do you think that will set our jobs aside in our in our in our families aside so that we can all come to this country say can town Washington DC and march\nOr do you think that we let our voices be heard by actually being good Americans living our lives\nIf we can do that but you're not get down there and present are cases these people are voting on stuff for put in there by the people for the people themselves fat one at a thing is that how long it does I\nThink people put into power they start ... away right ... and that's what people are afraid to say that ... to no longer a Democratic majority in a communist we'd better wake up America\nAre paid was that the second point you wanted to make yes I did excellent\nPete and Long Island thanks for the call good to hear your voice on the mark living show about

the first black president to have the quote unquote ... black roots and black experience has mental that\nHis father was born in Kenya so his father's matter like what I've said before and people would dispute this but this is this the undisputed truth\nThere is no chance that block Obama's\nFamily is his ancestors on his father's side were slaves there's no chance whatsoever his father came from Kenya if they were slaves they would've been over here\nThere's a much better chance that his ancestors were slave owners or slave traders because that's what happened one tribe will conquer another sell them to the Dutch slave traders and then you know they bring them over here\nBut the interesting part is he doesn't have that heritage in his history and he doesn't really have the black experience he can\nTalk about all you know when I was a black man in Hawaii oh I bet that was horrible\nYeah it was just like Selma wasn't it is when I was in Honolulu boy I'm telling ya and with the

fine but he's not I mean somebody like\nA wind by Alan West or or you know anybody but see they wouldn't they wouldn't qualify because they would be Republicans and then there would be people on the left they were completely discount that because they Republican so their heritage or their experiences no can\nYou know Herman Cain would have been perfect I mean he was a guy who grew up in the

dot org brought to you by the national Highway Traffic Safety Administration and the ad council Hi this is Larry with some ...\nSage came up with is rather simplified evaluation of worrying it goes this way they're only two reasons for worrying either you're successful or you're not if you're successful there's nothing to worry about if you're not\nThere are only two things to worry about your health is going to be good or you're going to get sick that your health is good there's nothing to worry about if you're sick where there are only two things to worry about either you're going to get well or you're going to die\nAnd if you're going to get well there's nothing to worry about but if you're going to die\nAnd then there are only two things to worry about either you're going to go to heaven or not and if you're going to go to heaven there's nothing to worry about I mean so why worry there does seem to be an obvious point and this I mean if you're a life sentence with one who made
