the synagogue and Pittsburgh over the weekend\nAnd then lemon jump straight to blaming white people and Donald Trump for several of the recent events that have occurred after seeing that white people were the biggest threat in this country he went on to say there is no white guy band so what do we do about that [noise] so ...\nNews his lemons full quote yes and then now another one and then you have all of them in a row and you know we talk we messaged about it a little bit this weekend I keep trying to point out to people and not to demonize any group oh no or any one ethnicity\nBut we keep thinking that the biggest terrorist threat is something else someone people who were marching\nYou know towards the border like it's eminent\nAnd the last time they did this a couple of hundred people came and they you know most of them did get into the country\nSo we have to stop demonizing people this is Don Lemon businesses grow we ... we have some demonizing people in ... the biggest terrorist threat in this country is white men so we gotta stop demonizing people but will demonize white men the biggest terrorist threat in this country is white men\nMost of them are radicalized in the right to to the rights\nAnd we have started doing something about them there's no travel ban on them there is no ban on you know they had the Muslim ban there's no white guy man so what do we do about bad and first of all let me just say this Maori style or to is the name and Vicki Jones\nAnd they have been lost in all this to people were killed on Wednesday\nThat you talked about they had been lost in all this and I know that people feel that this story has not gotten enough coverage\nAnd we will honor them do not in our program but going Chris sorry so than Chris jumps back in\nSo it's a there we've got to realize the biggest terror threat in this country is white men [laughter]\nMost of them are radicalized to the ride\nMonday before dawn the limb and said he doesn't know of any instance where Democrats were killing folks [noise] [noise] and uh you know we when we don't even need to point to you know the\nMass shootings we don't even need to point to save the leaves you know of course he wasn't murdered but if that\nGuy seems releases the security detail with not been there and that would have been an ugly killing field I can tell you that that got with one of those ... nothing to stop him if if they have them if they hadn't shot him and killed him he would have stood there and blown every one of those people are way\nThank God he was a lousy shot but eventually he would have started hitting\nPeople because they just couldn't get away from him but I'm a above and beyond that we know now that half the murders in this country listen a little more than half the murders in this country committed by black males and I would never sit here and tell you that the biggest terror threat in this country has black men\nBecause I Know\nThat those black men who are committing half the murders are a small percentage of black men\nSo when we talk about terror threats and things like this\nThere are very few people that I Know the thing that all of Islam is a terrorist threat now you can say that the Muslim religion turns a blind eye to it or whatever the case may be I'm a little more hopeful than that but when we talk about terrorists we don't call them\nWe call them radical Islam right\nAnd that an accurate description of them you're not saying that every Muslim as a terrorist what you're saying is is that most of the terrorists that are trying to attack the country and this is largely from without you know outside of the country are radical Islamic terrorist\nAnd that's an accurate description but it is a specific description you're not saying that the entire Muslim world\nIs a bunch of terrorists although you will see some and you know the Pew Research center has done some research on this there are a lot of folks in the Muslim religion who condone it there are a lot of folks in the Muslim religion too many for my pleasure who who think that it's OK and surprising\nEighty seven percent believe and this was in Egypt believe I think it was eighty six\nPercent believe that it's OK to kill somebody if they leave the Muslim religion well that's the textbook definition of a terrorist or certainly a terrorist sympathizers how many white men are in this country compared to how many white men are out there shooting up a synagogue or whatever\nThis is this is the same left that tells us we're not supposed to stereotype that we're not supposed to supposed to plant paint with a broad brush there were just you know we don't do that and that's racist and then Don Lemon is telling everybody and Chris Cuomo then we've got to realize the biggest terror threat in this country is white men\nWhich is absolutely astounding and I don't know any white men that have killed three thousand people with an airplane do you I don't know any but that's the biggest threat\nAnd then the trying to tie this guy in the synagogue shooting the Donald Trump is absurd when you've got Donald Trump the biggest fan the biggest friend the Jews have ever had but they will not stop the relentless because you know they say they say November six coming\nAnd they are desperate desperate to wrestle some of that power away from the Republicans they're not going to be able to take the White House because that's not on the ballots so what they're going to try to do is trying to they're going to try to block Trump's agenda\nBy taking over the house and or the Senate now and tell you there's two\nWell they don't realize is that a lot of I Would say the damage I mean that in a good way a lot of the damage has been done by Trump to the liberals out there because we got the tax cuts we've got the corporate tax cuts the economy is coming back and they can't stop that\nCan vote all of these repeal of the tax bill they want but they'll never they'll never go anywhere even if they take back the Senate to they don't have a ... they will not have a veto\nThe proof majority so all he got to do was veto all of this nonsense that comes out of the bike so they\nCan't touch what's in place now what they can do is block everything else that Trump will join the doing the last two years of his first term and I'm sure there's a lot to be done lot still to be done\nAnd if we allow this to happen then what we're going to do is we're going to sort of stop the growth of this economy the economy will continue to grow but I can tell you the\nMarkets aren't going to like the fact the Democrats are in charge of the house and Senate even though they probably will have little chance of repealing anything that's going to hurt him they just don't like it and then everybody tells us the worst thing in the world for Washington is gridlock\nWell we ain't got gridlock now\nWe got Donald Trump we got some rhinos trying to block some stuff but we don't have gridlock in other words we don't have everything coming to a screeching halt the Democrats take either the house or the Senate and we got gridlock nothing gets done because they won't let anything you'd done\nAnd then we'll see where we go with that I just can't imagine I mean I've been saying this for six eight months\nI Can't imagine we get into November and the people look around and go oh all of this

Know the courts are going to be hostile to any effort\nTo curb birthright citizenship statutory poor by executive order\nBut I hear people say a statute with the stronger first of all they're not going to get a statue because it'll be filibustered in the Senate so it's a non issue the Democrats aren't going to allow it they want birthright citizenship\nSo with the filibuster rule in the Senate there will be no statute the president is aware of that\nThe commentators on TV even some conservatives they pretend they're not aware of it but we're all aware of it or what have been done already
