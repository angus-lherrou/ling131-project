moving to attacking Trump\nFor what's taking place and now it's fully open\nIt's fully open\nThat Trump's words and Trump's rallies and Trump's\nTweets are encouraging the sort of thing\nAnd I took a

go\nBut I Am now in my heart that presidents from bears a lot of responsibility for rhetoric fascinated ...\nDemocrats in the navy I wasn't targeted this is an unusual for the ... go ahead\nOf the reasons that it is fair to blame the president was ...\nSo it's fair in some sense what sense powder or it's\n\nThe president's rhetoric Jay pot for like Jay more on that\nIn some sense ... the you know let me ask you Jay pod of you guys over commentary written much about the repeated references to the president and Hitler I Would think that would offend you does that offend you\nOn cable news channels let's go to Steve Rattner go ahead ...\nCauses I think when you have a right or if it were kind of rhetoric we've had this guy over and over again\nIt has a price on that his call the media the enemy of civil and right now\nSo the president calls the media the enemy of the people and their ten moms I don't know if they're fake bombs real bombs whatever they are but they are obviously a terrorism threats as far as I'm concerned\nAnd that you see is what triggers everything I remember when Gabby Giffords was shot in the federal judge who was murdered I remember that ... that assassination attempt on her\nAnd it turns out the guy was a psycho and I remember how they tried to blame Sarah Palin quite frankly they tried to blame me in a few others nothing to do with any of this\n\nWe have these mass horrific killings of kids in elementary schools and there's the media\nAnd then you or your costs the enemy of the people of course we're not the enemy of the pie but what
