Saudi nationality\nIn response to the journalists get the White House may consider stopping arms sales to Saudi Arabia but President Trump diluted to the cost of such a move during a roundtable event at Luke air force base\nUh the the you know decades of of her\nThey eat invading our living rooms in a very shrill and unlike away or the idea of Trump being the person to name Supreme Court justices versus Hillary Clinton uh the promise tax cut the the rejection of identity politics there was a lot baked into the cake and the twenty sixteen election\nThe economy trade all those things but the Senate all aside for a minute if you asked the men on the street name me one issue Trump ran on the vast\nMajority would be building that while I'm protecting our border and Republicans I understand why in some cases but Republicans did not follow through for him they just didn't\nAnd they'll tell you it's because the Democrats stood in the way because of the filibuster and they'll tell you that it was because of the threat of government shutdown they'll tell you lots of reasons it doesn't matter\nThey've had the majority and if they wanted to if they really really wanted to they could have pushed for that wall they could have pushed\nJumping on board the president's agenda with regard to immigration the fact is too many of them don't want to either because they're getting their beds feathered by the u._s.\nThe commerce and other deep pocketed interest groups who do not want our immigration laws enforced as they're written\nOr it's because they're terrified that they're going to lose reelection but here's the thing they didn't get elected so that they could get reelected\nI don't know anybody who votes thinking yeah I'm going to put this person in the house of representatives so the two years from now they can win reelection\nI I'm going to vote for the senator so six years from now I can vote for them again their job is not to keep their job their job is to do with the voters expect them to do\nAnd they didn't they dropped the ball\n\nOn enforcing our immigration laws and protecting our border\nAnd and if if they lose in many respects it's going to be because of that\n\nOr let's go to Daryl in Portland, Oregon your next step on Larry O'Connor infer mark live in a Darryl\nHow're you doing [noise] God do I watch I watch\nThe border over the years her up in Chandler, Arizona\nAnd you know they actually had a fear that a fear of consequences that if they snuck across the border for a job and they you know ... you know food or whatever they did\nThat if they ever got caught they were going to get you know tossed out of the country they got to basically everything in there and welcome more than the citizens and the people standing in line trying to do it the right way there's no incentive to do it and if you think walls don't work so back to the Israelis\n[laughter] yeah exactly you know sterile it's so funny when you say you know I remember when I was younger and people didn't cross the border because they were you remember a that\nMovie from Cheech Marin from Cheech and Chong who was born in east LA you remember that and it was a parody song they needed a parody of born in the usa called born in east LA and it was in the entire movie was about him being well actually the irony is his character was not actually illegal but it was but it was about him on the run\nFrom border patrol and from immigration officials who were trying to deport him right\nOh if only they really were the case and what what has changed for God's sake that wasn't a movie in the eighties\nYou know ... in the beginning it was a ... can't think of who who was in Arizona at the time I mean hey who's been there forever I mean obviously it's not no longer with us but uh\nIt just ... it's slowly that came in more and more and more and then they became later and later on the consequences you know when you get here and now they're actually given them benefits like hey we'll take care of you know we want to have you know four or five ... go ahead\nOh we're not doing enough for him Darryl Darryl thank you for that call and we're not doing enough for these people who are in this country illegally it's it's funny I I I always hear from people but you know for those who have been here for many years and they become part of our society the ones who are law abiding tax paying\nA people in this country that even though they're illegal we should have a path to citizenship for them and it sounds great doesn't it they've been here they'd been law abiding they'd been paying their taxes they shouldn't be deported we should give them a path to citizenship whenever anyone says that you could you just follow up for a minute and say I get a hold on\nI'm sure there's a lot there here in the country illegally they've been here for years they're law abiding and they pay their taxes and they've got jobs\nCan you explain how that's possible because if they're in this country illegally for years and years and years and they've got a job\nAnd they're paying taxes on the money they make from that job then by definition they are not law abiding number one they've broken our law by staying in this country or entering this country illegally but number two\nIf they got a job that means they buy their lied\nAbout their documentation or they're using ... documentation quite possibly they're guilty as an accessory to identity theft\n\nSays so your argument\nIs that complete and total nonsense [noise]\nIf someone has been in this country illegally for years and they have a job and they are paying taxes they are by definition not law abiding they are continuously had been truly and on a regular basis breaking the law\nAnd the fact is one party in this country apparently still cares about keeping our laws enforced\nOr speaking of east LA let's go to Ken in Los Angeles my my ... adopted my my first adopted home now Washington is my second adopted him you're\nListening on the great age seven to the answer Carol A R I can ... what do you make of this\n... where I wanted to\nTalk to people about getting out and vote and I think that falls pole and ah [noise]\nAre convinced show for showing and Flanders also discourage people from voting yeah\nAnd the overall media onslaught fish the scourge many conservatives on the right from voting for their own land out seven percent of the u._s. can years they fall in older voted for President Trump pulled the primary for\nAbout twenty five percent of the general [noise] um do you see there are a lot of people that aren't voting and I think actually most of them would vote conservative is taken out and voted for\nMe I Can't do you think though at this point after what we saw in twenty sixteen and and with the new trends with regard to polling and how you know people don't even answer the phone on their cell phone if they don't recognize the number did you think people still do believe these polls do you think that I think that people just inherently\nUh believe that these polls are phoney and fraudulent there I mean one of the last time they were accurate\nYeah well I think often that's probably the case but it's it's similar to landers that people don't actually believe for him to her for what they believe that other people will believe him and they won't get out the vote [noise] shall we say\nThat lives in ... that is definitely the danger and and and Ken thank you for the call out there in LA uh I I don't disagree with you that is a danger I think though that this president the fact that he's rallying going out and doing these rallies or several times a week between now and election or the fact that the that Kavanaugh\nHearing I still believe resonates and I do want to believe that that was a motivating factor for people I think and and and and back to our topic of the hour that caravan\nI think what people turn on their television and see thousands and thousands of people waving flags of their country demanding entry into our nation\nI maybe I'm naive maybe I don't get it\nBut to me that is the greatest free advertising for Trump in the Republican Party that we will ever see who wants to be on the side of the party who opens up our borders and says you betcha come on and take whatever you want because that's what one party's position is\nAnd it's certainly in the Republicans I'm Larry O'Connor and you're listening to the mark Levin show much\nYou are listening to six sixteen that when you ... your

C. W. M. A. L. is uh in the nation's capital it's the talk radio station of record in your capital and I do the uh the show right before mark\nRipe for three hours afternoon Dr Larry OConnor I sit in for him then goes Marco events do on my way home I listen to market here's the thing I Can't listen to anyone else\nI'm I'm too afraid that I did my plans an idea that I Will inadvertently take or or you know purposely take a bath\nAnd and also it's funny when you get into the business it's harder to listen to talk radio because he you know you sort of know what goes on it's like a filmmaker's look at movies they don't look at movies the same way you when I look at movies because they're looking at how it's been put together sort of that way for me with talk radio now\nBut see with mark first of all he's incredible I Love the show it's very different than my usual show actually\nUm and and and frankly because he's on immediately after my show a you know I I'm going to buy these days the news cycle the stories what's important what's happening now changes five times before\nI'm On the air again Twenty one hours later so I can listen to mark and I love listening to mark the end and\nI have no fear of you know but it did taken any uh his his ideas are lines or his takes because by the time I'm On the air that it's all new it's all different so I Love this opportunity to be able to sit in for him and I'm so honored to be able to do it and that's a huge thank you as always to mark\nAnd to Richard and rich and uh and Stephen and everybody a Becker at the mothership who's who's helping out here [noise]\nUm ... much more to talk about here and I do want to continue to take your calls on this caravan and what's happening or south of the border\nAnd the fact that it is coordinated and it is planned and it was organized by may use the word organized because you know organized is sort of a a a modification of the term organizer or if I may community organizer\nYou see our nation had a community organizer in chief and what we're seeing here this is what community organizing looks like\nThe the the demonstrations the moms the the the screaming the disruptions of black lives matter or the ... disruptions of the United States Senate the marches in the streets the stopping of traffic\n... this is all community organizing\nAnd and I guess we should be used to it by now there's there's this really how we want decisions made in this country\nBased on the screaming in the streets based on thousands of people demanding entry to work so we're so we're now going to change our immigration laws and accommodate these people were not going to make laws in the United states of America\nBecause thousands of people from another country\nCharge across our border and demand that\nMaybe we will have a red way [laughter] you know honestly [laughter] maybe maybe if this is really their plan if they really think this is helping may and maybe\nWe'll actually grow our majority in the house the Republicans will 'cause this is this is\nThe greatest thing I think that could happen to Republicans if they stay the course\nAnd if they follow the lead of the president who has been the you know you may disagree with his tweets you may disagree with the little language he uses you may think that he steps on his own message sometimes you listen and and guess what I Would agree with you on hold on most of that\nBut on the policy\nOn the actual things that this president has been able to achieve\nI don't know how a conservative Republican on the whole\nCould have an argument\nFor what this president's been able to do with the judiciary with nominations to the courts with taxes\nWith military spending with foreign policy\nEven trade I'm not a huge fan of his rhetoric on trade\nBut so far the threat of tariffs seem to have gotten results\nUh and and as far as I'm concerned blow up the terrorists against China they are not our friend there are certainly not our economic friend [noise]\nSo we have Republicans could actually follow his lead on this end in ... and finally jump on board\nWith regard enforcing our immigration laws and drawing a very very firm line in the sand you know a line in the sand backed up with concrete rebar a steel\n... pretty high maybe barbed wire on the top maybe some drones patrolling where you can't build a concrete rebar steel line in the sand you know follow through on that\nYou'd be amazed you'd be amazed at how things will go\nA will continue to calls in a moment I Want to circle back to initiate on my friend Dan

the doors and\nAll that jazz and I've been doing for quite a bit on that story as well\nAh I recently this week got to interview Carter Page Carter Page of the central figure\nOf the spy gates scandal right [noise] uh and and the ... and he hasn't done a whole lot of media but I was able to have a quite an extensive conversation he's in the news this week and I don't know if you saw this but Carter Page has filed a defamation lawsuit\nSo that so since you're still using that brain I Want you to think about something what has happened to people historically who had gone against the wishes of Vladimir Putin's\n... do you think if if he is a spy for ... and you think who wants to that's out there\nSo either Carter Page is a spy and he's going to end up with a bullet in his head or he could

shark attacks white shark attacks\nAccording to the detective work on both coasts wanted Cape Cod and that was a catastrophe September fifteenth twenty Eighteen shark attack off Cape Cod the second uh I have read a profound worry but not Marshall\nA young man attacked off the California coast a south of Long Beach and I go now to someone who can help me understand these two attacks on two cos\nAnd why there might be a changing pattern\nIn great white shark attacks on people this is Chris Lowe ducks Chris Lowe he's director of the shark lab at California State University at Long Beach Chris a very good evening to you and thank you for this these two attacks ICU commenting in both cases one in California and one in\nA Cape Cod so let's start with the mortal attack in Cape Cod nine Fifteen Eighteen they closed the beach accordingly but why was a great white shark so close to the coastline and why was this particular man attacked because if I understand correctly comments he made\nGreat white sharks don't mean to attack people good evening to\nGet a link and um yes this is this is a question that that's been kind of burning scientist for a long time wider sharks occasionally bite people\nAnd in order to have that happen we have to have two things we have to have people in sharks in the water at the same time and place and figuring out what motivates us is really a challenge\nThe challenge it tells me that we need to discover some of the facts about these attacks the first attack ours are met a chi or from the Boston area\nHe was attacked while swimming and the shark attacked him so brutally that when he was pulled out of the water his classical was exposed but the shock didn't stay around a there was a trail of blood according to the eye witness who pulled him out of the water than the sharks swam away so\nIs it that the shark bit the wrong thing did the shock feel attacked do we know anything about what a shot why a shark attack some people and bypass as others\nWell I think we first have to get out why sharks might be at beaches that that people use and and in this particular case what's happened is the recovery of the gray seal population and and it's been pretty much all marine mammals have shown pretty dramatic recovery since there are protections seventies\nSo it's really been recovery of the gray seal population and gray seals using those beaches as important look rehab attacked because I was really the draw to bring in\nLarge adult white sharks to those areas to begin with\nOr I assume you know so it it's the seals and Cape Cod which are gorgeous but they're yeah they're the bait and uh that brings them in\nSo we know based on tagging studies that white church Rome entire stretches of ocean they covered thousands of miles a year\nBut their prey like like seals do use of land periodically and what it does is it concentrates that pray in one general area and whether that be off Cape Cod or off you know California off shore islands\nThose are the draws that that bring the sharks back from sometimes thousands of miles ocean migrations\nTo these areas where all their foods concentrated so think of it like you know being out on a on a\nHike or a cross country travel travel and and you come across a Costco and that's where all the food is concentrated in bulk and it's easy to buy everything you need well for white sharks that's kind of what the recoveries are acting like they're drawing them to these locations and they're great places for them to feed for periods of time\nTo the attack in and need is a pop a beach town near San Diego and on San Diego county this was September twenty nine twenty Eighteen Thirteen year old king have\nNow at the hospital was attacked by great white shark you've done very careful work because the shock didn't stay around to identify what ... uh who what attack keen\nAnd you've used DNA how does it work Chris\nWell you know all living animals have DNA and their selves and when those cells slough off their body into the environment they become part of the environment and believe it or not in the ocean there's literally a a stew of animals DNA out there so you can take a sample of water\n'em and you can actually find thousands of animals little pieces of their\nDNA that are specific to their species so we had I collaborate with a number of researchers have developed a technique where we can go out and take water samples\nAnd then filter that water down in probe\nThat stew of DNA from all these animals to determine whether something like a white shark has been present based on his left off DNA\nWe referred to that as environmental DNA so using it very similar approach what I was able to do is swab keen sweat suit where he had been bitten\nIn swab the troops marched with a ... Senate traded through the wet suit and then my geneticist colleague was able to go through and amplifying demonstrate that there was clearly white shirt DNA in each one of those gashes in his wet suit\n[noise] do you call it the DNA and uh this strikes me is the like CSI white shark here\nAre you a cut is kind of is you can you can scoop water out of the beach area in San Diego county and determine whether white shark has been there within hours within days because the way they use the stereotype of common place I learn from you\n... well that's the part we don't know we don't know how long that DNA can last in the water and how recently that sharks been there so in that case it sampling water when we're measuring what we call it environmental DNA that's where the e in the DNA comes from\nUm we don't know how long that DNA will last before it completely breaks down and we can no longer measure it so that's that's something that we're planning on doing next summer is to try and measure how long the white church DNA can remain in particular before it's completely gone\nBut in the case of the wet suit that was different because the shirts DNA had become trapped in the ... show in many ways that as a standard forensic techniques that you it's been used in forensic labs all over the world for for decades now\nI'm a marine biologist or kind of late to the party so we're just now starting to adapt\nSome of these techniques for use in kind of figuring out who might have been involved in a shark bite\nAround and made through at about October\nAnd and the question that we're trying to figure out is what makes Southern California beaches and good nursery habitat for white sharks\nWell a lot of shark species huge nurseries and the reason why they give birth in those areas just because it offers protection for their young it offers\nAn abundance of food and good conditions so that there's young can grow very quickly so that they can overcome many of the things that could potentially kill them in their first year so\nI think Southern California is a little bit different than what we see off Cape Cod\nAnd the reason for that is the adults are showing up at those beaches primarily to feed on seals but in Southern California we really don't see a lot of seals on our beaches there around me off shore islands and that's typically where we see adult white shirts\nThe birth it's a live birth and they're about five feet long that's a big baby but there is no nursing so this isn't a matter of a mother bear protecting her cubs\nBut I learned from you that sharks are warm blooded like human beings and the young sharp sharks are not ready for the deep water is that why they hang around\nWell that's part of it so what church or or what we call\nWarm bodied her into their ... and basically as long as they keep swimming they can keep their body warmer than the water now the babies are fairly small and they have all the same equipment to do that like the adults the problem is their bodies are so small that we don't think they're very good at keeping the heat that they generate\nAnd therefore they act more like a call buddy shark so during the summer one of the reasons why we think they're in so close to shore and such shallow water because the water's warmer there than it is further offshore\nThe other reason is believe it or not females give birth to their young and they're completely on their own so they have to figure out everything on their own\nAnd they don't know what is it threat so one of the reasons why we think they're in such shallow water is because that's a safe place for them there are fewer large predators and then the third reason is they have to figure out how to eat on their own and the most common thing we find in\nBaby white shirt stomachs or sting rays which in Southern California\nCarpet our sea floor so this makes it easy abundant food source for them for a naive young shark like a baby white shark\nI also learned that they migrate from your area long be San Diego county to the south or at least they have here to for and you raise the issue of whether they're ... they're changing their pattern because of El Nino or El Nino or ... Nino or is it climate change can we tell Chris\nWell we're we're still learning about that but so far we've learned that the young white sharks are temperature sensitive they don't like water too cold and when our water temperatures dipped below sixty degrees that seems to be a cue\nFor them to migrate south to warmer water softball hot during the winter um the following spring similar sharks return to Southern California\nBut what we noticed was during the strong El Nino that we had in two thousand Fifteen our winner water temperatures never gets below sixty five degrees and none of the shirt so we had that year left they stayed so what that told us was that El Nino can completely changed their migratory patterns\nAnd the other thing that we're learning is that as our oceans are warming we're starting to detect not just baby ... church further north but adult white sharks are now being more commonly detected off Oregon and Washington and even British Columbia\nAs the war\nThere's no water warms so great white sharks like warmer water or they can range into the deep cold correct\nThat's correct and but it can't spend a lot of time in those gaps so typically they like water temperatures kind of um\nAbout sixty degrees up to maybe about Seventy eight degrees so for adults they're a little bit more temperature tolerant they can tolerate greater exchange and temperature but young ones have a very ... fairly narrow temperature range that they like\nShow but what we're seeing is as our global oceans warm\nThose warmer temperatures are starting to occur at higher latitudes than we're kind of an issue so what we've been telling people is look you may live in a place where you've never had to experience white sharks before but the ocean is changing and you should keep an eye out because\nAs the ocean warms we might expect white church to march further north\nI understand there's an experiment underway in your area San Diego county something called the clever bully it's my turn into a mass production it's to warn of sharks to warn to stay away from sharks out as a clever but we work\nSo that clever bully uses sonar so basically it's using the sport fishing sonar ships you download fishing Soner but this sooner points out in by using in a series of these forwards facing sonar bullies you can basically create a video image using\nSound to track objects that move through that\nSo now sealed so the idea there is you can have these ... and you can have a shark move through that\nAccrue stick or sonar field and you can identify that target and say that target you know is the target of a dolphin or that a shark or you know that's an eight foot shark no that's a ten foot shark so the technology has great promise it just doesn't cover a very large area and it's very expensive\nIt requires a lot of power to to power the soda\nSo um it it could\nProvide some really interesting data now the question is the California coast is huge so the question is can we even cover enough for the California coast to make a you know technology like that effective as just simply a warning system to let us know when large sharks maybe within coastal waters\nYou put the first one uh south of the bell bow appear you know these things I Do not in Newport Beach and that gained a lot of attention has been effective so far is it warned anybody away from a great white shark\nI'm not to my knowledge and again that's that's not my work that's that there's a company that right\nYou know markets this product um you know we're very interested in their results but so far we haven't heard of any I'm so to be very interesting to see what that technology turns out and and even though they're covering up very small area it will be interesting to see how effective it is\nIn in a death defying the difference between sharks and white sharks and leopard shark some of our non threatening species\nAnd then of course dolphins and ... and some of the other wildlife that occur along the beaches\nYou tag great white sharks ah when fisherman bring them to and you follow them uh and that data you're accumulating now have you learned anything new from that that at in this changing pattern because of warming we have about a minute Chris\nSo over the last ten years we've managed to tag about a hundred and ten juvenile white sharks and actually we've learned quite a bit about their migration patterns we've learned about what what cues may drive those migrations and right now we're learning about\nHow the young ones find it a nursery beach and how much time they spend in that habitat but we still don't know what makes a good nursery habitat nursery\nSo we need to develop new tools and that's something we're working on now or developing a ton of\nUnderwater tracking robots and and water sampler so we can measure for white shirt DNA well using drones so we're using a variety of technology to try to answer those questions so we can predict from year to year where my T shirt show up\nChris Lowe Dr Chris Lowe is the director of the shark lab at California State University Long Beach or jaws these the very famous movie from the twentieth century but here in the twenty first century it's much more helpful to think of it from the sharp point of view as we'll watch the change in global temperature\nVisit the John ...

Bob\nBehind the black he's also the author of genesis the story of Apollo\nAway the great success of the ... century in space was Apollo ate at Christmas Time Nineteen sixty eight the audio version is available\nWe turn now to the leading space program in Nineteen sixty eight and it was at NASA at that time Ross cosmonauts had racked up all of the successes so we come here to the twenty first century and it's not quite tortoise than hair things have changed\nThe NASA six has just turned into commercial space success that we will address and soon enough but we begin with the aftermath of the so use MS ten crash the two astronauts cosmonauts were rescued happily\nThe investigation continues quality control is always an issue with Ross cause most do does this delay the launch scheduled because after all Congress has left us with only one way to and from ... says Bob a very good at being too\nWell John as it appears the Russians are confident they will not have to lay the next land the law in Charlotte Shaw use which is scheduled for December\n... and the reason they say that is they expect to be pinpointed what the issue is within a week of now that's what they said that that that investigation is going to do\nAnd they say they want to do at least one of the large for the manned flight but the truth is they have at least three Shaw use launches scheduled before December already one is going to go from a French gay on the air and space site\nUm they're going to do another progress Schrader and a week or so and then there's another a Russian military large for using his show I use as well all within the period before December\nEven though those are all different variations of the show use rocket launchers people\nUm the ... components that are or affected by the failure on the same\nAnd so they think those launches and combined with the investigation they will be very confident that the December launched go God I have every confidence that they're going to identify the specific problem that cause last week's launch pad yeah and they're going to fix that\nWhether they can identify while we know what it is the way they can fix the underlying culture that is allowing these failures\nTo Kurt greater frequency in the last few years I have great doubts I mean the culture that's causing this is that they've organized the space program as a single giant corporation controlled by the government it's basically a Soviet style top down system\nHas no natural process competition and that culture\nMeans at their space industry has nothing to forced to do good work except political pressure\nAnd under that situation and there's a limit to how much they can fix this it's kind of similar to with NASA NFL is there have been repeated Ga oh an inspector general reports over the last decade tainted badly managed\nAnd natural agrees on this point at that point but then they actually ... you know that's just the way a few months or a year and you'll see another idea and share your report saying it's badly managed the same thing without competition you get this kind of problem\nSo the rocks cause most are providing now the journey to and from my assassin does that mean we no longer need to entertain an unmanned I. S. S. Bob\nIt looks that way yes and I think it makes sense that plan right now I mean if they get three ... launches land off before December and they pinpointed what the issue isn't they've done some corrective it's you know check to the latest so used to make sure they are the same problem I don't see any reason why December cannot launch\nAnd they would have about a month leeway now so I use that they would come back on\nIts life or its warranty runs out in January said a little bit of play that I should add by the way to things about space wall swans they're gonna do the December space\nWalk maybe in November to inspect the outside of that so I use because that's the one with the drill hole in it that was caused an leak that's one and two the two astronauts said didn't get into space last week were trained to do all the maintenance solve\nA space walks on I. S. S. and Russian say they want to launch them in the spring because they're trained to do those space walks network needs to happen\nAnd so we're looking at is not only will we not see a delay but the crew that just had this accident is going to probably be on a Russian uh saw use very soon thereafter\nBobby you have the excitement of first man as a review on behind the black or I'm upbeat because that's a high point I think of this review a first name what is the\nFirst man was a was a biography written of Neil Armstrong that has been now turned into a movie first manned by Hollywood and a few weeks ago you might remember there was a ... fold because\nThe star of that movie Ryan Gosling has Canadian implied in an interview that the achievement was that Neal Neal Armstrong didn't consider this American achievement it was a global achievement interview him self as an American hero\nAnd I'm quoting here and that and it was in ... contacts within mentioning that they left out the scene in which the astronaut plan the American flag on the road and there was a big align myself said that's really ridiculous this was an American achievement\nFor the world the world had nothing to do with it other than it spurred us to us to do it\nAnd they got a lot of flak for it and bad publicity the direct to shed no no no I never intended to reduce the American presence I just wanted to focus on Neil Armstrong's personal story well you know I decided I haven't seen the film so my criticism is maybe a little unfair so as soon as it came out\nI made an effort to find time to watch it and my wife and I went to see it a earlier this week\nAnd I have a review on behind the block and titles first ... triple lot trivialize Ina lunar landing\nBecause even though they do include the American flag out on the moon and they do in the food that you know it's very clearly an American achievement and they make some comments there and they're about how this is an American a triumph\nUm there's no question at the movie completely ache or eliminated the Cold War aspect of it the American triumph terror of\nAnd in that sense it was so focused on Neil Armstrong's partial story on his personal in inner workings which I'm not sure I Believe in any way that they completely miss that greater epic tale which is one of the reasons the film falls flat\nAnd why it's not getting great word of mouth apparently the only reason I don't think it's getting good word of mouth is that they portray all the astronauts has decided this likeable I mean the Armstrong in particular are seen as a lump salty and articulate an extrovert introverted\nHe also is portrayed as a jerk who really treats his wife and kids badly\nMy wife said Diane said I Want to ... I wanted to smack him upside the head\nAnd I kind of agree you know some of the action of snow question because they get where they had to go they they had a ... or their families a lot of them\nAnd they therefore jerks I mean I just adding to eat a lot of astronaut today admitted but a lot of 'em really tried to make up for it and a lot of ways this film didn't give that impression it just showed on strong as a jerk and and why would anyone want to see a film about\nThis [noise] you know there's a great epic tale here and if you just focus on a person's floors in this epic tale you lose

the way is been a huge commercially by a ... was a little bit late to gain a lot to grow up in Fort and Terry's rocket to put ... up to supply assets um they they come or tried to commercialize it a few years ago when there\nTrying to get customers all they've got a big customer now they picked up a ... thought important customer this week a rocket lab the company a it's a U.S company but it's mostly been based in New Zealand building an electron rocket to small set rocket tiny rocket\nI'm to put up many satellites cube SATs that kind of thing\nUm they uh been launching they launched one successfully out of New Zealand they've got two more launches ... later this year this year from New Zealand if they those go well they're going to go really operational in twenty Nineteen\nAnd everything points to them possibly launching once per week we live crepes at a regularly rockets only slightly larger\nSignificance than a model rocket but only within not much difference\nAnd so they announced that they're going to make that first us based sport at ... island\nAnd uh what this means is they want to be in a position that they have to launch sites where they can actually do as many as a hundred and thirty launches per year that's more than twice a week that's almost three times\nA lot of ... what does that yeah almost three times a week and they have they said their goal was all along I taught I gave a story with you I think last week about how they've also unveiled their um production pills lady\nFor making these rockets on assembly line basis on a quick basis and uh so it looks to me like one twenty nine tables around they're going to be a\nI'm off to the races with lots of launches Chuck\nBob Wallace island was originally used I think as far back as the Nineteen

ancestor organization and they used it for scout\nSub orbital sounding rocket tests for things like ... and rocket engines and so forth and it wasn't and they see a facility and the ... for doing those kinds of tests well eventually NASA couldn't afford to do it because the government agency they can't do it cheaply until they shut down\nUm and it still exists or and so they want they've been trying to turn it into a commercial site and they've had some success now and this is a big deal this\nIs ... and so going back to ... that's good for the area that is good for diversity and it's another space for it to a bit it's going to get private commercial contracts that's why I'm excited about it Bob I didn't know was comic\n... it's coming it's common and so twenty Nineteen we could see a one launch possibly a week from rocket lab really here are New Zealand real\nBar I find that just exciting as it gets because it's the east coast here to four I thought everything was out there

straight to gas the dry ice I'm like on earth are you begin to see the Swiss cheese holes developing within the plains of the ice cap\nAnd so that's what you got and so I ... they taken a lot of pictures in the last month this summer of the polar cap because I'm a because of the global stalled and they couldn't really take many middle latitudes pictures and get good results so they focused on

Jeffrey you tell a wonderful story however the German troops are far more better trained ... better artillery better machine guns better generals and the Austrians and the Russians both lose armies will fall apart in the course of the years but there's a story that is just compelling to me Geoffrey all about so\nEither wanted to read Greek or can read Greek or can identify with is a man is shut a German soldier so shell shocked by his side in the west that when he's transferred to the east to fight again against the Russians\nYou observed in the source material that he hit there staring at the ground reciting long passages of the odyssey in Greek is that typical story of the shell shock in the front or is just to stand out among all the other sources\n[noise] well I got that anecdote from the memoirs of Harry Kessler\nAnd a cat Serbs or that and go through wrote that down and he said it was emblematic of the difference between the fighting on the western and the Eastern Front and Nineteen fourteen he said\nThat the western front was so much more industrialized so much more intense\nThe concentration of of men machines artillery ... was so much more lethal than on the Eastern Front where things were spread out quite a bit more the armies were less heavily on the the the stronger and I was very deficient our children the Russian Army\nGuy was better than they are trends but compared with the Germans quite efficient as well plus the spaces where my just much bigger so you had fewer\nYou if you are men in guns per square mile or kilometer\nSo you the the concentration of fire was was\nAbsolutely mind bending on the western front and and ... was was saying you know when they got replacement ...\nFrom the western front and when they moved divisions from the western front to the Eastern Front in Nineteen fourteen to bolster the ah to bolster the Austria Hungarian war effort these guys are showed up where you know they had a much higher percentage of shell shocked guys than than a German or Australia has been serving\nThroughout on the Eastern Front but this explains\nWhy Annenberg and looting doors\nThought that it made sense to try to win the war in the east not in the west and they were always disputing with most of the younger and then fall can high and about the focus of the war\nA late ... north thought it was impossible to wait on the western front because the British and French which is to industrialized\nThe uh the the the British industry and subsidies we're creating a you know incredibly a solid trench works lots of artillery lots of Shell's yes there is a shell shortage in the war but the correct this\nAnd then they become stronger and stronger throughout and ... said we can't break through on the western front because these western allies are so well armed the Russians on the other hand\nWe can break through there because there's more space as more space for maneuver and the Russians are pathetically armed versus the the British and the French\nOr they were they were fairly well armed at the outset but then they're blockaded throughout by the by the Germans\nIn the in the Baltic to close the Baltic porch and the Turks who joined the central powers\nAh they close to the black sea port so the Russians so the Russians aren't able to get in any machinery and not able to get any artillery but not able to get in any shells or or or or bullets for the rifles in fact uh the throughout the war\nAbout one third of the troops in any given Russian unit have rifles two thirds attack without rifles and pick up rifles\nFrom Atlanta that was a reason for the Germans to launch the war in the first place I Believe I read you correctly they knew the Russians are bench Lee would be better armed and so they had to move now before it became impossible\nYeah and they probably and they and they didn't they didn't realize how just how badly they were they didn't realize it was as bad as it seemed\nAnd so in Nineteen fourteen Fifteen and then you know Nineteen sixteen Seventeen Eighteen as well or or in the end and burger looting or say look we have to seek decision\nOn the Eastern Front because they are the Russians are big but they're ramshackle we kick the door and the whole thing will fall down whereas we can't punch true in the west once we take the Russians out\nAnd we are they conquer them altogether or we force them to make a separate piece with us we can then focus everything on the western front and we can defeat the French\nBritish Hynden burg and looting Dorothy to work together and they will take over everything eventually and Seventeen and Eighteen but here they build an office chair and eastern army of twelve core six more coming and they attacked the Russians and roll up and norm is numbers of prisoners dead and ... are dead and wounded\nAnd killed and five hundred thousand they just roll right through the Russians\nAnd they want Conrad to work with them to attack from the south ... Conrad because he won't he ineffective and at this point is looting door thinking about taking over Conrad's army he will eventually but he did he think at this early November well\nThey'd been the ... the Germans were were effectively taking it over in the sense that they were increasingly coming up with ideas and increasingly a compelling Conrad to execute those ideas going over his head to the emperor in Vienna if he refused\nBut the problem the problem was is that you know you have the Germans on the left and the center and then the the Austrians in the center and all the way down there right so if you're going to have\nA big operation where you try to roll up the enemy flank the Austrians really have to participate because the Australian because the Russians are so numerous and but it the the Austrian is just ... whenever they attack\nTheir blown backed by the Russians and they and they lack the artillery they lack the infantry tactics to actually launch an effective attack and get through the Russians so they make these half\nHearted efforts to join these German offensives in the east but every time there stymied thrown back and then the Germans are less fighting alone without a flank in Austria Hungarian Army to assist them\nA sidebar to what's going on in the battle ... suddenly enormous casually numbers\nI just introduced me to what looks to be a fresh information about what happened to the Jews in the Austrian Hungarian empire that by the Nineteen thirties Nineteen twenties Nineteen thirties they were scapegoating by such as the national socialists\nThe dislocation of the Jewish villages in ... is co tournament it's with these offensive actions the enormous numbers of army marching through the blasting and the threat those Jews are what they're they they travel naturally to Vienna for support is that correct Jeff and that's where\nThe Jews have to live again having been driven out of their villages and they participate in the black market in Vienna\nYou know the uh the ... was the most was the most densely settled part of the ... and settled by Jews\nUh there were three nationalities living there polls Ukrainian Jews but there was a a large a very large Jewish presidents that extended from ... northward into Russian pole and which is why the Holocaust as is focused principally in Poland and Ukraine when the Nazis come that way\nIs that was the old Russian pale of settlement which extended down into Austria Hungarian Galicia as well um and so what happens is the uh because of the Russian tradition of pogroms and because this intense Russian anti Semitism I mean the Russian moves sheiks the Russian President soldiers", "show_name": "The John Batchelor Show", "year": "2018", "city": "Fairhope", "day": "20"}
