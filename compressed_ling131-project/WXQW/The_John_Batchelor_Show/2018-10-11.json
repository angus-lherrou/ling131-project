that international organization so that really calls into question all of the Chinese Communist party members who are working in foreign organizations as to whether they can impact the loyalty that organization or simply agents for the interests of the Chinese regime\nYou know Charles this strikes me as I Know there's a sense of overreaching them see jumping that he demands absolute loyalty he gets a ... he gets signs of it in China and now he thinks he can get absolute loyalty from foreign organizations as well\nAnd it just seems to me that there is something that's going on in Beijing I don't know what it is you know it could be over the years it could be over blowing blade a businessman turn tell all\nWho knows but the point is that China is done something to black and its own reputation and this is something that's going to take a very long time for the Communist Party to recover from if it ever recover from it\nAnd essentially we're looking at\nUm probably intense political struggle at the top of Beijing because something like this wouldn't happen but for problems at the top of the political system [noise]\nYes I think it's indicative of issues in within China\nBecause of the hero of the sheep policies some both leading to the United states finally I'm responding in a serious way to China's flaunting of international conventions and create\nA

expectation of political loyalty from these rogue regimes there's also low so the policies are just not working the way that that she had promised [laughter]\nAnd I think that this is sick causing

well he gets a lot of credit things were going well up until last year so strengthen his himself politically but now as you point out um China's being challenged it has problems all over the place so you're saying is being blamed for these problems\nAnd now he's reaching out and trying to hold others accountable so they're going to be a number of scapegoats here there's going to be intense political fighting\nEspecially because the jumping as the institutionalized the Communist Party\nThis seems to me to be extremely serious this is shaking not just one official among them way this is shaking the entire Chinese political system and therefore shaking all of China\nI Want to press hit Charles Wang ... and has a remarks towards secretary of state dismissive remarks mentioned in one

United states could kick\nCanada out of the U.S Mexico or Canada trade agreement within six months and so I think that had a considerable chilling effect on our government's enthusiasm for seeing

know focus and Washington and elsewhere and even in the ... even the Germans and I realize hey China is not our friend it's not our partner\nMe up to be much more circumspect I don't think China hasn't responded primarily because think about what time of year you're basically asking to China could basically ... ... do you have a different model from the past twenty or Thirty years and it just isn't ready for that that doesn't know how to respond and challenged\nYeah I think you're right freezer because what we see is you know confusion on the part of ... you know for decades they've been able to get their way they've been able to you know smile and that doesn't work they'd been bullying they'd been been intimidating they almost always gotten what they want\nNow they run into somebody called Donald John Trump and it's not working for them and I don't think that they know how to deal not only with Trump but also as you say\nWith the English with the Germans with everybody else this is a real moment as time where the world to bits and adopts the new policy and Beijing has yet to figure out\nHow to deal with this\nThing that's right because the Internet and below campus made a big play for the day and that's how we how do you think of started to big that's one thing I Would argue are pretty ... drove the overall relationship between China but even if China just starts buying more stuff from the states where there's more oil already high energy or ... or whatever\nOn on demand that doesn't solve the problem on level playing field when it comes\nChina doesn't solve the problems is the political problems in China you know and and China clearly it's if it's not panic it's clearly self flailing around and you look at the Interpol chief that the Chinese ... that only two years ago\nAnd here he is being disappeared in China under investigation for corruption so much for the anti corruption campaign that he gets position Interpol two years ago in the first place whenever you look at China that that and\nYeah and and when this this whole thing about currency manipulation I think is endlessly fascinating for decades China yes did manipulated currency in other words they drove the value of the ... down in order to gain a treaty advantage for their exporters\nThis year of course the remedy is falling precipitously against the dollar and other currencies but it's not because of Chinese currency manipulation as we define that term it's because the Chinese themselves don't want to hold their own currency\nSo they would actually supporting the room and be and that's the opposite of currency manipulation and that just shows the fragility of the Chinese system and I think we're going to see other symptoms of that fragility in the economy in Beijing has got to deal with that in a hostile environment because countries like the U.S are not trying to support any more\nPraise or I Want to press two we spoke with Marcus our colleagues about Hong Kong and how it's regarding these\nTroubles moments how is Singapore dealing with the disorder in on the mainland China because Singapore is a prosperous community and not not a small amount of it depends upon

basis in the hundreds of thousands of the containers on so global trade is important to them that always concerned about trade wars\nThat always concerned about China and climbed in there to depend on Chinese as well but ultimately the sidelines clearly nowhere near the thick of it in the way the Hong Kong is but a lot of people in an age are wide because he simply don't know how that shakes

changing and we just don't know where this is going and what you just talked about in terms of uncertainty I think is a scene that you hear around the world\nThat we just don't know how all of this is going to shake out because we're seeing policies in Washington and other capitals that we have not recognized we haven't seen him for decades\nFive I think that's right and I am or even they are a number of months ago being interviewed and asked about you know impact for the trade war and I said to the trouble is is there's a new one alive today who knows a trade or looks like\nAttitude no [laughter] so how do you measure these two candidates for the attitude no Donald Trump good evening to\nGet him to you John well those individuals are extremely accomplished a very smart people I'm\nDina Powell as I understand it I had served in the number to post at the national Security Council under a general McMaster when he was national security advisor very close to ... you will recall that the president then\nDispatched with general McMaster and replaced him with John Bolton to one of the big reasons why\nTrump replaced faster to fold actually one personally they didn't have much chemistry they just didn't get on but the other reason is at McMaster as accomplished as\nHe was an is make master in many ways was deep state neck master was established meant McMaster was off brand to Donald Trump and\nWell he shared a lot of the president a policy inclination he worked against him in a lot of ways because he still cared what establishment thought and to preserve tablets Schmidt influence a\nFantasy and brought in a lot of foreign policy establishment types that were working often at cross purposes with the president and his immediate team on major issues like ending the Iran nuclear deal getting out of the Paris climate accord\nConfronting China on their currency manipulation in the trade deficit renegotiating NAFTA and so on they were just too many problems in the next master relationship it wouldn't make master\nWas fired or let go a dino Powell is deputy you also chose to leave because she didn't want to work after John Bolton that all of that's understandable I think that\nUh the president's daughter Yvonne coach was very influential probably suggest it to the president that it would be wise after the Kavanaugh hearings to replace a woman with a woman and maybe that argument has had some traction with the president he might understand politics in those terms\nBut I think Dina ... herself as accomplished as she is is off brand for the president and setting aside a gender issue here and looking at\nLooking at the equation as\nWe really need to please Nikki Haley was someone who will continue making good progress that she has made at the un I think Rick Cornell is far far better choice were Grinnell it's like an extension of President Trump is fearless he is anti establishment\nA by the way he would be the first openly gay a UN ambassador\nUm which would be sending a real signal that the rest of the world wouldn't it\nOut and Cornell is he ... he spent many years at the United nations under five us un ambassadors\nNominated by president of both parties Brock Obama George W. Bush until one he's got a wealth of experience he knows the institution better than anyone I've ever seen it he knows diplomacy part of the problem I think John is that\nIn some ways we're Grinnell victim of its own success has been a tremendous US ambassador in Germany he's essentially one of the few us ambassadors on the continent who actually know what they're doing is had tremendous success in leaning on German corporations\nThere was like seem in Sendai Muller stop doing business with Iran\nAnd the face of new sanctions on the Iranian regime and the withdrawal of us from the Iranian nuclear deal he has to hit the ground running he doesn't waste any time he picks up the phone and talk to the CEOs of these companies himself it goes all of the the hard work and I think the president like having him there\nI mean the word is that the German Chancellor Angela Merkel is a little free to ... which is and I think the president that we think the president might be a little owes to remove him from the center of Europe and bring him to New York at the un\nBut my feeling is that he should because I think given all the success he's had in Europe he could have even more sitting in Turtle Bay confronting all of our enemies and dealing with our our allies on a more regular\nPost common armonica we have to we must anticipate that this is a ... cent post\nAnd that the Senate will weigh in and that very loud voices um voices we heard during the cabin on happiness will speak again there are several senators running for president\nOthers raising money and these last days now this process wouldn't happen until after the election but in any event that's an opportunity again to raise your profile for the Democratic primaries\nThat begin pretty much the competition begins right away and twenty nine teen speeches in Iowa so I Know that MSNBC and the word ... correspondent for MSNBC Andrea Mitchell has already declared Grinnell very controversial talk for unacceptable\nBecause the explanation he offended and the angle America all bats that's in translation he's not all want Abbas okay far no that's the recommendation but it's also warning Monica didn't Mr where no one through a rough process to get to Germany didn't it was a long way and now\nLong way thanks to the Democrat Chuck Schumer\nAnd now they're re armed so does I mean it does Grinnell want to face a pummeling again after Kavanaugh\nAbsolutely he would uh work as a as a friend of mine and he is absolutely fearless and the recommendation that he makes younger Merkel nervous is a good thing and the president seizing loves Rick because he's a fighter [noise] um\nI also think you know the assumption that Dina ... which through it's also a big assumption I mean we don't know what they're after the Kavanaugh education I think anybody that the president puts out for a major nomination is going to have to go through the ringer\nTo the question is who is willing to take this on who is willing to fight back\nI mean I think either one of them would be up for the fight but I think if you weren't looking for major major appointments in the cabinet at the un Oregon engines of the president and his populist revolution then I think the choice is obvious said it's Rick right now\nJohn Bolton a longtime colleague of bars and I miss him I'm sure John Bolton but you're in the national security advisor and you're you're not permitted to talk freely John Boehner said the favor Richard gr no rich Rick Cornell is that because that's sensible the Monica that the national security advisor wants to have a\nA a voice in choosing the ambassador to the United nations\nYeah of course you recall that John Bolton served as the U.S ambassador to the un he knows the institution very well after\nBeing ... by the Democratic Senate led by Joe Biden yes I Do recall\nThat yes and remember that President Bush had to a point there during the recession made it research appointment because Bolton was so controversial and the Democrats made his life hell I'm\nI remember that ... ... it was only there for a limited period I think it was a year\nMaybe because it was a recess appointment and so bold and made tremendous progress there but he couldn't he didn't have enough time to actually start to reform the institution which I Know is really heavy lifting it's turning around a battleship in the

worry about if you're not\nAre they are only two things to worry about your health is going to be good or you're going to get sick that you're hearing is good there's nothing to worry about if you're

then there are only two things to worry about either you're going to go to heaven or not and if you're going to go to him and there's nothing to worry about I mean so why worry there does seem to be

development between two base to large sea bass that are part of Eurasia future is just the Caspian Sea bass and whereas or by John happily dwells\nWith its energy resources and the black sea bass and we're both area along with other nations happily dwell the inland sea leftover from the changes in the ocean levels tens of thousands millions of years ago\nBulgaria however I learned from the news most recently visited a delegation from Bulgaria and visited ...\nSpeaking of ... energy and prosperity and military cooperation madam ambassador a very good evening to you the relationship between Bulgaria and Azerbaijan it's not obvious when you're in New York how does it work what do these two nations signed\nIn each other ... coming from different parts of Eurasia to work together good evening to\nMake and it's the bachelor and thanks for having me you're absolutely right either by John and they'll get a a a um strategic partners and in fact ... biggest part in the caucuses\nAnd as far back as three years ago in two thousand and Fifteen when my president visited Bulgaria there was an important document side reclamation all strategic partnership that\nCovered all these areas that give just mentioned it also it um elevated to let a lot of friendly enabling relations between our countries to the level of true to your partnership and\nThen they find that ... is a close interaction of a multitude of areas of common interests energy being one of them and I think it for the time being the most important one is that into the other than Thirteen before my president visited Bulgaria there was\nUm an agreement signed on the delivery of the gas resources manager resources specific the gas from either by John to Bulgaria\nAnd effective all tend to tend to do right now we're working closely with devoted in partners [laughter]\nUm and was very much help pull and we are looking forward to Bulgaria constructing a key element of this um delivery that into the into connector\nAs Greece Bulgaria and we envisage these project to be fully operational um end up next tier twenty twenty I Will be able to supply ... billion cubic meters of gas to Bulgaria because\nAt that very serious amount given the fact that dog areas anyway and they take demand varies between two point seven to three billion so that means that that's what about you out a little bit ... basically I'm delivering one third of ... a gas demand\nMost important then I recently our state oil company has expressed interest and I'm participating in ... so far\nOnly five percent of all guinea has been gathered fight fill a so called is covered they're looking into possibilities off the ... ability to study to check out what the possibilities are for other by us participation in this project and in fact um\nWhat is even more important I Would say is ... his role as a transit\nNot only as an end user as a consumer of Azerbaijan and gas but as an important transit hopping point all they've all companies because I'm next to it is Serbia is um Macedonia further it's a um Montenegro and other countries that are\nClearly interested in Azerbaijan a guess to be able to diversify their gas portfolio and will be coming to Europe specifically to go get it with our own volumes at a competitive price\nAnd voted it will benefit not only as the user and consumer all these gas but also as a country that would receive trying to tease\nYes let me let me recover for those of us who are not living with a map Bulgaria is on the black sea bass in the borders Romania\nMacedonia Serbian though yet is going to turkey right and the southern the southern guy slide a court or the now under construction starts in the Caspian Sea Azerbaijan passes through the ... through Georgia\nAnd then crosses through turkey\nAnd through turkey it must chip Bulgaria that's why I'm Talking to the ambassador these that's the interconnect or part but after Bulgaria the possibilities are mud many first of all the possibilities to go through Greece across the ... under the Iranians see\nTo Italy and southern Europe but you're also saying that these guys can connect to the Balkans\nAnd slow in Eastern Europe as well did I understand that so it can go in many directions from Bulgaria\nYeah absolutely and in fact the southern gas coded or that we've been talking about is um the one that stretches from the Caspian Sea as a write\nIn ancient across the Georgia and turkey but then sometimes it turns into top from turkey to Greece obey any any today but as we the connector I'm Talking about is a new one it is it is not being built yet and they sent their connector connects\nGreece from basic they tap Greece to Bulgaria better very project it's a key one\nBecause they support the not only as I said full Bulgaria now as such but for the entire region because it increases predictability a supply and it provides additional opportunities for for a wider consumer base to benefit from this resources\nAnd Bulgaria needs the energy to grow all countries need energy to grow and it's not\nObvious where they're going to gain that except from well there are competitors there's Russian gas and there's a Caspian Sea gas and it's good to have multiple choice so this relationship the strategic relationship between Bulgaria\nAnd as far as you don't make sense for energy what about the military cooperation how does that work about um about stutter\n[noise] well as far as the military partnership is concerned about ... is an important NATO member and does it by John is a one of the key partners and our geography for NATO's partnership for peace program\nThat's why we are very much closely cooperating well we'll get a a within NATO bilateral and of course within NATO given different training smell every corporation and a recent hosted a huge exit base in another by John that symmetry affair\nThe biggest in the region and it drew two hundred and twenty four companies from twenty nine countries\nIce cold ate it odd X.\nTwo thousand Eighteen and they'll get in a minister of defense was also there with the big teams so we're looking at different opportunities and possibilities to walk into a failed because we as the country we very much proud to be able to be the most reliable\nOver Donald Trump but it has a Republican representative at this moment have you seen uh a cabin are changing those districts\nNo I think if anything what we're seeing is that sort of more of those college educated white women in the suburbs um I think the cabinet situation help them make up their mind and mostly help them\nMake up their mind against the Republican Party\nUm if you look at some of the underlying data\nWhat has been most fascinating to me and the recent polls is it it appears as though the to swing groups now in the actual electorate are I'm college educated white men\nThey are now split essentially um I think the last poll I saw said forty nine forty nine between the two parties in terms of which party they favor and\nI'm white and blue collar women um who are still leaning Republican I'm forty nine to forty five\nBut are much closer than they were when I'm Trump was elected in twenty sixty so what we have right now is that the white college educated women have moved more decisively into the Democratic camp\nThe um blue collar white men are decisively in the Republican camp but there I'm sort of spouses and mates and friends are not\nNow we go to the numbers that I had over the last week I have had twenty three losses which is the best case for the Republicans and thirty three losses which would give control to Nancy Pelosi do you see anything in that range Lara from your information\nWell I Do think we're probably starting up more toward the thirty five or I'm forty seats and the reason why I say that is right now if you look at the cook Political Report they've already raided Fifteen Republican held seat\nAs leaning democratic or the likely democratic\nSo if you're already starting with Fifteen before you even move to the twenty nine tossup seats then\nIt it starts to become pretty easy to get above thirty because if you just assume that out of the twenty nine tossup seats fourteen or Fifteen in other words half of those are going to go democratic\nAnd then you add them to the Fifteen that are already there you're already it's thirty\nAnd that doesn't even include the twenty five Republican held seats that are leaning Republican but are certainly I'm more up for grabs so I I Do think one of the things that makes us different than Nineteen eighty two is that our\nUm parties and our country has sorted more and the polarization is much more real and it's also true that Republicans hold many more seats and they held in Nineteen eighty two and that\nIn and of itself makes them more vulnerable\nIn the Senate mansion I Want to go to you know please just\nGoing to say so I imagine what you're looking at is something more like thirty five forty seats rather than twenty six\nIn the Senate much more difficult post Kavanaugh we hear stories the momentum I certainly see the test or as a toss up\nAh the strains was clear when you saw a mansion vote for a for a cab and all that secures him in West Virginia\nMcCaskill in the high camp became under question but the places that I'm paying attention to our Tennessee where we've seen good numbers for black burning these last days and Florida where we've seen good numbers for Nelson\nSo right now in Nineteen eighty two the Republican picked up one seat is that credible for you I'll pick up a one seat with the numbers we're seeing now\nI wouldn't be surprised if it ended up being a plus two or maybe even a plus three but a lot of and that would be a net gain because a lot of that ended up being how do those two open seats really do land\nI don't know that we have an understanding of which way Arizona's going or which way Tennessee is going I think there's also kind of the wild card about Texas\nUm just because they do or has been such a strong candidate kids raised 'em as much if not more money than I'm Ted Cruz at this point and I do think that\nThere is some difficulty for Senator Ted Cruz in turning out Trump supporters because of the contentiousness the primary that they had in twenty six\nThe blood brown and George Washington university for

about to see the construction of a mass escape that will be recognizable to you\nNeal block a and block be they're looking for a way out and they see in the springtime and in the summertime and through the end of the fall before winter closes there's a rice field or near block be how is it that they come to decide on a tunnel from block be\nWell they they attempted many ways out they as soon as they got into the camping in the fall Nineteen Seventeen they read it and try to figure out a way that numerous attempts to get out jumping fences breaking the wall nothing works\nRiding out in the garbage bin ...\nUm you know any number of ah perplexing attempt and they ultimately decide that a tunnel is really the only way to get out from underneath of the three series of of of walls and so they begin um but first they need a place to start the tunnel\nAnd in blocked be a there was some stairwells that went down to the sellers and there was a partition wall that sort of blocked out underneath the stairwell\n... arguably so that prisoners couldn't jump out at the guards coming down the steps that what it became was this perfect entry point a hidden underneath the stairwell where they could start a tunnel through the wall and then to the closest the fields\nThe officers are taking the tunnel but there are um soldiers allied soldiers president who are orderly who are treated as servants are Batman and the Germans do not regard them as suspicious so our officers masquerade as as orderly says that how they get access\nIt is because black be is basically a divided into an officer section an orderly section and this there was a new orderly section so they need to recruit some orderly is to help them provide uniforms\nAnd then the officers a change in a room walk across
