going to move very quickly his ... certainly a bad actor for decades\nI remember the first ... by took to Israel thanks to Malcolm I stood there across the fence from the gunman\nWho had a big poster behind them this is north of Israel where the\n... his head cut off boasting about how they murdered Jews ... at the time I thought well this is normal it's not normal and its allies been bad actors for decades I saw that in two thousand and three we turn now to the U.S Congress\nAlways better late than never turning against his blah with two pieces of legislation I Believe they're going to be signed into law Malcolm what legislation good evening to\nGood evening and I think that setting you just offered is exactly right because\nThese things have been a long in the offing and many members of the house and Senate have tried to introduce these a legislative initiatives but to get the United States Senate TNN honestly pass a bipartisan bill as you know is today quite miraculous and this one would sanction\nWith an axe sanctions on a terrorist groups designated by the United states like Hamas like his ... and ISIS or al ... who use human shields in war meaning that they take civilians put them in front of them\nAnd use them as protections for those who want to fire over them as we're seeing in gossip today as we saw it all the conflicts including using a ... institution schools hospitals the firing missiles from you witnessed a lot of this and\nDo we know that ... has a traded on this and taken advantage of the fact that there was no consequences so this bill requires the president to identify and imposed sanctions on each foreign person who's a member of were acting on behalf of Hamas\nAnd who knowingly orders controls or directs the use of civilians as\nTo shield military objectives are from the attack it had fifty bipartisan Senate co sponsors and I think reflects real broad consensus that this barbaric practice has then and now we're hopeful that President will sign it the second ... is the illicit finance a bill\nWhich uh targets cause ... supporters and it's called the ... national finance prevention amendments act\nAnd impose sanctions on government entities that support\nThe group's military actions in sanctions companies vigils Kuwait as well as fundraising recruitment\nOr it was passed by the house last month and now the Senate and both bills are awaiting the president's signature which hopefully will be forthcoming soon and these are uh you know find a focused measures but have great significance\nFat as Malcolm moving ahead what do you make of the release by turkey a pastor Brunson [noise]\nOh I think what the timing couldn't have been better for them and the fact that he was held for two years is is forgotten enemies release is discussed it and especially now in the context of a\nOf the shows you the um incident and we don't know yet the full story but the apparent murder um turkey seems to be the main bench fishy area of all of this he's getting the Qatari defense minister visited the king of Saudi Arabia is calling him there he's making arrangements for\nWith others uh including the United states so he couldn't despite the fact that while he condemns rightly the what happened a heat rest won the leader of turkey arrested a hundred thousand people including many journalists so many military Joe ... and others in in every sector in fact\nI'm a but was never held to account for that but he is as I said I think the benefiting from this and the release of um\nOf the past it rains was certainly a in response to the pressure that the president brought to bear the threats of the sanctions Turkey's economy is weak as it is and I think they feared the consequences of a of additional sanctions\nI'll let me press you on this outcome and timing timing timing but what I've learned\nReading history is when two things independently happen in approximately the same time zone\nMaybe there's a connection just ask ask ask\nBrunson release in ... disappearance\nBoth depended upon the offices of turkey won for information about ... and after all it happened in Turkish territory and to the Bronx and release although I Can't figure it out now like it it's a puzzle shall I leave it a puzzle or their dot C. or to connect\nIt's too early to know about the dots and especially because the negotiations for runs his release began before the ... uh incident to even was anybody's mind as far as I Know so it's very hard to say unless you're you're saying that the at the Turks were responsible for it\nNo no I'm not I'm just saying the same time same people air to one out of out of favor and now suddenly in favor\nIn favor for yeah doing this but what the\nPoint is that he's being rewarded for an injustice that he is that they had\nImposed on pastor Brunson and the administration has made clear that the accusations against summit baseless I don't know anybody who has said he he admitted what he did which was to preach religion and and but never did anything\nPersecuted broad they persecuted Brunson and they Saudi let's put this way they were ... ... and ... and ... do not see the same book the same way

because birth didn't have the word he saw the French Revolution is a threat to freedom yeah as a threat as\nWe would use the word ... today yeah and he didn't have that word but he feared what he saw which was a transformation of the French\nOr tradition a transformation of it in into something that was violent and dictatorial and he rejected it quite quite different from how we saw the American revolution how did he called the American revolution\nI'm quite right and I I'd like to underscore your point John while it didn't have the word he\nClearly had the concept of a totalitarian isn't

parents have the twentieth century teeth and remake human nature and of course the American revolution fundamentally different the American revolution was we would say today and I think accurately and broke understood this very much\nYou could call it a conservative revolution in ... that\nThe American revolutionaries were not attempting to change\nDog I'm a change for religious faith changed custom and tradition quite to the contrary they thought to preserve the way of life\nThat they had that brought over from England and the seventeenth century Burke warned of this and Seventeen Seventy five he said he said to a he said the parliament those Americans actually they don't have a legal right\nTo be represented and debates about taxation imposed upon them but you're never going to be able to convince them up that because they're too much and fused with quote again that fear is love of liberty\nClause quote which they get from pain British than having it are energized by being

that was designed to keep government limited so actually and could continue to live the traditional way of life or we should say if they wish to break with tradition\nA matter of conscience they were also free to do so under the American constitution\nI Want to I Want to go over a detail here Burke was inheriting a tradition that easy English yeah and the tradition was hard fought from the sixteenth century through the seventeenth century to the glorious revolution sue Cromwell do the glorious revolution and I've recently been reading Peter there's a new book\nA young Benjamin Franklin in which the author Nick bunker takes us back just sixteenth century England\nWhen the first of the lord stark partition up the land in taking away arable land and grazing land from the from the young woman from the peasants and make them a wage slaves said they're imposing a kind of slavery on the people who resent it will revolt\nAnd that rubble takes a hundred years but we come to John Locke\nAnd the early shows berry and the glorious revolution all that transformation that it's a tradition that Bert takes for granted\nThat data he's inherited over a hundred years that's a tradition that our forebears came to America just speak for themselves and I've often had ... I've had it wrong my whole life America didn't invent as tradition we inherited it from our English forebears\nI I think that John that formulation as a exactly right I Would only quibble with one small prayed\nSaid a burp took it for granted in a way ... took park it took it for granted until the French Revolution and then he saw the tradition which he knew to be the source of his freedom with under with under profound threat\nAnd so that's how that gives birth to what we now called modern conservatism when Harris her of the English tradition of freedom sees a rising a direct threat come off within the tradition the French Revolution to freedom and their began the great and recurring challenge\nFor those of us devoted to freedom which is to somehow reconcile the claims of individual liberty and tradition\nYes we we we will address that sometimes called writes\nAbstract rights Burke worried about it here on the twenty first century pens as in much the same way when they partition the grazing land of the ... of Great Britain you feel squeezed on all sides Peter Peter ... sub Hoover Institution we're discussing a series of essays published it real clear policy\nWe're also pointing towards a lecture he will give soon enough in Manhattan the conservative challenge in the populist moments he will have be I'd be at the ... that's for the Manhattan Institute of you will be at the intercontinental hotel but when we come back\nWe're back to Edmund Burke and the late Eighteen century and an understanding of rights I'm John bachelor ... show\nYou all know that I traveled to the Republican as it by Sean this summer\nIt with my second trip than two years broadcasting from the rich and the Caspian Sea bass\nI've discovered that by John as a country of bombs resource\nFarmland produces the fresh food in Eurasia\nThe energy sectors are expanding by the minute now reaching out pipelines to Asia Minor in Europe to help with energy security for our allies and for NATO\nWhat I've learned is that as or by genres a prosperous country with big dreams\nAnd the leadership to support the dreaming of freedom and grow them\nOn the legendary Silk Road\nI'm most privileged to have the embassy of the Republican ... in the U.S to support my weekly business reporter\nI Will be highlighting and learning about I'd say about John and the cat in the regular\nFood to energy doing knowledge economy\nRepublican ... and the Caspian Sea bass in\nThe region I look forward to explore and I invite you along\nBalance of nature's fruits and veggies in a capsule\nHad cancer ...

speaking to gender equality in the workforce I welcome Richard Epstein professor rich have seen the Hoover Institution is senior fellow teaches law at NYU\nAnd the University of Chicago because in twenty Seventeen Richard reporting the number of CEOs of fortune five hundred companies declined from thirty two and twenty Seventeen to twenty four and twenty Eighteen are we going in the wrong direction\nDoes this mean that the advances made by gender equality these last years has been reversed suddenly because then fill in the blank Trump or is there more to this about the work place and gender\nRichard a very good evening to you certainly this debt test take about decline of CEOs indicates a headline\nYou do not find however anything of substance underneath that just deported so we go immediately to California where they have a new law California law that in his upon balance or at least some numbers of women on the boards of companies in California\nYour measure of this is that it is much about no facts in the workplace there had been facts in the class when women have been restrained by court orders that is not now the case do I read that correctly\nWell court orders is not the correct term by legislation will be the term but essentially what happened is in the history of the United states starting at the end of the civil war there were many formal disability on the ability of woman to\nHold certain kinds of position at the entrance to certain kinds of contract and those limitations we're pretty much removed as a formal matter\nBefore Nineteen hundred and then in the next Twenty years old a political restrictions on women's suffrage as we're lives so at that particular point as a matter of legal contemplation every woman in every man had the same degree of illegal capacity to enter into contracts to make ...\nWell the earth is Illinois and Muller versus Oregon You're referring\nTo the ... is an extraordinary case there was a situation in the state of\nIllinois where they put a ban on women working the majority opinion said there'd been recent cases about privileges and immunities which indicates that the federal constitution does not give protection to women um who wants to enter into these occupations um and so therefore the cases out and\nThis was probably an incorrect reading of the stature of the constitutional provisions but take it and then there was one judge who in concurrence basically announced that the national biological condition of women was such that it was perfectly appropriate to keep them in the home domesticity became not only virtue by the legal requirement\nTo which the obvious answer is if you open up the markets and more women want to go in and currently there they will do so men want to go and they will do so it turns out a if you actually look at the way these markets are organized today this free entry and exit but there is by no means and the density of men\nAnd women and all kinds of places and all kinds of firms in the law and the same thing is pretty much true in every other occupations within medicine within ... within science they always tend to be sub specialty so heavily female and heavily male and\nThese numbers have been roughly Constance in the last twenty or Thirty years so unless there's some major legal course they're not going to switch soup Mahler against Oregon is an ironic case it was from a to F Nineteen oh wait and the man who wrote the brief upholding the statute\nWhich had a minimum wage law for women only was none other than Louis Brandeis was probably the most prominent lawyer in the United states at that time it was I thought a dreadful brief that he wrote a buddy persuaded one of the conservative judges a man named ruin 'em to basically to\nUphold that statue to set a strike it down\nIn that particular case all the women who were hired were fired and replaced with um Chinese workers so it wasn't as though it did them a lot of good\nAnd in the long run most women rightly in my view of come to the conclusion that sex linked um minimum wage laws are flatly unconstitutional of because of what it is that they do ... what was the heroic advance\nIn Nineteen oh eight turns out to be a constitutional on ... offense today\nWhich indicates just how strange in a funeral all these issues are open up the markets certainly but does that mean parity in every position\nNo because the available pool was not based upon the number of\nPeople in the United states by sex which is what Jerry Brown thinks about it's obviously going to be dependent upon the number of people are the kind of qualifications it unique for giving all kinds of jobs and who knows what that is the one thing that is quite certain and many advocates\nFor women on boards at this point is that the last person who knows what to do about this is the state of California and\nIt turns out that it's really complicated it'd be lab of poor people on board and they want to add a fifth all of a sudden they have to have two women that means you've got to go to six but once you're six you had to go three women so now you're at seven and\nIt's very difficult to fill seats on boards and if you're going to try and fill hundreds of seats literally on me\nAbout the corporations with a group of women and then you're going to face the other question can you have a sex only rule here and found acknowledge that this was a constitutional difficulty but the wages that you're going to pay for the men and for the women are going to have\nTo defer because the men\nEssentially are not going to be in the same demand is the limit is it'd be a very strong demand for the query and can you buy sects used different wages so the companies may be completely block spin and\nMost people say oh my God was aboard you put people on because of specific areas of expertise and it may be that there are many many women with MBA's an advanced degrees but the question is you know something about a particular form of solar energy development\nAnd if you don't you're not the kind of person that you need for that particular board\nAnd we do know that you know for example if you look in applicants and schools do social work eighty five to eighty percent of the album send to be female you do label architecture it's over Ninety five percent male so the sex declaration begins fairly early on and it works its way up through the decision tree the boards of directors\nOf Richard ... is there any indication anywhere from the empty I study the one I'm reference before a is there indication there is are there metrics to demonstrate that parity such as California is recommending would grow the economy would lead to prosperity to have\nAnybody to able to come up with a study that demonstrate that\nWell they purport to do so the number the size of the game that they claim which is roughly twenty six percent of the economist priests opposes that women\nAll of a sudden or identical to men in their productivity stability ... school [noise] but then there was nothing to show that the current pool of women if in fact put into these positions would be able to create that sort of get 'em and\nThere's nothing in the constitution which says one Supreme Court must have nine justices but from the civil war on it's always been that way\nAnd everybody's respected that rule any unilateral deviation from that rule by either party is an open invitation for disaster retaliation and so forth\nAnd it will blow the company up as far as I'm concerned I regard this as well dangerous an irresponsible but I'm constantly challenged by people come debate ... says with me because these people are so angry about the capital issue that they really are willing to blow up the machine in order to get even with what they regard\nLet it go unless got a number two the recommendation and I've heard Joe ... who is the if if the Democrats control the house of representatives slated to be the chairman of the Judiciary Committee speak impeaching justice Kavanaugh is that a practical thing\nWell regarded as a very dangerous suggestions if you're talking about the situation in a nomination for the Supreme Court but the advice and consent function of the Senate\nThe Democrats have a perfect right to vote against capital of any reason on and on\nAnd so you don't care about burdensome proof and eat all the Democrats who are convinced that misplace the Ford was correct were also adamantly opposed him before you go into an a peach minutes a criminal trial\nThat all of a sudden they really are due process rules and there are examinations and all sorts of other things for somebody to sort of a sudden you're going to do and impeachments situation means that they have to assume that they were right on that particular case and\nIt seems to me that the reason in the N. Y. that voted not change\nIs that the on corroborated clams on one side\nDid not stand up after multiple FBI investigations and not only the denial by justice common or a but by all the corroborating evidence that was introduced on his side the sovereign God this is a terrible idea it will simply keep things worse and it will try to create a stain on the court I thought the\nBest thing that happened though the other day is when he was sworn in all eight other justices of the Supreme Court came to the ceremony\nIf one of them had been absent it would've been a terrible signal about the legitimacy of this and I think in effect what happens is everybody should accept the appointment justice cabinet oh I think made a serious mistake in the way and when she got so angry although I forgive him for that\nBut I think going forward what we have to do is to get all of this and everybody has to behave as though that never happened and that includes a justice capital T cannot sort of try to take this out on anybody knowing everything I Know about his character not personally but from other people I think he's up to that task\nConstitutional overhaul that can take many faces let's say that the president no longer has authority to appoint a Supreme Court justice that has passed off to Congress there are other recommendations as well\nOr is it very unlikely we'd overhauled the constitution but it is to just it as a remedy two of the cabinet or unhappiness\nWhile the two things one it'd be an absolute meal a day to sort of assume that the Congress gets to pick somebody without a nomination\nThe process of nomination with advice and consent for principle offices into judges has been with us for many years it's obviously a political process but things are worse the important constitutional change would I Am in favor of making is to make these appointments for a term of say Eighteen years Fifteen Years right\nTerm limited next recommendation term limits and that is\nI have defended that for many many years I think it's absolutely\nCritical there is a factor in the United states all article three judges as they're called have lifetime\nTerms so now when ... when we create a specialized tribunal there is an enormous resistance on the part of everybody to make them article three judges it's much more efficient to put them in a bankruptcy court and so forth which has a fourteen or Fifteen you trip\nWe should make that a constitutional norm I had a recent discussions with Jeff Rosen an animal attack on that\nAtom who's from the New York times and I disagree on many things but we were one on that particular proposed\nAnd term limits at ... ... ... ... is there a number that they talk about Richard that ... Fifteen\nTo Eighteen years you don't want her to be a short his political appointments but you don't want it to be so long or the other restriction which I'm In favor of this getting people out at seven day and I'm saying this when I'm Seventy five so I'm now\nBarred for life but I Do think what you want to do is to make sure that you don't get these generational shift in fact I Believe the same thing is true for the Senate and house the libertarians always used to say three in the in the house at six years and two in the Senate I thought that was much too short\nOf what I'm In favor of is something that I can in the house in four in the Senate or twenty and twenty four years\nI think there's something deeply wrong with the process when the head of two committees based on sending already about eighty five years old trying to figure out the way in which the future should do I thought Grassley behave admirable I cannot say the same thing about Senator Feinstein and will not but\nIf you're thinking about this is a process you do not want people at that age taking dominant positions in the United states if they're still vigorous\nThey can do all sorts of things in the private sector but incumbency is not a rapid or sensible road but figuring out the way in which we govern this country\nAnd finally the McConnell rule which Mr McConnell is\nOh the Biden ruled this is just suggest that in the final year of president said the nomination wait for the people to vote before the new president or the continued president makes the choice is that a recommendation that could be institutionalized\nIt's already there this is something which you don't need to do by legislation um let me go back and say what I thought about the McConnell decision back is respected Merrick Garland point number one is gone with a perfectly qualified judged\nA judge some genuine distinction and a great deal of affection by everybody who knew there was no issue about quality whatsoever and uh that\nPoints to should not have come up but on the other hand it was very clear not withstanding the fact that it was sixty three notwithstanding the fact that it was more conservative than the other four liberals on every major vote he would have switched essentially the other side and that includes campaign financing it includes guns it includes affirmative action\nThe whole Schmidt an abortion now I think the Republicans should have said we don't care about the next election we just don't want this guy\nAnd we think we want to keep this open and we lose the election and you get to a point Tim and somebody else I think candor would have been much better that Democrats are perfectly candid their attitude was if they had even\nA majority of fifty one forty now and there's no way they would've confirm Kavanaugh and they only grounds an objection that they would have made a what we don't want to switch it over and at that point they would have done something which I thank God the Republicans did namely that would not have had hearings\nAt which point we would not have this terrible situation what happened this time around is that Republicans knew if they played it safe they didn't win fifty one forty nine fifty two forty eight with causes it was fifty five forty five ... not going to get that the second time around with Democrats\nKnew they play it safe it's fifty one forty nine and they lose so they have to blow up the entire thing\nWhich is why long before we actually got to the sexual scandals involved in this case the\nDemocrats were having people come into the court said we're having points of order that were grandstanding in one form or another and keeping secret information which they laid a load on the ball and\nI think an effect that is what I regard this as not ... not acceptable if they\nAll of them and asked that day number one we will not vote for this man right right because we dislike him I'd say thank you it's an understatement at which point I Would do the following thing I said good we don't have any need for Harry are you convinced you don't want to ... we do want him why do we want the craze if you

that chase Eddie into war\nHe is understood to be a seventh grade dropout\nAnd the man who lead America to war when the decision is made\nIn early Nineteen Seventeen and the Congress votes to declare war against Germany as the Kaiser and come in on the ... the man who lead America to war our college man other West Point or the ivy leagues and he goes along as a driver for the officers this in the summer of Nineteen Seventeen\nAnd yet there are many instances where it's revealed to the officers to but many will become sly offices as well today have the skill with ... he has a skill as a mechanism\nBut they will make the leap\nAnd that's important to understand because that's just motive here she is not just an ambitious young man\nI learned from you that he is he's trying to break into the dominant class in America and that's not allow [noise] and it burns heady it keeps a close to Iran much of your book is based on his writing can you see it in his notes\nAbsolutely there's a moment you know he scraps to get overseas and he's gone to fly right you just sense that what he's talking about but he has to be a driver so they take one of the top you know race car drivers and what do they do they were chauffeur well\nHe transforms he they know we use mechanical he gets along with everybody they say\nYou run you become the mechanical you need becoming engineer you put together America's new big airfield over there\nAnd you put together you take care of all the planes and building at an all like that um and but that's where you can do he says no no no I'll do that but I Need to fly\nHe gets over there and he is with all these Ivy League kids who've never met anybody like Edie Edie is a tough talking a rough around the edges kind of guy who's now the chief\nEngineer at as it in the American big American field or does he do with these Ivy League new flyers coming over and they're starting their stuff they're going to debate war this is great stuff he puts them next to the German POWs when the ten buckets on the fields to pick up rocks\nAnd are they hate him day job scramble and he goes you know what we need to get this done but he's laughing you know all\nThe chief engineer it is a ton of September of Nineteen Seventy remember now she can do everything but he's regarded as the working class as an educated and America's flying cars going to be led cheaply by Harvard by by college graduates\nThat southern a friday and she is going to teach yourself to fly he has moments here where what you could say is that he's he's we're battling\nFrom class warfare itself which is destroying itself in the trenches by Nineteen Seventeen justice is a nightmare around maybe you don't have time and you were telling of the very busy lives to observe the fact that Eddie is outside of history at this point because history is a tragedy\nAnd a is a great success where we root for re we anticipate that he's going to survive all of them become America's gray days however the way it's going to do this is self taught he takes us an aircraft it's a new porch he takes the Newport teaches himself to fly away from everybody's observations\nShe is not so much a city has confidence in himself that uh I I don't have a word for it it's not self election\nHe doesn't manager [noise]\nUh he's frightened and he's even he Asia fear of heights fear of flying buddy overcomes you talk about his willpower what does he say it is in his notes how does he talk about his conscience\nYou know he um is for the first six months of flying he's nauseous all the time I'll throw up as cockpit will come down to a pro up his you know he has high problems he had an injury to wanted his eyes and an accent when he was a kid\nThat has left him you know with some depth perception problems this as a kid\nA young man who flying is not\nNatural immediate you think oh it must have been after all it wasn't at all so this is where this willpower comes in he had the strength and the focus to get through it\nTo be bothered and yet at the same time he was very clear about acknowledging that fear was an important thing to fear seal because people flyers who didn't have fear who weren't scared\nWe're going to die and they did in droves\nSo what Edie took from the race car days was a finding that line you hear NASCAR race for part about this now finding that line right up to the edge of recklessness\nBut not an animal well above tipping is both of which would get you killed in the air and on the ground\nAnd he perfected knowing where that line was can conquering his that overwhelming thing which comes out in your body when you've got fearful and you're just you know assaulted by physical ... you know pressure's\nJohn Ross is an extremely careful biographer\nBecause he takes us into what is now called\nWas learn sitting there with your very helpful notes and talking about how he's experiencing flying to sit this was ...\nSleep dangerous totally all the time the engine all the holy had one gear and Lindy was the only way to moderate the speed at the same time you're faces being gashed my Castro oil which they move uses oil is just before ...\nAircraft engine oil existed and that led to nauseous and often play by diarrhea when you came back he we're freezing above ten thousand feet\nAnd you had a role to play and constantly back and forth I get the feeling that you call it at one point you quote from one of the flyers so many of the left notes especially the dead ones there was like flying a gyroscope telescope all the time\nHe felt every moment out there that he was fighting the aircraft to Newport was tail heavy right it was he always had to adjust to keep this level\nHe knows he's going up to actually fight other aircraft the Germans had superior aircraft soccer aircraft or extremely superior to the new porous these were French belt but he never backs off the presses and presses until they give them a chance to fly with what becomes the Ninety seven terrorists\nHowever she still treated with disdain by a solo officers or the other is he's a sergeant right they never make him but they
