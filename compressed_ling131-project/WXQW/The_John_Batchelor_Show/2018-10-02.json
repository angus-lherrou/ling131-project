New York times reporter Ben protest\nMr ... was hanging out with friends at a bar and what appears that the police were called after a man I got into an argument wish\nI had to go to the hospital because he'd been bleeding from a right here\nIt appears that have it on didn't cause that and then died so but he apparently at one point and throw ice on a man and I was part of the larger kind of strong that they were and [noise] and there was an eye witness that identified with the other people who are involved in the the Internet and they all seem to be part of Mr God but I was a group of friends from Yale\nA is what they're saying the Senate side Republicans still have a very good chance of not just holding the majority of the game a couple of feet and here's where Kavanaugh which distorted them all the cuts for a two different ways in the house\nIt's a problem because the map in the house is suburbia and women who don't like the president's Tanner and tone\nAnd have been sort of driving these districts that have warned voted Republican for Congress away from the Republican Party in this election and all of his business will cabinet is not helping that maybe it's not going to hurt it any more but it's certainly not going to help but it could make it worse\nIn the Senate though where we've talked before we know we have a lot of red states a lot of space that aren't just Republican leaning but happen to like president\nA fist fight as it turned into over the past couple of weeks could jam up Republican enthusiasm and could help Republicans running against his Democratic incumbents will have to see where the dust settles sometimes\nThe major events or a member of the Access Hollywood tape and twenty sixteen and then the president you there's no way he could win the dust settles things kind of get back to normal and the race is on the other thing so we'll see how the dust settles but for now looks like it you know it is helping Republicans in the Senate races so that's where things stand\nSaturday you lived through I Would say so eight um before you turn to damage can you comment on the possibility that this is I was six or NATO sex\nCertainly go six for quite a bit remembering oh six we started to close the gap and and the Foley issue happened right at the end\nAnd that as soon as just off at that point in time you also have the economy was not doing well in many of the places with the target is seats and such as mine at the time in the Detroit area you could start to feel the effects of the economy is slowing down\nAnd people were very upset about that you had Iraq as well so you had war and peace we're not playing well and a lot of the suburban slashed targeted districts\nSo I think David's right we need to see where the dust is going to settle in terms of the house races and it's not going to be ... years we're always discuss to mid term for first term president but to me it's just a question whether or not it's going to be horrible or whether or not to cut their losses and actually do respectable job\nThat last month to remind everybody solely was represented to Florida I Believe and he had concealed his bad acting towards house pages that was revealed and he resigned did name right before the election something like that he\nWas gone but at the end it was covering up the bad behavior by the speaker's office than others and and so and that became a scandal and rightly so many of us were outraged we also knew this so darn voters\nAnd we knew that it was going to be you know seriously it's indefensible what's the leadership did in that instance and so you just went in there knowing that it was going to be far worse than you had originally probably Saudi even more so than men and women when that came out and you have a question for David size\nDavid in terms of the Senate we you talked about how this can kind of building enthusiasm and there's a lot of those red states with democratic incumbents are we seeing any type of enthusiasm gap change in the house races [noise]\nWell look the initial read on the past few days is that the Republican enthusiasm up is across the board but the issue is that the partisanship\nAnd the atmospherics and house races versus Senate races in most of these house races are already in trouble because the voters there have been done it especially female voters\nHave the gun to make a decision that they want to put a check on Trump and you're not dealing with the same kind of\nA bipartisan conservative or partisan Republican as you may be dealing with an Indiana or West Virginia\nOr or North Dakota and so it's just a different in in what kind of voter you're dealing with an and one thing that if I wanted to add on to that one of the things that reminds me of a sex it that a lot of these districts\nI think you're not necessarily finding unhappiness with the Republican incumbent but just the desire that you have no other choice\nIf you want to put a check on Trump but to vote for the Democrat and that's some of the things that I've been seen and it's what we saw no sex where people were glued saying the verbatim to Nepal in and what say out loud I Know you know congressman so and so he does a great job he's doing a great job for years but I just had enough of Bush and and there's nothing else I can do\nThat's too bad he's got to suffer for it but that's just the way it goes\nWe're joined by John Fund at the national Review Online and it's fun we have been commenting custody of slip through oh sex when the Republicans lost the majority in the house of representatives Nancy Pelosi became speaker and two thousand and seven comparing it to the conditions today with a month to go how do you measure chop\nThe problem is many many areas where the district or actually a competitive the problem is Republican low voter turnout and that's why the Kavanaugh situation is so critical it could end up boosting democratic turnout dramatically but also end up losing Republican turnout dramatically\nWhat we do see though is of course Democrats are revved up about this election\nWhat are they were abducted the places where it counts because if you if you're in a democratic district and you have Donald Trump and your vote democratic it doesn't change anything\nSo that's why the cabin on race is I Love become part of the campaign we're ready to be we're going to be voting in large part of the emotions and the issues shared by Kavanaugh which is completely unexpected develop\nA to have a question for John\nLooks the same same he kind of touched on a steam it earlier John about are we seeing the Republican enthusiasm apply both in the Senate which they even talked about are we seeing it as well in the house districts have house has to win because as David pointed out their different constellations routers I\nThink the suburban or urban and the districts were for Mrs Clinton and yet have a Republican nominee I Believe they're fifty or fifty five of them John and those are well educated and well money of voters\nWould I Do know is a lot of Republicans view Brett Kavanaugh as one of their own kind of Abu Schmidt marriage a crowded Republican and a lot of them do the Democratic tactics it's just appalling and if that can be combined with the Trump vote\nThen in some of these out district you might be able to drag a few of the house Republican incumbents all over the line and when a debt Republicans it's still going to have a bad election year but I think Kavanaugh because if the Democrats seem to have overstep the boundaries of decency and politics this ... that could mitigate some of those block the release suburban\nSees Kevin Spacey over confidence with the Democrats and Republicans have that as a as a constant tell when they're approaching election overconfidence how about the Democrats\n[noise] well I think that for no liberal groups on activists that are focused on feeding Kavanaugh anyway they can't\nI think that there may be a bit of over confident but there's no way this can cut against them I mean they they believe in this as a matter of policy and philosophy so I don't know that they're that concerned about the politics of it but I I don't think they imagine that if the cut against them I Know that democratic strategists\nThat are in charge of healthy to win campaigns are worried about it I've talked to them about it\nAnd they're not worried yet that it's gone or off the rails but they're worried that it could go off the rails I think and I and I know from talking to them many of them that I'm pulled them and I've talked to a few of them and they struggle I hear that many of them would have preferred a quiet Kavanaugh\nConfirmation if it had been up to them so that they could just move on to what is it working for them which is the focus on Trump and everything Trump talk about uh every single you\nMentioned to me damages quickly here that some very smart democratic ah see her as an empty seat on election day\nYeah yeah some of them here in ... bc intellectually all of a sudden they can be a repeat of a a twenty sixteen ... like you need to show up so that Republicans are in charge of of confirming this scene because the Democrats at this point have been pretty open with the fact that they will walk\nAnd they will keep the seat open the same way Republicans kept open the turned out to be the Gorsuch seat and twenty sixteen and they they don't want that to be something that they have to fight over ... they want to be about Trump\nDavid ...

NAFTA\nVeronique diversity of the Mercator center joys to comment on what we know so far of the ... of the the new deal that replaces after NAFTA\nFairly good very good evening to you first my thinking here when I heard it late last night is business brinksmanship you have been very cautious\nAbout the negotiations for some time you've been extremely unhappy with the tariff threats by the Trump Administration from what we know now about the new packed the U.S MCA\nDoes this satisfy your concerns about terrorists in the U.S economy and jobs good evening to\nJohn I'm guessing now I'm so glad we have a deal I mean I'm so glad it's lifting the uncertainty that investors\nUm had weighing over them that was holding back on their investment in the U.S [noise] and so it's a it's a really good thing we have a deal and it's a very good thing we have a Mexico us Canadian deal that was important so this this is a big relief\nI mean on the terrorists died I mean let's face it I mean we haven't\nMade much progress because it was already pretty great deal that we had\nAh with the exception really a Canadian dairy and all us exports we're going to can at Canada and um [noise] and Mexico duty free which is pretty remarkable\nUm shall we say the little progress on the Canadian under leftover Canadian I\nGet a imports but unfortunately the metal terrorists are still up and retaliate tore tart parrots from Canada and Mexico are still up\nFor the yes and and no one in this day the other part which is part of the center of this deal is not great but it's nothing like it could have been in terms of things that\nAll right I Want to speak to those two aspects first medals or the I'm following the wall Street Journal reporting here us negotiators have insisted than any change to us duties on steel and aluminum that took effect in June the address separately from a broader trader deal among the country's commerce secretary Wilbur Ross\nSaid recently an agreement to revise the north American trade pact with allowed negotiators to turn their focus to resolving the steel aluminum standoff so therefore steel and aluminum is the obstacle ahead of us does this give the momentum to resolve that or have\nHave objections raised in these last week's may mean that steel and aluminum is impossible\n[noise] I don't know I Know I mean I've seen headlines suggest that the Canadians who was going to tackle\nThe metal ... um after the closing bell so maybe there'll be more on this front to say tomorrow morning I think and an agreement between the U.S Canada and Mexico is honestly opening the door slides play a bigger\nTo um to allow that resolution on TV I'm On the medal terrorists it's also worth noting that um that deal this deal I mean you know as imperfect as it is on some improvement and let let's be honest about this I'm ...\nI'm also a providing a protection for Canada and Mexico again the upcoming strap a photo terrorists which\nWould be quite devastating to to the trade between Canada and Mexico and the U.S [noise] so I think I think we're making progress we're not there yet but we'll see\nLet's go to the car to the manufacturer and a vehicle part of this as I understand\nAnd and the details were not rich but that there is an agreement here to manufacture large parts of the automobiles in Canada and the U.S where the wages are high and not in Mexico where the wages are not high is that well and also\nYeah that and also by the way for like tried to block or created this attempt to have to use parts from um countries where wages are lower than in Mexico um that's not a good thing that increases the cost\nI understand I understand so is this something that did not exist and after this a portion of our you know say you have your standard Toyota did we divvy it up and this fashion in the old NAFTA or did the old enough to let you make your car where it was cheapest\nWell so um there was a requirement a source requirements for your part and it was sixty percent I'd have to be sourced in the region and now it is moving to Seventy five percent\nSo um it's not out there there was in terms of shore thing that was done there was nothing however there was no a labor requirement that I Know of especially that are so high and putting Mexico such a disadvantage [laughter] um\nSo but as far as I Know there was none of that to really exporting or bad or bad labor laws and and it's even more shocking to be on that so that if the Democrats\nWere trying to force these type of labor laws are minimum wage increases on American businesses the little pelicans will be ... and rightfully so because they would understand how much distortion that create in the labor market\nThe expectation is that this has to go through Congress next year and the the the reasonable assumption is that at least part of the Congress will be democratic\nAnd so the labor part of the negotiation looks to be a compromise with a which is that that they can use in Congress so let's move to another part which is the dairy dairy farmers reports the wall Street Journal got what they asked for in a new version\nSo the ice cream and milk tariffs that we're holding everything up turned out to not be profound I guess that's not a big number but it does make a comeback happy\n[laughter] yes but um it's also let's face it right well it will benefit this moving towards a closer to zero I'm On a on dairy tariffs on it's a it's really good for 'em for\nCanadian consumers during these are the true beneficiary of these changes and it is great and there were so there are few there are few farmers who are who benefits from it um in in the U.S but the true true true beneficiary are are in the Canadian consumers\nAnd drugs I'm told that I'm following the reporting the deal extends to ten years the minimum data protection period for biologic drugs\nAnd that means that Mexico and Canada will wait longer for lower costs copies of brand name medicine's so that's a concession on their part and that supports our big pharma\nDeal more [laughter] your name's John and under the president made this announcement in the rose garden it good for him for doing it in a location because it quote Joe Biden in a different context was a big sleeping deal with a promise he made by candidate Donald Trump\nEverybody mocked him they said you cannot renegotiate trade deals whether it's what the weather it's with China whether it's not that NAFTA agreement you simply can't do it\nPresident Obama mocked him and this is a proposal saying it it it's all gone kid when canal globalism is here to stay that says the new normal\nYou cannot bring manufacturing jobs back\nTo the u._s. what do you have a magic wand well it turns out that President Trump does not magic\nWand but he does have a ... negotiating skills and first he struck a deal with the Mexican government and they put the screws to the Canadian government Justin Trudeau the prime\nMinister yawn cashing a hip and cool by his poll numbers are\nNot very good and he realized that candidate was going to be left out in the cold unless they got to the table and negotiate with the president ministry ... they came to the table they hammered out this deal and the president ought to be extremely proud\nOf actually getting a replacement in place\nFor NAFTA which put American workers at American taxpayers at a very significant disadvantage for the last what thirty or so years he was able to ship around when everybody else it couldn't be done is\nWe are finished the third quarter we'll get the first estimate of the third quarter growth right before the election\nThe expectation is for it to be four point to which was the second quarter or better I spoke with Europe in these last hours Monica we're the envy of the world the European Union is growing at like points for while we're growing it for ... point plus\nSo the NAFTA deal will only the new NAFTA wishes us MCA will only enrich some more [noise] I'm not waiting for the president get credit because this is the Supreme Court week I have an announcement will get credit after the Supreme Court we have an announcement from Mitch McConnell on the floor of the Senate today I read\nThe majority leader's remarks\nThat he believes that this is a smear on the good name and family\nOf Brett Kavanaugh he says his good name and his family have been dragged through the mud with a campaign of character assassination based on an allegation that lack any corroboration McConnell goes on to say the ... an obstruction has come to a close will be voting this week it looked like the Republicans have\nAlthough slow to this Monica have got themselves organized is the party paying attention\nFinally John yeah and in fact I have a column coming tomorrow morning at the hills which has also posted on my Facebook and Twitter account that talks about not only the Democratic nation a machine gun tactics\nThey used on Kavanaugh which they also used on Clarence Thomas which they also used on Robert Bork et cetera but\nThey're they're a world full king hypocrisy and dripping thank him Modi which they have views out this process to try to take a Kavanaugh out at the Supreme Court nominee and I you know\nMind when when you hear them up the front of their their ivory tower purchases on the Senate Judiciary committee about\nSchool drinking on the part of cabinet or college drinking on the part of Kavanaugh is costing John and I actually a recount that scene from Nineteen eighty five of US Senator from Massachusetts\nWho say ... years earlier and got drunk and actually killed a woman sixteen years later he I'm One of his fellow democratic Senator Chris Dodd a waitress on cable and sexually assaulted her I'm speaking of course if Ted Kennedy the lake Kennedy was lying\nBy the left as a progressive icon and granted a state funeral when he died but they're sitting in judgment of Brett Kavanaugh\nFor having a couple years in high school and college you know these people really take the cake John the American people see through it that's why the polling it's starting to move against them particularly those very vulnerable red state Democrats\nYes I Want to know the ... of the Republicans are waking up Monica because I Would wake up for the news we lead with which was the U.S MCA than new NAFTA deal\nAnd the four percent plus economy that means people are working that means families are stable that means the growth of the United states is restored that's what I wakes me up but apparently that is enough for the Republican Party [noise]\nAh so the question is is the cabin all character assassination enough for the party to get to the polls or not\n[noise] yes now from what I'm saying you know Democrats had\nIt and it's usually as an energy gap heading into this whole process right we kept hearing about the right way to come out and sent their frustrations about Trump and the Trump era but now we're seeing polling comfort coming from Rasmussen and some other places that now the G O P has clues that\nGap that Republican voters and the independents are in by what they're seeing hearing this transparent political it job of a very good bad\nThey're outraged by it but now that the one problem that Republicans had was the center of complacency well now I think that Democrats shock to me because that complacency problem seems to be gone\nDianne Feinstein this is that this is a challenge Monica because she's acting extremely aggressive plane without explanations making claims making allegations and also\nConcealing or let's put it this way maintaining silence and the questions about how she handled the original allegations from Ford how the letter was handled Dianne Feinstein\nA toast to my surprise Monica is now the the the person most in charge of this character assassination in the Democratic party Chuck Schumer seems to have faded into the woodwork business Feinstein's work are you surprised\n[noise] no well\nLook her evolution has been happening over a number of years she used to be she came out of San Francisco of course but she used to be a relatively moderate Senate intelligence committee used to be somewhat of a voice of freezing at a party that was getting increasingly more radical uh\nBecause the party has gotten more radical she had a primary challenge the state a Democratic Party in California not back\nHer move against Kavanaugh makes total sense if you put Dianne Feinstein at the age of what is she eighty five\nShe's this she's eighty six right she adds in your finger\nIt yeah I if you take and put her in the context of her party and its political environment it actually does make sense but what a way for Dianne Feinstein complete her political ten year high but it's interesting\nIt'll edition of Monica Crowley we'll speak with Monica later in the week right now the news is that McConnell senator

robber who continued to work at the VA because there were no rules against it so you do like to come back to that\nAt the at no point in the future we'll let ever not be a great story okay five point yeah the federal\nAnd it has work rules that armed robbery isn't part of the conversation so now we go to how Mr Wilk is doing\nAs managing come out an organization this large made up of a lot of veterans in cells in other words a lot of people that work there are patients of their own a a constitution\nHow is Wilkie dealing with the turmoil silken and before that the long troubles of the Obama administration has he got an even hand or is he seemed to be an outsider in a rookie\nI'll get to that if you don't mind in a moment but I Want to make sure that we don't leaves a threat to unfold on this mar a Lago group\nNobody has ever alleged ... including the people who I've talked to from inside the VA that day want anyone to do anything underhanded or to benefit them personally\nOr any of that it's just that they're not accountable to anybody on the house or Senate Veterans' Affairs committee anyone else in Congress or anyone publicly that anybody can tie any particular policy to one of those people and asking them questions about it so\nI didn't want people thinking that there's some that there are some ... ball bits conspiring against veterans or anything like that that doesn't appear to be the case it's just there's no transparency no accountability to your question um\n[noise] uh about what happens um what is happening with secretary Wilkie is he's leading the depart right around morale I'm keen on morale\nTwo of these wonderful reporters to cover the VA our own government matters on the program tonight Nikki went link from stars and stripes and Leo Shane from the military times and we joked as we started to record the segment that this would be their last appearance on the program because there's not going to be any more news coming out to be a sin secretary will get told the committee\nThat a phase or calming down and morale is improving and VA is now a nonpartisan organization and we joked that their services would no longer be needed on my program since apparently everything's fine\nObviously everything not fine at the department of Veterans Affairs given the problems that you and I've talked about in the past but but but the thrust the message that the secretary wanted to get across to the committee was\nThat he was cleaning up all of the things that they have been worried about it in the past and that they especially said to him at his confirmation hearing\nThese are things that we expect you to clean up he wanted a very clearly deliver the message that he was getting on that case it was doing so\nA detail here Frances I 'cause I remember the bill for the Denver hospitals I took many years and was long long a controversy that she's got two hundred billion dollars in the new budget or have they learned their lesson about over spending about extravagant ... what's your sense we have about a minute\nOil or the acquisition folks that I talked to inside the department of Veterans Affairs tell me that they are going to work a lot more extensively with private sector\nContractors who build hospitals for a living and they're going to rely on a wisdom from other government organizations like the general services administration and the Army Corps of engineers who built big buildings on a regular basis instead of trying to think it all up on their own that's what really got them into trouble in Denver\nSo that is a partial answer for will be more careful in future we won't run over budget we won't freelance out our own will uh will follow procedures more closely and Wilkie inspired this or is any everybody learned on their own\nI think everybody's learned on their own especially given the beat down so that so many people on the acquisition shop took from Congress\nFor instance rose he

watch the euro\nCurrency is our uh I I pour but adequate substitute for the the news headlines\nThe euro has been beat up badly and you have a piece of Baron is saying that to be that at the polling is so bad it might be time to to bet on the euro why Simon and how do you bet on the euro\nWell it's an interesting story actually got one of the things we know and this is all out there is that the U.S is growing really worth your while it's booming growth phase high unemployment is really really low\n... the European Union the euro area which doesn't include the u._k. but don't include island ... caught him on the confidence like Germany and France\nThat bad economy's going going quite slowly been limping limping along with low inflation and you know a lot of the Mediterranean Countries not doing very well like ... Spain\nSo everybody knows this and so they all sort of bats on on on the dollar I'm taking that money from Europe and um habits flood into the U.S where\nFactories are being built money invested in the stock market\nAnd here's the thing when every body is bullish on warm thing then it's likely to be had it for a top point that it's going to be even if temporarily and so why now everybody's bullish on a dollar\nAnd everybody who's got money that is it bearish on the euro say you could expect things to kind of ... for us\nAnd and I think it will reverse bats that how you you look at it and how you bet on it as you look at the uh the euro futures market ... and you can also look at the ATF for the euro and you can best match\nI mean you can also look at an option so you were on there'll be um you want to be so called long the euro so that she would buy euros so maybe the euro PF\nElectric strengths credit Fonda and you can make some money on it you know a day's a brutally tricky market ticket why cause Europe again central banks like bank of England the Federal Reserve and all the rest of it but there is some money to be right\nUm the euro's now down I Believe it's well under one twenty which is shocking to me given that I've travelled in Europe\nWhen it's in the one ... one forty one ... and the pound has been in the sixties that's been or trade to so for some time now the European currencies you have in the u._k. but the euro and the pound\nHas been in retreat is that related to Brexit for you I mean it's just a breakfast story Simon is that why the ... the euro in the pound or so weak\nFrom the pound his weight ... primarily because of Brexit the u._k. economy has been vibrant for a long time or it has tremendously low unemployment it also has\nBox moments of immigrants who've come from elsewhere in the European Union because they want to be here now you you don't come to Scotland for that whether\nYou were you ... it's lovely here I like it but but there's a bit of rain now you know like every half hour so when people are coming here it's because the economy is quite so I'll be the plunging the pounds which was you know like you say upper one Seventy not that long ago it primarily due to breakfast\nBut he the weakness of the euro is really nothing to do with breakfast it's to do with the fact that they the whole European eurozone economy is just fairly slow growing\nWhen you saw waiting for you know things like you know France and Germany being off the entire eurozone so those two countries are growing fairly slowly I mean that's that's what's really going off\nThat he will be even more aware of the things that the deputy attorney general or has been up to while working for the president\nRod Rosenstein took his post April twenty six twenty Seventeen ... immediately afterwards came lots of turmoil having to do with Russia gate\nThe president had fired fires James call me because of a memo written by Rod Rosenstein and then soon afterwards Rod Rosenstein makes a decision\nTo hire um a Bob Mueller to run this special investigation rather than an alternative so Rosenstein has been at the center of this whole drama for quite some time does he like it there early is Rosen seem comfortable with having all this pressure\nThere I mean I I imagine that what he tells them self when he walks into work on Pennsylvania Avenue that whose job is to protect the institution that he's worked for now for twenty eight years that apartment of justice I'm so\nLooking in a in a way I think that all of your listeners we can all sympathize with somebody wants to\nDo well by an important American institution life that apartment of justice like the Federal Bureau of investigation however the various things that the OJ and the FBI did during the two thousand sixteen presidential campaign\nBoth she uh irregularities and the abuses regarding the Clinton server investigation and the irregularities unlikely crimes\nThat were committed in the Trump Russia pro I think I I think we'd all be more comfortable if you were helping clean up the mess rather than to obscure the problems that we are going on there so I suspect that he's a that there are a lot of anxious times over there in the deputy journey attorney general's office\nThe hiring of Bob Mueller out that has thrown the whole country in this wait and see mode uh the president has spoken poorly of malaria spoken partly of Rosenstein has ... spoke and partly of Russia gate\nAt this point do you measure you mentioned those documents you measure that Rosen scene is looking to protect the institution surely he knows that the documents that would be the fight a war that number four in June twenty Seventeen that Rod Rosenstein\nThat would be as gulp Atari information about Carter Page and that would be the thrilled to for Bruce or in addition to the president ordered\nThe revelation of all text messaging by the principles that the FBI and the D. O. J. and the twenty sixteen you measure that rather than seeing is keeping those back not because he's interested in protecting some version of Russia gate but because he's an institutional as well so how does that\nHow does that interpret why why is the denying necessarily formation Y Z denying his information\nNo not just because they can and not just because he's an institutional is he wants to protect the institution but I Believe he's also protecting an operation here against a candidate Trump\nPresident elect Trump and then later the presidency itself he would like to know we would like to know what the uh you know the the the scope memo that he wrote for Robert mother saying the outline of the investigation\nMost investors redacted and we'd like to know what this says uh the fact that the fact that they are Jay has pushed back so hard on congressional oversight committees\nWanting to see what that says I I think it's I think it's fairly significant um this is what we do know is is that the Mueller investigation and very important for people to understand I Believe that the Mueller investigation is a continuation of the FBI investigation that again in ...\nIn July two thousand sixteen which was open on the Papadopoulos story which looks more and more bogus by the day\nAs it falls apart as it goes like Alexander down or the Australian diplomat walk this stack\nAnd this was also the investigation in which the FBI you use the Clinton funded opposition research to secure a warrant to spy on a Trump campaign official so the fact that this shame investigation is continuing under the control of Robert Mueller\nWho is being managed by Rod Rosenstein yes this is a serious concern and look there's another there's another document I'd I'd point to and there are other important point to him there\nWhen I was in ... appointed the special counsel to move to that investigation from the FBI to the the OJ he could've just let a deputy director\nOf the FBI Andrew McCabe who as we know has problems of his own right now\nChasing a grand jury here in Washington DC but he moved it away from him and put it under his own control this also should tell us something about the a bureaucratic gamesmanship of the deputy attorney general\nThe deputy attorney general was not involved in the original Russia gay scandal of Tony sixteen\nShe did get involved however for that for size so war it is that a a case that vulnerability for Rosa seem to believe that the vulnerability that he saw a sign that document the document that we want to see twenty additional now redacted pages from\nRight right yes I think it is it alone or ability I mean among other things that was spying then on\nTrump associates or as I point out a new piece and would have allowed ... it would have allowed the FBI to listen to intercept a model the communication is a very high level officials in the administration at the time\nPerhaps or even likely the president himself but it's a very bad thing or the other\nThing that I point out that when we're asking what is the redacted information\nWhat are they saying that then the new as another a congressional leaders have asked to see what are they telling us that's worse\nOr or at least as bad as the fact that the Steele dossier\nWas the premise of this or that there is the premise of the size of what what else is bad in there\nAbout bud Rosen thing signed it whatever it is I Would imagine he doesn't want the president and doesn't want a lot of other people seeing it were rosy things name is on that and the question I ask and the article is Rosenstein is the best that maybe he didn't read the application for the war as\nSo that's one possibility he didn't read it while that would be negligence that would be a professional\nProfessional negligence the other possibility as he did read it and he doesn't want people knowing that he signed off on something very bad that the FBI was doing a link guarding President Trump at that point\nRosenstein right now uh\nThe facing the question being fired or not is he in line to stay on for the rest of the first term or the rest of the term depending on how the election goes in twenty twenty or see in line to step aside the way many people rotate after the first two years how are you ready to say\nYeah I I mean the way I see it as right now ah especially with the cabinet nomination I mean there's a lot more this White House and there's a lot of the J to uh be focused on right now and so I Believe\nUh and and sources and told me that the president does not want to stir the pot anymore than meets the third and that would likely happen\nIf the deputy attorney general either or if he was fired or if he resigns so I think right now certainly up\nTo the election up to November I Believe that the White House will try to keep the department of justice as stable as it possibly can while I intend to other equally important business again like securing the nomination like securing Trump's nomination but Kavanaugh\nI Believe that after the election I'm\nThere will be I don't know yeah so you can describe it as people rotating out and other people who are so much and again\nThat's happened to fit into this administration's which by the way I think is a is generally a good thing to get people to do certain jobs and then you bring someone else in the ... or we can just say that yeah it looks like that Mr Rosen's being as likely to be on his way out\nA after the elections regardless of whether or not um Democrats take back the house or the Republicans hold him\nLeave Smith writing it and real clear investigations on the fate of Rod Rosenstein the deputy attorney general for the next weeks I'm John bachelor this is the John

scale of the challenge in the Pacific ad in the north Atlantic\n[laughter] no no they're not working together and that's part of the purpose of this paper is that even after the Goldwater Nichols act of Nineteen eighty six of the navy and the airports have not gotten together to come up with a joint concept of operations and for that matter both of them have been proceeding of based upon assumption of easy access to the theater so\nOne of the areas where the air force has gotten a where they're very out of balance as they over emphasized\nShort range fighter aircraft that can also

they laughed at American codes they regard them as simple as\nThe German codes were a little better the Germans have changed their codes a few times but they were good at that too there are a couple of guys name\nNigel ... and others in the room forty\nThat find reading a code easy\nUnimportant deep distinction Thomas you make in your book what is the difference between the code in a ...\nA a a that's a good question and it took me some some time to understand that aside for instance industry if you take one letter and replace it with another way to be for instance if you change if you change one letter to another or one similar to another it's a\nIt's a cipher code is if you if you use a word um I'm In place off another word offer another symbol so that's that's the whole difference there and to the gym and telegram was a cold it was not a cipher\nWithin a code and there were several code set the Germans were using Thirteen oh four oh five nine five o seven five hundred was another way of talking about their code\nSummer summer good summer bad you have a code book you conquer words and once you conquer word and you see it's repetition you when you come to it again you know that's what they're using for example Zimmerman's name itself had a code and when you recognize as you saw that there were men had signed the telegraph\nCompared to what we do today was signals intelligence that the simple rubber member where before digital communication where we've absolutely there's had also were before the first and second war taught everybody\nThat gentleman do read each other's mail all the time in fact\nThey read it so much they say gentlemen's mail and that's why history he's missed strayed always when you re discover how people came to decision it's All right the\nTelegram is intercepted hall gets it and he goes through what I'd have to say Thomas is a the work of a break novelist Peter ... world within world so that there's always doubt about how the cameraman telegram came into the hands of\nThe foreign secretary dial for to hand to page on February twenty third and it creates such a world of mirrors that you spend a deal of your book\nOr a a a translating those who have written about the ... over the last hundred years including hall who either miss representatives or miss understood at your book itself is the work of crypt analysis Thomas congratulations\nThank you thank you very much thank you very much\nHousework is genius and he has to be one of the icons of signals intelligence is given credit for that hearing the twenty first century\n[noise] oh I think absolutely I think he absolutely is he is credited as one of the fathers of ... says now the interesting thing is of course hall himself had a very weak crash of crypt analysis\nHe himself was not was not a a natural code breaker I'm I'm a ... you can see in his ... sometimes confuse us these different codes and you know you have to read his ... with care because\nSometimes it's deliberate disinformation and sometimes I think he just doesn't understand you know the uh the fine points of ... but he didn't have to be he was a fantastic manager\nAnd he was a political animal and I think this is what what what made them until a grant from the British perspective I'm I'm such a success story it wasn't that whole whole you how to hire the right people\nAnd he knew how to manage these people well they all admire him these these these these amazing quote breakers um but he himself wasn't really concerned with is um which is a new show\nUm if I may I Would just like to elaborate a little bit on what happens of\nCourse and by the way what I Would say is that hall is jobs and crept analysis is the ... the difference between jobs systematic prayed at the empire with what you'd have to say are create a creative ideas can like Titus yes I like\nThat no that that's that's a good analogy at what happened and I think that this kind of you know it goes a long way to explain why hall was so successful at what he did when the British intercepted gentleman telegram\nHum hum as it goes through London at the time you know again they were routinely intercepting American telegrams and and then also the Germans that were embedded in them um he he understands as you as you said that he has a bombshell in his hand see understand if he gives this to the Americans list\nThis will have an impact on because here you have in Germany basically offering American territory to to Mexico and and by implication also to Japan and he also understands that he needs to be really really careful in my interpretation of holds actions at the time is that he's the main concern was not that the Germans would find out\nHow hall had gotten hold of\nThe telegram but that the American scored as you said you know they were routinely intercepting American um liberty and this African American communications I'm In London and to a if the Americans\nUm had at that point asked hole\nWhere was this telegram actually coming from he wouldn't have a good answer and not have the good and he would\nHave to give up his access to jewels and he was very shrewd because he was thinking beyond the war and\nFlew to adults would play play into those into the hands of those Americans\nThat were saying hey you know the British they're just trying to pull us into the war to get the chest knocked out of the fire for them when the film until like one of the industry is published in the u._s. press and we'll get to that at this point there were people were asking hey how how how did this telegram how ... how do we get this in the first place\nAnd if it was if it had been review the time that this was a British Intelligence propaganda operation it could have played out very differently so so all the schools to save a whole\nLawrence Taylor from the first place he is so concerned that this doesn't get out that he doesn't even tell the foreign office which you know by by law he should have\nOn it because of his concern he he he was he was concerned that the Americans would learn 'em that he was intercepting American messages and
