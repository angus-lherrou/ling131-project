Iran\nSo do you see the possibility that with the ... the drowsy economic conditions the sanctions that they could be increased violence increase uh dissension from the sectors\nI mean it's possible uh I mean the provincial demonstrations that started and last December I mean life's a I think it's fair to say they handle all over on us not just in the periphery where you have to start it if they struck everywhere [noise]\nUm [noise] I again it's it's a very hard thing to to know whether the minority issues could explode they had been hot for a long time I mean they're particularly in places like I was astounded much fairer ups and pollution ...\nWhere for literally for decades the security\nServices the clerical regime I've had a very difficult time maintaining security particularly at night though the problems of the drug trade the revolutionary Guard Corps as a as a participant about drug trade and our wars between the Baluch or Sunni\nOr in the central government they've also had longstanding problems with the Kurds who are split between Sunni and Shia and Iran and I mean there have been very aggressive actions against Kurdish leadership also terrorist strikes brought so [noise]\nIt is a minority issue is a significant issue for the Islamic republic but I Do not like talking about it uh and uh and I again I I I don't think that's likely but if for example the largest minority in Iran the ... of a positive Raj on there were also\nA ... million center on work to actually ... and you were to see some type of ... nationalist movement developed and I think that would really be there to kill us hail the regime but uh\nWe haven't seen that we've seen demonstrations but we're not seeing violence yet a breakout I'm actually out\nAnd do you separate deal was a manifestation at the ... the military parade the bombing or do you don't see that as a potential escalation in terms of violence\nI don't know I mean it's an excellent question again the problems among the Arabs are on I have been there or they could be accelerating I\nActually a motive expected that you would have had a more violence earlier are given the regime actually has weaknesses with internal security\nAnd uh you have a fair number of Sudanese are and they were on and needless to say a Sunni militancy has been on the rise for over Twenty years so\nI think the Islamic republic has actually been lucky that they haven't had more violence more terrorism or aimed against the clerical regime\nA rule at the Iranian color economy is in tatters the currency is fluctuating between meaningless since then nothing what's holding the country together as it is it a peasant culture that can survive what we would crumble to [noise]\nWell I you know the place on a ... has a very urban culture uh\nAnd uh I think the biggest problem for the regime as not a the a deteriorating economy of of that is a serious problem it it was ... ... it's actually rising expectations\nI mean the Islamic republic has has seen worse economic pressure I Would I Would argue or during the Iran Iraq War years\nI'm Pam it survived the question is now\nOr do the Iranian people\nHave higher expectations and how much are they willing to push it on the streets that we saw in two thousand nine two thousand channel with interruption with the green movement which was initially about contesting a fraudulent project presidential election [noise] uh that the regime was able\nWith a whole for war our two little of\nViolence very directed very ... which part brutal for some uh put put down a demonstration that a ... foot two or three million people on the streets of Tehran [noise]\nUh the they have so far handled and uh the demonstrations that started in December and I've had the provincial areas where the regime certainly thought\nInto to have to worry about uh I think really it's an issue of how big the demonstrations are and how many places am pound the revolutionary Guard Corps and the best change\nBut the numbers out there to to handle it or or will they have problems because you know a few years demonstrating in one place and use the security forces from the same

by the way the Iranians are there also against the United states\nAnd they claimed the big victory because the court said that the United states should sanction humanitarian aid which they don't there are exemptions for it but much of that what they describe as civilian things like airport play parts are really for aircraft that are used for military and terrorists purposes as well but the the

Iranians winning overturning sanctions by from the U.S\nWell these are the sanctions a niche about humanitarian sanctions that the court of justice and the um the fact is you know the mullahs take the

land masses that occupy that vast amount of water we called the Pacific ocean\nAnd he's here to help me understand the new navy and the challenges ahead we'll begin with a welcome to the under secretary he is a graduate of the Naval Academy Nineteen eighty three he flew the U H one in which Tom tells me is the Huey fluid for the fleet\nAnd he's now a helping the fleet understand what it needs for the future especially the people in the fleet\nThere is a speech that Tom gave to the U.S Naval Academy graduating class this year and it's available on YouTube for all of these will understand the navy it's a pleasure to watch a speech to young people\nTrying restless in their seats in the hot sun trying to imagine what leadership is going to be like well gentleman leadership is what Tom looks like because he was once in those seats and now he's the under secretary\nTom a very good evening to you and thank you for this I Begin with the puzzlement what does it mean that you are now the chief management officer of the department of the navy good evening to top\n... thank you John and thank you so much for having me on your show I'm a great admirer here have you on your format and so it's a it's an honor for me to be here [noise] um but to explain the my position as the chief management officer then maybe this is something that the Congress are placed in the last several years ago I did actually had its genesis\nOr in the early to thousands when I was here before the deputy undersecretary of defense for financial management\nAnd the Congress was looking at ways to to assert the management leadership of the department and the political or in the political appointees\nAnd they struggled with how they would do that um because there are so many the way the razor responsibilities for folks in these positions is pretty broad\nAnd they wanted to ensure that somebody at the senior levels and each of the military departments have someone responsible for managing the business operations to include business transformation business systems modernization all the things that many of the things that the private sector has gone through in the last ten or Twenty years with respect to modernizing how they do business\nImplementation of technologies streamlined supply chains or things like that and they want to they want to try to elevate leadership for that to the most senior level as possible and an apartment and so they they designated issue of the service under secretaries as the chief management officers for their service\nAnd they also created a new position at an apartment a defense call the uh chewed management author of the department of defense you also have that responsibility I'm generally for the overall DOD enterprise\nSo what you're looking at it as a trading that did the challenges of the ... the way international companies do to assemble their products and sell it and watch it in and re interact with their customers in your case the customers of the people of the United states so in general are you taking on a task that is\nA that is ongoing or are you in ... so you're the first time I remember being told that the U.S department of defense has never been audited is that accurate\nThat is the entire department has not been audited has a department\nThat is happening right now that is one of my responsibilities as that she'd management officer and one of the things that the Congress was looking at it traditionally the audit function and the Arctic readiness function has been driven out of the financial officer position\nUm but one of the things that I've done it in the navy is elevated to my position because it's more than just the financial management problem are challenged\nIt's an enterprise wide challenged particularly when you have business systems in IT that span across a variety of shows from Personnel Management a logistics\nI changed they all have different environments and almost every decision may that is made in those environments has a financial implication that needs to be traceable and accountable to the taxpayers so that's really what uh so the the audit right now that we're we're undergoing as for the first time the department of defense or writ large is going through a\nDepartment wide financial management audit each of the services ... has hired a different audit for him to do that um and we're on that path right now and those results should be out in the November timeframe\nYes you were in the navy and then you transition I think that's the polite word that the navy uses from wearing a uniform to not wearing uniforms being in the reserves and you were at an audit firm price Waterhouse I Believe so this is calling upon your skill set that you learned after navy\n[noise] um I Would I Would say that's true in some sense in another sense when I when I left the navy I actually worked in the private sector doing corporate mergers and acquisitions\nUm both in the aerospace industry as well as in an IT Services so I gained some experience there and then when I came back to the department after nine eleven for a short standing about five years I really got steeped into understanding what the ... the management and business challenges were and the deal D. which\nI then when I went to high price Waterhouse Coopers then was doing that with clients both here and internationally I was the global defense leader for the farm\nAnd so I Would travel around the world speaking to other militaries about some of the management challenges that they had and it's interesting that there really aren't very many militaries and defense establishment and the world that uh for which the United states has a good comparison because we're so much larger than everybody else\nBut it was a fascinating time\nFor me because what I think I learned is that a lot of these smaller countries who have for our very risque or resource constrained have become a lot more creative and I think we have become in terms of how we manage business um and so there are a lot of those types of lessons that I'm trying to to bring here to the navy\nI Want to apply this to a real time concept which is a needle education\nI talk all the time to the Naval War college I in fact in fact I spoke to professor Jim homes last night about the Decatur incident and I learned deals often the Naval War college\nIt's a it's a pleasure because that is that see that's the idea is uh the navy for the last hundred years there is also the Naval Academy where you both so how does a lot of ability or a clean sheet review I think that's a technical term how does that apply to the institutions educational lead you to do and so the navy\nWhile John I think that that at the end of the day uh are competitive advantage I think in this country is always going to be um our ability to out\nThank our adversaries um whether that's in a business or in war\nAnd so as we look at the future of the navy and where the navy should be headed in our whole defense or a ... it's really aware if you look at success organizations a private sector or whatever the ones that are really done well and this and this era of rapid change other ones are the most agile\nAnd so I'm ... from my perspective what that means is that we had to have agile forces on the ground that can adapt and be innovative collaborate be transparent and what they do and do things a lot more quickly than they do them now but that also means is that we need to have people who have agile minds\nUm and I think that for me is going to be our biggest competitive advantage and so what I've done one of the first things I did when I came here with secretary Spencer\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLooking at what ... what also Tom I'm learning is that the navy is knowledge center not just shell hardware and software\nAnd the challenges now are to recruit and retain a the agile minds you talked about before are you are do you have a plan for that to do in ... uh to in some fashion ... hold on to the people you educate and to have people you've educated come back to you\nJohn if it's an interesting point and I always I always tend to sort of push back on this concept of read or retain um because it was my experience in the private sector particularly working for a large sort of consulting for\nIs that uh we found that it was more successful to think about people bringing people into a network\nUm because ... basically we have a large ecosystem of people in the national security space who contributed variety of different areas from being on a contractor side the research side the academic side as well as operational forces\nAnd and my view is that yes we want to recruit people we want to train them educate them but um we want to be able to retain them in the ecosystem so we have actually add some laws that allow us to\nHire people directly from industry now at more senior levels without having to bring them in and you know the old one and some level we can bring them and more laterally\nCommensurate to whatever experiences that have in the private sector and I think those are the types of things you have to think a lot more creatively about uh in order to to build a sort of agile force or this agile ecosystem of human capital that's going to allow us to be able to compete\nWith us for the moment I'm you graduated in Nineteen eighty three the Reagan Administration into a six hundred sleep six hundred ship Navy I believe something in a big number\nThat I think we're now about two eighty ah you said to the academy in your speech that you quote judge Secretary Mattis I'm your job is to protect the nation your\nOpinion Tom right now you're talking to the moms and dads here are we protecting our two eighty [noise]\nWell I think the number is always a an interesting debate when we when we were driving toward the six hundred ship maybe and when I was commissioned in eighty three a John Lennon with the secretary and he was driving to a six hundred ship navy and it was a ... you know I think the great things about the ... one of the greatest elements of that particular era was that\nWe had a very very well articulated strategy and it was very little confusion about what direction we were headed um I think that was just fantastic and we did reach six hundred at one point but it was probably about the time when I got out of the navy [noise] um let's see what was more important about that I think with the sort of a signal that fat\nThat we were serious um and uh to to our anniversary at that time the Soviet Union that we're serious and it made them second gas and think hard about um whether or not they were going to be a viable force or to compete against us and ultimately I think they determined that they could not be\nSo I'm ... part of part of it I think is a is is that there's a huge amount of symbolism and that but also even at the time when we had that many number of ships out there were still only had about a hundred and fifty a hundred and sixty of them out there steaming at any one given time are we now have two hundred and eighty five ships\nBut we're still trying to scheme and have that kind of presidents have about a hundred and twenty a hundred and forty out screaming at any one time [noise] so what it's doing is it's putting a strain on that that down that top line number now or much better at maintenance were much better at sort of keeping availability or ships are are more reliable\nBut we definitely just need more in order to be able to cover the geography that the the nation as requiring us to cover\nThomas ... is the under secretary of the United States Navy his task is chief management officer of vast vast sleet and all of its attendant personnel moms and dads and the children of and also the serving officers and enlisted men it's a vast Chad task\nOr however the twenty first century is going to make it very necessary mom I'm John bachelor and ...\n...\n\nHi this is Larry with some ... came up with is rather simplified evaluation of worrying it go this way they are only two reasons for worrying either you're successful or you're not if you're successful there's nothing to worry about if you're not\nThere are only two things to worry about your health is going to be good or you're going to get sick that if your health is good there's nothing to worry about if you're sick where there are only two things to worry about it you're going to get well are you going to die\nAnd if you're going to get well there's nothing to worry about\nBut if you're going to die and then there are only two things to worry about either you you're going to go to heaven or not and if you're going to go to heaven there's nothing to worry about I mean so why worry there does seem to be an obvious point in this I mean if your life's into with one who made you then there's nothing to worry about\nIs there\nOn Larry western world radio and I came here speaking for churches of Christ weekend I have a Bible study course years free write me World Radio west Monroe, Louisiana seven

Chicago\nIn early June and the gathering forces of the fragmented Republican Party they cracked up\nBetween the bull moose and the Taft Republicans in Nineteen twelve\nThere's no reason to believe that they repair themselves because simultaneously with the Republican convention the progressive or having a convict just down the street just down the street at the same couch the thinking here by the progressive is as tiara acceptable to watch almost no one else says we want T. R. if he wants us Teddy Roosevelt\nRemains an oyster bay he's inside more help there in those days the convention was\nOr the route that tradition was that the candidate would not appear and\nWouldn't

so we really know word for word what TR is doing now we've come to Charles Evans Hughes who you're wonderful\nQuote I have to read it again no one wanted to use but everyone was pouring Charles Evans

want to be president water his\nWhat ... what is just thinking he seems pious and unavailable a hundred years later\nYeah I mean it's it's not unprecedented to jump off the bench and run for president goes out to be targeted in Nineteen oh for for the Democrats success not successfully but who knows [laughter]\nAnd so huge does not wanted though he tells his wife his wife wants him to run he says

have worked TR holds back why\nTiahrt doesn't seem to know what he's doing really is easy is digging zag in every way around whether she knows that that that the Republicans would would reject him again and can't face sat rejection\nCould could very well be but George Perkins and a guy name a\nA cane Jayanti king who's a boss from Bridgeport, Connecticut have devised this strategy where they're going to delay the nomination of T R by the progressive which essentially sink his candidacy because they've got\nTo really threatened the Republicans into saying we're going to do a third party again and where we don't care what ... what what could a worked\nBecause the Republicans everybody ... you know with you\nI mean they weren't they weren't they were not excited that one of the reasons why this period gets glossed over in American history is because the Republican convention is so list list so on the floors list list but the machinations going on behind the scenes with T are are fascinating TR sends\nA telegram or a letter communication to the progressive to nominate lodge Henry Cabot Lodge that was the moment I dropped the book that is right just the way that the the
