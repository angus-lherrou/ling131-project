and larger and it hit\nA house in ... in which I'm a single mother and her three children were living but you know they get usually a Fifteen twenty twenty five seconds warning but she heard as soon as you heard the sirens that an incoming missile was on the way they quickly went into the basement\nThe whole front to the house was shared off this explosion took a concrete home and shattered it\nSo this was not a a small weapon this was a significant sites in significant impact I'm ... and certainly in Israel that fact that they attacked that's one of the red lines Israel can't tolerate they can't you know it's one thing when the shooting mortars across and\nIf they made life miserable for half a million more people in the south the fires from these balloons the\nIncendiary devices that burning tires that has caused a respiratory illnesses amongst many children [noise] um and they burn half the forest near gossip about twelve hundred actors\nOf land but the and about altogether between farmland land about ten thousand acres destroying crops killing wildlife destroying forests\nAnd and Israel has demonstrated such incredible power it's the\n... goes beyond that\nThe response was immediate and yet the response has not adequate Malcolm because there are other aggressions or the tunnels where are they\nThe tunnels are very serious matter and and you're quite right the people of Israel are demanding harsher response was I think Egypt may be others are urging the Israel to a moderate its response and not to attack and the they began again negotiations the Egyptian intel chief was started it again\nOr between with the ... with us\nOr as you know there are layer upon layer here yet I'm us versus the PA Hamas versus pigeon other groups and you have of course turkey involved to Ron and Ron car and bump or the war with Israel does so many things in this the onion that you can take layer after layer\nBut the the the Israel or the IDF attacked twenty targets military targets somewhere rocket installations others\nBut one of the most important was uh the tunnels and these are tunnels for terror they're very sophisticated these are not just the saint castle operation stay up stay involved the costs ... perhaps millions of dollars they hit their electrify day a blight say air conditioning\nAnd they are developing the Palestinians to Paris developing new means new technologies new\nMaterials that can deflect attention Israel has technology they use a combination of ah the sensors territorial censors 'em and they use intelligence and at at the logical sensors\nTo um to gather information they destroyed sixteen tunnels this year including the one recently which was a huge one\nBut the estimates are that there are perhaps thirty attack tunnels and several dozen more that are defensive and offensive I mean that they're used to hide arms die soldiers underground so that they can go and it's a surprise attack with it is or when they come under fire they can hide their\nAh we've seen that these that they're getting more sophisticated in the rockets and mortars that are are um are are being fired\nAnd be a so Israel has to develop new methods all the time to detect the tunnels because they're only purpose is for ... they want to kidnap they want to murder\nAnd the uh you know they have the fence now that it's going alone Israel's borders so it helps protect somewhat though not the\nUh completely so the the tunnels remain a really serious a danger and that's why the idea of hit them and try to hit other infrastructure without causing civilian casualties and nobody notes this but there are no reports about civilian casualties\nMalcolm who claimed credit for the rocket attack\nNo one and it's interesting how mullah both said wasn't us we're investigating wasn't us and um that seems to be quite common in the middle east today but the fact is that\nIt has to be you can't fire from Gaza without them knowing especially you know a a large rocket or being able to track exactly where where it's coming from and who was behind it\nAnd the you know the masses in charge and if the you know when you're in charge you're responsible even the EU issued a statement that said that the indiscriminate attacks against civilian\nPopulations unacceptable I Wonder if discriminate attacks are but they said you know the rockets and then he has to stop but they will take no action they don't do anything to implement it\nAnd in the meantime you have the escalation because it's diversion from the internal problems you know the PA barred the oil from going in now Israel has closed obviously the crossings and stuff because they placed bombs on them on that Israel's border there are no Israeli soldier so it's not against\nOccupation and

very good eating do the Europeans have filing notice Popular Mechanics reporting is that it they've read all the all the statistics and they got a copy of your book probably they had delivered over overseas you know in a rowboat\nThey got a copy of your book what are they doing about it and they got a response good evening to you Joe\nThank you so much for having me and I I I feel obligated to note that the book has a very brisk sales in Europe and in New Zealand there are spikes\nIn the ... in sales in the places that have these new space sports that are coming out of line so there's definitely a keen interest in space in Europe in their ... falling behind the United states um than all the different\nRegulatory in industrial farms and all the reinvention of space flight that I talk about\nIs having a real back then the Europeans are\nApparently very nervous about it they they uh this report from his advocacy group that came out\nIs filled with peril and fraud you they they're they're not all that into the United states that the United states has reinvented the way that they ah that that we achieved space and they can take advantage of board it was very interesting development\nYes they do they do have the European space agency but as we've learned big space isn't the answer what's going on now is commercialism of big space and you note in this report\nThat they're they're trying to match by American space with by European space how they got things that we want to buy Joe have they got a small business\n[noise] their satellites that communication satellites are excellent they have things that are worth watching for sure\nBut they don't have\nA robust launch industry they've got a very good space sport and\nSouth America where ah they're expanding even the kindest face the fact that they can launch with the the Italians they brought in but they take a launch system which is which is coming out of line next year the\nRussians large from French beyond which is the European space pork and South America and it's it's all good but that used to be a position that could dominate the industry and they don't dominate anymore and\nThe United states does and that's what they are worried about their where they're going to lose their autonomy when it comes to space and the space industry and they look at\nThe commercial space effort and the United states investment into the commercial space industry and how the government or leveraging that to do more things in the military industrial international side and they say what about the you know we're we're falling behind what can we do to catch up\nAnd that's what this report and that's what I was reading about and today's are right up\nDo have lots of ... but looks and bugs and investor and commercial as to what they need our convenience yeah what they need what they must have\nBecause I see China's taping this by\nBy coming up with what they call small private companies which are actually an extension of the pie LA a launch vehicle system but what they needed something like rocket lab I mentioned rocket lab Joe cars rocket lab is one of a matrix of small sat launch posters companies\nThat are looking to wind contracts commercial contracts and rocket labs has now chosen wall of silence here in the east coast and Virginia\nFor its launch site and that's an example of what you have throughout your book space as uh because\nThe the whole ... the the multiple the multiplication of launch vehicles it's what's driving this story here not having really one launch site which by the way I mentioned Joe is in the new world\nNot just having one blonde side but having many launch sites and having the flexibility of companies to compete for those lost sight\nWe're seeing the space industry led by the it's it's hard not to be ... Django is about this because the United states did a\nA very calculated gamble and it started in the Bush administration and endured they say the bomb administrator and and the Trump Administration is embracing it and doubling down on it in many ways and\nIt's the United states is doing something different encroaching space in a completely different way and it's paying off enormous dividends NASA\nCan now rely on cheaper launches focus on on more ambitious ex exploration robotic and manned by as well\nAnd the commercial side while but you know they were small satellites coming online like you mentioned rocket lab that expand greatly the number of places that can get involved in a number of missions out there more missions means happy space sports and\nI you know if experiment that happened with these three subsequent administration they may not be another policy that has survived those three administrations intact like this not among vets wildly successful\nUm ... it's starting to pay dividends and what's happening now is the launch system's getting into space as being ... and now they're looking at\nHuman space flight commercialize it\nAnd also landing on foreign bodies on celestial bodies landing on the moon is going to be leverage by commercial technology\nMilitary launches for all the billions of dollars pouring into military space a lot of that as being leverage in a beer the commercial space companies that are coming online\nNot just space I lost the most recent one blue origin um and there's a new rocket I'm a I'm a gay that's being tapped by the U.S military\nSo this robust industrial base is really paying dividends and ... and unable in the U.S government to do things that are lapping the Europeans and and are keeping pace with a new stuff with the Chinese are doing and\nAnd winning the United states off of Russian dealing launch vehicles to all these things are happening right in front of us so if it sounds like we're being optimistic or or being ... were just you know for me it just reporting what's happened\nIn the you you single out in your article and Popular Mechanics and the United kingdom space industry or his dad I'll leave situation are they aware of the problem more than Europe\nThey have a a big steak is but I mean especially in satellite manufacture I think it's like forty percent of the commercial communication satellites have roots in the u._k. somewhere they've got the space port in Scotland the new one coming on line there very much very proud\nSpace industry even though it's not very well funded and\nIt's hard to point to what the what they do in the same way that you can ... with other nations but what they do is very good if they find these niches and it can exploit them in the future when they'll find a home but they want an organic capability to do this and they're waking up to the fact that other people have this\nAnd the wall and it doesn't sit well with their national pride in their national security or certainly and and and again they see America First and they the reliance on the United states and I don't think they like that\nA genetically engineered organisms that and

... is running into the Russian Army Jeffrey we will run into the Russian Army with the Austrian game plan which is always attacks though they're out number\nThere's a man named ... commander a man named Bruce Ackerman are they aware as they plow into the Russians that they're out numbered and overwhelmed and being pushed into a strategy they can't possibly work\nOr not not initially they have there's some cause for hope you know the the central assumption of Austria Hungarian war planning\nBefore Nineteen fourteen was that to the great war would be against the Russians that even if they are able to fight with the Serbs the Russians would intervene and so the bulk of their strength would have to fight the Russians and so they had\nPondered how would the the relatively small Oscar Hungarian Army fight the vast\nRussian Army and this is this is a really a perplexing problem for the Austrians because the Russian Army is going to advance on a very broad front from the Baltic Sea all the way down to the to Ukraine\nSo all the way down to the nice stir so where do where can the Austrian strike with any hope of victory well there was no hope of a victory in the sense of breaking through or sweeping around the Russian flank in March into St Petersburg\nWhat the uh the Austrians always plan to do is to give it a short sharp jab at the Russians and knock them back and inflict heavy casualties and tear up their railways and retard their mobilization\nWin by time for the Germans to win in the west and then trying to support the troops to the east so often bag and a ... often bag and ... the three generals on the on this uh Eastern Front stunk all in the north for a ... in the center of brute um in in the south at ...\nThey were the army's that uh we're going to make the short sharp jab at the Russians and try to throw their mobilization of war\nThey called it ... that was attacked\nIt's kinda like the the US marine corps you know hated all did a lot of the middle of this was a true Austrian Army slang for you know sort of a macho attacks you know smartly delivered without a lot of preliminary fire and maneuvering and Frank and just spray up the middle and uh you know over power the enemy with your Manley says that we're\nSnitches early September Nineteen fourteen and you haven't seen that illustrates to me how nothing was going to work at one point six Russian patrol get lost in the woods and they come across to south in Austria\nAnd they tried to surrender the Austrian instead you report one of the Austrian officer says in check to the Russian letter surrender to you\nAnd so take some Russians take prisoner two thousand Austria\n[noise] yeah and this was you know this was a month or less into the war and already extreme demoralization on the Oscar Hungarian side and this was you know for many reasons first because the army was already suffering badly from nationality problems before the war\nParticularly among the checks which for one of the more sophisticated and and numerous a national minorities and the empire and they they held a lot of slots and the officer corps they were an industrialized rich province but the checks\nWere really treated like second or third class citizens and they thought this was particularly appalling because of all the concessions given the Hungarians and Eighteen sixty seven and the checks it always held up for the same kinds of concessions and didn't get them so by the time they get into the war in Nineteen fourteen\nYou see extreme disaffection among the checks both in the on the Russian front and on the Serbian front or when we talk about the Serbian front we see whole checking in is dissolving under fire and in this case that you just cited of this to battalions of check infantry and surrendered by their own officers to patrol of six Russians\nThis it it doesn't get much worse than that\nBut as for the actual plan for the offensive there were two options there was either a suit shots of southern stroke from ... to try to get around the left flank of the Russians are there was a ... so northern stroke a northern blow to try to get around the right side of the Russians and the problem is that the Russians were so numerous\nAnd they mobilize so quickly unexpectedly quickly because of the huge French investments in in Russian infrastructure before the war so they could now mobilized and deployed far more quickly than the Austrians are even Germans had anticipated\nThey have so many troops in the line very early in the war that the Russian that the Oscar Hungarians really can't get around either flank with any hope of success\nSo in the end they launched this first battle of there's a battle called crowds Nick and then a battle called comb are off these are the first the opening battles on the Eastern Front both or or you know a small time Austria Hungarian victories but they're rapidly absorbed by these huge Russian numbers and the tables are quickly turned\nAnd then after that I mean after these these short sharp actions of the very beginning of the war it's all downhill for the Oscar Hungarians\nThere's a photograph in your book on September tenth Conrad the commander of the overall army but certainly the commander of the strike north and arts to freak Rick I think they call him prints all\nThey traveled to the front for what you say is one of three wartime visits and they're standing on a road looking off into the landscape and very flat and behind them well up to be a number of German officers German Natasha days\nAnd they look ignorant no one's briefing them I guess they hear gunfire in the distance you this picture and accurate presentation of what intelligence they had about where the Russians were\nWell that's a great picture and uh and it it's interesting because it shows the the the very\nStrained relations between Conrad and our fridge right they're not really like ... or who work very much in tandem and are very effective pair\nIn fact a freezer because they have ... militarily inexperienced and\nConrad is very nervous and thin skinned and so there's sort of gazing off as if to try to divine what's happening they had good intelligence in the sense of that all of their frontline units where I'm from the second are in the ... and the third army\nAnd the fourth army and the case of that photo they're all in contact with the Russians and they're passing back information that they are in contact with you know a division or a brigade or a core or whatever so they're they're pretty good information plus they've got some limited aviation\nCapability so they're getting flyer reports giving them you know it's a bigger picture of a Russian movements but it's just that um as I talk about in the book their whole strategic conception was deeply flawed Conrad really believed\nHe was an expert on into the offensive and you really believe that if he just kept attacking the Russians he would somehow over all of them he would somehow destroyed\nTheir morale and throw them back and make them quit\nAnd um this was not a view confined to Conrad I mean you see this all around Europe and Nineteen fourteen the French are are are just as bad in this respect the battle the frontiers in the battle of them are and they're launching these high concentrated attacks at the Germans and suffering previous casualties but the the the the the differences that\nThe French rapidly adjusting to shove pulls everything back and changes tactics and goes into trenches\nConrad never read things that I mean oh he does obviously by Nineteen Fifteen sixteen but throughout Nineteen fourteen in the first half a Nineteen Fifteen\nHe's just like attacking relentlessly and its general just saying you know ... we can't I mean we're we're being were being destroyed and the truth phone do it they they they won't go forward they've they've seen this this movie too many times\nAnd and yet Conrad who in you know you mentioned that photo and it's also quite good because it captures the essence of these two men who were shot two generals par excellence I mean they only go three times in three years to the front\nAnd uh and uh so they have very little sense of what's really going on and what it feels like to attack Russian quick firing artillery heavy artillery and machine guns and they're they are\nTrying to make sense of the battle in and despite being briefed and everything else they're still or in\nIn the book is a mad to pass the outbreak of World War one and the collapse of the
