unknown and he was exchanged in the twenty first century and we get and the British gave back one of their recruits say it was a it wasn't even exchange and he was living peacefully we're told under

intelligence service saying ... percent we will get you out is not applied and it undermines recruitment and boot and\nWatch the career intelligence officer would notice more than anybody so get never made any sense [noise] uh and it still doesn't make any sense but let's go to what unfortunately seems to make sense to me and that is the new Cold War\nAnd you and I started calling him that the new Cold War almost five years ago it's not so new it's been getting worse\nWhile we've been distracted by judge Kavanaugh all and all the astonishing exploits of his high school years but when you go back and look at what's happened\nJust during that Kavanaugh hearings in the new Cold War gets really\nAstonishing the extremism\nThat's come over the American political class policymakers I find\nExtremely alarming you gave us some examples in your broadcast a threatening to attack\nRussian missile site take out take I got out that was done by the American ambassador to NATO it ... it wasn't somebody on a pension down in the morning forgive me to wind attached to a very high ranking and know tries to figure the ambassador to NATO um\nWe have I think you also said at a\nNumber of the United states is element secretary the interior Ryan things right yeah\nFor threat threatening him naval blockade against Russia that's threatening war you have senators John we've forgotten them like two weeks ago they were promising and they're working on today quote\nCrippling economic sanctions against Russia that's called economic war so you're getting these depositions of war I Want to give you one example that pains me a little but it's so last trip that I think we have to realize what's happened to our policy lead\nI Know Michael McFaul for many years and these are very nice guy\nBut it's got to be sad that he was Bible ... a former professor of Russian studies at Stanford University a very prominent university and later President Obama has not only Russia and and the White House but his ambassador to Moscow for two years [noise]\nSo they're says this may be the leading public American authority on Russia at least a media trees seem that way a diplomat and I'm ... key is now saying\nBecause one counts on people like look fall to stay calm\nAnd to avoid extremism but he is now saying\nA an article in the Washington Post September twenty eight just a few days ago we won Russia's now the\nGrave a threat in the entire world the greatest threat that the only way to react to AA and na permanent escalating sanctions that will automatically\nA BMW and whatever Russia\nDoes something wrong in other words this term that warfare if not sanctions\nSpecifically directed at anything but it's a whole new policy of permanent escalating sanctions and he gives one example that is I don't know why is editors didn't query him about this but he says it\nEvery day Russia helps the rebels and the gun boss region of Ukraine where there's a civil war sanctions should escalate\nSo three hundred and sixty five days a year sanctions should ask escalate on Russia that this is a form of extremism\nMaybe ... didn't need it but it reflects what's come over our political class in regard to Russia and I find that ah\nI almost unprecedented one thing that should be added here [noise]\nI don't know if there's an analog in history maybe it was a McCarthy Era but this thing we call Russia gate I think you'd agree John it didn't exist when you when I started under the rule book of the new Cold War in two thousand and four to eight\nKnown was invented it entirely after the election of twenty sixteen entire\nWell I I Would argue that a little bit it was growing before the election because you remember Mrs Clinton during the debate into sixteen called Trump pollutants pop but so this this story was already out there we know that the famous dot CA by Christopher Steele of so called a\nPie Kremlin dirt on trouble was being leaked to the media and to sixteen that's his tablets yet and to sort of the FBI but the point I Want to make here is\nIs that ... way historians look back and write the history of this Cold War and this assumes that when this Cold War coordinates there still will be historians but it doesn't become a nuclear war or\nWhen they write it the way we've been writing the history of the other Cold War which is a big\nHistorical industry new books a pure all the time they're going to note and maybe be amazed by the fact that Russia gay has become part of the new Cold War\nIn two senses it affects the weight Trump can and cannot make policy toward Russia but Russia gate to the extent that it's believed in this country and I guess the numbers are about fifty fifty people who believe Russia gate demonize is Russia because it accuses Russia all having\nUs during the presidential election into six changes and now this is a point I Want to make [noise] we have a series of publications\nIn the New York times ten

discussing the myth understanding between Israel and Russia that happened immediately after the shoot down to the Russian and surveillance aircraft\nWhere the prime minister was eager to\nA calm the waters and the president of Russia was in a position of having many voices in his ears some of which were ready to react immediately please continue\nJust put his first reaction was to be conciliatory and excuse Israel\nSay oh it was just such as the war zone in Syria it shows how dangerous it is mistakes made I don't know how to use the expression fog of war but that is how Russia the media interpreted his state including getting\nBlame it on Israel but on the fog of war his own military said absolutely not Israel is fully responsible the prime minister of Israel and the ER and his defense minister Lieberman writes I wanted to fly to Moscow that day\nI imagined us now John they wanted to see a pool and persuade them of something you said no you can't come\nAnd the reason you can call me didn't say this was is that I Can't let you come in light of what my military is saying is that you\nAre responsible so instead of Israel sent a low level military delegations the shah was\nIs that who switched positions [noise] an adopted the position either because he was persuaded by the evidence the ministry of defense skating or because his political position wasn't tenable Fifteen Russians had died that's not nothing John\nFifteen Americans die having come we don't pay attention in Afghanistan but if they died at rushing hands some place that would be in a court in this\nCountry and I believe that included a general officer who was a ... a prominent in Russian defence industry and we're talking specialist center surveillance aircraft they were not uh they were to these were not draftees\nDirect so we're looking at an incident that has been a blow to the Russian military no matter who did it and then the Syrian set a date but the Russian reaction has been halfway belligerent to then say we're going to deploy as three hundred which is ... different capability than the U.S two hundred that shut down the the surveillance craft\nShow now prudent has to make a decision\nIt would appear\nThat he was being told by some members of his military\nBecause they blamed Israel for having position the planes as it did and having done it on purpose that Russia should shoot down a few Israeli planes and strike\nI mean they wanted really aggressive action who was going to do that but the decision he made is ram a fine and we ought to talk about what it means if we know what it means for many years Syria\nAnd also by the way around has wanted\nThis air\nSurface to air defense system known as the ass three hundreds and now there appear to be\nAn order and newer variant of this and the report is is that having made the decision now at last after three years four years of Syria asking for it to give it a system to\nThe Russians will operate and not strange but it's a powerful system we don't have anything like it\nExperts agree that it has multiple in the capacity to shoot down multiple aircraft or something like [noise] I don't know two hundred and fifty five hundred ... I mean it has an enormous range in fact\n... could declare a no fly zone\nOver this area of Syria now so this changes everything\nBecause the Americans are operating mirror the Iranians are operating there the Israelis [noise] thought this is a very big decision for who he so far as I Know has never given any country\nThere is also for hundreds system which the Chinese one and he may give it to the Chinese but that's a separate relationship [noise]\nUh Americans are not in a Chinese combat so Steve\nI talked with them is a former Israeli generally now leads the think tank in Tel Aviv\nAnd he indicated the three hundred system if deployed and there's some question of whether it will be deployed because they've talked this way before\nIf deployed would be in the hands of Russian agents only not given to the Syrians that still doesn't solve the possibility of accident but it does remove the possibility that there'll be another incident such as\nA couple of weeks back there was a twist here if that system is deployed around or in the vicinity of Iranian missile batteries which I Believe was the target for the Israeli air raid that led to the Syrian firing missiles in all directions that means that\nThe Russians will be in a being a place where they have to decide if they're going to stand down pending and Israeli air raid it's not a good story Steve is not going to need fashion\n[noise] well let's look at\nFirst of all this look at the political\nApplications it means is now officially that Russia has become the ...\nOf Syria correct\nCompletely correct politically it was a protectorate that has to say ... representing us saw on the president of Syria in world affairs now\nAssuming this has got to be a no fly zone you'll need Russia's permission to fly operation what\nMust not happen is an American or Israeli airstrike killed a Russian that must not happen\nBut that's why I say we now moved to new level and the dangers of the new Cold War\nWhile we're sorting out the ... that we've been distracted like this is really something new and important the second thing it tells you now is that if you weigh the jewel political things in terms of victory in the last ...\nI don't like to do it but there's no question that when ... who entered Syria three just about exactly three years ago September two thousand this thing and everybody in the west side it wouldn't be a disaster and the Russians couldn't do anything with from that moment\nBecause it was Russia that destroy the Islamic state not the United states in Syria\nTo now becoming and remember Mrs Clinton had argued during the two thousand sixteen presidential election that if she was president she would declare a no fly zone over Syria so Russians couldn't fly there you can see how far polluting than Russia had come on the world stage by this this guy I mean I don't want to say it\n[noise] so this is geography of Russia annexed Crimea\nWhich is a financial\nWith no natural land border with Russia except through Ukraine and the Ukraine border has been closed So Russia has had to supply crime me it's very expensive either by air or sea\nAbout four months ago folks might have seen the TV footage of it it was very dramatic Russia's been building I think is fourteen mile bridge I don't know if it's the longest British in the world but it's a very long bridge from southern Russia\nTo Crimea and it's going to have as I understand it three bridges actually won for automobiles one for trucks and one will be for trains the one for\nTrucks I think I'm gonna try to open five months ago and putting drove the first truck driving a truck truck across the one for automobiles so like if I wanted to go to Russia and visit\nCrimea now drive\nThat to be open and I think the rail bridge is probably about Eighteen months away that means that the port of Mary ... now you and I talked about or you will remember this\nI Do remember there was an offensive a drunk driving in Mariel poll I write a big guns rattled in those last week the hot war\nThat try and to fourteen when the civil war began\nA following the fall of Ukraine's president I'm Don square and the uprising Mary ... was taken by the rebels is a very very important seaport\nMaybe the most important in Ukraine I'm not sure but it's very very important [noise] and the rebels held it for about two weeks and then the Ukrainian army control bike here took it back\nAnd controls it today [noise]\nSo since the bridge has been built Russia has become very interested in the sea lanes of Mary ... about his off which is a tributary of the black sea the whole region is the black sea\n[noise] ah Russia has been moving\nWarships and I guess these little boats whatever you call them these patrol boats into the area and it's been stopping certain by burying ships and examining what's on board with Ukrainian Turkish French I think Russia has said so said this is our water now\nAre ... and ... and ... if it stays a certain number of miles from Mary ... borders at whatever age three miles or twelve miles but it's been a\nRandomly stopping ships the president of Ukraine\nPut her shingle who has a single digit some board\nAnd is up for reelection quite soon in March I think of next year has declared he's got a ...\nIn the house all see Russia where his naval power which Ukraine doesn't have much has some ships and these two ships that\nThe United states sent to Ukraine you told me John really are at war vessels though patrol Val\nUnless you're a ... unless\nA smuggler no they wouldn't have thought of another warship\nBut the significance of this\nIn my mind is it's been dangerous enough in Ukraine but it's been ... and the fighting has been going on in done boss off the line that divides a gun boss from Kiev control\nUkraine that has meant that the fighting has been spilled into this other part of the cry civil war has been kind of remote\nFrom people that goes on people die every day uh the Kiev army still shells during the day when kids go to school they're not supposed to but all reports say that they do they're all sorts of proposals to end this war but this is an escalation because it now could become award the and ...\nWhich is so I'm not sure I pronounce that it's very ... it's terribly terribly important and Russia will now\nUh bring pressure to bear there as it feels and has a right and a crane depending on what Washington does oh we'll do something so we can see here now on water John\nThe un Adam immigration of foreshadowing other kind of catastrophe that took place in September in Syria [noise] uh where\nPeople died now in this case it's Ukrainian and Russians you know the difference between them is often hard to tell most Russians most Ukrainians speak Russian [noise] uh as well as Ukrainian so this is a new emerging\nHot spot in the new Cold War and it couldn't get much worse very quickly attending on what Trump to us and here is a question in my mind that we probably won't discuss tonight and you probably know the answer better than I Do [noise] who is making these policies in Washington\nBecause Trump clearly\nDoesn't want a war for a policy with Russia and yet look at all the quotations examples that you cited today and recording by officials of the American government\nThey're very warfare Trump clearly is not in control\nRussia policy in Washington so why we have\nThis new and I think more dangerous Cold War we have an almost unprecedented situation in Washington where the president whatever we think about him\nIs not in control in primary at least a policy toward Russia which raises a question who then it's just a post script quit you'll remember I'm sure that into sixteen President Obama got it in his mind to cooperate with Russia against terrorists in Syria\nAnd they struck an agreement secretary of defense carry once a Moscow about what ... they shook hands it was destroyed by the department of defense which attack Syrian troops and that was the end of that so it's not without precedent\nA conflict or opposition or perhaps sabotaged that President Trump faces when he tries to quote cooperate with Russia\nDavid

pressure on Bezos is Fifteen dollars in addition to what you're saying is this Fifteen dollars buying some peace for a while\nBut I think that's exactly what it's doing it's it's an olive branch or at least a token to try to buy some social goodwill because at the end of the day Amazon probably fears government regulation more than any\nYou know ... or ... showing that it can out compete an out

response to market conditions and I think this is one of those interesting situations where [noise] sometimes uh some people perhaps like a Senator Sanders might argue that the market doesn't create the outcomes that they want would want it to create\nBut this is a perfect example of the competition for workers heating up to the point where now workers have the bargaining power\nAnd Walmart and target and Walmart are all in a an Amazon are all in a massive\nCompetition for workers they've been raising wages consistently for the last few years and a Walmart is even going to the point of offering to pay college tuition for its workers if they get a business or religious six degrees that would allow them to move up in the company\nThe old theory from the Federal Reserve and I don't subscribe to this I just read about it Michael is that wages are fifty percent of inflation and that one's wages start to move you're in a cycle you are behind or something like you can catch up\nIs this evidence of wages moving too quickly are are we looking at do we have the Goldilocks economy right now not too hot not too cold\nIt's hard to say and the number one rule of a economic school is I don't try to forecast what's coming down the line and number two rule is\nDon't try to forecast what's coming down the line but I Would say from all indications we are kind of in a Goldilocks age I don't know how long it's going to last but a wages aren't a falling behind inflation\nThey're slowly are outpacing inflation even if it slow\nAnd a workers are ah spoiled for job opportunities right now so it's hard to imagine things being much better\nAnd finally you mentioned Wal Mart's several times Wal Mart says that great big fancy operation did Walmart Smith the boat when it didn't create Amazon what's your opinion Michael they had they had everything at one point Nineteen Ninety five and then along comes that does do they do they do they worry at night that they missed it\nI'm I'm certain they do because they're already trying to hustle to catch up in the Internet space but I look at this story as a general a sample of how good market economies are because they are uh\nBusinesses have to be flexible\nAnd responsive to consumer demands\nA Twenty years ago you and I might not have been able to say that ah the Internet and Amazon was going to be as big as it was a but but we have that now\nAnd now Amazon or Walmart\nIs trying to catch up to Amazon with its own online sales and in fact I just bought something at Walmart dot com the other day\nBecause the price was better there than on Amazon so I think that it's a good thing to have Amazon and Walmart and everyone else competing against each other because it means that you work that much harder to satisfy

organization into a organized crime\nI mean you and it\nAnd I'm so Santos and go brings them all to event and it has this so called up peace agreement that he does what he does an extract any concessions that he doesn't make them hand over the money that they made that hey we don't have any money he says okay that's fine and then\nHe doesn't make them or do any jail time\nHe says okay you can go off to these little farm innocent in rural areas where you'll be fine for some period of time where you will then you know confess your crimes to a to a special a peace court\nAnd then you can be reintegrate into society ignoring the fact that these guys are basically mobsters\nAnd um ... which is not to say that I don't think they some of them still have a political agenda but their political agenda is tied to expanding their business is OK so this idea that they were going to get out of the businesses and they were gonna do regular jobs\nUm I think was never really believable I thought it was laughable and you know you know that over the years I wrote very strongly against\nMaking these concessions to these guys who have a whole history of atrocities and human rights violations against the civilian population of the country so here we are you know I'm not quite two years I mean I'll be two years in November that they've signed these peace agreements and why do we find we find\nThousands of members who are FARC guerrillas so we're supposed to go they said the rank and file guys they were supposed to go to these rural enclave hand themselves and spend\nTime there confess their crimes et cetera there were turning to the battlefield they're returning to the battlefield because they're fighting against other armies illegal armies that have come in to the space where they were and taking over the cocaine miss it\nAnd they're sitting there going wait a minute we're going to send in these camps or any real jobs that pay minimum wage and these guys are still going to be making the money in a way so they have gone back to the battlefield that's one problem the second problem which in my mind is even worse is the fact that the\nHead honcho Z who were sitting in a van Gogh shady deal had been found are alleged to be still and cocaine business and I can talk a little bit more about that but the point is they don't want to get out of it as a so it's not that the current president\nYou know doesn't want to enforce the deal but in order to enforce the deal or can go to and to complete the deal to implement the deal he needs\nPark which signed off on it to do what it said it would do and guess what what has surprised you know these criminals are not keeping their work\nThe complaint right now you report is from the Colombia's attorney general's president attorney general minister Umberto marching as much you know\nThat the FARC is not complying with the peace agreement in ... I'm worse in the special piece chords are making fun of them are making a far south as there are there are also testifying concocting documents no Martinez has the power of the state and the new president ... okay\nI can exercise power in some fashion is limited in in some important ways she politically compromise to in order to prosecute these complaints by his own attorney general\n[noise] well no I think the attorney general couldn't prosecute them but I think what becomes clear when you when you read about that allegation is the same old tired of the whole problem with trying to police this\nThis drug trafficking which is that they make a lot of money in this business and what do they use that money for they buy weapons\nThey recruit soldiers and they corrupt and bribe a law enforcement and institutions inside the country Colombia courts are very much corrupted by drug money\nAnd this is just an example I mean the the special piece court was supposed to be you know the the one where the interview them and find out what their crimes Warren right them all down and this is going to be a way to sort of have a cleansing a spiritual cleansing of the country because everything would be out in the open and the criminals have confessed\nBut it turns out that there's already corruption inside the Peace Corps they're officials inside the peace court that had been cooking up a false ... Martinez described it and and fraudulent testimony in order to help\nFor you know the FARC members basically escape and and and go off and do whatever they want to do so the court is corrupted\nAnd you know he says that he is going to prosecute this particular series of people that he caught if the court can be corrupted like that it will be corrupted again and again and again it will be very hard to keep up with it\nAnd you know one of my big problems with this court in general is that why shouldn't you have a parallel court system\nWhy shouldn't you say somebody if you killed somebody over there you have to go to jail for Fifteen Years but if you're a card carrying member of the FARC and you killed somebody or killed five people all you have to do is come and tell us that needed to go free creating a parallel justice system is fraught with problems", "show_name": "The John Batchelor Show", "year": "2018", "city": "Fairhope", "day": "03"}
