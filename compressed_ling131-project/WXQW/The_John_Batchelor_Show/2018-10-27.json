transformation\nVisit scholar dot com today to modernize your digital experience the business of America is small business this is the American business report with gene marks\nThe rights a small business column for the guardian as well as the Philadelphia Inquirer a very good eating to Eugene there is good news in all directions for small business as the small businesses of America I've been telling us for several years things are getting better all the time indeed we have a three point five percent first round report\nOn the GDP for the United states consumers are spending an eye sees on that because that's what small business cares about you have reported that\nThe fed beige book is indicating gross steady growth going forward a though there are trade concerns were mentioned that but do small businesses continue optimistic or is there some hesitation is winter approaches in the north good evening to\nChina it's great to speak with you yeah all all that information or that you report it is accurate the or GDP numbers came out day is three and a half percent it was above what estimates were expecting um the economy um as continued to grow um some people are are forecasting more than a four percent\nUh yeah GDP increase in two thousand in Nineteen so we'll wait to see on that\nA jobs numbers good consumer spending is up consumer sentiment is leveling off a little bit but that could just be a monthly monthly blip now\nThe Federal Reserve um every month they go through and they they surveyed their um their their regional banks and um you know they put it together actually into a like sort of a quarterly report that they like to do to twelve regional banks called the the fed beige book\nAnd what it is it's again it's just a it it's it's an addict auto survey of how things are going in the different regions of the country and\nI'm ... page book to results were were released today and ah or reporting what we all know already economic growth is steady although most of the regional new Federal Reserve's reporting that businesses and all across all regions are\nStill are concerned about tightening labor market higher wages um is a potential concern or for for business as well as trade and now that's going to impact a you know a lot of states economies I mean John some states you know California and\nA twenty two percent of their GDP common was from trade with overseas partners I mean Michigan it's like thirty eight percent it's a it's a big numbers um so some states themselves are are very you know are relying on on on trade\nCanada Mexico or are the biggest trading partners as well of course as China\nSo right now we're at a stage and trained where you know the north American trade seems to be on a good track\nNow there's been some agreement there still has to be signed by the president and um as well as the Mexican and Canadian Prime minister the president's ah but China is the biggest you know so uh you know a lot of the Federal Reserve regions are concerned or either\nI I Will restore itself 'cause you know I watch China very carefully there will not be a quick resolution to that because Beijing is not prepared to change its business plan where it has become the number two economy on the planet\nBy pretending to be a developing nation and therefore it can subsidizes can steal it can cut corners it can ignore international agreements that's not going to resolve itself quickly until the leadership in Beijing results\nTo join everybody else and play by transparency and rules so I go to what's wrong here in the United states right now and you mentioned it there's a shortage of workers Jean and I ... that has to be a continuing concern for small business\n[noise] yeah it does I mean I I wrote about this in the Philadelphia Inquirer um you know just a a week or so ago how employers not only in the northeast region but across the country continue um to to have a hard time when when\nWhen the unemployment rate comes out and shows at historically low rate lowest rate since the late Nineteen sixties um you know the Trump Administration shares the economist share of\nAh but I you know my clients and small business owners around the country or not cheering\nWhen they see that because it is it it makes them and makes it very very hard to attract new employees to their companies\nThey are fighting very hard against larger companies um they are dealing with companies like Amazon as well as Wal Mart target that are paying higher minimum wage is ... what a lot of small businesses\nCan't afford it is a you know it's it's a good the good the bad we're seeing a growth ... it's great that an employment is low but a lot of small business owners are more or finding it very very difficult to find\nPeople I can tell you that you know some of the things that I'm hearing across the country as I speak to groups and I meet a lot of business owners\nMany of them are reaching out to high schools technical schools community colleges nurturing relationships with students I'm really at a at a high school age inviting them to their companies offering internship speaking at the schools themselves\nThat has become a significantly more popular way for small companies to trying to attract workers um into their businesses um and they'd been forced to do this and be innovative with programs like this and some of them are really succeeding\nGene you know a deal about personal income taxes and business taxes so therefore how do we all get to be Jared push push is there a formula that you can lead on well ...\nShots for like ... about a week or two ago the New York times had a front page report about how Jared Kushner had not paid any taxes in the past five or six years and [noise] you know it was kind of referring you know inferring that oh you know what kind of sketchy deals as you doing where he's\nCheating the government out of taxes and that that's just not the case I mean whether or not you agree with which aired Christmas politics or not um she did not paying taxes because he took advantage of certain incentives and the tax on set up sort of been around for a while that I think a lot of business owners need to understand as well Christians in the real estate property business\nHe buys buildings in rehab them renovate salmon rents them out\nThere are some specific new depreciation allowances that are allowed for businesses like him so he can fix them up front deductions um that that offset any income that might be coming in\nBusiness owners themselves have the availability to take some significant deductions on capital equipment that they buy from many case up to a million dollars a year John\nAnd if you're a business owner and you want to buy equipment\nLike Jared 'cause you don't necessarily have to pay for it you can put a down payment you can finance the rest as long as you put that equipment or that property into service\nYou can take a big tax deduction Ford cushion your did this to the extent where there's the directions were even exceeded his income and then he was able to carry forward those losses or even carry them back as well so everything he did was completely legal and above board and not only that it's good tax strategy\nPre protect your property install storm shutters or have plenty of plywood on hand to protect

resentment of the American business report ... gala gala a leading marketing technology company powers and millions of digital side\nAround the world leading the wave of retail transformation visits gala dot com\nToday to modernize your digital experience Jean right for the Philadelphia Inquirer his small business call them\nAs well as the guardian we go to optimism and post recession high and small business I like this talk gene I liked the fact that businesses are happy small businesses especially but is this in the rearview mirror you've been traveling\nDo you see this routinely or are those worries we've evidence this evening a crowding it\nA combination that's huge on on Capitol one bank um\nJust came out with their latest small business growth index ah they do this twice a year\nAnd this index found a sixty seven percent of small business ... I think that the business conditions in the area are good or excellent\nAnd that was up from sixty percent uh this time last year um they also found that a third of them plan to hire in the next six months which is up from\nTwenty five percent over a year ago so is it that's all good news\nUm but that that small business grows index also found that there was some current concerns that small businesses out of things that we just talked about in in our last segment obviously finding people um but in addition to that you know the high cost of health care remains a big concern among business owners\nTaxes and their impact on on their business tax reform will have an impact on of course trade a could have an impact like we talked about before so\nThe optimism is still there a business owners are happy and looking forward to a good holiday\nUse them but there are some concerns that's the way on their mind and here's a concern that I didn't know existed but Jean's\nColumn and the guardian points out that we're looking at a nation of lawbreakers who don't mean to but you know intention allergies is not something you can plead in court you either break the law or not what it's about a fire and how is it making people I'm\nTroubled well\nIt's not just bought a fire but it's it's any music streaming services and so you know\nYou might look 'cause my sister she she runs out of the family doctor so she's a small business owner she runs a practice down in Philadelphia and she streams a spot if she's got music playing right over the speakers for her patients in the waiting room to here she's not alone right we go and\nCoffee shops or restaurant ... yet dreaming the music right right\nTurns out that all of them including my sister are breaking the law\nThe the license agreements for that streaming music as evidenced by a company called soundtrack your brand or who is a company that goes after things like this I'm a said that eighty three percent of businesses small the around the country and around the world are listed Lee using these services\nSpotify apple music for public consumption you're not allowed to use it for public consumption that your own personal service\nYou oh these people are you a license fate and because nobody's paying these license\nFees it's costing the music industry more than two and a half\nBillion ... is this like it's just like the the little sign on mattresses right I mean the penalty of death is right I ride a voyage which was a threat in my youth but I then I learned that we're all going to go to jail together so I relax [laughter]\nWell I did a good luck to soundtrack your brand and good luck to the music industry try to find all those millions of small businesses are collecting royalties [laughter] I don't think that's going to happen in our energy alerted them to the possibility that the that the that the music police could be showing up at any night\nKnocking on the door saying All right uh entrepreneur as we celebrate\nThem in ... in our world in a in America today you have the king of Prussia I'm a new guys we have the Silicon Valley new guys there in Austin, Texas how is it that they make bad decisions given that they look so well to do\nWell there was a new study that came out as well that I wrote about on ink dot com and it's got a great Dane John it's called\nCurb your enthusiasm is the name of this study was done by researchers from the University of bath and Cardiff and London School of economics and you know and you know what I found\nIt found that optimistic entrepreneur is earn less money they surveyed a bunch of entrepreneur is in the u._k. and other parts of the world and they found out that ... that\nHave a more optimistic outlook of the world are turned out that they made worst business decisions then entrepreneur is our business owners that were more pessimistic\nHat so it turns out that if you're a glass as half full person sometimes you can be blinded by what the right decision or not as opposed to being somebody a little bit more\nHow shall I say cynical and John I'm a I'm a CPA cynicism comes as part of my job and so I I feel I have nothing to worry about there but if you're that kind of a person you might want to temper down a bit or at least surround yourself with somebody a little bit more realistic\nFinally we have a minute and a report from Philadelphia this isn't the Philadelphia Inquirer a very well informed about China and China and tariffs what do they want\nThey want to see the the Chinese published a punished excuse me in fact from a recent study by a company called um there's by cell they said he chews thousand entrepreneur is an overwhelmingly they supported President Trump's move against China\nSo you know the president has support of the small business community behind them and doesn't surprise me again I think I mentioned earlier\nBusinesses have been complaining about you know China's unfair trade practices and allegedly taking of technology and all of\nTheir ... their pirates their parts it's not it's not a debate here there are pirates but I bought I welcome is that small business owners in Philadelphia a city you and I love right there on the front line of foreign policy thinking good [laughter]\nThey get it there one with Capitol Hill in fact they were probably ahead of Capitol Hill at what took a while for the members of Congress to realize that those Chinese checks bounce gene marks he is a small business columnist for the Philadelphia Inquirer and for the guardian\nBusiness of America is

Juno\nJupiter you've got a very small orbiters and so so this is and you know now they have a pro heading towards murky mercury and you also have to sell the puck approach so it's a very busy season and so that's one of the reasons they want her to hold off I suspect they will try again come January\nWe just have to keep our fingers crossed that somehow that solar panels get revealed one of the concerns is that uh the cold temperatures\nWill ruin the battery for good and because there's no Dustin\nAtmosphere think about it's always warm on a cloudy night when the sky is clear nothing to hold the heated and the customers holding here and tell us gotten colder and so it could very well be that opportunity has filed he's left us where\nCommon for a opportunity okay just that right there will get their suits to sue sue we'll walk right up and say that is the Smithsonian on Mars All right we've got a high boots a to a this is the third row her so why why did they rehearse\nWell here's the deal they originally going to land in late October and grab a sample um but the root route you grew does has no tiny dust pauses no soft mood sections nothing at all it's all a rubble pile of of boulders rocks\nAnd that's a problem they hope to have a landing area that was smooth enough that was at least\nSixteen meters across that's about what is that is about two hundred um but they didn't find anything that wide what they found something that the best they've been able to find something twenty meters across about fifty forty feet\nAnd so they decided to do additional rehearsals hold off until January the landing\nAnd so they've done now they don't want to sell our earlier on and then this launched they've done out to vote for our souls I have links to the pictures I posted\nThe closest image and they don't have any scale so trail to know that we do know they were going to try to get within twenty meters of the surface about sixty feet so that's probably what it says so these are very tiny rocks\nHum how good that their aim was I don't know they haven't lived at least a press release they now have a couple of months to relax because\nI'm the son is moving in between a ... and the earth and so therefore communications is not easy they won't lose communications but because of that they they got to hold off of these more complicated maneuvers we just have to wait and see what will happen in January what is Parker\n[noise] the pocket solar pro if you remember was launched a few a month or two ago um to do a series of increasingly close fly by the sun to tell us something about the atmosphere of the sun and the corona\nAnd did a flyby of ah Venus in October early October and what what's key here is that this week it turned itself around and talk looked back and took a picture of the earth the mole\nI have a close to them behind the black it's not particularly spectacular\nImages an unusual picture of the earth and to the moon Bob I'd have to say I wouldn't immediately recognized starts oh\nNo you wouldn't I mean basically well looking at is low resolution close up of of the earth the moon taking behind so it's just a bunch of pixels that's slightly oblong because of the moon's presence what's important about this image isn't the image itself but the water they could point that\nThe instrument precisely to look at the earth and it demonstrated to that the instruments wide field camera is working properly and that's really what it was done for instrumental\nOperational test to make sure everything's good and that's what's good about this and so what we're heading toward the sun and it's not going to burn up\nAnd Bob the Parker probe is a new information more gathering up are backing up we have a couple of sun probes up there now so different different this is a\nBig star remember it might be an ordinary style but it's a big\nAnd so we there's a lot of things we just do not know and we've never been this club when it would no previous probe ever went this close to the sun so we're going to be diving into areas we'd never seen you know at the same time it's going to be looking at other data to come from other theories you know it's always the same there's some things you can burn something should learning new\nThe big thing is it's getting close to the side and that's what's important\nSaturn has a ... named ... and sudden and not a rock star suddenly they're stripes on the on I didn't know to look Bob but I clearly from this report you're pointing us to these are mysterious drives why\nYes um what they what scientists have done as they look back at the archival that are of Cassini which is unfortunately no longer around Saturn\nAnd ... and the images took of the ... and they what they tend to fight was 'em long narrow stride scattered across the surface generally tend to a hundred kilometers in line for so that's approximately thirty to three hundred miles long\nThey tend to be very narrow two to three miles\nAnd the brightest in the truck surrounding terrain that parallel to each other and they over like features and straight done not affected by top hog if we think of a road that goes straight along the county line goes up and down and around because it doesn't turn it just doesn't ignores the topography will just the same thing with these the gesture and they also parallel to the equator\nThe ... is that there's some kind of\nThey were laid down from um external dust on materials that came in from off the planet and this is not unusual in the environment of Saturn um you've got the Saturn's rings and a lot of material being transferred between point days ... days\nAnd so that's hardly they think what's going on here but they do not know um there is a great quote from them the quote the material could have implications for the biological potential of the subsurface ocean\nTo be honest I'm not sure how they can act but that's what they said and\nThey wait wait wait do that again biological interpretation\nI yeah I don't know why they say this but you know they're always trying to sell their projects and anytime they can talk about life\nOn it I Know I was thinking that this was crop riding in some fashion you know the way the way the aliens take what oh wheat fields and signal to it\nYeah I don't think that's the case it's more likely if you remember on behind the black if you do a search on behind the black you'll come up with a great images of Saturn some upset and tiny moons near the whole inside the rings and they tend to ... have these gigantic reaches at the equator because they\nThey gather dust from the rings at the equator\nI'm almost ... and saucers well here could be these a parallel to the equator and they lined up with a ... or it could be that this is just dust being picked up from al ... how it has any implications biological but nonetheless they make that point and so let's get the more\nMoney our friend Alan Stern has another great idea this is the man who are devoted more than half of it live two New Horizons which is now in the type of build up to the fly by Pluto what's the latest about what\nThey did him in a few other scientists and engineers did some research to see how could they go back to Pluto and the most effective manner that they had been in this there's a debate you know we want to go to Pluto again at all but at the planet the the whole planet we've only seen half\nBut they also want to get a plug probe out to the type of delta do research there and what they did is they said if they use to a um an eye on type ... system that was used on dawn ... ball the asteroid they could launch a probe to orbit Pluto and then using share on as a flyby technique\nOr leave the orbit at some point and then use the the iron propulsion to travel throughout the type of belts in other words they get to bangs for one block\nAnd propose they said this makes sense and this allows them to get everything in one mission and so this is probably going to be opposed to NASA or others and they're gonna try to make this mission happened and I think that's really really exciting\nJobs there were

columnist and editor for the wall Street Journal editorial board\nIs here to help me understand this phenomenon that sometimes in some magazines in North America is called Trump him or Trump plight the man's name as both a narrow I first recognized him when he was attacked during a rally stabbed in the stomach he's recovered he\nIs in a run off and he is given great possibility of becoming the president of Brazil though I don't know where\nThat takes Brazil because it's been so troubled and is in a deep recession right now with former leading presidents either in jail or in disgrace\nMarry a very good evening to you both to narrow I can understand both in there I can understand if he's none of the above what does he present so what is he going to provide Brazil but it needs good evening to\n... well they've named John um I think the first thing we can say about books that are oh is that he's not a member of the Workers Party I'm not a left wing socialist and I think I'm a lot of these ... explained by the fact that\nYou know he was a he's he's the alternative to the socialist model on and\nYou know why other why other on a Kennedy did not catch on because there were many other candidates and the first round which is a good question but I think um they were to ordinary to run to the mail to mainstream\nSimilar maybe to what got the attention of voters in the United states during that the Trump or the two thousand sixteen campaign on both in our Dario spoke and he's not shy about saying things that are politically incorrect\nUm sometimes he makes very rude comment on but I think that people feel like there's something real about and\nUh and they are just so disgusted and were filed by the socialist Workers Party because not only the collapse of the economy on their watch\nBut also the gross corruption I mean it was unbelievable the way that they just uh the abuse their power to enrich themselves the business elite and um and the party\nAnd you know all the while that people are learning about this there also a hurting economically they had nearly three years of recession then they had\nA very slow growth in this year and next year is not for cats do much better because they're looking for other ideas and both ... not a market liberal he's basically I Would say the and an\nAntidote to um to socialism and we can talk about that a little bit more because I think that it's not entirely clear what his what his solutions are going to be but I think that people just started saying anybody but the socialists and that's how he got where he is\nTaught me over the years that Brazil's a hybrid mixture of socialism at one scale kind of redistribution and back scratching\nAnd also a big data's to economic forces enterprises that are vast and take a and grab capital in don't permit\nEntrepreneur ship or experimentation is both an arrow both so narrow going to answer that these big ... like Petro bras and ... and then the peasants who are\nWell who are bought off with a broad\n[noise] well that's the sixty four million dollar question and then of course you know he hasn't won yet or people I talked to give him between a Seventy and eighty percent chance the prevailing on Sunday [noise] but um\nUh even if he does win all it's not clear his he's been in Congress for twenty seven years his voting record is\nBad for the state you know I mean this is as we talk about right and left and I think sometimes the language gets very confused but you know he's not a free market guy according to his is history that being said\nHe has a University of Chicago PHD economists\nWho is chief advisor and consulted on and he is also made certain commitments for example he says that the central bank must be independent and of course the central bank last independence during the ... government\nAnd that was a big reason why they got into so much trouble and they got back to double digit inflation and so forth so\nHe's made some commitments that I think are very encouraging he's also said that he will privatize and you have to remember\nThat under Lula and Dilma\nThe state was getting back into all kinds of economic activity\nSo both so now he says he's were bullied burst those decisions he'll get rid of those stayed on enterprises that I think there might be somewhere around fifty of those um but he also has stopped short of saying for example that he's going to privatize cut your boss he says he wants to keep in state hands what he called\nStrategic companies and that's of course a disappointment to those of us who believe in the market\nUm but I think a lot of people are just hoping that uh that um you know in terms of the orders of magnitude he'll get closer to market economics\nThen obviously the P. T. is even if he does you know do the full Monty\nSecurity uh I Do I have never traveled to Brazil but I read anecdotes just say that the streets of the large cities can be dangerous because of abduction dangerous for the will to do does ball so narrow speak to that is the is what he says credible\nWell first of all I Would say that most of the danger and we talk about danger I think like with respect to haunt us by most of that of hers in poor neighborhoods and the\nThe major victims of the high a homicide rates are um the poor\nI mean they're the ones who are killed in these bad neighborhoods and that is why I'm despite the fact that he's been accused of being a racist and so forth um and he does have some support not huge um but he has some support or some significant for it I Would say\nFrom um people in those neighborhoods [noise] um\nI'm a little bit skeptical as to whether he can I'm\nActually make a big debt in crime any part of the problem is that this was organized crime and it's funded by ah the drug habits of wealthy Brazilians and wealthy and Europeans and an American\nWho by drugs or you know through the supply chains but eventually these are the people who are supplying them so um\nThose people have a lot to lose their very well armed um I think it might be very difficult for him to dismantle the organized crime groups not like nobody has ever tried before I'm having said that\nWho don't have jobs um who who just have you know almost absolute despair in terms of their future course they want to go to the United states but not by the way the way some native is field because they want to come here and um you know live off the off the welfare state they want jobs and they see the United\nStates is a place where they would have opportunity so you know if you start organizing and you tell people okay we're going to use on the strength and numbers to get into the United\nStates you're going to get a lot of people to join ya I'm having said that\nI think it's really important to understand what is it in an economy that these countries that is making a these young people so desperate and that's why I wrote that column about the silver mining Guatemala because that's silver mine was implying well over a thousand people\nAnd all of a sudden you got these um you know NGOs coming along and saying well you know they're challenging the right of the silver mine to operate because\nSupposedly um they didn't up properly\nConsult with a indigenous groups in the area before they began operating silver mine and you know you dig down and you find out first of all that that the census of the most recent census when the wind was started found that there were to do\nThat too she W O indigenous people in the whole area where the silver mine was operate\nList is the ... ... is that how you say it ... the I guess is\nThe ... and you know I'm not I'm not a you know\nDoubting that the shouldn't have right but on the inside the the property there was not this impact\nOn the ... community that there is that the minus charged with being sort of you know sensitive too and uh once they proved that the court said well okay that may be true and wake knowledge it there were only two there but um\nWe think that ah\nThe government should go back and interview and look into it more and you know they've been dragging their heels on this the mine has been closed for well over a year and I know that to a year and a half\nI think and all these people who were working for the mind and by the way the mine was not accused of any environmental degradation it wasn't inclusive any labor violations it had spent millions of dollars in the area on education and community um enhancements\nFor the people who lived in the area and now all of a sudden the mines shut down all these people don't have\nA job and um and and by the way the mind also the court had the option of saying that the mind could continue to operate\nA while the government went and did these consultations with the indigenous population and the court had done that in other cases but in this case decided not to um I think that there's a lot of questions about\nHow those judges made their decisions um but we guard list of that the bottom line is that here you have the Guatemalan of ...\n'em all in government as institution um you know deliberately shutting down a source of employment and wealth creation for a large number of people in a very poor part of the country and\nThis was in an isolated event this happens over and over again in this country and\nUm I think it's one thing that we need to keep in mind when you see all the people that of course our hearts go out to them with that you know that they need jobs and and they're moving through Mexico now because they're desperate but you know what guineas countries do to make the where they are where these people live on\nYou know more um attractive for them to stay and there's plenty they can do but they have to have the political will to do it as I said this\nIs not a new to this this movement of people through through Central America and Mexico is not accidental these people are marching in lockstep they're organized I'm not saying that the migrants themselves are necessarily political but it's a political movement that is is basically on as a as\nWe said in our editorial earlier this week it's very similar to when she al Castro unleashed all of the migrants from the port of L'Oreal in Nineteen eighty extremely just said destabilizing on and difficult for the country that is out to accept them and\nUm so I think that the Trump Administration is right to be a challenging I'm a ... the organizers of the larger than to be telling these people that they this is not the way that we accepted number\nAnd uh you mentioned Cuba's so for the final minutes here you have a column about Cuba's conduct and you identify it as a\nAs a master of Venezuela what we're seeing in the catastrophe then in Venezuela must be looked at as what Havana ones is this what does this help Cuba to have the people of Havana are the people of Caracas without food and resources\nWell that doesn't care if the people of ... don't absolute resources Atlanta wants to control Venezuela and um if that means that as well as an empty out and there's not going to be any when they're at the very small population of additives care about that and then it has done that to the island itself or sixty\nYears Joe this is a um a matter\nOf geo political strategy on the part of the van and yeah\nI mean I think that uh it's quite obvious that the Venezuelans would not be capable of the kind of in ... intelligence control on control over passports or the electronic voting system the ID cards\nOn the spy on people that has you know it has its chemical everywhere and that's a that's a very Cuban honored with a strategy and tactics\nOn that ... has been using at home church for many many years so I mean the reason I wrote that column is because people keep saying what can we do to help the Venezuelans you know because it's it they're they're they're quite um you know they're they're suffering a lot right now and\nI think that it's just wrong to think that you can solve this problem and crap is this problem that has to be solved the Nevada and this is the problem that was dead aided in a bed it by Brock Obama\nWho basically supported um the dictate the military dictatorship a seat al Castro gay that oxygen gave it food gave it support when it was breaking down\nAnd that gave it to you about the life plan it needed to keep going and to reach out and to expand it was already working on this expansionist a project in bed at swell up but\nThat very much helped I'm the Cuban um military dictatorship continue and\nI'm so somebody has to do and I'm assuming it would be the Trump Administration or the next us administration but at some point you know that the democracy that the region have to get together and and tell her that I like you know my you know and that hasn't happened and and and the ... the result of that\nIs is when you see that as well right now\nMary Anastasia ... indeed she is the America's columnist and editor at the wall Street Journal\nEditorial board I'm John ... this is the John ...\nHey thanks for taking a look

also their combat and their risk\nDescribes the American effort in the great war you will recall that America stayed out of the war and that will Joe Wilson was reelected too proud to fight in Nineteen sixty soon afterwards having to do with the machinations of the empires that were bleeding themselves to death in Europe\nWoodrow Wilson was provoked by the Germans declaring on a on unrestrained submarine warfare against all neutral meaning sinking passenger airliners American ships friendships anything they could kill because the Germans were starving to death\nThe British navy had enforced to blockade these many years and the Germans were eating onions if they could find so it was the decision of the Kaiser knowing this would provoke the Americans to take the risk thinking that the Americans could not get men to Europe fast enough\nIn order to stop what he knew would be the German offensive of Nineteen Eighteen rushes out of the war in Nineteen Seventeen so they move all of their troops that have been fighting a two front war to launch the offensive that the American stop\nIn June and July and August I'm Nineteen Eighteen Patrick's book takes us into the Americans throwing themselves into the line to support and in most cases replaced the broken and fleeing French Army broken and fleeing Patrick it's worth mentioning here\nThat as the Americans um we've talked about the Marines coming in but the army as well the field artillery as Americans come into line in the summer of Nineteen Eighteen they see that the French Army is no longer fighting and will not fight\nIt is it leads to bill award it was not fighting and then it sort of reconstitute itself as was sons and is is is\nMuch more of a stable force 'em but you initially yeah that was in fighting and it was a the American [noise] the the presence of these American troops had an enormous morale boost as well as tactical a position that they provided by blocking this offensive\nI Want to be a little more severe the Americans the Australians and the Canadians are the offensive unit that crack the hindered and bird line in the summer and fall of Nineteen Eighteen it's not it's the fresh Australian troops the fresh\nOut of the French Canadian troops because the British are also exhaustion yes\nAnd the Americans ought not only are launched an offensive but they have a million men coming behind them\nYes I mean this is an extraordinary story that's told it in in the unknowns it's the story of going from two hundred and twenty thousand regular troops at it you know in Nineteen Seventeen to over four million men and arms\nIn Nineteen eighty two million of them in Europe yeah ... story building this incredible army\nThere's a flood coming which is part of the political

deprived of that by the constitution you will recall the one that was signed in the Eighteenth century it had not been at this point corrected\nYes and but interestingly enough the stereotype of the American injury Indian as the ultimate warrior kind of holds up in the American army they're put in some of the most dangerous positions in the American army as runners or as reconnaissance Sanders\nThis as an engineer what is their job he's in he's a combat engineer but he's not there to build things he's there to blow things up or to breach the line and this is the ... the hope of the
