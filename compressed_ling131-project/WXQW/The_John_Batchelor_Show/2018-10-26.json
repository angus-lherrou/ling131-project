regarding that suspicious packages\nThe witnesses lawyers asked a full bench of uh of appeals court to review that decision but a notation in court filings says only nine the courts can act of judges participated bowing out was judge Greg cat that catches the courts only member opponent by president Donald Trump\nCats are served as deputy White House counsel before Trump tapped him for the powerful D.C court of appeals last year\nGoes on a spokesman for Mueller's office Peter car declined to comment on my litigation\nLawyers for Trump said the mystery grand jury subpoena fight moving through the DC circuit had nothing to do with the president no idea said Trump's personal attorney Jay Sekulow one show on the docket for the case [noise]\nAttorneys for Roger sounds said they didn't know of anyone challenging Mahler subpoena beyond Miller Miller's lawyers agreed with Mueller's prosecutors to make many aspects of the dispute public\nNo such agreement appears to have been struck in the other fight although Mueller's team and the mystery witness did file a joint motion earlier this month of asking the appeals court to expedite resolution of the dispute\nOther lawyers who represent witnesses on the mall or investigation also said there were unaware of who's crossing legal storage with the special counsel team and the largely ...\nA court case a few barebones details about the dispute are available in the public record well all records about the litigation and the district quarter sealed the DC circuit stock it shows that the case was brought in the D.C court on August sixteen and how ruled on September at Nineteen the initial appeal was filed five days later\nStay with me on this because we'll try to make sense to this is actually very very fascinating\nThe bottom line is most likely scenario someone filed a motion to quash or otherwise resist the grand jury subpoena\nAnd the judge issued an order denying that and saying the witness leads to testify said Ted Boudreau so I Know hey Gibson Dunn and crushed her attorney who is handled grand jury related litigation for journalists and many organizations\nSinclair what does that case the appeals court has agreed to hear and December involves an assertion of attorney client privilege or some other privilege is framed as a broader attack or most of the party or perhaps advances both sets of arguments very hard to tell from the stock\nAnd well I'll tell you it's not hard to tell at all\nBut certain Miller ... challenged we know from a few months back the constitutionality the appointment of Mahler under the appointments clause of the constitution that same argument I've been making\nAnd professor caliber ISI has made\nI don't know exactly what kind of argument there making obviously I'm not privy to this sort of thing but it's the same person Miller and I assume it's the same lawyers who are making this argument probably challenging the subpoenas by challenging the constitutionality of Mahler and his operation\nIn the first instance\nI suspect I Believe strongly that that's what's taking place again because I have first hand knowledge but because remember what took place a few months ago\n[noise] the grand jury cases pose a threat the mullahs investigation because they couldn't service vehicles to get questions of us has already illegal legitimacy before ... judges relatively quickly and I believe that's what's taking place here such questions have also been raised by defendants and some of his criminal cases but all the human defendants who\nSet foot in a courtroom of ultimately decided to plead guilty and drop any challenges to the special counsel the hardier tactics\n\nMystery cases moving through the courts involving grand jury matters and independent counsel matters or aren't uncommon in Nineteen Ninety seven conflict of interest investigation into America or chief Eli seagulls fundraising activities was conducted under steal from its star\nIn the final report remains at a public view involving another Clinton era pro the labor secretary Alexis Herman and influence peddling accusations\nThis can't this can get a step or two weirder than it already is set an attorney representing a senior Trump staffer in the Russian inquiry Tiller recalled a case from a previous investigation where you couldn't even get to see a judge's opinion because it was under steal All right\n\nI'm fairly confident that this is the case that was originally brought involving Miller by counsel as I said they questioned the appointment of Mahler or the appointments clause and the DC circuit has been packed\nA leftist an Obama appointee so who knows what'll happen there perhaps they're building the foundation also to take it to the United States Supreme court\nAnd despite what you've heard by senior judicial analyst than others this is not the Martian versus Olson case of Thirty years ago and robbing the independent\nCounsel the elements in that court decision appear to have been violated in my opinion and professor calories his opinion respecting Mahler\nAnd this is why these two questions are important to stay with me 'cause you're smart and you'll know you'll be able to follow all this we've talked about it before\nIs Mr Mahler a principal officer of the federal government\n\nFor is an inferior office\nFor purposes of a challenge\nTo the appointments clause of the constitution I have no doubt that he insists that he's in fear officer so reports to get to the attorney general Rosen's thing\nThat he did not have to be nominated by the president and confirmed by the Senate he's nothing more than an inferior office official like some assistant United States attorney or jeopardy to an assistant attorney general now you know that's not true\nHe's got more power than a U.S attorney\nAnd the reason among other reasons that he has more power than a U.S attorneys because his initial\nAppointment was enormously brought it didn't provide any criminal basis for his investigation we've talked about that so this isn't like Mars send versus also now the court may conclude that it is but on the facts that is not\nIt's a legitimate challenge of is that sorry I don't know where it will go but I'm Glad it's being done\nAnd ice more than ... I Believe strongly that that's the ping pong that's going on between the trial court the district court in the appellate court back and forth and that's why the appellate court is uh\nIs going to hear the case and again as I said that court is heavily loaded with a a leftist activists so the the final case will have to be made to the Supreme Court if they'll accept that we'll be right back\n[noise] month\nHim you were listening to six sixty that when you were executed out when you when your news that the information to products to go Home Depot\nI'm more than I thought my suit can still make an impression on video games are still game changes in my lab can bring on there is a bright future because when I donate my stuff too good will help my job placement and train the people in my community now that it's a second can and will get\nSomeone in my community they can and will donate to create jobs will find your nearest donations that are good will not or good will not or this message brought here by goodwill and the ad council\nA hurricane watches issued when there is a credit hurricane conditions within a twenty four thirty six hour period\nDuring a hurricane watch listen to a battery operated radio or television for hurricane progress reports if their right to hurricane warning you may be advised to evacuate the area\nCheck the contents of your emergency supply kit and feel plastic water bottles with one gallon at freshwater per person per day this has been a public service message from FEMA [noise]\n... here for about five year old has found a number to narrow it with loaded I heard on the news about fourteen year old girl who was bullied on line for like a year she couldn't take it anymore so she got her dad on for\nAbout ... broke up with a guy from\nThe links are covering the home she killed\nHerself was\nIf you own a gun you have a full time responsibility\nWe can get into the hands of curious to trouble in terms of the reward anyone else through my misuse or\nYour family friends and neighbors are or how they\nFor more information on for all the stores safety deserves the PC the or\nBusinesses grow up to you by the national crime prevention council bureau of justice assistance to\nListen to what David ask from Illinois has to say about his experience using the ex chair here's what he writes the extra has made such an unbelievable difference in how I sit at my desk and how much time and\nI have throughout the day and I was able to get a lot more work done game is absolutely right I truly love my ex chair and I know you will to trust me why don't you feel how much support the ex chair provides you'll never want to sit in an ugly uncomfortable office chair again and your business owners\nThanks chairs or the perfect investment that take the productivity of your entire team to the next level ex chairs\n...\n\nIf you suffer from E.

as radical left as you can get\nIn the left all over the country is pouring millions and millions of dollars into this including billionaires who the the usual suspects\nRhonda scientists who I've strongly endorse Rhonda Santa's um\nTallahassee is a very corrupt government under this mayor there it's been a a long going FBI investigation as I understand it and even the mayor himself that is the man who wishes to be governor Andrew Gillum he got caught up in this what exactly happened\nOh yeah no absolutely so he is very close relationship with several lobbyists who are lobbying the city government to get basically city money to to build the project they want it to a million dollars and so what these lobbyists did is they arranged a number of excursions one of which was the New York city\nI'm In a long for the ride on that was a undercover FBI agent who are trying to infiltrate it\nHe was posing as a contractor trying to do business with city but this guy got Andrew during that trip one thousand dollar ticket to go see the play Hamilton Rene people hear about bee gamble\nPick a day to day like go to the movie tickets or at least a\nThousand dollars at that time um and so he gave it to Andrew Andrew knew that Anders lied about that but now there's been evidence that shows that but then those same lobbyists also arranged a luxury for night stay\nIn this Costa Rica bill law which ended up costs and about a thousand dollars a for Andrew and his wife uh in addition to some other folks and uh getting injured and pay for that and then what happens after all this mark low involved mayor Andrew Gillum turns around\nAnd he gives those lobbyist two million dollar deal that they were looking for an so\nAndrew is getting things that that he shouldn't have had that did violate Florida ethics laws and in the lobby is God a exactly what they were paying for and so that's really the way the government runs its corrupt\nIt's wrong I'm Andrew has you know he lied to the country on Sunday night when I confronted him about this but then documents came out almost immediately refuted his denial showed he was lying and he's basically tried to blame everyone he can cause he just refuses to take responsibility but the bottom line is\nHe still to this day tries to say he's not under investigation but mark here very smart and the law you understand the stuff\nWhat an FBI agent ever act undercover and give somebody a potential dry like that if they weren't investigating the public official Batman only reason you would do such an act\nOf course nobody knows the peace in the clear now are not nobody knows if this is an ongoing investigation of among other people and him\nOh it's it's it's definitely an ongoing investigation and bad taste\nBitter I'm a painter staying we re ran an ad uh basically uh talking about all this problem\nAnd his attorney wrote a cease and desist letter to the station and then the letter the attorney said\nA public reports have said that Andrew is not the subject\nOf the investigation but as you know mark some of these bugs words you can be a subject of an investigation you can also be a target of the investigation his own campaign attorney\nDid not put in that letter that Andrew is not a target he just said he under is not a subject so that to me is is a is an interesting no mission uh because the bottom line is\nWhy would they be investigating corruption in city hall if it had nothing to do with the mayor you wouldn't have had those FBI agents around him on these trips like they run\nAnd run to send us he immediately tried to racialized suspicious that the reason you were bringing it up for that matter I guess a local media is bringing up is because of his race\nNow last time I checked it has nothing to do is somebody's race when there's an undercover agent\nGiving somebody a value to try and see if they'll take it any took it has nothing to do with race and I notice he tried to do this over and over and over again in this campaign let me ask you a question your running mate who is your running mate\nOh her name is Jeanette noon yeah she's a state representative from Miami\n\nYou are listening to Shaun bachelor show exclusively on six sixty you know when you were executed out with you\nI'm John ... is here and we welcome professor ought to link Emanuel helps us understand a combination of\nMajor stories that don't work the first or second or third time you hit it you come to them but they do in fact threaten the United states this is Latin America and Hezbollah that's right you've learned correctly Hezbollah is a terrorist organization that dominates\nThe middle east dominates Lebanon dominates all of the characters that touches bug where does it get its money how does it function doesn't Rob banks well in a way\nA professor a very good evening to you has the law and Latin America how do they go together where is the relationship good evening to\nYou and thanks for having me\nHas ... has been a a active in Latin America for nearly four decades ever since its inception and has a ... a chore than a she a Lebanese expatriate communities that exist in Latin America and indeed\nIn other places in the world like West Africa like the far east\nUm and the institutions that serve these communities are loyal to the cause\nA and by by making sure that these communities remain committed to supporting Hezbollah they'd then leverage to communities to engage\nA the very least and fundraising and often times and that's especially the case for that to the America engage in that type of elicit financial activities that raise\nFunds for the organization now in Latin America when the most profitable economic activity uh fortunately today is trafficking and cocaine\nThe margins of profits are huge\nAnd the cartels which are you know expanding their reach everywhere across the globe a as society is so far and wide increasing the consumer vast quantities of cocaine cartels names\nAre allies of the global level that can help them trying to support the merchandise to distant markets show it\nAnd then ... the money in a way that it looks legitimate and that's where Hezbollah comes in\nAs well or has been helping the cartels transfer and distribute their cocaine globally striking deals with organized crime all over the globe and it has also used to snap or cough communities in order to um\nFor the money to the cartels Federal Trade based money laundering schemes that of course in the process has bought gets a hefty commission as payment for its services or all this money goes to fund its activities in the middle east\nAnd um you know conservative assessments suggest\nThat all of the roughly one billion dollar a year budget that has has at the very least\nThirty hundred million is that is thirty percent of its budget does not come from Iran him contribution as it comes from these type of illicit activities so it's extremely significant and that means that Hezbollah is an\nAlly and uh you know a a very significant contribution\nTo the disaster a of organized crime that he was wrecking societies eating societies from within in Latin America corrupting their systems are and in the process also pushing out immigrants uh and and crime uh all the way up to our border\nBut the it seems to me to be a a conflict in in the way we respond to do so and so we summarized we how we got to where we are today in the in especially significant I think today the president signed this was a law\nInternational finance prevention act that was passed by Congress or I think last week the final authorization that allows the executive to go after\nBoth his militia members Andy ... their financial facilitators yet at the same time and I'd like to comment on that but at the same time project Cassandra which appeared to be a success was launched ten years ago\nTo to a counter as well as both outside in the middle east and yet despite the science of success that it will shuttered and the and the whole team dispersed how how do you account for this appearing instead of a disc apparent contradiction\n[laughter] well the thing is that ah you know be the uh the the the the successful and for a project Cassandra uh was in the shots or a um but that was under the previous administration and he was\nPart and parcel of a political vision that suggested that uh the United states need to seek a town with Iran\nOr across the board or that included the going after has blind luck in America and other places or festival I was involved in criminal activities\nIt incidentally involved\nI'm standing down and getting a you know not not standing up for values and interests of the United states in Syria\nAnd other things and and that

I'm\nVery much welcome Ted Frank the director of litigation at the Competitive Enterprise\nInstitute who is about to make a case standing before the Supreme Court about an issue that you've all heard of class action suit what you didn't know and I learned from Ted now\nIs that class action suit benefit the law firms bringing them but in the case of very large class action suit such as a recent one against Google\nThe actually offended parties get almost nothing if nothing at all\nThis is a twenty first century version of ambulance chasing to my to my amateur eyes did a very good evening to you or this is a revelation to me that law firms are in the business\nOf chasing class action suits not to share it with the offended or harmed or litigants but in fact cut it up for themselves or directed in some fashion\nUh two powers of their wishes which is nice Seventeen struck nine sixty one Frank versus cows you're the Frank\nYou're arguing on Halloween\nTo do with a federal rule of civil procedure about class action suits wear ... according to the quote that you provided to me where so doing is quote superior to other available methods for fairly unofficially adjudicating the controversy the\nQuestion before the court is whether or and what circumstances\nA sigh press that trust law doctrine award of class action proceeds to provide no direct relief to class members supports class certification and comports with a requirement that a settlement binding class members must be fair and reasonable an adequate my amateur translation is\nThey're going to decide whether it's okay for the law firms to get everything and the litigants or offended part is you get nothing what is your presentation to the court get good evening to\nThank you thank you for having me the conditions\nIn the court is a before a court can approve the settlement under the rules of civil procedure it how to make a finding that it's charitable inadequate\nAnd it's not share and reasonable by definition that the attorneys are getting all the money in the class is getting nothing and trying to hide that the classes getting nothing by steering money to third parties in this case the attorneys all the monitors that it's an alumni donation using the classes money basically\nA doesn't make an unfair settlement fair the\nCase if I follow correctly and that is my guide here I'm just reading is Google and Google offending a the the class action team because it took advantage of privacy restrictions and didn't adequately follow or provide information\nTo those used again now we all use Google so we're all in on this and the estimate of the New York times article right above that says we're all due for sense that's not going to happen because it's inefficient so therefore the eight point five million dollars or portions up\nEntirely to the law firm is that right\nIt it goes to law firm and then a basically a slush fund of of organizations that the law firms and Google wanted the money to go to\nA and you know these are suit\nAlleging violations of federal law and if the crew the violation of a class member would be entitled to a thousand dollars so that clearly didn't things they could actually prove this because they settle it tore as you note four cents a class member\nNow we're not asking for the force sense but you have this eight million dollar pot of money and you can\nFind a way to distribute it to class members the reality is\nThese notices in the mail and and you could make a pot of money available to people who filed claims to get the notices and say yes I Want my share of that eight million dollars and the reality are so few people ask for the money you could distribute five or six dollars per climate\nRight I mean I've had these notifications over the years because of the end of certain companies that I purchased or the companies went on a business because they sold out and they sent me this document saying you're part of a class action suit and I say I don't want anything to do with it so I run away from it\nAnd and that's what most people do a so it's possible to get money to the class if they actually want to do that right ah they just didn't want to do that because they'd rather see the money go to their on them\nAnd the four and the courts in this case this is the Ninth Circuit court that's a pretty big court at that out west they dominate the west the Ninth Circuit court isn't going to apply the law firms that issue and you\nGive me their names one's in San Francisco not theory and John or young and the other is in Colorado camera law those law firms are not required\nBy the federal government to make good to all the injured parties couldn't they do that isn't that imaginable\nIt it is and that's what other circuits have done we won cases in the seventh circuit in the ... circuit and the third circuit where the court said look the the attorneys have if I Do share a duty to their clients to get the money to the clients first if you set the legal rules like the Ninth Circuit did that the attorneys get paid no matter what\nWell of course the attorneys are going to cook for her to give it to a charity that it said it wants because then the defendant will say okay we can get two million dollars a class or for a million dollars to our favorite charity and the attorneys are going to say well give the four million you you don't get the money to class give it to your favorite charity and then we can get a larger attorney\nNow that says Google right Google and we're all have Google Google can easily communicate with all of us what do you want to do with your four cents John and that could give me boxes to check off you know the red cross or the ASPCA\nOr protecting of a wild habitat they could do that and the law firm could direct Google to do that that's not that's not a painful remedy do you agree cat\nWell I mean there there's a reason they don't do that and that's because if they told the class members hey you can make a claim for a five dollar check or you can check this box and you can give it to my alma mater a ... everybody's going to demand there are five dollars right they're not or they're not going to make a claim at all\nUm they're not going to say I want the money to go to my lawyers favorite charity if if I\nWant five dollars and then the charity or I can write a five dollar check to charity or or bigger ... hum it but it it's that the lawyers are are are trying to not give consumers that choice so they don't want to because the consumers would want the money it's\nJust a well known problem cat has this been going on for a long time and sort of a deal between lawyers in courts and we're all ignorant of it\nUh I mean it's been an increase in the big problem uh and it's going to get even bigger if the Supreme Court doesn't act or this year another nine million dollars and it was a small class it was only a billion people it would have been and they had everybody's address what you would have been really easy to just mail everybody a check\nWithout even asking them to check a box\nIt just because we have too many lawyers and not enough work is is because of the lawyers in India who are doing jobs on line is there is some crisis and I didn't know about ten we've got about a minute\nAh I it's just we have the rules in place and judges aren't enforcing those rules because the the the attorneys have the incentive to to maximize their own attorney says\nIf you're in a class action suit you can do something you know ask you for your for censor your five dollars at a law firm as and say what the heck you didn't try to reach me you didn't try to give me any money\nAt ten Frank is already going this do for the Supreme Court on
