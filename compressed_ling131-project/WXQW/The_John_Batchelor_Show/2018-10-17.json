are stupid keepers they do secret deans [noise] they're not interested except when they need some good publicity\nPublicity and yet suddenly we have major political scandals are the\nKinds of that could very well result in a transformation a bilateral relations between the United states and the countries involved and in the ... same that they are there's no doubt about it intelligence services consider all night here in the United states what we call Russia gate\nWhich is based essentially on intelligence agencies allegations about what the Kremlin dead to cry\nSuccessfully are unsuccessfully to compromise President Trump then we have you mentioned it in the United kingdom the attempt it appears to kill a former he was actually a British age and they turned agent\nHe had been swap living in England but an attempt they say by\nRussian intelligence agencies to kill Mr screwball who had been living quietly and Salisbury England and his daughter and then we have now most recently the screws some of them in Turkey in the consulate of Saudi Arabia\nWhere say journalists Saudi journalist who was resigning with a green card in the United states and actually a Washington Post\nColumnist who apparently was killed in each of these cases leaning actors are said to be intelligence agencies so you would agree with that premise so far\nI certainly do agree with it and I'm On a on a layer it a little bit save these intelligence agencies have their own ideas about how to oppose there or the other country and they always have and in fact in reading about how the Soviets thought of America\nAnd how Great Britain thought of the Soviets it's exactly the same the Soviet flooded market Margaret Thatcher to lose in Nineteen eighty three\nThey were and they worked very diligently to undermine your eye to\nEye you don't need cyber warfare to see how the first chief directorate\nSenate illegals and to influence and betray that the federal government and in fact they supported labor Michael Foot was a longtime\nConfidant of KGB other agents so Steve it's a it's not it's a revelation to me that in the detail because we now have the filter of Russia gate but I don't see any update whatsoever save the it's like both both sides have these temp plates of how to disrupt the other government\nBut this takes me to another concept that is always put out there when we try to figure out what actually happened\nEvidently Russian intelligence agencies were involved in this for Paul fair but the question is did prove knew about it or was it and the word is used a rogue operation\nSo what I Want to do just suggested we need [noise] excuse me John its end of allergy season\n[noise] um we need to rehabilitate the word roe ...\n... it's true and history teaches us this recent history to bet it is quote a rogue operation it could just be a commercial criminal\nActs because these guys have all sorts of freelance operations\nThey were for the official intelligence agency but they freelance at least Russian intelligence agencies have they were or dark money people they get involved in all sorts of criminal activities and occasionally somebody wants to ...\nWhich has nothing to do with politics but I Want to go to the other possibility that these rogue operations are actually political values to say it's possible because they have it as an industry town you suggested this before that they are run by opponents of the leader\nA route to Moscow\nRight out of Saudi Arabia to disrupt a foreign policy but the opponents do right now we have a history of this and the Soviet Union for example\nGoing back actually Nineteen twenty four but the one that keeps coming to my mind I Can't place today but it was the early sixties when there were no diplomatic relations\nBetween the Soviet Union in West Germany and ... the Soviet leader decided he was going to restore formal diplomatic relations with East Germany\nAnd in the run up to that of course jobs enemies ran a number of operations to disrupt it to sabotage it including a gas attack on the west German ambassador and it almost destroyed Khrushchev off a plan with Chris Chalk per pulled ahead we also out\nFairly well documented that when Eisenhower in ... began their d'etat after ... death a and they had a spring meeting planned in Paris\nOr will it must have been Nineteen sixty I say that someone set the youth to spy plane over Russia it was shot down that disrupted ... did not meet again that was the end of that date taught\nAnd record seems to show it was set by the CIA and the plane belong to the CIA [noise] that forces in the CIA perhaps the director\nDollars himself was opposed to d'etat was Russia joke we come back to this idea that what we casually referred to\nAs rogue operations could be political operation involving the highest level policy what are the opponents usually intelligence agencies or the intelligence agencies themselves are opposed so we do not know\nOr we may find out we can analyze but we can't be sure whether in the case of the attack on St Paul and the United kingdom\nAnd on the case of the killing evident killing the Saudi a journalist and um turkey whether the leaders of the country\nCorrect ... and I'm ... bin ... knew about this or these were operations against these two leaders remember that at the moment of the crime\n[noise]

great fun tonight reflecting\nOn the old Cold War and the new Cold War spy versus spy\nThe KGB now FSB the CIA now CIA and my five is the equivalent of the FBI in Great Britain now my sixties equivalent of the CIA\nThese agencies tangled with each other all during the Cold War they continue to tangle with each other they have their own political agendas they have lots of political analysis analysts within the company they're not just all agents of acting illegals another country and doing dangerous missions very few of that\nVery few actually are occupied in that\nBut they do have political ambitions and one is to make sure that there are at odds with the other side that increases their budgets that gives them great power\nAnd as we saw in the case of the Soviet Union one of the heads of the KGB moved to be the premier of the Soviet Union as we saw in the United states\nA leader of the CIA moved to become president of United States and the son of a president of the United states from the outside\nBoth intelligence services have been politically astute for many decades are they now acting with similar ambitions and see if it's a question we can answer today Thirty years from now they'll be\nThey'll they'll have access to material we do and they'll still be in a fog that's the nature of intelligence services they not only do disinformation they provide glimpses that

... how he served Margaret Thatcher\nAnd how he served Ronald Reagan and how we serve Great Britain the queen decorated him but he look from the Russian point of view to be an arch traitor\nAnd part of the apparatus that destroyed the Soviet Union it would appear that that was an accident that he didn't mean to destroy the Soviet Union what he meant was to encourage democracy as he said at the time in his in his in his country\nOr do we have actors today in our agencies that my five and my six CIA FBI\nWho believe that they're encouraging her strengthening democracy by undermining if you see my analogies to\nI Do but I disagree with you on one point but maybe it's not a disagreement maybe you didn't mean to included I didn't hear the case of the Russia gate allegations against Trump which are also allegations against ... that is proof pride and long ago to recruit Trump or compromising and he's been success\nAnd still happening on him and and run and run to\nThe right it's sad it's sad that is clearly a political agenda or no question about it\nA Obama's intel cheeks particularly John Brennan editors CIA\nPursued this agenda the record is clear Brennan's made no bones about it\nThat he was a kinda godfather of the Russia gate allegations very early on and he still pumps out today because he has a perch on some network and he gets in the New York times on the op ed page when he wants to but it appears to be also the line of the people Trump\nAppointed to these agencies therefore it say corporate position we can't say oh it was just Brennan no it was the high level of the CIA and it seems clear to me that from the beginning\nWhen Trump first out are these words early in two thousand and sixteen cooperate with Russia they did not want this new policy and they continue not to not want this new policy\nAnd therefore in the case of these intelligence operations that involve Russia I think we can say that they are intensely\nPolitical and we can analyze them as part of the political story so it raises the question we\nRaised it before because there have been episodes I remember in July how long are we forget there's so much News John but we spoke in July or when after Trump bought the Helsinki to meet with ... and in the first formal summit and\nWhen Trump got home he was literally accused\nBy the New York times in the Washington Post and by John Brennan himself\nWho is now retired of treason\nFor doing what I was simply having having had a joint\nPress conference with who is it never happened to an American president every president since Roosevelt had met with the Soviet or the Russian leader Trump is calling treasonous we're doing this so it raises a question of who's making Russia policy in Washington is a Trump\nOr is it forces with the backing\nOf the intelligence agency so we come now I Do in my head and I'm not a conspiracy theorist but if we agree that intelligence agencies and the major players in high level politics particularly foreign\nTrade is that history is adamant on this evil leader for the first Gulf War and we agree on the show\nAs historians we accept that as a historical facts they have been very very active uh and not in a round of intelligence gathering in the ... cents but in the political sense so we have to ask ourselves\nThe headline you gave at the top of our talk tonight these American Ukrainian and to a certain extent NATO and joint\nWarplane after ... exercise\nClear sky Eighteen yeah\nSo it was not plan to obviously than a Ukrainian pilot and an American pilot would die\nIt's going to tarnish the exercise but this is a provocation\nFor the United states to be running a joint air war game on Russia's borders over Ukraine of all places\nOf Ukraine the source most uh an indigenous conflict that we have with Russia you have to ask what's Trump told about this\nDid they go to Trump and say we're going to do this exercise is really going to vary ate the Russians are but we're going to do this because you crave age to practice it's doesn't planes that we gave them did Trump authorize it didn't even know about it I mean I think we've gotten to that point\nWhere we can ask the question now people will say that conspiracy thinking but I revert to history we know\nPretty well that the CIA aborted Eisenhower's summit meeting with cooks Jonathan Nineteen sixty with a YouTube flight so there's precedent for\nThis and how we know and drop off as ... as premier of the Soviet Union took the U.S and the Soviet Union to the brink of launching missiles saved that's where

dreams\nWho they believed they were as opposed to the facts\nAll Eighteen sixty six was fostered Hungary's last war before Nineteen fourteen and it was it was more than he had called Australia was the Austrian Empire and an Eighteen sixty six [noise]\nThe auction empire fought a war with Russia and with Italy was called the Oscar oppression war and it was for control of the states have Germany and the states have Italy and Austria Austria was trying to defend its role in Italy a controlled ... show the port of Venice in the hinterland up to Verona\nAnd then it controlled the German confederation which was this league of thirty nine states created the Congress of Vienna and Eighteen Fifteen\nAnd it was controlled by a diet of princes so the king of sex any of the king of Prussia the king above area the Austrian temper but the Austrian number was president of this German Confederation suited Austria perfectly uh gave the appearance of great history in power but to push him\nUnder came home the first one so him\nAnd his brilliant a prime minister auto fun Bismarck really shaped to this arrangement and so they push throughout the early Eighteen sixties for a war with Austria so to dissolve the German confederation to reform Germany under pressure rule which would eventually happened and then these two wars of Eighteen sixty six and then the Franco ... war of Eighteen Seventy\nSimilarly in the south the ... the Italians were being organized by the kingdom of ... who was trying to unify the entire peninsula that unified most of it in Eighteen sixty one\nUnder the under the leadership of the house of civil way the the ... dynasty and all that remain to them was a new show this Austrian held province in northeastern Italy\nAnd the papal state the city of Rome and the surrounding area a lot to do but also the papal marches and and parts that are hadn't yet been annexed by the kingdom of Italy so Austria last that war so really the ... you could say that Eighteen sixty six was really the death knell because\nThey lost their ... role in Germany they lost their ... role in Italy they were forced back onto their own territory the the the Austrian Empire\nBecause of all the internal Russians that went on during this last war of Eighteen sixty six\nThe emperor felt compelled to make an arrangement with the Hungarians where he divided the monarchy into two has the Oscar and a half a Hungarian half called Austria Hungary granted the Hungarians of parliament in eastern Austria and and then there was a German Parliament in western Austria\nAnd so really the ... the country was\nThe the the idea the emperor's idea was that he was retrenching that he was shoring the umpire for the long haul after the defeat of Eighteen sixty six but what America's asked if he really talks about in the first third of the book\nIs how this ... this pretty compromise of Eighteen sixty seven with the Hungarians\nRather than strengthening and retrenching you'd actually desperately weaken the monarchy because it creates exacerbated the nationality problems that had already been quite sharp before a theme sixty six but they became much sharper\nAfter eating sixty six because of this compromise with a Hungarian basically eastern Austria the part that was taken over by the Hungarians as part of his great compromise of Eighteen fifty seven [noise]\nWas was Hungarians were actually in minority\nBut the majority in eastern in eastern Austria this area called translate the any of the ... area east ... the river where slobs and Romanians\nAnd the Hungarians were you know about a little less than fifty percent over there and the and and the majority were slobs and Romanians and so the Hungarians ruled eastern Austria\nWith an iron hand they insisted on Hungarian in schools and churches public office administration\nAre they in franchised only seven percent of the population you had to be a wealthy educated modular Hungarian in order to be elected to parliament or\nEven to vote for deputies to parliament so you had millions of slow vox Ukrainians Romanians really chafing under this very hard Hungarian regime in the eastern half and the western half\nWas a there was more concern for cultural and language rights but you still had a German master nationality and most of western Austrian in the far flung outpost of Austria Galicia worry World War one we were printed levy fog this also belong to the Austrian half\nSo the nationality problems rather than being\nLaid by the arrangements made after the feeding and says you actually get worse as you march through the Eighteenth seventies eighties nineties and into the twentieth century [noise]\nAnd so really are in the book talks a lot about this in terms of the pre history that the monarchy was really coming on ... there were nationalist demands from every quarter from the checks from the slow vox from the slogans\nCroats Serbs Hungarians Romanians they all wanted to have\nMore say in parliament they say a Ukrainian speaking university Ukrainian speaking schools more Ukrainian deputies in parliament are checked deputies or polish deputies you name it\nAnd the emperor was you know constantly trying to juggle all these things making little concessions here and there but having a really hard time keeping together the only thing that might have served as a hardcore was the Castro Hungarian Army and yet the book shows quite convincingly\nThat this was a lost cause too because the Hungarians very deliberately\nWhittled down the army in the years after Eighteen sixty seven make it made it increasingly small weak underfunded under gunned\nSo that by the time I needed to Nineteen fourteen it's an army the size of the Serbian Army ... ludicrously old fashioned artillery bronze guns often without crews shields very low caliber short range hardly any heavy artillery at all\nNot nearly enough machine guns fewer machine guns per regimen battalion than the Russians even who are also very backward\nAnd you know at a in a dismal level of training\nAnd the other thing the Hungarians do in order to keep the Oscar Hungarian Army small because they they don't want to pay for the they view it as possibly a conquering force if the Archduke ever takes over he makes no secret that he wants to re conquer hungry dissolve Austria Hungary and reestablish the Austrian Empire\nOr you know the Hungarians are are taking so much money out of the army when they get to Nineteen\nFourteen it's it's it's it's all but an impotent force and uh so that the decision to go to war in Nineteen fourteen is all the more baffling and it's something that the book explores quite closely\nTo the detail here the Hungarians are dominated the
