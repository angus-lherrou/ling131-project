because they're themselves who usually deported or the people\nAnd that means your version of the economy and and your version of national security and how you deal with allies and trade and all that so I think\nGet a credit candidates are still doing what they need to be doing but for a while they were were held hostage to what the national party was doing I still think that the arranged for Democrats is you know are around twenty five to thirty siege but there is now much\nThere there is now less of a chance that they will get there and so I see more of a chance of a public ... hanging on with a very narrow majority then before capital\nAnd forty seven percent for President Trump is that a surprise to the Democrat\nI look I think we've seen these things go back and forth I I think that probably privately there there might be a little bit surprised on a little bit surprised but not necessarily because you know for about three weeks there you have the Democrats making us\nThe ethical and themselves almost the way they accuse Trump of making expect with themselves and their right he often makes a speck of himself Trump for several weeks had little to say on Twitter only last\nWeek that he's sort of getting back to being himself which was the biggest breaker Democrats have caught in a while so it'll be interesting to see where Trump's approvals are falling a later this week and next week um but ... that's why they get themselves no favor because all of a sudden they became\nWhich they said they were running to stop\nSaturday as a general and one of the messaging messages as the Democrats are running on collectively I think is about health care especially preexisting conditions have did you have to choose peas crop of candidates come up with any counter messaging on that it presents\nJohn milk out David go go first go ahead\nSorry about that look I Will just say this is really interesting to me because we saw Democrats lose a thousand feet um basically over to mid term elections because in part because of the unpopularity of Obamacare and all of a sudden with President Obama out of office\nAnd Republicans in a position to actually do something about healthcare they're now on the defensive and Democrats have done a really good job of putting them on the defensive on these two tenets of Obamacare which are pretty good condition the lifetime cash\nAnd some Republicans that I interviewed on the trail of really straight about it close federal mandates to protect preexisting conditions lifetime tasks they do this through other means but they don't want the government\nTo protect it and other is just kind of harm all over their word and finally got around telling me well yeah I I Believe in these two parts of Obamacare\nSo I take it you ... your hand of the Democrats here and that they got the better part of this issue\nJohn I was at a meeting today we're Nancy Pelosi was speaking and she said this election is about health care\nAnd they ... strongest suit\nFill the last thing they want it to be about the economy which is doing well\nIt was the last thing they want it to be is about a national security and the last thing they want it to be is about the tax cuts although they still make arguments about it benefiting the rich the Democrats are running a micro decentralized campaign around the country largely successful in many districts but\nIn the districts where the Republicans are most in trouble I see Republican after Republican incumbent doing what David says but just roll over and agree with a Democrat so while the Democrats have a good issue where they need to gain seats the Republicans are agreeing\nWith what we have a GDP number estimates for the third quarter coming next week David I start with you that promises to be in the neighborhood and I'm quoting stay more here and then ... which is the Laffer curve\nStay more in the neighborhood of ... percent is that already built in to the argument or is that going to boost things to have it\nI think it's built into the argument in fact I think it's really a better arguments for President Trump twenty twenty than it is for Republicans and twenty Eighteen and look why All right so that the economy like this Republican should be in a much better position and the only reason they're looking slightly better than they wore and it's only slightly\nBecause the Democrats formal the ball with Brett Kavanaugh I think that that the problem for Republicans with the tax overhaul is that you look at the polling all on it and on balance people disapprove of it it may not make any sense but they did a horrible job selling it\nAnd you have some key districts where the elimination of the state and local tax deduction salt\nIs still a problem and so I just think\nThat it is good is this you know might have been for the economy and and then I'm not arguing that ... motors have not connected the dots I said that if the kind of die but that they can connect in a twenty twenty reelection for Trump but it's not happening in this election\nJohn GDP\n[noise] I I think that's sort of amorphous number that people don't really follow what the follow is it's my job secure am I worried about losing it and that's my take home pay going up in the last year\nUm there's a mixed bag out there because we've of stagnant wages for over a decade but I think in some key districts especially where I'm you know the companies are hiring again and and the wage and they're increasing wages because of tight labor market conditions\nIn

McCotter my colleague can cause W. J. R. and we welcome alcohol line\nConference presidents major American Jewish organizations there was an overwhelming amount of news from\nThe middle east we began with a report that Jordan plans to revoke parts of the peace treaty with Israel Malcolm I don't know how to interpret this what is driving at us spoken most warmly of King Abdullah the second these many years more than a decade now what is this\nThis is very disturbing and the good evening to go to view it is a it's a story still in the making and it caught or people in Israel I think in Jordan as well as in the United states by surprise\nIn Nineteen Ninety five when they signed the peace treaty between Jordan and to Israel and I was privileged to go there with President Clinton at the time to the Arab out to the desert to to witness the signing was very emotional very celebratory\nHim one of the causes in this ... dealt with two pieces of property one in the north called Ira or and Hebrew in Ryan\nAnd one is in the south that a hundred and thirty kilometers north of um [noise] a lot near\nA ... a that was called so far in Hebrew a hammer in in Jordan or this was these were Lance uh they have somewhat of a different status or the aid from the other one the one in the south was um a rather in the north\nWas an area that had a that ... had a hydroelectric plant built in the Nineteen twenties by Jewish farmer Jewish businessman who bought much of the land\nAnd Whitney agreement was signed um and Israel and Jordan and the spirit of friendship agreed that farmers from Israel could continue to\nPlow the land and produced on it but the sovereignty would return to Jordan and in the middle of it is this island the peace where the hydroelectric plant than a which had been dedicated by the king\nAnd there's also a memorial nearby to seven young girls from an Israeli school who were mowed down by Jordanian soldier than six more were wounded and if you remember the lake king was saying paid a visit to the families\nAnd a very moving a and a sign of humility asking them for forgiveness\nThat second place in the southern place so far a ... is is a bit larger\nAnd there again the farmers who are dependent upon this for their income they're about fifty farming families are would lose I don't know two hundred and fifty acres or so uh but it will be very important to them and the dream it that was signed said that it was to last for twenty five years\nBut one year before and that one year anniversary is this week either side could get noticed that they want to re examine or talk about exiting the agreement\nJordan exercise that and notified Israel it seems only with the public announcement made in Jordan\nOr that day and did not intend to renew the agreement when it ends or a year from now ah and the agreement says that either side making that announcement would engage in negotiations in Jordan is saying now they won't engage in any kind of negotiations it's not clear whether\nKing of the other was upset because she was left out of the ... the Jerusalem negotiations that other recent events and may have prompted it but most of all that\nAnd mystic demand and this is being celebrated in Jordan and he had received a a petition on many issues but the only one affecting Israel related to this agreement asking that it not be renewed\nSo I guess we'll learn more but the uh you know this is a very valuable to the terms of the Israeli farmers and family said it's been very peaceful they've cooperated a manager Danny is work there and I think it's a very regretful that has moved in this direction\nWhat next Malcolm Macleod and how does this parent breach become a healed [noise]\nThat's a very good question and I don't have a good answer because if the if you're a dancer simply saying we're not going to negotiate [noise]\nUm it could be grandstanding could be you know a a chance for the king to show its constituency that as being tough and then during the course of the year they work out some sort of an understanding\nA right now I don't know what the shape of that could be there are a lot of possibilities because there's heavy investment by the Israeli farmers there there's a lot of money that they put into this over the last Twenty years and the importance the symbolic importance as well as the economic importance\nAre not going to sit well with the Israeli people it's certainly not going to help the atmosphere and as you know Israel is very critical to the security of Jordan and Jordan's security is critical to Israel they've said so many times and they have exercise that\nIn many more ways than than is made public so the stakes are high but I think that the two sides can find some sort of a compromise that would enable the the agreement to somehow stay in force and maybe Jordan has some face saving additional rural or sovereignty the expression\nAs we approach the November for severe sanctions on Iran puzzle we mentioned that is now confirmed by intelligence sources there and here that Iran is upgrading the rockets with has the law\nAre we looking at a cataclysm hear Malcolm Jordan has his ally everything on November fourth\n[noise] this

altogether new rockets being shipped into these are the GPS components\nTo rockets that were generally unguarded so when the cars would fire them they have no idea where they would land or across the border in the border and this would of course give them a much greater capacity\nAnd rainy and factories inside Lebanon where these things are being fixed to the to the rockets\nAnd the the flights

oath\nTo members of Congress in the next days and what he will say is significant because he's in charge of Russia gate he's the boss mother's not even really a real attorney he works for a Miller [noise]\nAh oh he works for rose attain Miller only does what roses even wanting to do and so in talking to rather than saying we're actually talking to the thing itself\n... very good evenings you I Want to concentrate on this because we've been dealing with Rod Rosenstein is if he was a wallflower or just without a backbone or a man who can't find your shoes in fact he's the boss and having gone through the facts of may twenty Seventeen\nWhen in a matter of nine or ten days he changed his life by panicking\nAnd spinning around in a room I figure he was like being a ... a victim of extra system since ... may have twenty Seventeen he's become more and more the story so let's begin with the Rosen steam power Rod Rosenstein\nDirect smaller Mohler is going to a report to Rod Rosenstein maybe we don't have to see any of this may be only the indictments wherever whatever we'll see I learn from you but you noted in your conversation with rich Lowry on your excellent pod cast I recommend everybody at National Review online\nThat there was a Bloomberg report last week that ... getting to wrap it up does that mean Rosen scene can direct Muller finished is get it done report to me what does it mean wrap it up good evening to Andy\nGood evening John well it's always been true that Rosenstein could exercise authority over\nMahler because he uh in the pecking order he is not only the the official who named Mueller as special counsel the is the is the deputy attorney general he's also the official in the chain of command that Mahler answers to the reason we thought of him\nJohn as a wallflower\nIsraeli more out of Mr Rosenstein his own mouth than anything else as soon as he appointed Mueller but that very day he had a meeting with top Democrats on Capitol Hill and what she promised them\nThat there would be no interference in bowlers investigation that he would be permitted a basically to do whatever he shows in terms of uh you know chasing facts down to wherever they lead and he was given this wide mandate to investigate without the\nCredit of a a a normal criminal investigation so he has given mall or a very wide berth or the latest reports indicate that uh he being under pressure I Believe from uh the White House that is the Rosenstein being under pressure from the White House\nOr because of a number of things not least of the fact the revelations that Rosenstein ... a ... at one point\nUm talked about invoking the twenty Fifth Amendment against President Trump talked about secretly recording President Trump in the White House clearly as a a a ... as kind of a a ballast\nFor twenty Fifth Amendment claim that the that the president might not be a mentally up to the job or is that obviously is a not looked upon which great fondness by the White House\nThey have blamed on Rosenstein is starting to get this over with and Rosenstein the reporting it Blumberg indicates a has intern leaned on smaller meanwhile it has looked like Mahler\nHas been has been at least ostensibly doing things that would be consistent with winding down an investigation ... such as staffing down\nOr transferring some of the investigations the indictments that he's brought to other components of the Justice Department so it looks like we could be wanting to an end but I'm not holding my breath quite yet\nThat is one of the possibility is that I may have for further shall we say X or race or by the special counsel\n[noise] well I think\nA daddy is that while Moore has stepped down as I have often pointed out uh I did a big terrorism case in the Nineteen nineties with a grand total of three lawyers me and a two other guys Mahler still even with the down staffing a has\nA I think fourteen Thirteen or fourteen lawyers on staff which is a very large staff and they were obviously continuing to work different investigative the angles they are still negotiating as we understand it over the terms of a\nPresident Trump's sit down interview by the special counsel including whether that interview Wil happen at all and if it doesn't happen whether\nA mall or would take the step of issuing a subpoena which would be a very controversial and would lead to a lot of\nLitigation we hear that there were also pursuing a some other angles involving potentially contacts between a wiki lakes and Roger Stone who was a ... a friend\nAnd associate of the presidents but not somebody who formerly had a role in the president's campaign so there are still odds and ends there that are literally being looked at\nYou told rich Lowry that Mueller has not Bob Woodward thank heaven however what I take from that remark and say we're not going to get a narrative that satisfies a TV what we're going to get is either\nNo indictment or indictments we've had some indictments of Russians cheaply and also Manafort for actions that took place before the campaign you believe in significant however\nThat the sentencing for Michael Flynn has to come on December Eighteen to explain why that tells us that Mueller is going to be disappointing\nYeah let's let's I guess we should sort out two separate things John I think that with respect to General Flynn when he pled guilty it was with the understanding that he was going to cooperate with\nThe investigation and so far as we know he has made himself available for interviews questioning and all like um [noise]\nGenerally speaking prosecutors when they have an ability to influence when a sentencing is scheduled do not allow cooperate or to be sentenced by the court\nUntil after their cooperation is concluded which usually means any testimony that they're going to give are expected to given the investigation\nOr because you want the fold breast of the person's cooperation to be before the sentencing court so I think the fact that General Flynn is now scheduled to be sentenced and apparently the sentencing is going to go forward\nOn December right team indicates that Mahler doesn't think he's going to require him for any in court\nTestimony that's not a sure sign of that but it's a pretty good sign\nAny when a department of justice figure comes out and talk to the press it tells me they want something what's the one with this is this is is promoting himself as a politician is is to make Hollywood interest how how does this work for it [noise]\nWell I think John ... and what I'm fearful of is that what we're seeing is the outlines\nOf how this whole episode is going to be brought\nTo an end and I think that what you what you were starting to see our the outlines\nOf a a kind of accommodate a deal in which there were probably no charges or impeachable offenses sided against a President Trump in the mall or investigation and at the same time\nOr what ends up getting soft pedaled is the Justice Department and FBI's investigative tactics in connection with the Trump campaign in the run up to the twenty sixteen election and the first months of the Trump Administration\nUh I I think that this is the way that this is teaming up and it's interesting that Rosenstein would be a guy who is going to have this conversation with a very select group as you say\nAre not the full committee but very select a group of a of a\nHigh ranking members of Congress who've been\nLooking at this uh I I think that's where we're headed and Rosenstein so the guy who can you speak to both ends of the investigation both the investigation of the Trump campaign and the more investigation\nThat is [laughter] well it would be unfortunate and it because we've seen evidence [laughter] side\nOf people abusing their power walk investigated the Trump campaign and trying to sabotage the ... but we've not seen any evidence or Russian collusion by the ... campaign or by the president himself\nRosenstein does he not have a rare her large stake in that outcome because of some of the things he did criticizing the eyes of war\nYeah I said I think so yeah and I think what they'll end up saying that he is is that\nWhile the president a himself did not take any a suspicious actions and uh you know while he hasn't done anything um criminal or actionable\nBut he did bring into his campaign these people who had significant connections to Kremlin tied\nPeople and I think that's the way they'll uh educated which gave the Justice Department and the FBI\nOr a good rationale to be suspicious and to take investigative action I'm not saying I agree what those are just a I've been I've been thinking for a long while a that this is the way that we are headed and I just think it's very very curious to me two things number one that President Trump's\nFirst announced and then did at one eighty on whether he was going to authorize the public disclosure of the documents that these congressional committees have been pressing for so\nWas going to give them he was going to give us we were going to be able to see what was in those documents Congress who's going to be able to see it and then suddenly he changed his mind\nAbout that a ... and you combine that\nWith his John pointed out the sudden appearance of um\nOf of Rosenstein publicly uh the justifications he's a now publicly offering\nUp for the investigation and I see that maybe this is just my I'm being a cynic maybe this is my old prosecutor and ten a paying paying 'em could be any number of things I suppose but I see the outlines of a potential deal here\nTo deal with Rosenstein now Andy Rosenstein\n... author the Mueller investigation he's written those to let her first letter in the second letter August he has a lot of explaining to do if if he's to stay on and the Trump Administration after the elections a lot of explaining because the party the Republican Party sees this as a politicized gamut the whole thing as election Eric\nThe whole thing as a narrative satisfy the Clintons in December of twenty sixteen and then to drive fund raising and programming for MSNBC and CNN for Eighteen months now ... responsible for all that he signed the fourth size to war and\nHe has no future and the Trump Administration so with roses out of there do we get to when we get to see all those documents 'cause he ... to my reading he's the only thing blocking us right now\nBut when we get to see all those documents were going to have a lot more to say then she fell as we were wrong\nI don't know John I I Wish that I thought that was necessarily true but you know I don't see Rosenstein is the only stumbling block\nHere there's never been a moment and we observe this several times in the last couple of years are just discussing this and analyzing it there's never been a moment when president and President Trump hasn't had the authority to disclose all of this information and yet he hasn't\nUm I'm not sure that Rosenstein doesn't have a future in the administration at ... you wouldn't think so but uh you know the president speaks well of him he speaks well as the president when they used to when he's speaking publicly the Republicans even if things go well on election night are going to have a very thin margin at best\nA in the Senate so it won't be the easiest thing to replace Rosenstein or if he's fired\nAnd I just don't think I'm that the Republicans are unified\nIn in believing that the investigation of the Trump campaign\nOr was politicized I think that there's a lot of feeling particularly in the Senate we heard a lot of it and the Senate intelligence committee or that there were very good reasons to proceed with this investigation and there'd been a number of prominent Republicans including Marco Rubio I'm\n... and and you know Trey Gowdy to to name to a who seemed to be very sympathetic to the FBI surveillance of Carter Page\nSo I'm not sure it's a it's a unified Republican front\nOn this and that's another reason why I think we could be just seeing the beginning of the end\nWhere it turns out that there's no charges fraud or any actionable information brought against uh against President Trump\nThat they decide that the um even if there was some excessive um the tactics used in the investigation that that all in all it was on the up and up and everybody um walks away\nA kind of reminds me if I May of the of the nine eleven commission which you know started out as a a a kind of a partisan ball\nAnd then at a certain point um when everybody kind of realized that both the Clinton and the Bush administration could be harmed by this are suddenly there was a a piece in our time\nThere was a report that was issued that didn't blame either the Clinton Administration or the Bush administration for nine eleven they hung the or you know the FBI the CIA out to dry but the\nYou know the politicians pretty much emerged unscathed and everybody loved to fight another day\nAndrew McCarthy National Review online Thaddeus McCotter W.

I'm at this time he had trans supported he was coming back\nFrom a trip to then known as Constantinople\nAnd um he was transporting a bunch of good you know clothes or you know all different types of things and he um is stopped at one of the train stations because he was transporting hunting rifles at the time\nAnd at the time um you know they weren't illegal the hunting rifles but um but he was stopped and by the time he got to his home town of all of us are\nThe police surrounded the station and um and arrested him and um and so from then it really sets the tone and right before that happened\nThere was a hum this kind of profession to celebrate the arm the anniversary of the army is also bad had just happened\nAnd it was a big moment for the Armenians and and the Turkish soldier was killed during the demonstration and and it's a long story of what happened but tensions are really um life in this town between the maintenance and the Turks\nAnd um my grandfather was you know eventually he was his conducted served for about two months\nWhen he went into the central prison correct and he's in with a Armenians or they're Christians are there but dominant moslems the ah the supervisor\nOf the central prison is that they just name it brought him beat bay and they're all frightened of him for torture\nBy your grandfather has a what I call a sunny disposition I'll get out of this things are well I'm with other Armenians the priest comes on Sunday I look forward to it nearly Easter [noise] I'll get out of this that along comes history it happens often at all the time dawn and your story that's why your grandfather\nHe's such a time machine for me it's a journey through the twentieth century and this is a fresh take on the first war\nBecause in the summer of Nineteen fourteen we know they're going to be a catastrophe called the first war however the Turks anticipating that center that bedding everything obliged your grandfather and others to be in a position to be ... scripted did he want to be a Turkish soldier and Nineteen fourteen\nI don't\nThink that he necessarily looked forward to you know serve in the military but actually for I mean it's to serve in the military was was a recent right\nFor them um they weren't able to do that and the years um up until um right before the war and so\nUm he so he joined um you know the Turkish Army and he ... he ended up being in a I'm a labor battalion right and doing road construction and so he was separated from his family\nAnd um that's how much of it when as you know the war um you know with more people show more countries joined the ward and crew larger and larger and uh my and then in Nineteen Fifteen um the Ottoman government supported the majority of the two million Armenians from their homes\nAnd um that included his family and his community and his town and so he was separated\nFrom them you know let's go to that decision because it's important we're talking about the Armenian Genocide but what generates the conditions that ... the depravity\nIs the general deterioration of civilization in Europe and Asia Minor because you will recall that turkey at the time didn't exist it was the Ottoman Empire the German government in the ... government had made inroads for the previous decades with the Ottoman Empire\nAnd we're building railroads and there were lots of German engineers all over Constantinople so when the war came along it looks like the Ottoman Empire was allied with Germany nothing much what's happening until of course the Russians attack from the north\nThe Russians were in league with the French and the and the British or not we're not making this up this is genuine for a war on history\nThe British would eventually attack\nBy coming around at the ... campaign would attack Ottoman Empire so in the blonde port which is the government in Constantinople they've felt attacked from both sides and age that dawn\nAt the way I read it it that that generates the conditions that I'll leave the decision makers and it is done bowl\nCrazy enough to believe that by punishing the Armenian somehow there were leaving or blames or shifting the blame on to the real fault of the army faltering in the north and the British attacking from the south\nDo the Armenians talk about the war do they talk about the conditions that left a of the Armenians exposed did they talk about how this could not have happened without the the first world war\nI I mean I I don't I think that\nYou know you look at different genocides over his history a lot of times it takes place during upheaval in a country returns for you know you look at the Holocaust and what happened you know what happened Kansas backdrop of World War two\nAnd I think that same thing with the I mean there was so much happening in the world and there was so much strife like it's so many countries are involved and losing some losing so many men and um that it was easy for the Armenians to disappear it was easy\nI mean of course we remember but it was easy\nUnder the cover of war to deport the Armenians and and and drive them to their death let's\nGo to the moment that you know she was a as looked upon every year it's important to remember all April twenty fourth Nineteen fifty\nThat as the date that is remembered because the rest of the Armenian dignitaries the leading scholars than brains and\nA diplomat sub Armenia in is tumble and what followed from there was persecution waves harassed the usual\nUh depravity where ... what what did your grandfather and what most importantly what an odd about our may when they heard about the arrest in his stumbled or ... ... excuse me did they know\nThat this was the beginning of an end or did they think it was just going to pass over them because those were VIPs and they were hard working village people\nWell they were there were rumors that I'm never rumors that things were going to happen I'm\nI'm I was actually right after that um roundup of intellectuals but the same thing happened in my grandfather's town which is what I really tried to focus on my grandfather's story and has towns as just a lens into the larger story so soon after what happened in in ... with a roundup of intellectuals\nAnd politicians and and basically their leaders\nI'm the same thing happened in in their town where the wealthy and influential influential um individuals' day were rounded up and deported and um and so you see it just throughout my grandfather story the story of his town with\nYour experience in their town it's just the you know something happens but they still can't imagine\nThat it would get worse or you know just same with with the ... when the deportation order finally happened you know so many of them thought that they would be returned home they thought that they would they were just leaving breathe you know just for a period of time and and would come back\nI'm never imagining the conditions that
