... de ... owns a almost everything and in fact in the Eighteen fifties\nThe south and the institution of slavery had more money more wealth than every other element in American Life all the railroads all of the manufacturing all of the financial instruments banks\nHousing real estate some money that existed in human flesh was greater than the sum of all the ...\nWas not invested in slavery and I think\nThis was the basis for the south deciding that it had to rebel and what you have\nToday is an American ally that is in that same situation without control without any bridal whatsoever and they are\nThe force that is seeking to remake or to to drive in late America and whatever agenda they choose in other words the south was the aristocracy they had the breeding they had the fish and they have the money\nThing I raised southern chivalry yes\nYes well but they had a mission that that dominated American Life and I must\nSay because this is absolutely essential\nBut south cannot be understood and its dominance with oh also at the same time understanding it it's deep intertwined relationship with New York city in other words the the New York a\nSlave trade and financial elements or what kept the south alive as the dominant force in American Line\nNew York city with Confederate Michael we know that had voted against Lance twice yeah and it was\nWay after the civil war but the fact is New York city and the south together represent the nineteenth century America will eat we look at\nThe poetry but deplorable ... they were the only reason they were the the hard Scrabble um

Want to I Want to focus is now with his Eighteen fifty sixty years to go tragedy to go between fifty six in the opening of the conflict\nAgain I remind myself and everyone you cannot know you're in a civil war when you're in it that's one of the mysteries here only afterwards you reflect on it we know now that Greeley within a civil war a war of words but the attack on\nButler or the attack on some nearby butler or a representative of southern chivalry was a blow in that civil war we've seen in these last days Michael thoughts against senators we've seen the routine like\nI'm not since the cops so far and I don't think that's going to happen the security is very good but certainly verbal assault and certainly assaults on character than the ... and they sold on Kavanaugh was also an assault question here Michael is Kavanaugh's part of the elite you you've talked last week\nOr about how the rental leading the blue ... both exist in unhappy city called Washington they're side by

that this ... this fight they they got into all week or ... or\n... alienates the American citizen the human alienate do they see that\nI I Try to sort this out and a new article that will appear in a couple of weeks in the magazine the American conservative\nAnd it's it's about the proclivity of America to to fight and divide and to embrace civil war and one of the most important\nElements in the dynamic of American a division an American bitterness is the way in which elites go hammer and Tong ... at one another and I think it has to be said that if you look at the first American civil war which\nWe call quite wrongly the American revolution that to the um the rebels horse and certainly not the rich and money deletes compared to the British aristocracy\nMonarchy and if you look at the ah situation that I laid out a couple of minutes ago in terms of the disparity in wealth between the southern aristocracy Italy\nAnd the new rising Republican Party\nAnd here I Would suggest anybody who wants to understand what the Republican Party was in the Eighteen fifties should read William in apps\nA wonderful book or the origins of the Republican Party and you will\nFind out how much the

[noise]\n...\nJoined us or this is the John ...\nIs the is the small business reporter brought to you by the Republican ... Xiong as about genre is a prosperous nation looking to develop into the twenty first century with small business just as the United states is developing which is why\nThe business of the planet is small business gene marks is the small business columnist for the guardian newspaper\nAnd other distinguish publications in junior new column in the guardian looks very attractive so immediately want to go to the question of minimum wage you have written about it in the guardian most recently we've talked about minimum wage for the last year but it's been a debate in the United states especially around\nFast food franchises and\nExtending from the Pacific to the Atlantic city's you're debating whether minimum wage is can be imposed upon small business owners\nAnd what that does for employment statistics however we now have the breaking news that Amazon\nIs raising its minimum wage and all of its of hundreds of thousands of employees to Fifteen dollars what was your first impression when Jeff Bezos made this announcement how did you how how did you think this would affect small businesses good evening to Eugene\nScreaming John ... my first impression when Amazon or decided to raise their waste or Fifteen dollars I think they're sending a clear shot across the bow at all small businesses and merchants that they'd better step up their game\nThat's what I thought now first of all there are a lot of reasons behind the scenes right Amazon raised their wages to what they are and people can debate that there's political reasons some people you know they're they're actually cutting some benefit some ... plans and their bonus plans for some people are saying workers might be making a little bit less or\nAmazon disputes that claim a your Amazon themselves are there are there are automated near warehouses for this might not even be an issue going forward as they continue to cut down on employees but the bottom line is from a PR standpoint they're paying their people Fifteen bucks an hour which is more than other their competitors like Wal Mart or doing as well they're going to have to respond\nAnd if you're a small merchant or this is what you're up against when you're when you're trying to attract people I the reason why I like this is the lesser of two evils John is that I I don't like the government\nTelling businesses what they should be paying their people I've always been non supportive of minimum wage I think that the federal minimum wage right now it's seven dollars and twenty five cents as\nUnrealistic anyway and I don't really know any any of my clients are paying a you know an hourly wage that low\nUm I think it should be left up to you know the private sector and the private sector is doing that right Amazon right now saying it's do we think Fifteen bucks an hour should be what it is so I prefer to have that then the government requiring it but now small merchants of small businesses are hourly you're paying hourly\nThey've got to respond to something like that and I wrote in the uh in the guardian recently how um you know my my clients that complain the most John\nAbout I'm not being able to find good people I'm looking to see their numbers they tend to pay their people less you know they they're you know I just can't find a good person to work in a warehouse for ten dollars an hour and the reason why is because down the street somebody's paying twelve bucks an hour to do it\nSo I you know I think we as business owners have to realize that you get what you pay for and we do have to pay a little bit more and maybe that doesn't have to be in the form of wages maybe it's more paid time off or more fringe benefits are better health insurance but\nTo tight labor market and we're either gonna have to suck it up if we can or increased prices if we have to do that but\nYou know this is what's going on now and I think Amazon is that they are telling all small businesses by this move we better do something as well as that but\nHave a column and the guardian recovering these twenty Seventeen study by the University of Washington\nThat mitigate this rush toward the Fifteen dollars an hour if the ambition is more jobs now we're in a very tight job market right now actually the we're tight as an adequate they're either not enough workers one of the or one of the\nOne of the practical reasons for Amazon\nRaise the wages that they need a hundred thousand a hundred and twenty thousand for the holidays and they might not be there so but in any event gene ... things have not changed right on the economics of minimum wage it it decreases the number of employees and limits the possibilities for a small business owners and French officers\n[noise] yeah I mean it's it's it's definitely a challenge for business owners to react now again there was a study from the University of Washington that said that it had an impact on employment in Seattle where their minimum wage went up to Thirteen dollars an hour\nBack in two thousand and six team but then another study just came out that at Berkeley which we take it with a grain of salt joined us from Berkeley\nUp and they increase said they looked at a few cities that increased their minimum wages above ten dollars an hour Washington Chicago Seattle San Francisco and they they said no this doesn't have any impact on jobs over the years there's been plenty of studies that that you contradict each other\nOn the impact of whether a minimum wage hurts job growth or not the bottom line is though is that\nYou know it's it's a competitive market and right now employees um I could have their say they didn't have to say ten years ago when the unemployment rate is so high\nBusiness to respond to that and we have to pay more if you want good people you gotta you gotta pay for them or you're going to lose out to companies like Amazon and you have to adjust in some way on land line horse or increase or price\nOn less and less the employee is a robot okay let's examine the trend here gene a these are the you have a guardian column about a cash ... retail store what does that and what does the controversy\nWell there are um first of all there there's Amazon itself a as it's been introducing cash\nFlow stores around the country they just open their third cash flow store in Chicago just recently where you go into the store and uh you know you can pay you know you're by yourself you take it off the shelf you pay with the app\nAnd there's no cash that's involved is an automated store which is cutting down on employees technology is one way that you get around having to have\nThose employees and so a lot of companies um when they're looking at\nYou know how to save on costs a lot of them are being forced to take a step up and make some investments and self service types of kiosks and point of sale systems and ah maybe selling more online and doing things that require less people around and\nAmazon itself it funny John this is one company that\nYou know they're paying now because they need those holiday workers I Know what ever Amazon says they don't want to have all this holiday workers if it was up to them they would have it all automated and they're working toward that they have more than fifty thousand robots right now that are in their warehouses and twenty different locations around the country and it's growing\nBut doing a lot of the tests that warehouse workers did so I think Amazon is being forced to do this kind of stuff but you know they're they're actually opening up stores are that are cash\nLists an employee Lester virtually employee list or because they see where it's going that automation will save a lot of people's time you know\nI I wrote it another piece also in the guardian about a company named atrium ... San Francisco what it was a process yeah sixty five million bucks this company because they've come up with a ... a software an artificial intelligence software application\nJohn bus or this is the John ... says oh gee marvels as long as the columnist for the guardian and this is a small business from or the business of America is small business the business of the planet and small businesses has brought\nTo you by the republic of Azerbaijan which in my visit I saw is an excellent capital as day with lots of small businesses in all directions looking for more that the middle of Eurasia\nAnd the middle of North America together for small businesses then Jean\nThe economy is extremely strong can I say that again extremely strong we have deals in place now that are solving the terror of disputes with our allies that would be Canada and Mexico\nAre allies the European Union Japan is in conversation however what I learned is to pay attention to the small business because that is the metrics that leads us you told me in the winter of sixteen\nUh watch out for Donald Trump small businesses love him they think they're going to get a big boost from him and I went what\nNow I pay attention again with small businesses are looking at this fabulous climate just fat the markets are up the ... the chairman of the Federal Reserve says things can get better [noise]\nSo what to small businesses make of this excitement\nUm met [laughter] okay maybe a little bit better than ... people are happy that's good news um by clients I talked to a ... they're happy they're there\nThey're looking for employees there they are busy there certainly um you know but you're pleased with the way the economy is going but interestingly enough it particularly with small businesses and I keep an eye on these guys the question is John if the if they're doing well should they be spending more shouldn't they be hiring more go now hiring\nIt small businesses he's up but it hasn't been at the same level as big corporations and now a new survey a new report that just came out from Pepperdine University um is is actually saying that uh the financing among small businesses is is is lagging a little bit\nThis you know this report found out that I'm a third of the small businesses that they they surveyed with under five million in revenue only a third of them so that they plan to raise financing and the next six months forty three percent don't plan to raise any financing at all and twenty three percent orange sure what they'll do\nWhich translates into the fact that small business owners themselves as strong as the economy is they're just still cautious we are a very cautious breed we still have\nThe great recession it's hard to believe it's like almost ten years ago but it's still sticking in our minds let's not forget that the average age of the small business owner in America is about fifty three years old\nSo we're old enough to really remember that recession and before we extend ourselves too much or expand shoe much um we're really not going to got to think very hard about doing that\nSo yes we're happy with the way things are going yes we're happy as the economy is growing but are we really getting the financing that we need every really spending on expansion um it's it's not\nHappening at the page that you would think it would be happening\nIs that how it cost is it health costs January the colors the guardian that looks at the expected rise in health costs and twenty Nineteen right so people\nAre or are concerned not only about employee cost and finding employees and meeting that demand but one of the biggest cost that we're all facing happens to be health costs yeah we've been looking at double digit\nHealthcare insurance increases over the past few years now the good news is that they're actually report that just came out fairly recently one from a consulting firm called out of their health that found out that\nOh care costs are really only expected to rise about four point one percent next year for employers\nIn addition to that health care costs as well um based on the Kaiser foundation study that just came out this week also predicts about five percent increase in five percent is like for health care is pretty good I mean you're right I mean we're used to a lot more than that\nBut even so the cost of a typical employee for health care is dial up and around twenty thousand dollars a year it's still significant and the demands for healthcare insurance are higher than ever and the need to provide that kind of benefit\nIs a priority if we want to attract good people so it's certainly costs for that and keep an eye on retirement costs as well John which are also creeping up\nThese types of cost or people were a business owner for spending more on our people and the cost to maintain them and keep them loyal and a happy than getting financing to go out and you know build new you know build new buildings or expand our businesses so I Do think yes that is one big factor that's going back\nTo things change first California is looking at a changing small business lending practices do you regard this to the good\n[noise] I I I regard it as I Can't believe it it it does now all of a bill in California to legislate legislature to build it it's it's pending to be signed into law will likely be a sign in or\nWhich is requiring lenders to provide full disclosure about John here's what the bill requires lenders it's led in part particularly on line lenders they have to tell you the total amount that you're that you're borrowing that that the cost of the financing that term\nHow often you have to pay what the pre payment policies are these are kinda like standard things right I mean if you were going to get you know alone a these are the things you'd be asking for\nWell apparently there are a lot of small businesses in this country that get loans from online lenders that aren't getting that kind of information unfortunately and so the state legislature and California stepped in and said listen if you're going to be an online lender and land in California were requiring you to make sure that your your your clients your customers\nKnow that information that you are disclosing it all to them so I think it's a great thing for small businesses are but I Will tell you one thing if you're a business owner and you're not even asking these questions\nYou better hire an accountant or an attorney to represent you if you're getting any kind of financing even from an online vendor because those people will be asking these questions regardless of whether the law requires them or not\nAnd Michigan a form association health plans under federal rules is this a work around that is viable we've seen others rejected\nYeah we're talking about health care before so I I'm a big proponent of association health plans is a ruling that was issued by the department of labor it's under the Trump Administration is one of the many things that the Trump Administration is doing so to circumvent the Affordable CARE Act\nAnd in Michigan there is now stories of companies that are forming associations so you don't have to join your industry group although maybe your industry group offers them but you can form your own association and if you're more than a hundred employees that are part of his association you're like minded businesses or what not\nYou can negotiate better rates because the rules are under Obamacare are not as owner is if you have more than a hundred employees which means that\nYou can cut out some essential health benefits and and and get lower premiums for yourself\nAnd your employees now some people might not be crazy about that but you can't exclude people with preexisting conditions and you can't charge people more based on their health history association plans are great option to offer it to your employees along with whatever else you're you're currently offering just\nBe where it's a Trump Administration thing John and you know as we've learned by executive orders they can be overturned by a quick 'cause this is not law on mar a Lago reelected these things could go right out the door\nJean Marc sees the small business columnist for the guardian another distinguish publication this is a small business report brought to you by the

further its crackdown on illegal immigration\nSo at the point at that point capital ships I cannot operate with any confidence whatsoever in a vast amount of ocean huge us over and just put you put them out of action\nYes and you can also with this um law ships and where they can't sorority and that's a big part is that you know by taking a what they were uh you know China has a large amount of their fleet fucking an island or whatever it's\nSystem you can literally layer appreciate in my field one pass a bill that night but be promote self bomber and that all that combat power will be locked that island they can't leave until they the mind that that harbor that area so we're talking\nJust a week here in the ability to better by it call do I fear of what mine warfare is and it's definitely going to have a right to my eyebrows at Beijing\nProtests and this is sort of be fifty two because to be fifty two has such a lift capability that's why they're designing all these new weapons for and you can put on a library of your arsenal and and launch\nYes let's put it this way right now of what we know of the pie fifty two if I remember correctly has five hyper ... weapons systems being developed for it five ... that's what we know about 'em so it it is the\nAir horses bomber truck of the weapons to talk of the future it's caring big outside weapons\nLong distances and delivering them set up branches and do this one of the other great but I did not that Ted\nIs they want to make that outer pile on capable of carrying a weapon of the twenty thousand pound class so that the big big weapons okay um and that's something that would be like a like a hyper ... who is like ...\nUm but even these quick strike by its can get his biggest two thousand pounds so instead of sending a fighter that carry two of them\nYou can set a bomber that carry twenty four of them and lay in a higher Meyer killed in one shot\nThe beaches seem to the weapon to fear in the twenty first century who knew in the twenties now we go to the air force his plans to expand their operations with new squandering the sea will recall that the air force and all the military services\nHave been a guard at these last years because of Congress's inability to reach a budget that is no longer the case and what the air force one is striking\nA tie your reporting that they want to go from three hundred and twelve squadrons to three hundred and eighty six that's a lot of new aircraft um why what is it that they need what capability did they gain without growth\nSo basically that plan has capability growth in every combat\nKind of been in a category that they do so air force wants to grow the squad are numbered space in fighter and bomber and refusing all a lot of inner fueling um so it's pretty much everybody needs to get that wants to stay quiet which is totally unfounded\nNow there is no idea how it's going to happen but the takeaway is that the airports to really try to curb the trying to get Congress to come\nWith the reality is that there's not enough aircraft or combat hour period you even had a quiet man that is their two day yet alone if we get into really protracted even a low intensity conflict or whatever so\nThe chickens have come home to roost sweat comes to the air squadrons being cut ...\nPercent of the Cold War and he has two thousand three\nWe could not now Asian of Iraq\nWith airpower years today like back then I couldn't do it we don't have it so this is a remedy here that the big question is how are they going to say\nWell they'll pay for it out of necessity the same way they paid for the fleet after Nineteen thirty nine in Nineteen forty one so let's go to what else the air force he's either upgrading or needs to ... has has need for attention the beach to what is that ... what is the ... it really looks really cool what's it for\nMe to a woman who was America's stopped bomber you know it was built in Nineteen eighty nine as long as far as the bail and it's amazing to think it was three years old you know the first stop on average been around for a while to operational for about Twenty years or Twenty one years\nAnd it certainly has already have horizon but it still America\nSilver bullet course it is the most capable air combat vehicle and the girls are being cut an ape and the enemy airspace were out to help to show us or that\nAnd want to ask that are ... eighty is currently targeting organizations can you take out and hire to do with Michael ... one of those are\nAnd the beat two is operating now in the middle east or I remember reading about that have they rotated them out of the middle east out of the country are field I think is where I read about uh once upon a time where I still live so\nNo they're not out at the beach too is generally a an air for me to basis um that they have operational support that there are some in Hawaii right now that are trying out new concept that are actually in the wake island where the only way to call and which is all do but in the middle east you got to be let him be\nA ... one of the older the older strike aircraft by yes so it's there there's a B. one which they operate now\nHave been using against ISIS as I recall the guy to that is based largely in the U.S and is now part of this ... geo strategic\nManeuvering in the Pacific out of Hawaii the beef she'd do we've mentioned the grandfather and grandfathers and then there's a new strike bomber there that are developing for the for the future how soon as the future for the new strike bummer\nWell amazingly so uh they say that this aircraft is going to enter operational capability and twenty twenty five which is really hard to believe 'em but\nThey move very fast on it it uses a lot of existing technologies I'm so they're not developing new avionics at all the time it gets really expensive they're trying to use off the show technology is Laura and\nPackaging metro area scale a cutting edge here\nSo the idea is that with all these costs they want to spend ... million or coffee which sounds like a lot of money but it's not in\nBut he talked about stealth bombers right and they want to buy a lot of them instead of like the beach too which is a ... but it's only after the Cold War going on were built I'm only twenty exist today\nWhat they're talking at least one hundred\nBut based on like this new ... Palmer um squadron goal but they have it we just discuss we could very well see that a Twenty one go to like a hundred and fifty or even a hundred and Seventy either because it's not just the other\nIt cause harm to different things and it's optional and band as well it can be censored out it can be very upset about the nation's it can work as a quarterback ... air vehicles potentially\nSo it's not just the traditional bomber at a target fly home this thing could support sleep in ways that really I'm ...\nI'm speaking with the rug away he keeps a war zone at the drive with his colleagues and we're talking about the air force in its capabilities when we come back what is the weapon uh the photo has said we need to build for I'm John bachelor this is the John ...

decades is that going to stop we got a way of stopping them given the new commander of the DIE you good evening to\nBelieving so it's an ongoing effort from that the U.S government is paying more and more attention to now the Trump Administration is attempting to modify aspects of\nUh the way that we make sure that other countries aren't transferring to much intellectual technical capital to their shores primarily Chinese\nAnd the Chinese government and intellectual property that has a dual use value so could be used for commercial or civilian applications but also military applications\nAnd part of the push for that uh was a paper that was called the Pentagon paper and its authored by a fellow who's going to be the new head of the aisle you seems Michael Brown and he's a former Symantec CEO\nAnd it's a change in what this aspect to the Pentagon was supposed to do it we stood up and two thousand Fifteen by former defense secretary Ash Carter and it was meant to be the Pentagon's liaison\nTo Silicon Valley so it was up to bridge both the culture and a practical gap that exists between a Washington DC and Silicon Valley to help the defense department really grabbing harness all of the great innovation that she was coming out of the American start up seeing\nSo ... what they called nontraditional players is a little tiny companies that are getting big vc money that produce

China and Chinese companies can make us start ups but it's also an effort that the U.S to help again\nThe defense department's secure innovative technology solutions from a non traditional players so I'm not big uh\nA defense contractors and it's a real up her bottle so it if you if you haven't looked at the paper which we were the first to actually publish the final version of it on to ... uh it it highlights uh some of the dangers that uh\nUh the very least many a growing number of people in the defense department or and also think tanks are highlighting in terms of a supply chain compromise and other issues from the growing amount of of Chinese investment there Bob but it's it's not an again as a problem that has an easy solution because\nIt's free flow of capital is also kind of a thing that we're all about it's it's really a big part of America's branch to the rest of the world and so a navigating this new space where a\nWe're watching technology transfer to a potential future adversary what we today describe as they can pay a competing nation a competitor nation or it's not something that's easily fixed but that's something that uh the Pentagon's outreach arm to Silicon Valley is going to be spending more time\nDoing three three points that you develop in your piece at defense won won the v the industry in this country is throwing all this money on software meaning everybody's innovating out there to the Chinese they're no longer according to Mr Brown they're no longer copycats\nTheir creative and three there are several Manhattan projects or authored by China a command economy\nAh which right now we do are are not matching AI is one I Know about but there are several other that could be listed here so what does brown recommend what it what is the need to get his ... at ... to make his job possible\n[noise] well it it's a good point that he does highlight the contrast between the way the Chinese government takes a whole of government and kind of whole economy\nResponse to ambitious technological goals and realizing them with big investments and things like a quantum computing and and artificial intelligence and those big investments also come with big vision statements that\nThey're able to tie different aspects of the country together and to meet the\nCommercial sector that the government to beg you know has a primary influence over there's also a the military et cetera so uh one of the things that he's suggesting brown and suggesting is that uh maybe it's time for the United states to\nBegin to match from a government funding perspective some of this research and development that we see coming out of China and also maybe to develop some of its own big vision statements its own Manhattan projects toward some of these areas hyper sonics we are investing Barton hyper sonics but it's a\nIt's been an effort in fits and starts and and the Chinese are surging very quickly to a head in some key areas artificial intelligence and we are standing up by\nThe Pentagon is sending up a new Center for artificial intelligence research but that's military specific and we can bring in a commercial entities that also have their uses out of that and when you signed up to meet those names you're going to have more success and in a few other areas and he also it was it was actually sort of interest and\nUh even though you know uh it's it's now the Trump there he actually a structure very on Trump Ian corn\nTalking about how uh the most recent round of tax cuts is probably not going to be in line with\nA stepping up to meet those new challenges because it increases the deficit which makes a more consistent funding for those new research and development priorities a little bit harder especially as you go forward and future budgets\nI'm One of the things that the air force right now is recognizing\nIn what they want from uh the new bomber that they're developing and I think you might even see the the same sort of thing come into future language about uh ICBMs and and when the navy begins to talk about it when they replace\nA nuclear submarines um is this sense that new defenses against us bombers\nThey're going to be more difficult and also change more rapidly than a perhaps to us is prepared for at least in terms of the way we used to design stuff and that's because of information technology right that's because\nAh can cuter or software based uh a radio radar\nUm software based threat detection software based uh you know methods for attacking information systems that are part of aircraft those things evolve at the speed of information technology which is much faster than hardware evolves\nAnd so what they want from this neck strategic bomber is that it be a not only rapidly available but rapidly credible in several key areas including defensive systems\nAnd so that speaks to the need for a maybe a ... probably new forms of cognitive\nA electronic warfare capabilities and also a cognitive defensive capabilities which means the ability or it made it in terms of the software that's on the plane to detect new forms of radar detection that are being thrown at it and also to uh\nLive to execute new forms of offensive or electronic warfare weapons delivery and that's on top of carrying whatever payload it needs to carry\nA but one of the things that they also are looking at is how this thing is going to operate alongside a bunch of other aircraft to create a sense\nOf uncertainty in in a potential adversary and that's that's also a big change from the way we used to think about nuclear deterrents right because the ... go back to your doctor Strangelove those\nBombers are flying to sort of you know send a message a bite your lip fighter jets tend to completely different message and now the the emphasis on creating a sense that hey you know with a\nI'm a long range strategic cruise missile\nA that is nuclear tipped it's possible to have a fighter jet that also serves in the function of a bomber um and that's something that they're talking about in in for a couple of years now they've been talking in an abstract way not in a formal way but in an abstract way about bringing some of that capability onto the thirty five\nPatrick I'm In my late ... they're they're treating air frames like the way Tesla treats its automobiles they don't actually touched the machine they upgrade with software is that what they're thinking of here that it that to the air frame remains the same but its capabilities will change as they write new software [noise]\nUm yeah basically that that that's not necessarily that that's the capability will improve with as soon as you press a button or you might have to install something new but it can improve pretty\nThey can do your point though when David goldfish in general they would go back and he was the chief of staff the Airforce talks about what he once and future air fringe actually does bring up exactly what you just describe be actually brings up Tesla and remote updating\nOf a core functioning\nOf the ... of the systems on board by virtue of just you give them a new payload and all of a sudden you've got an entirely new way of that aircraft injure facing with the pilots have communicating with a command and and really of accessing the world so that is something that they want to move towards his is remote updating of a lot of different aspects of\nThe way these planes function in terms of the sort of the court brains on board and\nWe turn and naturally to space acts because basics right now is popular because it's building cheaper boosters first stage repeatable boosters that you can buy secondhand in third hand\nHowever now a debate emerges that I did not know about about space X taking orders for weaponized space\nAs I understand that Patrick what's happened is that we're no longer debating should face be weaponized it is and it's going to be so the question is how are we going to respond is this a contract or in other words would add the Airforce be outsourcing its weaponized of space to go to space ex\nWell this was an interesting and I think sort of revealing moment that also occurred at the uh air forces recent conference when ... well who are basically runs through space acts on terms of the day to day operations there\nShe is the president and and the c._e._o. was asked if that space X would consider delivering weapons payloads into space and she said sure why not [noise]\nUm so ... it's a it's nothing the that's become a contract yet but it does speak to\nWhat is the next stage of of the U.S putting things into space and there's a lot of push a particularly from\nLike a girlfriend who's the under secretary of defense for research and engineering to put a lot more sensors in space and also potentially deport direct energy which is blazers or a neutral particle beams a more weapons in space to attack\nMissiles as they're launching during the boost phase this is something that he's talked about uh in terms of a potentially of great interest in an advantage to the United states so it's no longer so much of an abstract discussion at something that's becoming a a real discussion though not yet connected to a big change in policy where a lot of people are waiting for\nThe new missile defense review to come out to explain that but space exploration example of one of these new commercial private space players that's kind of seeing the writing on the wall in terms of the way one of the world's up but probably the world's largest space single space customer [noise]\nUh is talking about what they want to do and and signaling that that's something that they're comfortable with but uh you know even though you can set and I think that that certainly Defense Department folks do say that the weaponization of space as\nIt is a thing that is actively occurring that a Chinese anti satellite test which go back now more than eight years are very real and the the facts of them are are known to the entire world\nRussian a placement of a robotic entities in space that may serve an anti satellite functioned that's something that a more and more people are talking about and uh it's a matter of known intelligence at this point\nSo even though you can say that the weaponization of space is something that's already happened\nThe differences that China and Russia are yet acknowledging that that's something that they're doing whereas the U.S policy seems to be a we're going to at some point announced the possibility of intentional placement of objects in space\nWhich means that I don't know what many ways that's sort of the worst of both worlds there kind of late to the game but they're the first one to take all the heat for it because there is a lot of concern internationally about\nWhether or not that's something that the international space treaty would support\nPatrick Tucker the technology

product of all the dust gathered in the local boy\nI think the way to view this is that over time over billions of years the galaxies attract what another through the gravity and the galaxy cluster right and the groups they attract other galaxies into their rather than ... shall we say\nAnd the void expand as a result and so you can look at what's going on as galaxy clusters and syllabus pulling in additional galaxies food that gravity you can also look at it as a void lifting the inter galaxies\nAs the filament attract\nThose void galaxies toward it so probably the reason that the local she is so very fit it simply because the local boy has pushed\nThose galaxies has squeezed those galaxies into that sheet between a that local void in and avoid on the other side of us so it's it's really a wonderful opportunity just to study what are these gigantic cosmic structures because of local board is still buried\nNearby you ride your report in the sky and telescope that the Milky Way us a little pd peace in one of the artist the Milky Way we're going through the University of six hundred and thirty kilometers per second which is fast okay one point for a million miles per hour is that because of the local boy does it make us go that fast\n[noise] yes it is part of the reason that we're going very fast and let me first put that number in prospect six hundred and thirty kilometers per second which as you could say is one place for a million miles per hour that's really fast\nBut okay if you compare that much faster than like going around the stuff I mean there are schools around the sun it only thirty kilometers for second and a son and goes around the center of the Milky Way galaxy it only two hundred and fifty kilometers for second so here we are\nThe entire local group of galaxies that's the way and they draw like al ... or that all the other galaxies in a local group or all moving through the universe at six hundred and thirty kilometers per second much faster than we go around the sun or go around the galaxy and the question is why\nWell it must be because there are huge cosmic structures out there that are trying to pull us their way or perhaps push us away\nFrom the local boy does what are the things but first let me talk to other\nObjects that are a very important to our motion one of them as a Virgo clusters of galaxies is located fifty four million light years from earth it's the nearest galaxy cluster to us and it's trying to pull us its way through its gravity also at a greater distance there's something called the great tractor\nWhich is an even more massive clusters of galaxies at it too is trying to pull off its way in a different direction and then\nYou've got the local boy which is what you asked about now Lloyd's don't try to push ups and ... don't try to pull us that way because there's very little matter in a void instead you can pick of the local board as trying to push us\nAlways felt the polls from the vertical cluster and the great attractive and the big push from the local ... explain our ... to the university very high speed\nOf six hundred and thirty coauthor it's protected so yes we do need to include the influence of the local avoid as we try to understand that very high speed\nThat we have through the universe or as I say in the article in the sky until ... nothing really matters\nThe illustrations the company or a sky telescope peace are revelations to me because they're they're working on this scale\nAnd when we come to the local group of galaxies or how we move through space but surrounding us our super clusters or come across or the Hercules Cluster\nThe shape Lee concentration the ... cluster are those also exerting um pull upon us are we are we being bandied about by all of that the local the local void moving because of all those clusters\nWell yes all of these structures are influencing our motion to the universe and so the clusters try every cluster tries to pull us it's way okay 'cause every clusters got galaxies at every galaxy has math\nAnything that has math has got a gravitational pull so every cluster is trying to push pull pull off it's a way for the vertical cluster the tractor the chef the cubs to fish and they're all trying to hold\nTheir way and other voices they're trying to push us away because they've got less mattered than the average and still the local boy this is pushing us\nAway and so our motion to the universe is very high status that hundred and thirty ... second is is a result of all of those are great cause but that cities and then in addition to that\nAt a very large this to say a new voice has been just discovered called the dipole we tell her Lloyd and it also tells us and it's it's trying to push us away in about the same direction that they created a tractor is trying to pull up\nOkay so when you take into account these very large scale things and we're talking up to this is about a billion light years fits explains our motion to the universe they use the motion of the local group for the universe\nI'm speaking to a doctor can cross while riding a for the cover story of sky and

curiosity is actually the backup computer because shortly after it landed on Mars the primary computer started have problems\nHardware and software issues and so they switched to the backup\nThey have a over the over the over time they have diagnose the primary computer and not using it but they try to diagnose didn't figure it out with a bad memory was so that they think they can use it again and

ago\nAnd use that to try to get a record of what happened so they can then diagnosed the problem on the backup computer they've been using for the last five years\nAnd this carries a little bit of risk because the old computer did have problems they say they're diagnosed it and they know that they have isolated the bad um sections on a memory that they don't want to use [noise]\nBut you know this carry some risk\nIn the meantime ... is not going to stop ... stop doing anything it's been sitting now for more than two weeks without being able to give us any information you can communicate with it\nAnd meanwhile opportunity remain silent or they didn't check you know they're checking on it multiple times a day [noise]\nUm but they've got no response from it now since mid June and um they're hoping they think what's happened is that the it's a it's solar panels have been covered with dust so he can't get enough energy even though there's no much stalled and they're hoping that dust devils go by and blow the dust off that has happened to the past\nBut they're not getting the response yet so we don't know and what this means for the United states and for the world we are been

that their optimism curiosity is is is realistic but there's a risk\nWith opportunity they basically stated where we are a if those solar panels are covered and they're not getting any energy they're not going to hear from it until those pounds get cleared\nAnd it could very well be months in another month or two because November is a dust up the season and so they're they're they're anticipating the more likely dust devils after November and so we'll just have to wait for that\nIt's very possible cure or opportunity is dead and that's just life it is when a lot longer than it was both do so
