that the attack in Pittsburgh has just continuous with the other incidents because of the horror of it it was an attack on innocent people and at the same time you can join with what the us has enjoyed for Seventy years which is speaking how\nAh how will the U.S has welcomed Jewish refugees from the Europe pars and here we have one visited upon us is beyond irony John it ... it reminds all of it that you have to be a watchful every day\n[noise] well I Know several ex patriots who are Americans but live overseas it might come back to this country perhaps once a year and talking to them as a real eye opener because they see the country of snapshot Forman they notice changes over the course of a year or two [noise]\nWhat I've been told by many of them the last two or three years is is how much more politicized America is how people are yelling at each other about politics and no longer discuss\nThe normal course of daily events they immediately jumped into politics and they find out who side someone who's on and they start attacking them social media has become a mosh pit of resentments and prejudices and name calling\nSo one of the greatness of the great things about America from much of my life has been we don't dedicate everything to politics politics is sort of cordoned off people carve out their lives separate from it I think the age of Trump\nThe age of the age of the shouting in the yelling has meant more people are getting more upset with each other than they ever have before and that ultimately has consequences\nThat if you have questions a gentleman there or not or they're not deep divisions among people view of the country in the direction the country's going to lead to this and how do you ... the rhetoric amongst both sides when that chasm exists debit\nWell I think part of the problem is nobody wants to accept responsibility for anything you know the president is never fall for anything he says the a leading figures on the left or never fall for anything they say\nSo everybody says whatever they want and it's always the other guy saw and nobody's willing to collectively take responsibility for things things that\nAren't necessarily their fault but in a sense\nAre their fault that they're an elective office because otherwise why are you there that nothing is going to get better I think it is true that we are deeply divided nation and that has been a\nA character of our politics and increasingly over the past Twenty years I think what's different now\nThan at least in some previous decades although this isn't the only time in American history this has happened is that at the present time were particularly tribal about it we are with our political try because the other side of the evil so my side might not always be right but the other side is evil\nThey're not just wrong they have ill intent and we have seen\nBoth the left and the right to strive president they don't like is not just being wrong but purposely wrong for the purpose of undermining America on purpose\nHas no political leaders actually say to themselves and they get up in the morning left or right today I'm going to ruin America on purpose for one purpose I have no idea that people believe that\nJohn I'm\nBoth sides believe that the America that they want is threatened\nAnd we have seen the last Thirty years the percentage of people\nWho believe that the other party is evil as David described has gone from about ... percent of Republicans and Democrats used to believe that about the other party now it's fifty two fifty three percent for each party\nYou cannot have a functioning democracy cannot have a Congress of compromises in passes bipartisan legislation you cannot have anything like the old politics we have\nOver half of the country\nBut lose the other side is exactly what David said I'd met at a domestic enemy an enemy of the people um those those are not conditions under which you can govern the way we used to\nA question Richard Haass that are raised in an article he wrote in Nineteen fifty this during the McCarthy period when there were deep divisions in America\nAnd I paraphrase it just loosely because I Want to ask the question of out of this David do you measure that Washington today is prepared for the opponent to be the government\nOur men and women going to work on Capitol Hill and at the White House aware of the fact that the people there are posing tonight on television could very well be the leadership of the country in a matter of months\nWell I think I think that for political professionals in Washington they know that very well but they have a part to play and they play the part and then the election happens and they go about their ... that they kind of go about their business so I think that when you're in business you say all sorts of things\nAnd then you're able to work together the next day because that's just your job I think the problem with that is that you create expectations among the electorate\n... make it harder for them to be okay with he's doing that job so for instance if you if you go on television call one party evil and they're trying to undermine America or or you beat up on the political establishment and the government in and create a sense of distrust among institution then when it's time to actually do your job\nWell your professional so for you it's no big deal but for voters they're sitting there going but I don't trust the government and you said the other side of evil so I don't want you to compromise with them\nAnd and I don't think that I I don't know the political leaders have digested or or talking heads and digested but they create this or that they might not necessarily believe and think it's all part of\nYou know you're in the middle of a football game and then when it's over your friends again but for the fans they still have the other side's fans and they don't want you to make nice with them and I I don't know if people quite a internalized that\nJohn do are are they professionals ready to acknowledge the other side is in charge and work with them [noise]\nWell we're going to find out because if the Democrats take back the house that would give them the responsibility of governing\nAnd we can see if we have a normal Congress where there's a give and take and you know people debate whether or not to have a government shutdown and not what the how to stop that and pass appropriations bills and all of those things how to negotiate with a Republican Senate\nOr we can go to every democratic chairman issues lots of subpoenas halls and members of the administration for questioning and moved to impeachment remember the leading democratic donors to the will of elected a lot of these House Democrats Tom Steyer specifically in California\nDid so say we want to impeach President Trump so the expectations that David spoke about are going to be there if the Democrats take back the house they will have a choice\nDo we govern normally having you know ... won the election or do we are we driven by our donors in our participants in our base to you know full frontal war with the administration and there's no pretense of governing\nJohnson to the national Review Online and Fox News David ...

very good evening to you thank you for this the Trump Administration is lowering sanction so what was your inspiration to be very particular about who it is that is the ... who is the problem good evening to\nGood evening a thanks for having me I'm just report that I'm that we're discussing is coming about a week before the Trump Administration renews the rest of the economic sanctions on Iran that had been lifted up under the two thousand and Fifteen a nuclear deal and\nI think at least this is a vital stop I think it will go a long way towards pressuring the regime an exerting a fairly devastating impact on US Economy but I think as we do this it's also a very important that we also go after the figures in the regime that are responsible for major human rights abuses\nBy the Trump Administration as well as their mission beforehand or had already um sanction a number of such people\nBut there are many more within the regime that have yet to be a designated for human rights abuses that I think it's very important that we do so now also because the Iranian people are um protesting as we speak on the rich are on the streets of Iran as they've been doing since two thousand ah Seventeen and\nUh they're looking I think many of them are looking to the United states for leadership first solidarity\nUh they were a member of the fact that President Obama was largely silent when they first protest it on a mass\nScale in two thousand nine and I think that by sanctioning these people I think we're also sending a much more a direct message to the Iranian people that we understand the particular place that they experience on a day to day basis and these are figures which um you know he's earned obscure figures within Iran many of them were actually\nAppointed by president Hassan Rouhani who is often described as a moderate um but in fact when you actually look at his behavior um UCLA actually um that is appointed officials who are directly who prior to the appointment we're responsible for major human rights abuses and\nContinued hum since then so um these are people who report to Rowhani so we can't uh plausibly argue that um he has no responsibility for this or that he's powerless to prevent it um the these are figures within the regime that a\nA ... that operate it daily\nThe ... of repression\nThe report is entitled profiles of Iranian repression architects of human rights abuses in the Islamic republic it's available at the foundation for the defense of democracy the website I'm going to look to breaking down there twelve names here\nBut and they're all unfamiliar to me before I come to the profiles provided in the report so we'll begin with the ministers\nA mock mode a lobbyist the minister of intelligence he is a severe abused or of the Iranian people at the same time he says his job is to stand up to the cronies of global hedge me\nHad jumped on me meaning the United states\nHow is the ministry of intelligence used internally against the Iranian people say\nWell the mystery of intelligence is probably a arguably probably one of the most uh it's not the most major human rights abuses or a in a Iran\nUm it has its fingerprints throughout\nThe country in terms of uh targeting dissidents and journalists a political activists ethnic and religious minorities or you name it on the ministry of intelligence is job is to monitor dissidents to monitor opponents of the regime [noise] uh and\nIt had a pretty extensive infrastructure uh aimed at doing so um it's probably\nThe minister of intelligence is probably one of the most important ministers I'm In the regime [noise] um and I think they've also I Would know state played a key role in suppressing um the protests are through force that have occurred over the last\nYear they actually operate their own um prison wardens within Iran infamous prison ... infrastructure [noise]\nUm so uh you know when these people are sent to prison you know they ... they play a direct role I'm torturing these people and extracting a force confessions an otherwise mistreating them in many ways um second this is one of the most a brutal ministries in that regime\nThe ministry of interior ... what is striking about this is that he manages the the L E s a who is ... and what is the LA you have to say\nA supposedly is the minister of interior and the ... that stands for the Islamic ... the law enforcement force of the Islamic republic of Iran A L E F is basically the official state police they're responsible in theory for um insurance law and order and\nUh I'm sure they do that to some degree in prosecuting legitimate in the ... actual crimes but they also do is a key role in suppressing protests and what we've seen over the last year\nAbout that in addition to folks like the ministry of intelligence um they have been on the one they have been the ones on the streets shooting of protesters are arresting a thousands of them um and playing a key role and stopping them um the minister of interior\nAlso plays a role in uh approving permits or or or in this case not approving permits for protests you know in print according to the Iranian law you can't\nA protest without a permit but in practice or it's virtually impossible for any protesters or to get a permit because the regime does not want anyone to demonstrate against them\nSo the minister of interior or I think maintains this process they prevent people from protesting that when they try to prevent people from protesting and when those wheels are defied\nA A R y you know the regime response to force\nSerious legal effort a these are often they would interview people for for a few minutes hum and on the basis of several minute interview would decide whether or not they would live or die\nAnd Abraham right you see that was one of the members of those a death panels I'm associate directly has\nA responsibility for a scores have doubts and today he presides over a foundation called Austin cuts for his hobby a which plays a key role in generating um\nThe money that helps a Iran a ... a deport support terror abroad or as well as repression\nI'm at home um this is a foundation that with a real estate value you know in the range of a hundred million dollars um and\nUm the fact that he occupies a such an important role in the regime I think is a very telling 'em because it really just shows that the regime a really doesn't particularly care about a human rights abuses on on the contrary\nUm he was promoted I think not in spite of his bloody record\nBut because of it\nBecause it showed his loyalty to the regime and to the radical Islamist on ideology that drives that so so he is I think one of the most important figures and arguably one of the most dangerous as well and the regime\nBrigadier general hug sane ... he is in charge of the law enforcement force L E s that includes cyber I Believe and it overlaps with the best seat ... how does he make warn us people\nWell the police are responsible for us suppressing dissent\nUm the police are routinely arrests of those um it's it's it suspects of defying the regime whether we're talking about a journalist human rights activists religious minorities et cetera and\nI think the police has also over the last year played a key role in uh arresting and otherwise using force against Iranian protesters so just as I said I think that's one so the Eliot to law enforcement forces is one of the most important bodies\nHum of the government responsible for attacking suppressing it so people\nCome under the siege goal I'm sane guy in power vote or and the puzzle here is we don't know how big the siege as you have estimates from a hundred thousand to five million what's the what's a good guess\nWhat we're talking about we're talking about I'm In the millions on this has actually largely a volunteer force it has branches throughout the country and it's fairly embedded within the daily fabric of Iranian life\nNow there may be several million but we're not talking about us early a several million who are active date today\nA nose or you know are we talking about a bit of a smaller number hum but what makes the um the sea distinct from the police\nIs it not only do they um suppress dissent but they're in particular they pay a particular role in enforcing the religious nor was of the regime but I think the most traumatic and most well known example of that over the last two years has been a suppression of Iranian women particularly those women who refuse\nWhere it job or the head scarf\nUh in public I'm refusing to where the headscarf is a crime that can land you in jail or in Iran and in fact that's precisely what's happened over the last\nYear when many women um refuse to wear their head scarf and public as a as a ... as a form of protest and they wind up in jail or other things that the uh us each a does as they try to prevent\nA let's say male female ... and I'm having a party where men and women are present together a can easily land you in jail\nAnd the CGI is one of the main forces responsible for ensuring that happens so hum this again is another dangerous uh organization I'm within the regime and it's particularly important role\nIn the religious enforcing the religious nor and stuff up the government\nAnd to judge as a woman named ... T the other one name ... say you say there are hanging judges that what they do what do they do today yeah\nThese two judges are among the most infamous judges or any Ron\nI'm they probably had a responsible for more um unjust sentences in the judiciary and the judicial system than probably I'm almost anyone else\nI'm ... I'm I think became particularly more well known in the west back in two thousand nine when he actually presided over the public trials of hundreds of Iranian protesters and since then\nUm you know he's continued to work and I mentioned but by the judiciary system earlier um this is a system where trials can often last minutes um uh lawyers are access to lawyers are limited for non existent and I'd also highlights ... because he is actually played a key role\nIn um sentencing\nA number of dual nationals I'm In Iran including several I'm\nIranian American citizens um the regime has a particular interest in capturing these people because for the obvious reason that regard that the United states has et cetera adversary\nAnd when an Iranian goes ahead and gets a un American citizenship that is obviously something that deeply troubles the regime so when these people come back home they often have a strong chance of getting arrested\nAnd in those cases hum they often get sent to a solid body um and\nThey get sent to him because they know the regime knows that he is going to deal with on a very harshly so when the river the regime wants to make an example of somebody or he's or go to guy and it usually doesn't disappoint them because these are folks that end up\nSpending a long time in prison or where they frequently face torture I'm at and\nOh and by the way I'm many much at the time um you often hear that these people have to confess to to their crimes are so to speak but in fact\nAs we know and as many prisoners have reported on these ... these concessions so called confessions are coerced under torture often um so when we hear about you know these ... that Iranians are committing a but they've done wrong to the regime do you have to ah keep in mind that\nAh it's likely about a confession that wasn't deliberate voluntarily\nMe document is profiles of Iranian repression we've\nWe've talked about nine of the twelve names there's also the minister of communication there is the man who's in charge of the prison other bad actors it's produced by the foundation for the defense of democracy I've been speaking with C Conn he's a senior Iran analyst there's a forward\nAbide the author as well Dr ...

it's a phase of\nThe early colonial history of New York that really until\nPerhaps more recently that I was in school anyway uh was was kind of a race from the textbooks race from consciousness uh and you know that's really one of the reasons I wrote this book was to restore our\nAh awareness so a lot of military history of New York city New York city area that are that we're on aware of or I forgotten\nHere come the Congress because in sixteen sixty four\n... king of England and his brother both lay claim to some of the territory that the Dutch have claimed to the north there is a treaty the Harper treated there is an invasion between New England and the Dutch here in New York\nHowever that doesn't satisfy a man named Nicholas shows up with a war fleet author of Fort Amsterdam\nThen directed by Peter ... but then he gives them an ultimatum ... might as well surrender and is that the end of the Dutch up with one little episode in future that's the end of the ... in Manhattan that moment right\nHanded after their endurance wise thing don't fight or overwhelming force\nThat is correct a ... and has a hard time coming to that conclusion because he is a real soldier he's he's a man who came up through the ranks of the Dutch west India company\nHe's he is Keith successor as governor basically director of the colony but he had fought the Spanish on behalf of the Dutch Caribbean prior to his arrival on Manhattan Island so he's a guy a real\nA real Marshall temperament he's very capable administrator a far far far more so than keep to men\nBut he does alter the face reality is that he's got a little for with a few hundred\nUh uh settlers a couple of hundred militia men and soldiers that he can he can muster and yet he's face is facing not only a flotilla of English a warships\nA manned by sailors and soldiers but he's also got the problem that if he looks across the river to the shore of ah where where really the Brooklyn Bridge is now today [noise] um he's got a whole he's facing a whole\nA mob of English farmers from the far reaches of Long Island who also on hand over the Dutch territory to ah to the king of England so he wisely as\nYou said a decides not to fight and a and from then forward a Dutch New Amsterdam becomes English New York there was a brief moment as you mentioned and sixteen Seventy three Seventy four the Dutch sale back in\nAnd take over again but then they handed back to the English during these negotiations and sixteen Seventy four so you end up having New York as a as a port city of the British Empire\nBritish Empire but the umpires now tangle for the next and sixteen eighty four to Seventeen sixty three a series of wars chiefly fought between the French\nAnd English and Spanish to get involved and they were always hanging on the side and the on the periphery of those but this is a transforming period for New York\nMentioning a William kid captain kid the pirates who sounds trinity church who is one of the ... name didn't trinity church is founding fathers and its Yangon London is the pirates is pirate ... is the New York a pirate haven\nAt the turn of the century about Seventy no one is this a place where bucket where private tears are welcome\nYes yes it's both buccaneers and private tears are welcome by the English authorities at that point and there's just there's just an important distinction between the two which sometimes got blurred buccaneers were pirates a plain and simple\nOut to prey on whatever cargo ship merchant ship you know showed on the horizon regardless of his nationality private tears were officially license to\nA a basically a pirates for war in other words their mandate was to sail forth for their given sovereign in this case it would be the king of England um to basically raid the cargo ships of the\nKing enemies in this case the French and the Spanish\nAnd the irony is that uh that that kid is originally licensed lean kid who was a Scott's men who settled in Manhattan\nIs there was originally a licensed by the British authorities to sail forth as a private tier\nI'm against the French enemy\nBut also to hunt down a pirate Seward preying on English ships but what happens is once he gets out in the Indian Ocean he faces a mutiny on the part of his crew and they all decided to turn pirate and that's the beginning of the legendary career I've kept in kid\nWho when he does show up back in a on the east coast of America having having already you know see dozens of English and and other European um\nCargo ships um has basically tricked into being arrested in Boston and then shipped back to ah to England for trial to hang um what was known as execution die on the Thames river in London\nUm but he's certainly one of the notorious New
