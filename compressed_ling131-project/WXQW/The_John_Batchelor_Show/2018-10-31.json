will be able to throw the election to Republicans is unbelievable\nI Want to answer that Steve by pointing to the old Cold War I've been reading you know I Do that a deal about Russia and our ... book the spy on the trader\nAh with Ben back mcentire this is the greatest that's been a story of the Cold War it's about a man who\nWas deep into the KGB the son of the KGB and he flipped to the ... six sometime in the Nineteen eighties and became the critical source for information of MIT fixed they didn't share it with the CIA his name was ...\nHe is now forever living an anonymously in Great Britain under a sentence of death from the old KGB no FSB but the reason I mentioned him\nIs that in Nineteen eighty three Margaret Thatcher was facing a critical\nReelection she was working a hand in glove with Ronald Reagan fighting the old Cold War and her opposite number in parliament was a very prominent labor politician named Michael ...\nWho was leading labor to a challenge died as Margaret Thatcher what I learned from the new book by Ben mcentire is that Michael Foot was an agent of the cage you beat they paid him for information for many years he was a KGB ...\nAs a labor leader\nHowever to twist here is they didn't tell Margaret Thatcher\nThat's right she went to the people and she won that race a dominant late Thirteen million votes to eight million for a foot labor party and seven million for the liberals\nShe won that without making that allegation they thought it best that they not trouble her because it would complicate the situation with garde asking it would complicate the old Cold War now\nSteve I present it as just an example of\nInterfere as Chris said but the interference by our side we decide we're going to interfere by not telling the leader of the British Parliament and a close ally of Ronald Reagan that she's being challenged by the KGB we didn't tell her\nAnd here we are in twenty I mean there's farce here are we what we need is a a what we need is a Broadway burlesque to ... to show that is\nWhat we have in twenty sixteen is an allegation were all they do is tell Donald Trump all they do is tell Mrs Clinton she tells Donald Trump details Hillary Clinton\nAnd there's no evidence adds up right tonight there's no evidence that anything's real it's completely made up there's the irony of the old Cold War versus the new Cold War when it really mattered they kept mum when it doesn't matter they chatter away\nWhat struck me I didn't know the story about Michael Foot but I remember him very well as the leader of the Labour Party at that time what strikes me is is that they they knew about sport as a fact\nYeah and they kept they kept it from the political leadership yes in the case of Trump it was all whispers in shadows no evidence has ever been produced two and a half years later that the Kremlin had any old compromise or or anything on Trump and yet [noise]\nWhoever started this story I think we know what started in the CIA I did what Brennan\nShow it was the intelligence agencies you're right the first thing they did was Bob it as much as they could because I thought it would damage Trump's campaign then you're also right that Mrs Clinton actually said in the debate I think it was August the third debate\nIn two thousand sixteen she actually said to debate the Trump was a puppet of the Kremlin which is essentially in Asia and there were such articles in the New York times by so called retired CIA agents literally accusing Trump\nOf being recruited agent of the criminal so the reaction was completely different\nUh ... was a factor I guess in the case of what was kept a secret what was something made up I think about Trump was Blair and everywhere they can get a TV camera on them or a newspaper to permit so I don't know this is a sign of different times or different kinds of people who are\nWhat I learned from this is in a democracy people believe the conspiracy of the moment if they want to there are still people in the United kingdom Ben Macintosh told me that when we talked about his book\nAnd because he revealed that fact again it was not unknown but he ... he emphasized that again there are still members of labor party who deny this road who say it's not true it's made opposite if some story plot\nMore says Thirty years later so thirty five years from now we'll turn

able to attach a robot\nOr or an engine to it to de orbited or to raise it saw that in order to do that they've got to have it under some kind of control and that means I going to need at least one gyroscope functioning\nUntil ... limited life huddled right now the next gyroscope that goes it's going to be on its way out this is a tragic thing and we do not have a replacement for Hubble unfortunately none at all I had a lot of interesting comments on my website about suggestion a robot mission even a manned mission to\nFix the gyroscope server place for the Hubble and actually one of those ideas as possible we have the technology to above robot mission to do this now they were looking at it a decade ago it was too soon now the technology and software exist to do a robot mission to replace those gyros\nYou could also do possibly a manned mission using our dragon capsule and sickness I'm\nA cargo Marshall together or to bring up a quick comment\nAnd a docking part and then maybe even a quickly made a robot arm to grapple Hubble and maybe do this by mad\nThat would be more ambitious I think but either way this is something that\nNASA should look into there's no reason why we called the Bob\nCould could we moved to a place where ... ... to a private enterprise that can fix it and then monetize ...\nThat's an interesting idea that would be that that's another option that would require the Trump Administration taking very different approach they haven't yet that that would understand the concepts of private enterprise more than I think the Trump Administration and said\nI was always there for perpetuity we can't remove the possibility that a future government would understand that monetize ... which is a miracle machine is good for the federal government and good for Hubble\nAbsolutely right I personally think that a private company maybe stay sex maybe ... mosque should say hey I'll save this telescope for the public relations purposes and they can put something together and make it happen and I really think that would be a good thing\nI said this to the University of the mayor of this is a telescope that will not die every decade someone's come along to try to kill it and every decade the want to try to kill it ended up to become becoming a boost for the telescope and where to situation now where\nAre we going to start facing the orbiting telescope and I think when that happens they're going to say well why do you why don't we just said the robot up to fix it fry that's where we'll come\nAs a job curiosity again we had we had moments of anxiety about curiosity because they're a main computer and its backup computer were behaving unusually by Bob says things are restored Bob back better than ever\nYou know I wouldn't say better than ever ... this is breaking news that no one else has covered yet to go that fast and sent out a press release and most modern journalists today wait for the press release but I'd track\nThe actual images and the stuff coming from the science community\nAnd the science team has made it clear that blog that they're in the process this week of resume and soulful science operations and if you look at the wrong image is I have links to both by the way on behind the black you can see that in the last week they started to send down lots of images\nFrom multiple cameras every day that's something that haven't done in six weeks so it's very clear that they've got the computers um\nIn a working in a manner that they're satisfied and they're proceeding to download data again\nUm they have not yet released a detailed description outlying why it took so long to get the second computer up and running\nAnd what are what they're doing if anything to repay the computer that produce the problems in ... in the last month it would be really good if they could get the secondary computer I'm working again so that they have a backup because both of these computers had problems over the life of the mission now and\nThen the on the computers of the rovers got so we would love to have both of them in a good shape so we'll have to wait for that press release it hasn't come yet\nAnd they're going back to drilling Bob is that what they had\nAnd we I'm not sure what they're going to do next I mean the original plan was not to drill at this location but to stop moving out off of air Ruben region of the mountains but one of the things they discovered on getting new images\nAre at the site they've been sitting there for so long which was a drill side by the way is that all the dust that had been scaring the ground in the interim blew away\nI'm not sure why this was this all occurred after the ... the storm it occurred so it wasn't wasn't this'll be the dust on that but it was wins and saw the ground is clear\nAll the all the dust from the drill hole so blow away so they're looking at the ground again and say listen to this so we don't know what they're going to do next to long term plan is clearly pop up the mountain and that's not too far a few\nTime looking at the front has camp and what you see is recognizable um earth plot a landscape here Bob\nIt looks like they're sand in very small grains a rock in between larger boulders or larger rocks that are peaking through so that the dots that you say blow away to reveal these uh these these folders\nHere Ruben rejects you'll remember John and it's shown it and many images since I got up to the top is kind of like\nUm [noise] it's a plateau that uh has like he's flatter boulders everywhere crack with space Dustin between till you're driving over almost like a a an uneven rock pavement flat rock pavement\nAnd so the bus blows away and you can see those rocks better and those rocks have been very hard they have not been able to speak to any of them very well and they really would like to get a drill off from the top of the ridge but they haven't found one that can do it yet so we'll just have to see how it goes next year\nBoy does that look like the bottom of something that water on it could also be wind erosion I understand All right we go to ... what is Parker\nParker Parker solar probe is on its way into an orbit of the sun it's going to orbit the sun multiple times over the next decade um cut get very close to the sun to observe the sun well it was only last the summer\nIs now set this week has set new to new space records the first it's and it's now gotten close to the sun than any other spacecraft has\nIts within twenty six million miles of the sun's surface\nWhich requires a lot of protection from heat because even a twenty six million miles you get hooked\nAnd the second thing is is this week it is now ... is now moving the fastest of any space craft we've ever launched traveling at a hundred and fifty three thousand two hundred and fifty three thousand miles per hour or more than that that was the previous record set in Seventy six by he Leo's too which is another cell the pro\nThese are all will only just begun because it's every orbit is going to get closer to the sun as it flies in and every all that will mean it'll be going faster as it flies in the past ...\nAnd

colleague inclined he's the bureau chief for Breitbart truthful now doing investigative reporting in the race for the governorship in Florida posing Ron dissent just Congressman Ron dissent is\nAgainst mayor Andrew Gillum hour and a very good evening to you I read in your most recent report at Breitbart that Andrew Gillum has an unusual background in preparation to be a political speaker\nOr he has works and continued to work until twenty Seventeen with an organization that is identified the problem with the United states the last two hundred and forty years apparently it's predatory capitalism and Christian had Gemini what the heck is he talking about good evening to Aaron\nGood evening yeah this is actually a really significant story because until now\nUm there's been another group with which he has been associated and you and I have talked about it repeatedly\nAnd it's called ... defenders right which is there an anti Israel patriotic and I believe and military organization um and I reported on Gillum as close association with dreams offenders how he signed a radical pledge that called for the about Schmidt of the police\nUm and how he's written in support of this group how we ate it their activism\nAnd he has been as numerous times publicly by one does you know just the latest was actually in an interview with me twenty four hours ago um but many times including the debate Gillum has been asked to disavow this group and we've all been wondering why hasn't done so\nSo now and I can't believe I only found this in the last forty eight hours because I've been investigating Gillum for quite some time but it turns out that Gillum\nFor openly from two thousand and chew into last year when he announced he was about to announce his running for governor of Florida\nHe was the director of youth organization that first of all radical training youth organization that train dream defenders train be founders of dream defenders first of all they graduated from his training organization so that's ... first why apparently it's not this value them\nBut that we were we took a closer look at this group I'm it's at this ... finance people for the American away\nUm and he he served as he served as youth director\nUm your leadership program to recruit from two thousand five to two thousand and Seventeen were oversaw ... organization called the young people for\nWhy pay for it when I say over so I mean while he was mayor of Tallahassee he was paid by people for American way as a paid director and he was very hands on a we look at the website and his bio and his picture is right there at the top\nOf the staff directory and we find announcements where he did hires a headline fundraisers so he's working basically part time for this group is the mayor\nOf Atlanta turns out that his group and we went through the archives of it to their website well Gillum was there\nIt has radical but more radical as during the defenders I look at the rhetoric here and I'm quoting here um their mission is court to challenge us\nPredatory capitalism they want to abolish the president of system just like dream defenders they want to fight quote a spiritual resistance against\nA Christian hedge him on anything you want to read the fine the American borders um collective liberation them um they accuse us of being a quote colonialist power\nUm purpose a perpetrating quote structural violence and continued genocide um they claim that us judicial system as quote justifying white supremacist policing practices and I can go on this is the highlights so\nIt really this rhetoric mirrors the group that he has been trying to distance himself from dream defenders only know Gillum was in charge of this group this was his organization up and I think we are just scratching the surface of of his radicalism\nI'm reading from the statements from I guess their website right this is a these are statements of their mission is breathtakingly try\nAt the same time he suggests that he is he is again what he's now running for which is the constitution of the United states in the state of Florida it's peculiar has he come out in any fashion and explained how he's done off one eighty in order to be the governor of Florida if he is\nWell not yet this is just came out but I saw her dream defenders actually retweeted at so thank you dream defenders for that um and by the way I'm going to be in Miami's shortly where I'm going to try and go I enter your dream defenders let's see how that goes but ... it's not just with this Gillum\nHas claimed that nobody paid for any of his trips he says he doesn't need it and we're finding actually people for the American way this group sent him to New York on the very weekend where he is strangely obtain that Hamilton ticket a two thousand and six team that's\nBeen part of the debate puzzle right that he wouldn't that be Gillum is not offered an adequate explanation for his funding\nEven while the trip had two undercover FBI agents and that they took it originated with them but but he was saying you know nobody pays for his wife\nWell this group pay for his way their statements about um the undercover agent and a and a a a lobbyist from Florida who actually got a to point one million dollar contract from Columbus city\nAnd who pays for different trips here and there\nUm so he he's kind of trying to have it both ways but he also he claims he didn't say certain things that he said I'm he talks about not having Medicare for all he actually when he said uh we we've documented he changed a lot of his rhetoric\nIn order to in order to run for president sorry for for governor and this kind of reminds me of rock Obama where\nHe and the early days of his career was so associated with anti American radicals anti Israel radicals on them runs for president on on suddenly a centrist platform and it's the same here with the Gillum he's made a statement against moving the embassy the U.S embassy to Jerusalem\nEyes rated very strange statements about the Gaza Strip and claims that Israel is using rocketing from Gaza to justify attacks against the Palestinians\nAre and now we finally he Gillum training and the founder of dreamed offenders which boycott Israel and he's claiming on the other hand that he doesn't support the boycott of Israel and that is pro Israel\nHe's giving speeches and synagogues and at least one synagogue wearing a yarmulke I keep on and talking about how much he loves Israel so a lot of questions about who is the real Andrew Gillum here is he the centrist or is he the founder which I found he is of this organization\n[noise] listening to Shaun bachelor show exclusively on your\n[noise]\nOver in writing\nMuch of the
