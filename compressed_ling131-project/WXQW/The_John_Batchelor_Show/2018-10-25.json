of topics and points that\nYou make it our our typical ingredients of what is taking place in the destruction of Europe and fortunately we in the U.S are just mere in that image and I I Believe that uh\nThat what we're seeing happen in this country is just a um\n[noise] it just what they're seeing\nTaking place in Europe as far as the the uh what they call them they know that they're they're ... they're um uh people coming from the Syria ban and all these regions that are going to war\nAnd uh [noise] we have the need and that is destroying everything and has their opinion and agenda and they have in Europe the EU which people that are wearing suits but not appointed by anybody they're dictating what's going on mhm and I find very interesting aside and I don't know if I can share it on the air with you\nWhile let's not but uh you make you make some interesting points there and um [noise] and you're probably\nNot aware of this but you're quite right in this or to the extent the progressive movement a reaches to its philosopher kings in your roof so and ... and ... among others\nAnd also you know in in certain respects the signing of this nation reaches back into your\n... to skew in Sydney and and others that also of course I ever started on ... but but the point is these are really two different ways of looking at humanity\nOne looks humanity one individual at a time that's where we come from you and I mean one individual at a time individuals have merit individuals have value individuals have worth\nTheir God given God given God created and then there's another view\nIs to look at the whole community and if people are stepping out and they're not doing what they are expected to do for the better good well then those people need to be addressed and dealt with\nAnd of course what happens here is a relative handful of individuals when compared to the overall population determine what is good for the community whether it's good to the community or not\nAnd this is where you get in trouble you get into these various ideologies and theories and obstructions in which I'm a relative handful of individuals seek to impose their will and the all of society and to destroy man's nature\nAnd so the individual is only as good as the individual is willing to surrender his or her individuality to the greater good to the state because conformity and uniformity our priorities their primary\nNow are viewed doesn't have it that way conformity in uniform and he does not the priority as much liberty for an individual that as possible and in order to society and moral ordered society that's our model\nAnd so you want in addition to that an economic system that is competitive that his market oriented that is relatively voluntary and so forth and so on as opposed to this constant central is Asian the government\nPower uh but that is essentially seized by an elected individuals and they will that has imposed on you rather than exercising your own will you can see this now your point on the immigration from\nThe vast majority of Americans don't want what's taking place on the southern border\nThe vast majority of Americans do want the southern border security even those who are fairly liberal and the issue of immigration\nBut you have a political party and leadership and a political party that believes it must change the population it must change the electorate it must change the citizenry in order to have as close as possible a permanent hold on power\nAnd that's exactly what's taking place here that's what Merkel did in Germany that's what's taking place and the people don't have a right to come to the United states of America they don't have a right to come here at all they're not even covered by our constitution\nIt's the people in this country who have rights and have the right to make these determinations and so um I agree with you to that extent that\nWhat's happening here on the American left as they've taken the European left the progressive left both of which are progeny of ah of haggling Marx and ... and the and the Russo and others are and that's the that's the road they've taken as opposed to the road we've taken

should mum\nFaces cordless Troy ... her and I\nLearned a cigarette and ministers go peacefully\nFor more than pressure I have from conversations there is that they very much welcome the demonstration of American commitment to the region\nOr the the demonstration of American commitment to respond to what they see as\nA relatively accelerated pace of provocations from China or made the developments in the south China Sea as you noted are have been really a quite aggressive in recent years and there's been on certainly the in East Asia and Taiwan included\nAbout whether America would do something about it so I think this has been helpful and reassuring goes who bought the line that the Trump Administration was very transactional on trade and might be ignoring South China sea and China's territorial aggression\nSteve is there a concern in Taipei about a miscalculation or accident that could lead to an escalation and these episodes where warships traveling at high speeds on the open seas could\nSo understand or miss direct like that incident with the Decatur\n[noise] well I think the answer is yes but mostly military circles I find that concern that the greatest military circles in Taiwan but also a military circles new to us so and Pacific command particular they will also have\nSomewhat of a concern about miscalculation on the Chinese part and we've lived with some of these miscalculations in the not too distant asked to in terms of the air maneuvers that led to the the tree crisis in the early Bush administration and some of the\nMachine based confrontations we have but in Taiwan generally I think the biggest concern is that the U.S becomes either distracted by er an amber with its dealings with China and Taiwan just becomes a pond that is lost in that match\nGordon the you know if you go back in the last year which first year of the Trump Administration um you get a sense that the president and the national security team around him in Washington really weren't quite sure what to do with China and it did look at some points that they were willing to do with China over a number of things including North Korea\nThis year um there's a very different tone that I sent and you're in Washington and I'm not [laughter]\nBut I I get a sense that the administration decided that it is going to disengage from China and obviously that has implications for Taiwan I mean do you read in the mood in Washington the same way or do you see in somewhat different tones\nOh I think there's contending views in Washington and within the administration to a degree of president seems very clear that he is simultaneously open to a deal but very sperm on trying to reset the context in which that deal with the may\nAnd certainly in the run up to the ... the mid term election and probably his reelection at twenty twenty\nI Would put a very low the odds of some kind of a grand deal on trade or security ... have you but as you know he has set an intention to consider another meeting with Kim Jong un and the north Korean negotiations could go and very unpredictable ways\nBut for the most part I think Washington was very much in the warm bath of conventional thinking on China for so long that it's been unsettled by what I was\nI think articulated by vice president Pence of the kind of bill of particulars of the many ways China has upset the status quo and the administration's determinations or respond\nBut they haven't really detail how they'll respond and that seems to be to talk of Washington now\nI Do not recall the Obama administration or the or the Bush administration sending two warships and so the Taiwan Strait for sixteen hours perhaps you can recall for me but does this mean that the Trump Administration is seeking to embrace the defense of Taiwan\nWell I think that Secretary Mattis has been very very clear about the deterrent message he has conveyed I think you're right in terms of the precedent in terms of uh as as far as the trend that the battalion straight go in close proximity\nBy but this I think has more to do with freedom of navigation and the claims in the south China Sea than it does just the Taiwan Strait\nBut and there are strong thing said going back to the ... some confirmation hearing and the amount of affirmation hearing\nAbout the south China Sea and this is the first time we've seen I think a systemic and to liberate brushed back of the Chinese and it happens to be the Taiwan Strait but I think it meant more broadly as a signal that China not just\nTheir Gordon one more question Steve what is going to be the ultimate test of relations between Washington in Taipei what are you looking for\nIn terms of of how these two capitals work together are we going to be closer are we going to be farther apart let's say six months from now [noise]\nWe should be closer together and I think it's actually a time of strategic opportunity for Taipei a while there's trade friction and maybe some military question going on in the U.S China relationship to put forward bold positive proposals of things that would be good for America and good for Taiwan on trade and the facts\nAnd so I think at the time of opportunity they have their local election their version of midterms at the end of November and one spot beyond that distraction hopefully presidents die and her team go bowl [noise]\nStephen ...

W execute W [noise]\n\nI'm John Donvan and this is the John ... family mom what\nIs the family office yes it is associated with wealth and why we care about wealth is that that's where the jobs come from the wealthy people put their money to work\nAnd that creates the conditions for the rest of us to work I welcome Denny ... Denny is going to tell me what a family offices here in the twenty first century been through changes since John Rockefeller put together the first family office a hundred years ago I learn from the books but Denny's going to put us to work\nToday in the United states and around the world for family offices which are changing guinea a very good evening to you thank you and welcome\nCindy family office according to the dictionary is one well to do family\nThat hires who hire people to manage their accounts they're ill liquid and liquid assets and to look out for future generations has it changed so much since John Rockefeller good evening to you thank you\nThank you for having me um I think it hasn't changed in in in in the idea for somebody else is really it's having neutral people work for you and have\nNo other incentive botch your goals to take care of your financial needs of your legal needs of your children as a school of state funding taking care of your future of the inheritance\nAnd again the important thing is done by us so they are only working for you they're not getting paid as opposed to ... in\nA bank or a private equity firm that's going to take it sees no matter what you have\nTeam of people who only ... concern themselves with your assets right they cost you\nObviously you pay them a salary but they are non biased when I'm working with a private banker I'm going to end up with some products that may not be the best thing for me because he sells them to me because it's getting a commission for instance\nYou're DC in D.C Hi and finance dot com is the website what can you do for people who are well to do and want to know whether the family offices for them what would you tell them if they contact you with us through the website [noise]\nWell we do we do gatherings we do conferences that are held in a New York Miami used in Dallas Toronto London in Israel where we're from which is interesting and I can talk about it later [noise]\nUm or they there's no media by the way you know a a Wall Street journal anyone like that are covering it blows to the press is the way we see in that sense yeah we we do they feel more comfortable when they're not you know pictures taking these spoke to that and stuff like that\nI'm a generalist myself whether I'm an ex tendencies to cover Wall Street for global sneakers and to the wall Street Journal and Israel\nAnd um they learn in a private setting about lots of different topics from investments to a state spending philanthropy for instance in Dallas this week or next week we have a a very well for somebody to talking about marrying into money not think how sensitive that topic is she brings her husband\nAnd she's one of the wealthiest families in Dallas and she's going to talk about the challenges he had marrying into money and what comes with it\nAnd both of them are going to talk about it seems from these angle and she's from her so when you have a private setting and you hear about both in the afternoons and other topics that are very sensitive you your your child's future you know addiction is one of the biggest problems for our diction suicides so the\nThe very serious topics at ten year the keeps these guys awake at night and when they hear about that from professional people from their peers data sharing that with them and they get to network with one another to investigate her own which is a different topic I can talk about that is what they actually want\nTo arrive now family offices can come to you for these conferences people who want to know what to do with their money that they will do they need a family office did they need a private bank or the bankers I'm going to let them go easily after all they've got this enormous amount of money right so you would offer the difference between a family office\nAnd it private bank or or a private equity firm let's quickly to find that what's a level of for profit\nTalk for a for a family office to work what level of of well\nSo that different levels in different places I Would say roughly in many would argue about that but probably north of a hundred million dollars is a single ... single family which means is that like you hear like the ... it's a single a group of people that fourth only for you in that if my name is gates I have a family right right right\nAnd then I Would say between ten to a hundred maybe twenty two hundred is behind that individuals\nUh I like the old China with some of the tend to think of themselves and they would normally worked with a move that from a\nMulti family office which works the same way but it's a group of unrelated people who have a team working for them\nRight they work with different families that don't it doesn't justify for them to to hire an entire teen by themselves\nThe family offices are extremely desirable I read from the point of view of IPO's or start ups Israel is a start up nation the U.S here has a few start ups every once in a while our family offices attracted to start a\nVery very much so these guys are open minded they are like institutional investors says your investor needs to return the money some points so that's a problem they cannot invest after a certain point\nThey cannot think that's just smaller companies they have a lot of liability than a lot of rules within that they need to operate in somebody else's and don't and the beautiful thing about some of the ...\nI can come to you right now and put your glasses on you and tell you even though you don't do anything and we are in virtual reality\nPut those basses on you until you these are the future and this is what the future you may falling in love with each right now which is called by the way a emotional investment like they do with the art sometimes and you can come to your father or your mother or whatever and say listen we got to be involved in this thing\nThe only ones that can make decisions that data family officer so I think they love the clergy you see that they invest heavily into gold you to diversify the risks and they love the adventure they love to look at different kinds of tech related investments absolutely\nThe concern I have about family offices and where they are going now is the difference between here in New York and in Israel and in Europe I hear they're different tax structure of DNA I hear that around the world you have to know what you're doing to pick our people attracted to the U.S version of a family office as opposed to a European\nIt's a good question I think Europe is Mm all around the place you know you have so many different cultures which is also a problem is probably number one\nCulture wise they don't always seem to saying that don't agree\nAnd taxation then they come from different countries are different rules that makes it very hard for the call invest going vast meaning I Will instead of going to a fund our come to another family that he does real estate and I don't do it is said and that will join them and the roost in investment and they will join me what I'm good at that say to college\nAnd then we'll take the middleman out and it's just us and we have the same objective so in Europe I think it's it's way more problematic because of what I've just mentioned well the U.S these huge and people who came from the same place so pointless things way easier here than there so that's one of the major differences between the U.S and Europe we\nHad a crisis ten years ago the financial crisis that swept the earth I've chiefly real estate failure in the United states do all of that laws were changed job and I'm taking chiefly of Dodd Frank\nNow that we have this this this invasion marching through Mexico marching inexorably toward our southern border the president has now said that he is prepared to deploy the military to seal the border to prevent this invasion from entering this raises a really profound\nQuestion John that has so far been unanswered when does the mob of foreigners used to storm our border\nBecome an invading army that within justify military action to retell it we don't have an answer to that question get there is going to be a showdown because the president is serious about feeling the border and not allowing these people it will he authorized the use of lethal force what I what is going to happen when this\nCaravan did this army of invaders get to the border we don't know that yet but we are now in an era\nOf mob and this is what my column in the Washington Times about tomorrow because I call it Trump calls the bluff with the left wing mobbed [laughter] this caravan\nIs the latest mob but it's also the biggest of them all but we are now being bombarded by left wing ... every where we look for in the Senate confirmation vote of Brett Kavanaugh\nCute social media to antifa mobs roaming our city streets to progressive gangs hounded elected officials where they live work and dined vandalizing their offices and of course the biggest most most powerful mop\nUp the ball is the media it's a virtual mob especially when it gangs up with entities like Facebook Google Twitter so we're looking at Bob\nAnd especially left wing mobs in every direction the president of the United states is doing his best John to fend off and I think when you're seeing the momentum move at a lot of these key races toward Republicans it's because conservatives Republicans and independents and\nDisaffected Democrats are all responding to the onslaught against this country\nThe mention of democratic Bob's takes me to my youth Monica always happy journey and Nineteen sixty eight August I'm Nineteen sixty eight which was a tumultuous months in world affairs the Soviets moved against\nUh Prague against ... surprising everyone a Vietnam was collapsing around the Johnson administration the peace talks were going nowhere in Paris\nAnd in Chicago a very large contingent of democratic activists we now call them progress as a child were charge by the ... by the Chicago police and Mayor Daley was screaming at the podium in the Chicago convention hall during the nomination of a ... a Hubert Humphrey for ... president of the United\nStates that wrecked the Democratic power so much so that Richard Nixon your mental was elected ever since then Monica the Democrats have not been happy about those events and have talked about how they never want that to happen again so how do we get here Monica\nHaving sworn it often sixty eight why do we see these demonstrations in twenty Eighteen to they have no memory\nWell they haven't worn it off and I write extensively about this in my column coming tomorrow and the Washington Times John So thank you for giving me a chance to talk about it I write about how in the Nineteen sixties\nToo radical left wing professors Richard Klein Howard and France's Fox in argued for reading the transition to socialism\nBy overwhelming and then collapsing the social welfare system a few years after that ... the radical revolutionary talked about destroying the capitalist democratic order by what ... humiliation mockery and me years and yet mob\nSense forward John to the great recession you went to hundreds of union it other thugs descending bankers home [laughter] then after that you had the Occupy Wall Street mobs out there in the city streets committing violent crime and trafficking illegal drugs desiccated on police cars\nIs what the radical far left does they manufacture may had designed to advance the progressive agenda but what they fail to understand or maybe they just don't care is that the United states is still a center right country and when these things happen as they are now\nWell you get a backlash because they're great silent majority is ready to put it down get again as it did in twenty sixteen and as it did yes in Nineteen sixty eight by like ...

Bach the Armenia and\nAzerbaijan tangles since the late twentieth century and the end of the Soviet Union that is not resolved I welcome professor Brenda Shafer at the center for Eurasian Russian and Eastern European studies at Georgetown University Brenda a very good evening to you Mr\nBolton statement following the meeting with the leadership in Baku says that the U.S is committed to a peaceful settlement\nIs that consistent with what we know about Armenia is still not acknowledging some of the steps that were ... were lined were line many years ago\nAnd have not been moved on also we know that Armenia ... is a very close working partnership with Russia also\nWe know that the new prime minister of Armenia met most recently with Rouhani and the discussion wasn't about\nAre going to Disneyland it was about the Iranian sanctions so Mr boldness intention for a peaceful settlement but is this all wrapped up in Iran and Russia and the enmity between the United states and those countries good evening to\nCut in India and well actually you needed to lay out all this complicated Web about about the health club because it's because the fact that it is a meeting physical meeting ground of Iran and turkey and Russia\nIs why this ... region is of such importance and despite it geographically sensuality a as a meeting ground between again like Europe and Asia\nUh all bordering turkey Iran and Russia um there have been very few high level us visits in the past decade or to the region so it's very a welcome that that uh John Bolton it chose to visit this house caucuses the three countries at the south er Cox isn't that\nThe last visit ties are by John By senior cabinet level official was the secretary of the navy in two thousand Fifteen and before that a Secretary Clinton you know the only really to senior visits over\nA decade but this was very different in the Nineteen nineties you know us secretary of state a\n... a senior military officials in to the region the U.S had a president in the U.S as part of the game and it's very nice to see a John Bolton returning to the region and and I think it's an important message in the in that respect that the U.S has a back\nIs he therefore around and see their for Russia as the there for ... you and I both visited is farmland that it's been abandoned because of the fighting the Armenians or at the front line they show routinely there's\nHarassment fire there are casualties now and again certainly there are a threat along the front line they blocked the river to deprive water to the farm land so is he there just settled that or is he there to worry about Iran sanctions and Russia interference\nWell actually John I think all these issues are are interconnected because what's Russia's main will ever to control the ... the Caucasus region and other regions like Ukraine and like most of that\nIs actually the conflicts he'll decay is actually you know if you take Nicole ... it was you know Ninety thousand uh Armenians inside a Azerbaijan\nA I've had the ... the chef something similar a hundred and twenty out of the highest Ninety thousand South Asians these were not\nRegional wars these what these were you know almost village a conflict since Russia really turn them into a regional war is because it's a very good a lever\nThing that I Hope John Bolton would be very different than most of its us predecessors said us efforts have ... and conflict resolution of tend to focus on Iran ... cook you know getting the two sides together to top to agree it's really not about you're unemployed cool it's really honestly about Moscow and and and Washington and that\nUh you know with our understanding how Russia uses his conflict or to hold the region hostage on it'll be very difficult to as all that and I think another point you brought up the ... really relevant is that\nUm I think I mean it needs to acknowledge it is the co presidents and the gonna Carl boss places diplomatic game which says well there's Armenia and there's the you know ... ... car law forces as if it's some separate entity and I think it's not\nReally a way that build any confidence to solve the conflict you know your I've been I've been to the region you know there's I mean in soldiers serving their the previous two presidents have I mean you are actually from the gonna curl up\nAh I'm Armenian citizens serve in the military and in the region a you know ... to say they're not there would be if Israel said you know we're not in the west bank that's like local today and forces now if it's something\nA four and so I think I think it's also important that are that Armenia ... you know come clean and recognizes its own presence in this region\nWe have news or you mention Israel the commanding general of the ... of the republic of Azerbaijan forces visiting in Israel for the first time I visited with the Azerbaijan forces earlier this year\nAnd I saw a lot of first rate Israeli equipment I heard over the years that as about John and Israel worked together chiefly ... that's the benefit of Israel when and if there is need to use basing in ... north of Iran\nHowever it is to just that there's more of a a developing relationship for arms and training\n[laughter] yeah I think you know many you know media and sometimes foreign officials\nI'm a talk about the relationship between Azerbaijan and Israel's if it's time you know marriage of convenience as if it's just about well interest but you know because as your by Shonda Shia Muslim and and and Israel is predominantly\nA Jewish that for some reason there would be some attraction to their relations but I think it's exactly the opposite I think that that there's there there is um ... this whole region has nothing as we discussed a in a in a previous discussion between that\nHas nothing to do with with a religion just like\nIran and Armenia have very close you know relations when you know our Armenians occupies territory that lead to you know nine hundred thousand or she Azerbaijan needs to become refugees it doesn't bother the Islamic republic of Iran the same thing there is zero anti Israel sentiments in Azerbaijan\nI visit there frequently I'd see ... you know probably the Jewish person I feel more welcome in Azerbaijan than I Do in most places in in in Europe\nUm ... and again this is actually it's kind of interesting because they were to not only is this the first is the chief of staff of a chip on in Israel but the last major visit of a senior antibody Johnny official was may fourteenth does it does that date say anything to John\nYes may fourteen that was made for team that was during a conflict I Can't recall what was the ...\nYeah it was actually the hope that this didn't two thousand and Eighteen it was the opening of the U.S embassy\nAll right here in Jerusalem and Jerusalem I was going the wrong way I sought some something was happening in Baku yeah yeah\nSo it's actually you know the inter inter governmental commission between Azerbaijan and Israel met for the first time in Jerusalem when the U.S embassy was being open and you know and basically the whole Muslim world was a a a boycotting and up in arms\nThe U.S is extremely uncomfortable because we've got military at risk Ken the Saudis be\nCan can this moment this moment where the Saudis are vulnerable cannot be used to calm this feud\n[noise] I think it can and I think it should be a again here the Saudi ambassador ambition was to get tough with the galleries or they had the galleries were supporting terrorism and we're too close to Iran they issued a long list of demands slapped on the embargo\nUm Doha did not in fact meet and those demands that survived the embargo um but because of the interruption of economic linkages as trend in part to Iran and so the relationship between gutter and Iran is far more now than it was before the embargo began\nFrom an American perspective still largest US military base in the region as in gutter and of course the Saudis and ... and others are our security partners as well and so now we have partners on each side of this fragment of Jaycee block which doesn't make life easy\nFor us and so a really as I think a State Department spokesman spokesperson said was a view of my ... Iran has emerged as the beneficiary of of the state of affairs here\nTo Iran is now entered into this they're watching the show gee tragedy and in the essay an unexpected benefit for them\n... you know the Iranians have been\nA notably silent\nAnd and this and uh you know in American domestic politics there's the rule of thumb that if your opponent is in the process of destroying himself or his reputation don't get those wages keep your mouth shut and watch\nAnd toaster good fortune and unfortunately I think that's where the Iranians are today because they look at a not just the division between the United states and Saudi Arabia is likely to um create but the empowerment\nOf turkey I'm the sort of moral diminish meant of Saudi Arabia the degree to which this has made business and\nUh and governments around the world less inclined to work with a and cooperate with Saudi Arabia and from the Iranian perspective that's all good news and they didn't have to do anything to achieve that\nNext on the last down this is more difficult to the bus a Hariri the prime minister the son of the slain prime minister was for a time in Riyadh and the question was was he there on his own free will the Saudi Arabians they're not saying he's free to come and go he's just vacationing\nBut when you mentioned Hariri you are plunged into Lebanon and\nSyria what are the Saudis up to in Beirut ... what is their party at Richard so\nA year ago the Saudis um concluded that they did not like the fact that uh has blah who's a sponsor of courses or Iran\nOr within coalition government with Saad Hariri the prime minister loving on a and that they wanted to try to marginalize a has lost political influence on their by ... deal set back to Iran\nAgain a not a bad ambition um but it backfired ah they lured a Saad Hariri to this to Saudi Arabia a forced him under obvious dress to resigned his position as prime minister on Saudi TV\nFor explanation although he was required to end did blame Iran um\nBut the result of this was it didn't hold and within a matter of weeks later he was back having rescinded his resignation he still prime minister and it had the effect of actually increasing the political support for Hezbollah rather than decreasing it so it was one more\nUm kick in the counter productive column\nYou mentioned Israel as a\nPlus because Israel and Saudi Arabia has moved very close together these last years and ... center of that ... but I see that the Israelis are very worried about ...\nBecause having moved so far with Saudi Arabia they're concerned about losing it uh you also mentioned a positive that the Saudis were ready to back us up in the event the\nIran sanctions or damage the world's supply of oil especially if our European allies are both those positive now at risk Richard\nI Would say that the positive with respect Israel is at some risk in the sense that\nUm ... for the Israelis as for the United states the Saudis or a less valuable\nStrategic partner if you could call it that um than they were before the strategy a murder given the program that's been directed toward Riyadh ah I think the oil is a different matter I think that the Saudis\nAh it's it's theoretically possible that they would react to any pressure the world puts on them or with such anger that they would reduce their oil exports and not make up for the reduction and Iranian exports of crude and so forth but of course that would cost them economically precisely at the moment ah when they have a big\nPlan to grow and diversify the economy I'm not so they won't do it but I think it's unlikely\nUm but uh but what you said ... also points to you know the potential kinds of upside sit there are in this relationship which is why I say don't just get rid of the thing let's modify its terms um they have\nTo stop their previous hostility toward Israel they are helpful when it comes to pressure on Iran and certainly our counterterrorism intelligence cooperation other things as well\nThe concern here is how to go forward and this is a tabletop exercise it's almost like a game of risk and what you're trying to reestablish relationships after\nUh after you see conflict between South America and Africa for example do what he is adequate you mentioned the global Magnitsky Act I also had conversation talking about\nUh the convention on torture the possibility of the international criminal court getting involved is that\nIs that imaginable that the U.S would go along with a criminal charge against people in Saudi Arabia\nWill certainly not to the international criminal court I mean the Trump Administration and John Bolton the national security measure have made clear that they would like to de legitimize the international criminal court and my understanding is that Saudi Arabia doesn't recognize us jurisdiction anyway so I don't think that's\nAn Avon you the the global Magnitsky sanctions would be sanctions economic sanctions target financial measures visa bans things like that that are directed at the perpetrators in that I think will happen I'm just in the past Eighteen hours or show I think the secretary of state telegraphed as much\nUm about the broader question of beyond punishing those who are are immediately responsible or as far up the chain as you can determine are responsible\nAh what do you do about the relationship more broadly and here I where I come down is that the unity of measures are are you know to some degree necessary but they're certainly not sufficient ... this is an opportunity and to reset some aspects of the relationship between the United states and Saudi Arabia\nAnd to try to move them in a more constructive\nDirection so that they're not engaged in a kind of caught productive uh actions that I describe it instead of a you know use this as a wake up call to try to wind down some of the things particularly the war in Yemen\nRichard Fontaine is president of the center for new
