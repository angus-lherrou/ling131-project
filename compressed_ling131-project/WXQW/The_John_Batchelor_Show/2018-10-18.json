you know about that [noise]\nYou know what I Know about it as very little what we can speculate about quite a bit okay speculate well yeah yeah well\nI mean it's it's utterly fascinating to see such a quick pivot from from China it's of course as we talked about the last one I was on what we saw a bit of this happen right in here in Newport we're having our ah\nInternational sea power symposium the head of the Chinese maybe it was here and actually pull and actually pulled out and went home displeasure over the situation in the south China Sea was recalled to to to Beijing\nSo that so that was sort of the origin of what we say having that we'll see happening in Southeast Asia now and of course it seems like go China has had second thoughts as soon as the defense minister to this defense for the church coffers between the United states and Ozzie on\nSingapore and uh [noise]\nSo I'm not sure exactly who gets the upper hand that diplomatically but it's a fascinating to watch\nHim I'm told that the Chinese believe regard a an article of faith especially to the Chinese military and the ... that the south China Seas are Chinese and that the U.S is poaching and that just as we do not permit\nRussian or Chinese ships in the Gulf of Mexico may do not end\nAnd to a permit us ships are our allies in the south China Sea can they enforce that\n[noise] [noise] well I guess I'll take the gesture things is the second thing I Would answer first I guess that's really where the rubber meets the road is kind of do they have the assets do they have the uh the material the missiles or craft all that kind of stuff to actually enforce their claims\nIn the south China Sea but the they interpret this as sovereign territory of seems to be the one coming out of Beijing for the past few years they talked about indisputable sovereignty meeting a monopoly of force that belongs to shut up in the waters of the claims so\nWhether it has the votes to enforce that I guess remains to be seen as far as the historical comparison I mean it's it's in a sense it makes some sense I mean big powers of big powers like the United states like Russia or China like India in fact\nWhen they look offshore they do have a proprietary says towards those wars but at the same time if you look at what China is doing today in the show show to see\nWhat the United States the Caribbean and the Gulf during the era of the Monroe Doctrine yes there were just ... claim do certain prerogative but\nCertainly the United states never claimed to own the Caribbean to own the Gulf to own all the within their ability to to make the rules in Washington governing what happened in those expanses so it might be the same thing but it's an order of magnitude greater in an ambitious\nAnd to reinforce your point Kim a it was just a couple of years ago when the Chinese sale within ten miles of an Alaskan Ayelet\nWe didn't stop them um we didn't complain about it\nSo you know if the Russians are the Chinese wanted to say on the Gulf of Mexico our position would be yeah go right ahead um less because we believe in freedom of navigation and I think that you know the Chinese always say well who they could never sailed near Hawaii well we allow them to do that if they want to if they have the capability to\nIt's just that of course we don't like it but we don't stop them from it\nI mean we're we're going to say that seem to think that they're really really short but that's what they were used to it I mean\nJust a moment and we'll get you back on the phone because I Want to hear we had to break up their garden I ... I Want you to do with that point again that the Chinese aggression here that we're seeing is building gradually it has been building forever for many years and the cost of this conversation tonight I see that we've come to accept\nA certain claim a certain amount of claims the Chinese were contending with them we're talking history but I think that's true for for more than just the United states I think they are European allies have accepted that the aggression in the south China Sea I'm even beginning to believe that parts of East Asia have accepted it\nWell I think parts of East Asian might have accepted it but no I mean we don't accept a Chinese territorial claims and that's why we had the Decatur um engaging the freedom of navigation operation a last month and that's because we do this we do this not only in the south China Sea but elsewhere\nAnd although you know we take a position that the United states will not arbitrator take a position on competing ... sovereignty claims were were not involved nonetheless we insist on an open global commons international airspace international water\nAnd Jim Jim's back with us are we backed up by our allies on this Jen will will they speak for us and an episode like the Decatur [noise]\nWell you know what I actually feel better about the situation when I did up to to really you know two or three years ago it seemed like it was developing into a U.S China us on China thing I Wonder one mano a mano type thing which I think is a really really bad situation if it happens\nHowever when you're ... we've started to see the royal maybe Britain Israel they show up in the south China Sea the French the French are probably are mounting a president's talking about doing more Australia has been has been has been pretty stored on the whole thing so [noise]\nYeah I think that I think there's I think our allies and our friends and and as we would like to recruit to realize and friends are starting to realize that you know every every state has a stake in freedom of the sea and that they show up and they let her speak up about it in the south China Sea\nThose rights go away at places like the Baltic Sea blacks or you know there are other nation other waterways around the world\n[noise] James Holmes Tim homes is the wily chair a maritime strategy at the Naval War\nCollege he blogs at the naval diplomat that naval diplomat dot com Gordon Chang the Daily Beast I'm John ...

[noise]\n\n\n\n\nI'm joined us or with Gordon Chang the Daily Beast my colleague and co hosts and we're very pleased to welcome the Hoover Institution Michael last friday most recently at the national review and all their distinguish publications about aggression by the Chinese\nOr leadership in Beijing the People's Republic of China aggression that appears continuous with the reputation that China had gained as a diplomatic after many years\nAs remaining in the sidelines or emphasizing peaceful rise are seeking non conflict Michael a very good evening to you you cite several instances they're very well known now\nChina forcing the airlines to remove Taiwan from its websites or China challenging the U.S has to cater and the south China Sea or most recently you've written about China detaining up to the New York times tells us a million ... reeducation concentration camps\nThis new aggression does it come from one place Michael good evening to\nGood evening John well you know does it come from one place in in one way it does it comes from ... the president of China and now he's obviously the beneficiary of years of policies that have strengthened China but in his five or six years in power\nHe has moved assertively and indeed in many cases aggressively to throw off the caution that China had traditionally practice shortly said practiced in the past several decades\nTowards the outside world and you're seeing a China that is unapologetic that is unwilling to compromise that is unwilling in many cases to negotiate a and in fact what I think it's doing is beginning to push itself into a corner but it's not doing so without\nCausing a lot of pain and a lot of disruption abroad\nMichael I'm seeking thing is very different from his predecessor Hu Jintao who is a consensus builder mild quite weak politically or see jumping is just apparently the polar opposite\nUm do you think's the jumping is an aberration or is he the inevitable result of the evolution of Chinese communism\n[noise] well it's a great question you know the historian I'm always are hesitant Gordon to to make a conclusion like that and and you know the easy way is to punt and say that that will see but in in some cases we really are at a turning point ... paying is able to successfully consolidate power and successfully pushed through\nThe uh the types of policies that he has been doing so far meaning they're not they're not reversed that it's hard to see China going going back a short of of course the type of collapsed scenario or or severe weakening that both of us have talked extensively about on the other hand\nIf it turns out that he missed calculates that he creates a coalition of the willing so to speak that is opposing China if he blunders into a conflict that China's not prepared for that and you can easily see a lot of this being unwound and he and his\nApproach being disavowed by those who would replace him so in in some ways what he's fighting for I Would say is not just China's role on the global stage he's he's actually fighting for the future of China when he talks about the China Dream as he's done since coming into power\nWhen he talks about rejuvenating the great Chinese people what he's really talking about is this pathway and we are in the midst of that experiment right now\nYou know clearly you're seeing a pushback from the United states and from neighbors in from other countries\nAnd this is I think causing some political distressed because we've had the ... way is the president have been a pro ball being recalled disappeared [noise] um there have been other instances suggesting political distress at the top um infighting we don't know the full dimension of it\nUm but it seems that see jumping is fighting not only for the future of China but he seems to be also fighting as you suggested earlier to consolidate his political position in Beijing because otherwise we wouldn't be seeing these symptoms come so soon after each other\nI think that's right um now one of the things that he's done assiduously since coming into power in the late ... twenty twelve and probably before that when he was the Arab parent was to begin by isolating and eliminating a potential other sources are centers of power within\nThe top leadership of of the Chinese government bombs so it's not that he did not understand that he would cause antibodies so to speak to come\nForman and try to either blunt what he's doing or or you know displace him and take it over for themselves\nAnd he's been very successful in doing that with the military and doing it with the media which was already controlled by in clamping down on civil society and the like\nBut you are absolutely seeing signs of I'm I'm not\nUnrest but dissatisfaction in China are there are a you know in the Soviet Union we have to use to have the ... dot underground publications in China they will come pop up here and there on the Internet\nAnd then spread like wildfire there are extreme criticisms of him and the the path that he's taking a you see some concern in the top leadership as you mentioned of course the Interpol chief Chinese are being disappeared this is this is a regime I don't know if I'd say that the wheels are coming off I don't\nThink it's it's at that level but it is is absolutely one where Xi Jinping is pushed so far so fast\nThat there is the beginnings of a push back against it the question is has he been successful enough the neutering potential other centers of power that he will be able to get through this you\nMentioned the national review on line three hundred and fifty thousand Chinese students studying in America are they a problem Michael that is developing this escalation of aggression he's that turning those students into ... unhappy people are unhappy visitors to the United states\nWell obviously it's it's hard to you know you can't generalize about all three hundred and fifty thousand but what we can talk about John are the\nUndeniable actions on the part of the Chinese\nGovernment to mobilize in some cases weaponize the students have done it lessen the United states but they've done it in places like Australia and other countries where they form a very vocal interest blocks a and they try to suppress anti Chinese\nDiscussion or Chinese um lectures or Chinese events on\nCollege campuses uh they will go out as as large crowds trying to drown out anyone who is taking a critical stance of China they um are another element along with the Confucius Institute says the state uses to try to portray only positive a\nPositive views of China now in the United states what we also know is that the government is very carefully watching them that there are in essence agent provocateurs who are sent to make sure that none of these students say things that they can do that themselves the students are saying things that can be construed as critical of China\nOr to send a chill or into the ranks of those students and it it really cuts against everything that we say that well when they come here to this country they're going to experience\nAcademic freedom and intellectual freedom and therefore they'll go back and change China and the fact is is that they feel probably even more under observation and more under surveillance here when they're studying abroad than they do in China\nYou know Michael what'd you say is absolutely will hundred percent correct about Chinese students here they are under surveillance by the Chinese government by the Chinese students and scholars association by embassy personnel\nFor the Republicans not to be touting the economy and their responsibility for it at every turn to and Democrats are guilty of this too I mean they they tend to get lost in their own storylines or what every story lines are created it defined for that by the press\nThey tend to get lost in those things I Do and I've been talking about this for months\nI Wish that the Republicans had been counting the economy and\nTheir role in creating this pool every single day right up to the day of the election they have not gotten\nKilled I Am disappointed in most of the candidates but I still think that the American people are going to deliver them a better day on election day that most people think but it's not entirely because Republicans have been so great at their own messaging\nThe New York times reports that after Kavanaugh and ... in these last weeks\nThat there is evidence that the Republicans have gained because of the polarizing of the ... electorate over issues like capital and others\nIn other words they're stronger in red states the Republicans and they were before\nAnd while the Democrats are stronger in blue states hardly anybody's left in the middle of Monica except for maybe Elizabeth Warren wandering around trying to figure out what she is but the polarization means that both bases are fired up both places remember the story for a year was that only the Democrats were focused\nRight yeah and that was true and Republicans were so self satisfied after the twenty sixteen election that a lot of them\nAnd a lot of voters who are particularly passionate about politics just sort of kickback didn't watched what was unfolding which for them was pretty good especially economically but now John I think\nGiven the Kavanaugh situation which spectacle debacle that was how horrifying that was just so many voters not just Republican base but independents disaffected Democrats who voted for Trump twenty sixteen they took a look at what the heck\nIs going on here this is a good man this is a brilliant man who deserves to be able to Supreme Court elections have consequences the country elected Trump Trump's prerogative is\nTo nominate we'd like to sit on the Supreme Court and unless they're Charles Manson that person to deserve to be on the court so what is going on with these couples smears\nLevel that this guy that got a lot of people across the board really mad\nIt got that mobilize the question is whether or not that that energy and enthusiasm born out of the anger of the way Kevin always treated whether that can carry three to election day I think largely a cat\nObviously I think if the bitter kept the day after he was confirmed you would have the may be a Republican landslide forget about a blue wave\nBut the timing of this is such a I I still think that it's close enough to the Kavanaugh spectacle that there will be enough Republican energy to mitigate any blue wave\nRight it looks like the blue way is a ... blue a metaphor is no longer useful the times says that in polling shows than in the rural areas the Republicans are granting stripes and for the way to be gigantic\nThe Democrats have to do well not only in suburbia they already have cities do in suburbia but also in the rural districts and that's not happening at this time I wanted to buy this up the way up into house which political science says goes to the Democrats the party on on the out\nFor the first term of a president and the Senate I've been surprised Monica\nThe Senate numbers have come in and we're getting likely voters now\nHow strong the Republicans are in red states very very strong and that it will be a credit to such as Joe I'm Mr Manchin senator mentioned if he holds West Virginia the Republicans are overwhelming in Missouri overwhelming in North Dakota\nOverwhelming in Nevada overwhelming in Tennessee or they might even be overwhelming in Arizona I Can't tell at this point but whatever that polarization dozens in suburbia you certainly successful for the Senate candidate\nYes exactly in fact the Senate Baptist really tilted in the ... favor just sit in the last couple of weeks I always thought that the Republicans were going to hold the Senate\nAnd maybe pick up that seat or to you now we're looking at I don't and Alice yesterday John that said that I sort of healing we could pick up seats I don't think that's likely but now they've got the average ... the Republicans picking up about three or even four maybe five Senate seats\nWhich is entirely possible so\nMitch McConnell made a comment about Obamacare and said look if if it turns out\nAs we expect it might be where the where our party at the numbers that we're going to take another step

Monica I've saved the this to last because it's your story and there's more to say about Hillary Clinton and Monica\nBasic it's just a stunning to me that Hillary Clinton speaks about what happened in Nineteen Ninety eight with Monica Lewinsky as if it's as if it happened in another universe it's not even connected to the world we live in\nA Hillary Clinton in this last week I think embarrassed the Democratic party if they're paying attention are they [noise]\nThe tone deafness is Mrs Clinton never ceases to amaze goes a John I mean I Believe she made a comment today that\nIt that her husband

states she was twenty two and a White House and turn the whole concept of a feminist argument on this especially in the ... era is that\nPower differential overwhelming got out of course it wasn't abusive power it was a textbook abuse of power idea Mrs Clinton can not\nSeemed to twenty five years later process what her husband did to her to miss Lewinsky into the country after all of this time she hits your wagon\nTo him years ago what forty forty five years ago to try to get the presidency that failed and you can still see the sense of denial and her cat actually quite sad\nMonica Crowley

I think much simpler and kind of a more reasonable explanation of this without the without going up to the ... and stuff like that and got ...\nOdd because I think first of all we know from the ... so

there are demands for use and to to to and from I just ask have you seen as scheduled changes in any fashion after this accident [noise]\nUm ... there was a slight change which might take place because in fact I own including a might actually are the ones the next launch a ... because uh because what's going on is there is right now the international space station is under stuff\nThere is

on\nHow people want to consume it will be providing those kinds of products but really focused on on clean and organics were going in real soil we don't use any synthetic fertilizers chemical pesticides such a cleaner healthier product that has a sharper chirping kind of flavors and profile\nUm that that consumers prefer now in terms of our we were building those soldiers are still building them are Hamilton facility and Ontario will be finished by the end of this calendar year and we'll start selling into medical market in January\nSo we're actually not selling today in Canada yet we have sales in Europe in before we do in Canada and then in ... back our facility will be finished next summer but even before then\nAs we start building each girl room will will start cultivating and harvesting so we expect to be expanding all started medical in Canada and Henry and then during next year will be expanding across more medical patients and the province by province in the recreational adults use market but we've actually made a lot a lot of progress since we last talked\nAbout we purchased a company now in Poland temp Poland which is industrial hemp base CBD oils and from there are selling into multiple countries across Europe\nWere investing in this business to\nActually take some of the technologies we've been developing in Canada or have licensed out of the U.S\nAnd we'll be expanding our product portfolio exactly into edible as you mentioned and beverages be on the oils that sell today and since we last talked we've also acquired a company in Jamaica or fifty percent of the company in Jamaica you can't have majority ownership there we've we've got forty nine percent\nAnd this is a fully vertically integrated company everything from cultivation\nTo extraction manufacturing in retail stores we made an announcement last week that we've entered into a joint venture and Mexico which is one of the biggest markets in Latin America and we'll be exporting products from Poland from Canada and and from Jamaica\nInto Mexico and then soon to be the rest of Latin America we're also investing and building the sales and distribution structure so\nReally we're on track to to build out our global brand\nAnd become the leading organic cannabis Brent I'm\nIn the world I wanted to ask about that the facility in Quebec that's twenty thousand square feet is that where the robots are Brian is that you're going to use robot arm or\nSo and it it you know in in in Hamilton it's it's a hundred and fifty thousand square feet twenty thousand is the indoor part in valley feel just outside of of Montreal and come back that's actually one point one million square feet now twenty thousand so it's much much bigger and yes it will be largely\nMade it we thought we actually chose cut back because it has the lowest power rates in the country huh huh hum as well as some it's great\nThat so that's where the robot farmers will be in Quebec\n... that's right so you don't have people and the girl rooms which which has a number of benefits because it's it's a lower risk of contaminants coming in Raj tends to happen when people are coming in and out and then on top of that because you've got robots to lift up the tables you don't need walkways for people\nWhere are the stores to look for and how are they how are they and managed\nIt's going to take a bit of time I mean today you only have a couple dozen stores across\nThe country um what you'll find is over the next month some over the next year they'll be more and more retail stores opening up they'll be very specific only selling cannabis products with the exception of Nova Scotia where they're selling it and liquor stores as well\nUm but you if you're in Kennedy in order to on

Ontario um there's a lot of American states a lot of big population um adjacent Ontario it won't be until next April you'll be able to find it in retail stores in come back\nFor for states that are neighboring I'm back um they do have some stores now but I think over the next few months will be a lot more stores\nAnd they'll be better accessibility and the government is handling a slower go the\nWay I understand what you gotta start somewhere today's the start date so they're now going to build a the government is handling the the merchandise as wholesalers correct and then there are opportunities for private enterprise to sell it as retailers\nThat's right so for the medical market which is being in place for some time\nI'm it's direct patient directly to the producer through e commerce that we can sell to medical patients across the country but for a recreational adults use um the the provincial government in each and every province is the wholesaler record so we sell to the province\nAnd then they go on and sell to retailers whether it's their own retailers like in in ... back\nAnd and and several other provinces or private retailers like Alberta or Ontario as of next April will have a private retail network\nUm the government will still be kind of been in the middle there ensuring the right quality and then write controls and excise taxes everything else are collected um and uh and also create the getting getting together wholesale markup as well\nI mean the the the promises when I'm from a financial standpoint as well as prize reducing crime and then making sure that that the tax basis as strong and and there's quality products out there\nThere is to get in to the way the BBC is reporting this have you heard from your neighbors and Britain are

America everyone is looking to Canada\nFrom being the first kind of significant or G. seven country to have legalized adults use 'em and want to make sure that candidate right and I think what you'll find as more and more country see the benefits um in terms of providing um basically helping people to them and there's a lot of medical benefits to it but even if you compare it to the average out call\nI'm On the recreational side um it's also a healthier alternative\nAnd um I think you'll see more and more countries looking at Canada as a role model and looking at how they could replicate

[noise]\n\n\nJohn ... so this is John ... melodrama of the collapse of the hops for gunfire Conrad is the general public tiara the general's son Joe says the eighty four year old\nWho ruled by avoiding all problems and yet the war is upon them Jeffrey ... a mad catastrophe as the book the outbreak of World War one and the collapse of the hops Berg empire there are plans\nGeneral staff plans they've had maneuvers for years where they planned what will happen one more breaks out\nJeffrey there are two enemies that they must concerned themselves with in Vienna one is the Russians the great Russian Empire from the north and the other is Serbia but ... is a minor threat to Vienna\nMarching on Serbia is a waste of time and money you emphasize that when the Germans made common cause\nWhen Berlin made common cause with the Anna may always believed that the posturing would go to war with Russia that they would help the Germans whole Russian in the east while Germany destroyed France and the British expeditionary force in the west before they came back and finished it but that the\nAustrian didn't tell Germany about the Serbian few is that correct\n[noise] well I mean the the book talks a great deal about this in the sense that\nThe younger it held it for the younger that the German journalist actually gone rather the Austrian journalist that she had\nHad intermittent staff talks\nIn the years before World War one they had a meeting and ate in Nineteen eighty nine at a meeting in Nineteen twelve where they talked about war plans but the warplanes are always very vaguely elaborated by both men for a couple of reasons first the Germans never trusted Austria Hungarian security arrangements\nAnd not to because the toxin\nFascinating detail about the raid affair Nineteen Thirteen when ah when the uh when when when one of the best and brightest and the author hunger and general staff\nIs discovered to have been selling\nIn Germany and Austria Hungarian war plans as well as you know or information on Germany Austria Hungarian technology and fortress a provision arrangement and that sort of thing\nTo the Russians and so the Germans always kept things close to the best the Oscar Hungarians under Conrad also shared very little with the Germans Conrad actually had a rubber stamp on his desk in the journal stop building that said not to be shared with a German general staff and he would stamp documents for that\nReason they did this is the both sides the Germans and the Austrians want and as much freedom of a maneuver as they could and so they didn't want to commit themselves\nTo definitely to each other because they wanted to maintain flexibility that Germans because they were they were nursing initially from plan and they were planning to throw him merely their entire army against\nThe British expeditionary force in the French and the west and then only once they were beaten move everything back to the flu didn't want the Austrian saying hey you got to commit to leave it doesn't divisions are twenty divisions out east\nAnd the Austrians because they had this very flexible flexible in theory war plan\nWhere they would have a large echelon of troops that wouldn't train for the for the Eastern Front they would have a ... a very small echelon of troops that were in train for the Serbian ... in the event of a two front war and they would have a floating reserve of a dozen divisions\nThat could and train for either from and uh the Austrians didn't want to have to nail down that floating reserve\nThey you know because of German demand they wanted to have ultimate flexibility is it's so there was this very dangerous vagueness about the arrangements between the Germans and the Oscar Hungarians both general staff saw that as being convenient but it would prove fatal in war time as you see in the book\nBecause basically what happens is that ah the war you basically is triggered by the passionate assassinations of Sarajevo and\nAh the Austrians have an opportunity to\nI guess Serbia because so great is the international outrage of this assassination I mean remember these Bosnian Serbs assassins killed\nCrown prince of Austria Hungarian empire in the streets of Sarajevo he's were Bosnian Serbs it was assumed by virtually every one that they had some kind of\nSerbian governments Serbian military connection this was going to the Austrians when they're all tomato and we're going to investigate improve up but in the meantime\nEverybody from St Petersburg across the London was horrified by the gate so your trees actually had an opportunity to rule with everything into Serbia and crush the Serbs but the way to the opportunity wasted entire\nMonth the whole month of July they were all literally\nAnd vacation they didn't even come back to the end of the plan this war that they had been wanting for years their mobile time\nThey get around issuing an ultimatum a month after the assassination indignation has asked to weigh everywhere and now from St Petersburg London instead of the people thinking hey Austria has a right to invade Syria everybody's thinking hey Austrian better not invade Serbia and and Russia and France are saying don't\nInvade Serbia because Serbia has friends\nSo at this point by the time the Austrians actually get around to going to war they no longer have the option of a one front war it's definitively going to be a two front war and yet and here's the madness of Conrad fun Hudson's or if he decides to direct the bulk of the army south against the Serbs and send only\n... other half of the army out to the Russians when in fact he needs to be sending for you to use to face the Russians and ate divisions\nDown to face the Serbs but instead he sends twenty against the Serbs and um [noise] and uh twenty eight against the Russian and they're not nearly enough for him to the Russians are going to build the strength of a hundred and Ninety six divisions\nThe three Army Corps that are sent against the Serbs are in the hands of tiara who is the rival of Conrad and hold your eye is even less effective as a commander and more hysterical and the man searching for victories and Conrad\nAnd what they what they wind up doing is trying to cross the dream river\nTo print into the mountains and we learn from the first time and Jeffrey's book that the Austrian citizen\nAre totally unaware of how to fight a war they're barely trained and this is the first and best of the draftees\nThey don't have enough weapons is generally a Jeffrey said but they fight badly they bunch shop and charged with band not into what you insulating fire and it's a disaster in the heat and they are beaten by their own tactics them I said that correctly Jeffrey\nYeah yes exactly and and you're right this really hasn't been covered if you look at history of the world war one\nUh the the drunk or invasion it's it's quite puzzling how they actually lost but no historian has really gone any detail and how that campaign was fought\nAnd how it turned and uh you know what happened was the the ... and as you said these were the best troops and the author and good are these are the long service groups and my book by the way\nHe concludes by saying really by\nThe end of Nineteen fourteen it's game over because the train the army has been moderately annihilated and the train opposite an island and they start getting annihilated and the Serbian campaign and the Russian Campaign Nineteen fourteen and what's happening here in August in August September Nineteen
