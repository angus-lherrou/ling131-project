good about see what things cost and make that decision if you get into a significant accident\nYou end up filing an insurance claim probably just looking for a good body shop at your insurance company will go and work with right you're not doing shopping there so the first thing you know even if we can get to this place are going to be some exceptions\nDon't imagine they'll ever be a good time to be shopping for the best price when you're having to go to the emergency room for some major medical a bit ...\nOr so that would be a you know a moment where it wouldn't necessarily apply and there might be some other major surgeries to where I wouldn't necessarily apply I mean they were talking major surgeries complications that you don't even know about it until\nYou get in there are so like you know there are some of these things will never be solved by by being able to say oh okay well this is everything I Need medically and here's the price\nBut again for all the basics it would provide the level of transparency and that's kind of the the more important point generally but to your specific situation again I\nI feel for you and and I wish you the best and I hope that you can find a some providers nearby that would be able to assist you can provide some level of transparency\nWhat I have done and I'll tell you that it's not always the most popular thing and it's not necessarily a something that always comes with an answer but I Will ask people in my wife's got good at this to asking how much is this going to cost\nAnd it can lead to the health care provider\nKind of running in circles and every now and then you won't get an answer I have actually not obtained healthcare and in some instances because they couldn't tell me how if something was going to cost\nI won't necessarily just signed a piece of paper that says hey whatever happens in here I'm going to pay for\nI don't provide any of them my Social Security number because they don't have a right to it so in that context you can ask hey here's my situation what am I looking at and hopefully there are some providers that might be able to provide you with the least some guidance on that type of information\nBut again not God Bless them and best wishes to you and\nUh if anybody comes through some ... a specific information make sure that uh your your information there are we uh we have it and

histories one side effects\nI operate on the premise I Will never accept a false one and I will assert that anything that's built upon the false premise is destined to fail\nAnd also denied I've talked about those sliding scale of morality I think it helps explain a lot of what goes on in our everyday life how some people can seem like they're good people in good times and then turn around and stab us in the back\nOr in this particular case that we now have a political party because basically embraced a lack of morality to where they are willing to be dishonest and lie about major issues that would impact every American like the fraud that is Medicare for all for example\nAnd then have people buy into it the political party that will perpetuate a series of of lies and deceit like Christine Ford in I Believe her\nAs Chuck Schumer Dianne Feinstein and many Democrats did because then their constituents believe them creating a whole major segment of this country\nThat embraces a lack of morality and a lack of honesty a lack of integrity and decency but we also have that with climate stuff and the un ah\nThe the blessing un by the way Nikki Haley was about the only

we've been dealing with with hurricane Michael here which which by the way ah I'm Brian mud inform our club and by the way you know I'm In south eastern Florida\nQuite fortunate to be virtually missed entirely by the storm we got a little bit of weather but uh nothing of of significance here but for the folks in the panhandle\nAnd what you what you see is is very real for one specific community Mexico beach and to a certain extent the surrounding areas but give you an idea in a comparison ... a lot of folks\nAre familiar with Hurricane Andrew even if you're not anywhere near South Florida course Hurricane Andrew the devastation you might even has some of those images in your head and one of the things that\nI ended up noticing and when we were taking a look at some of the imagery come back from Mexico beach ground zero for hurricane Michael a lot of pictures so looked an awful lot\nLike what we saw with Hurricane Andrew you heard a ... a Rick Scott say there's like a tornado\nOr this you know in hurricanes a lot of people but to focus on the category and the tops Hussein when very rarely is the wind the issue and hurricanes and I know that sounds weird if you're not used to have that avenue to deal with them wow good hurricane be about almost anything but the one\nJust as you saw was born in the Carolinas just as you saw with hardy\nAnd Houston last year it's still flooding storm surge flooding is responsible for the overwhelming majority of damage in death and hurricanes rarely is it about the when\nHurricane Andrew was about the wind\nWhen you get to a certain level you're not just talking about a tornado you're talking about a hurricane bed around its core is a tornado to give me an idea you got that scale you know you got the F. one through the five tornadoes go right\nOn top sustained winds at a hundred and fifty five miles an hour\nHurricane Michael was three miles per hour away from being an ass three tornado I'm very fortunate my my my family has been trying to uh to give me a heart attack thing\nYeah my parents and my sister and my brother in law veteran Naples the last year or ma I hit them directly they ended up being alright ironically and I'm On the other coast I'm southeastern Florida um Iowa is without power for five days we had a little tornado came through tore up some of the power lines near us\nThey were out power for like going to to actually fared better where hurricane Irma's truck directly than than we did\nGo figure but a got a brother and Panama City beach all the reporters through Michael that were on PC beach give me an idea and he has a\n... about ten miles from ground zero and really about four to six miles outside never lost power and bill without cell service pretty much for the past couple of days boat in the marina\nBasically fine\nRight they are back close just a matter of miles and that's because we're talking about a hurricane that went through as governors constant like a tornado\nBut there's something else that you know it's kind of a an important in the ... contacts in the conversation and this is a a meeting you for anybody who could be a long and it goes like it'd be in the northeast could be anywhere in between you can be on the Gulf and take a look what happened to Mexico beach\nI ah had an idea there was one silver lining that came out a Hurricane Andrew was building codes we have what's called the Miami Dade code that is rock solid you don't do anything but concrete anymore\nIn affected areas and it makes a difference every now and then when you see the pictures Mexico beach you'll see structures that are still standing right next to whole areas that are just completely wiped down nothing but to bring and you'll what's the difference there\nHad an idea that a lot of those homes or built well before we had the Miami Dade standards after Hurricane Andrew in Ninety two went back into a glove the average home that was built Mexico beach is Nineteen eighty three Nineteen eighty three\nWell before those standards would framed homes and so the media you is your in one of those types of homes and you're at a point to where you could be impacted by a hurricane\nYou know you you might want to think about your situation because if you get a hurricane is like a tornado comes near you you know think about the impact on your home the ones that are standing\nBy and large are your structures that were built\nAfter Ninety two with those upgraded and updated standards to me and the difference not only in life and death but it can make the difference in your home being there versus your home being wiped out can make the difference between a community that can be rebuilt and something that isn't even recognizable\nAs mentioning Hurricane Irma last year you go to the uh the lower ...\nYou'll see when you go down there every now and then it's like huh wow it seems like there's a lot of space where they're used to be homes\nCall eight

[noise] it\nWas ... about as big as we've ever seen in history we've never had anything like this\nDay is actually pretty close pretty close so you might hear quite a bit malware Michael ranked historically now ... years at top five so I'm not quite in terms of recorded\nHurricane in us history but by name storms that is the case here's the deal we've had in Atlantic hurricane season that leaves drag since Eighteen fifty one but then it started naming hurricanes until Nineteen fifty three All right so\nYou actually had the strongest hurricane ever recorded in us history it was ... it was the Labor Day hurricane Nineteen thirty five\nO'clock in the top just eight windows ... hundred and eighty five miles\nPer hour does that go on\nWith hurricane care Nineteen sixty two top winds one Seventy five\nAnd he had a joy die for the third strongest hurricane at the time a land fall hurricane Camille Nineteen sixty nine a buck sixty five and yeah Hurricane Andrew in Ninety two at one sixty five as well be the strongest hurricane\nAt the time the landfall record in us history what's called the ... hurricane of Nineteen twenty eight that's another one deals where the lake Okeechobee here in South central Florida if you will honor sixty miles an hour tops the same way and so where does Michael rang\nBut when's that a hundred and fifty five miles per hour at the time of landfall text strongest hurricane and recording us history that big of a deal\nCertainly prayers go out to the folks\nImpacted direct align their blood the other things so much for two and we heard the death toll earlier today lemon twelve and a lot of concerns that number's going to rise one thing in particular like in the in Florida we do often a really good job\nOr minimizing death at the time of impact of a hurricane but often will see a bunch of people that will go out there and and make mistakes after hurricane\nThey'll end up died that's been four to track record historically really easy by the way when you're ... you're tired you don't have power to go do something silly\nThat sometimes can just include stepping in water bottle or something with the downed power line I kind of thing happens and the case of or taken a look at though with a with hurricane Michael\nWhat we don't know how many people were actually in those homes\nMexico Mexico beach and uh let's pray that folks to get out and that we're going to have a debt told the rise is considerably\nTomorrow and over the weekend this one was bad bad news for sure right at the end on a lighter note\nI couldn't help but ah but bank of actually the first time I remember hearing the name Kanye West and\nIs that when I was doing radio in Savannah\nDuring the Iraq War the folks you saw it in a Baghdad or toppling be statues of Saddam Hussein heroes among heroes those are the third the third Infantry Division third id at Fort Stewart just outside of savannah\nJust amazing people and outside of the tourists that come to savannah it's a major military town everybody is either friends or family was somebody serve it and back then somebody who was overseas\nSo when we have a record on on it was important with all the major updates to get the information out to all of our radio stations we happen to have a a urban station a ramp station there was a young rapper they are in the afternoon\nAnd uh he was playing in in ... is from Atlanta and so he's got a big deal in Georgia and he was just starting to become a big deal I think nationally about that time to anyway I'm supposed to be going in there to do this major update on the third Infantry Division and the Iraq War\nAnd I go in there and this young rapper is doing his thing and he's all worked out and then he is coming over to me out of a Kanye West's song\nAnd he couldn't remember my name anyway it's it's it's widely with the news and I became Whitey with the news\nAnd I managed to hold it together long enough to give the the update but after that we kind of turned it into a thing and for all for meaning couple of years that was in Savannah he would end up helping me with culture and so I Would do things like a you know learn how to to speak the language\nI'd just be a chilling and stuff you know those are the types of things that I was telling me you know and being Kanye West was that the forefront of my organized\n[laughter] anyway Hi

[noise]\n\nOn John John ... show it's a pleasure to welcome Lewis ... who is the director of the Douglas and Sarah analysis Center for foreign policy at the Heritage Foundation just returned from the Caspian Sea bass and I talk about it and deal I'm keen on looks observations I was there in July and August\nIn the heat of the summer and there was great news anticipate\nThe signing of an agreement for the state of the Caspian Sea bass and just share energy pipelines future development on the great Silk Road\nLook good evening to you and thank you for joining your back from the Caspian Sea bass and they always anticipation of success you been there since are they celebrating our they disappointed what is the word and back to about the working together with their neighbors good evening to you\nThanks John good evening and thanks for having me on that just came back from a ... I was in Baku had also knocks serve on which is a separate region of either by John both for very fascinating place to visit I've been to a bar code number of times before\nBut you're right this was the first time I've been since the agreement on August ... John people are very optimistic and excited about the agreement I think that most of the countries around the Caspian are happy with the agreement to other than Iran\nAnd I thought was interesting to looking at some of the reaction of social media many uranium felt like the President Rouhani of Iran and betrayed the country and betrayed the people over the agreement because\nIranian see themselves as having this a historical legacy the Caspian region and they feel like they should get\nMore ownership of the Caspian what they are getting out of this deal but nevertheless putting aside concerns of the concerns of your average Iranian which let's face it they have a lot of other problems right now\nPutting those to one side agreement does offer a lot of potential to bring new oil a three sources from the heart to Central Asia and the Caspian base and to Europe and many of America's allies in Europe\nYes this is the southern gas car door and uh I've tried I've described it to the audience Luke and I want your help to it say it take connection from the ... that natural gas the there are two platforms developing it but also from Turkmenistan also from Kazakhstan\nThrough Azerbaijan and then through the ... guy suit Georgia to turkey\nAnd then across turkey through the Balkans including Bulgaria into Greece under the rainy and see and all the way to Italy so we're talking about not just the riches of the Caspian Sea bass and are we talking about energy security for a Europe that's how I saw the possibility of ...\nAbsolutely the you know the ultimate goal was southern guess court or as to allow European gas from places other than Russia or Iran [laughter] so we're we're talking about right right now in terms of like practical deliveries\nOf natural gas to Europe using the southern grass court or we're talking about really eyes by John\nBut in the future because of the Caspian agreement we could see this expanded out to Kazakhstan and also Turkmenistan because they're on the other side of the Caspian\n... there's been this debate over the years on to building a pipeline connecting the west eastern side of the Caspian Sea where you have Turkmenistan for example with western side where you have either by John\nAnd the reason why a pipeline is required us because like oil or natural gas uh uh it's very expensive to ship\nA by by by boat you have to liquefy it Ellen gee you've heard that term I'm sure many of your listeners have\nTo have to look all liquefied natural gas\nSo it's only profitable to do that when you're when you're traveling more than let's say two thousand miles or so whereas the distance between the two coasts or the Caspian or talking only about three hundred three hundred and twenty miles so into a pipeline has constructed as profitable to move this gas\nTo Europe through the Caspian but tell the agreement an August a pipeline was unable to be constructed because there was no legal framework to do so and now there is so there's a lot of optimism about\nEurope able to get news sources of of uh of gas or to diversify where they get their energy from away from Russia and the more from other resources\nAnd many of your listeners can be thinking well how does this impact me in a in the United states and that's actually a very simple because\nMany of our European allies in NATO for example we're obligated to protect\nTo through the NATO or the north Atlantic treaty and it's in our benefit that they have security and energy independence away from Russia because that gives Russia one less lever that they can pool to apply pressure on many of our allies\nYou mentioned in Iran and it's unclear where that had it but it certainly is a rough neighborhood Azerbaijan lives and I want to just to attend a moment to Georgia because this pipeline goes through Georgia\nAnd George get seeds from it all so get energy from it Georgia is threatened state\nOf the south caucuses it was pulled apart and the two thousand ... invasion by the Russians had not been put back together\nAnd I see the court or or at least ... agreement and the Caspian Sea as one additional way to back up what's left of the Georgian Government say is that a fair generalization look you study this area very carefully\nSo absolutely that's a that's a very important point is actually often overlook to Georgia is a very important transit country and what the Georgians one is as much energy\nTransit taking their country going to Europe is possible\nThat only because you know from an economic point of view Georgia would get transit fees say they are able to get a certain amount of gas and oil from John because of the transit\nFees and the the transit rights but they know that the the the more oil and gas transits Georgia to get to Europe and and to get to the international markets\nMeans that there's more international concern and focus on Georgia and as you pointed out Georgia is already partially occupied by Russia in fact twenty percent of the country is occupied by Russia and they know that if Russia tries to take any more land\nOr there'll be a bigger international attention on the situation because of the oil and gas traveling through the country\nStill crowds of it's a theory it's a dream it's an imagination but they have a port at ... ... they're waiting for the development of the Silk Road how close are we look to getting that trend said\nUh the pipelines the highways that to railroads from China to Europe or we within Twenty years ten years what's your opinion\nBut actually say it and to some extent they exist right now\nAnd it's like ... it's been around for a couple of millennia\nTo different degrees and there were there is a huge aspiration to do a lot more with new uh pipelines new shipping routes Newport's new rallying say and I think we're seeing it progress with all of this but I think for for to really see its full potential we're talking another\nFifteen Twenty years but right now we're already seeing huge improvements in a way east and west um travel transit of goods on the Eurasian land mass uh takes place and and I was about to such an important part\nAnd here to for that's been a challenge of and so editing a DNA or nay inside the body isn't something that has been a real I'm hurt a hurdle for the field to get over that will be create to circle nucleic acid what we do is we create a system that is a little bit of a Trojan Horse\nThat allows the DNA or to get inside of the cells allows us to now start correcting faulty DNA or in some cases like him cancer of putting in kill switches so that we can actually genetically target cancers and are able to get rid of the cells that have\nA particular gene of interest or that may be leading to a\nCell that we know one of the body like a cancer so this is generally called immunotherapy\nUm you know therapy is a one way to use a DNA productively inside the body\nHim into a therapy space right now is as you mentioned that your intro very hot topic now this year actually very\nHot topic absolutely a Nobel Prize just went out a few weeks ago now for some of the developers and the pathways for me no therapies a gym Allison and has to go home Joe shared a Nobel Prize for this idea that you could use the body's own immune system to fight cancer\nAnd in fact there are drugs that are now on the market that are helping patients with cancer use of their own immune system to fight off a cancer causing cells\nBrain I GI track lungs skin there's the list goes on about where this is useful their cells all over the body that can go awry\nAnd you have a way of treating the cells without being rejected does the S. N. A. does they sustain itself the body will attack something from the outside of eventually does it a road or does it does it stay with us\nAs you mentioned we kept busy it actually care we're developing drugs and many different therapeutic areas and some of the first therapies in these areas that are genetically targeted so the idea is to go after the underlying genetic causes of disease\nAnd sure enough that you correct but genetic defects that are inside the cell um you can create sustained medicines are ones that are actually heading towards cures\nWhere we've created a way to modify the underlying disease source and we're not really just talking about treatments anymore but we're really talking about opportunities for us to correct mistakes or inside the code itself\nUp for um diseases and all different types of Oregon's\nThere's a video to several videos at a company or a website and the emphasis is on three dimensional why is that important David three dimensional approach\nJust one of the discoveries that we made the base so back secure was bad cells and tissues don't like two dimensional a linear DNA origami that's floating around\nIn fact your body to ... to try to get rid of the DNA in our day I'm over evolutionary time and that's been a huge challenge in the field for the last Thirty years because people have always looked at two dimensional structures and tried to puzzle over how to get those into the right cells and tissues\nQuite a three dimensional sphere ... structure is so important to us at ... that we made at Northwestern university it's part of my PHD work in a laboratory of a gentleman named Chad Merck and\nAnd what I discovered in the working group was that when you create these three dimensional structures now this is a key that the cells recognize the cells like a three dimensional structures and now are able to take that DNA into the cells productively where we're able to make genetically defined medicines\nWe have an FDA Europe has an FDA Asia has asked everybody has FDA's where are you in the process of getting this to market to the physicians\nIn our FDA process sure so\nEither correct there's different jurisdictions all over the world right we're currently working on clinical trials in the u._k. and Germany and in the U.S at ... going to run our first us based trial and the amino therapy space using our spiritual nucleic acid and we're in ... starting that trial in patients with cancer before the end of the year\n... end of this year twenty twenty Eighteen our expectations that we're going to be injecting the first patients with army no therapies\nAnd how long it's a process if you are successful I mean you're learning from this I understand I'm not presuming success right away but how long is the process for the FDA long\nProcess to get through the stages of clinical trials success along the way so we're starting with a phase one be to trial or we just announced last week successful completion of a phase one trial\nUm after you get through the phase two trial you have faced three trials and then out into the market\nAs process can take a meter several years to do now one fun part about making DNA based medicine as the front end as much faster so we can sit at a computer we can design and medicine and we can get into patients to test it out to see if they can work much faster than traditionally done indeed a development space for drugs\nIn our conversation David you gave me a vision of the future vision of the twenty first century you use the word design you can see an individual's DNA and respond to what is that where we are going in medicine absolutely\nSo I mentioned that we had the idea of DNA and the structure of DNA solves since the Nineteen fifties and two thousand and three we declared success on sequencing the human genome and that tells me how your DNA John is different than my DNA\nAnd what at the individual nuclear based level the eighties the genes to tease him sees underlined the fundamental aspects of life or different between you and me in different between a disease state in a non disease state\nBecause we had that code book now in front of us we can actually sit at a computer we can type in the code of the medicine that we want to make and I can design a drug that will work and your cells and will not work in my cells\nAnd so we're at the point now where we got the code and we've got the tools we now have the circle nucleic acid which we think will allow us to make designer precision medicines that will impact lots\nOf different areas for one person or one of the ordinary jewels one person comes with an affliction or is diagnosed with an affliction and you respond for that person or that family I guess there would be similarities and the guy that\nProvision for the future right now what are the areas that we're focusing on it genetically defined disease and he's often times are inherited diseases that pass through generations of families a spinal muscular atrophy is one of the ones that were working on these severe disease that affects a motor function and children\nAnd that's an ... an inherited disease that's genetically based but you can sit and you can look at\nThat type of um a change in the DNA from the different patients and you can see how one patient is different than another patient and my vision is that Twenty years from now you're going to be able to walk into your doctor's office and walk out with the medicine that specifically designed to go after your faulty DNA switch 'em

very powerful state\nWell this is the unfortunate part I my sense\nAnd I can't prove this I merely speculate is the is the basis looks back what happened to Bill Gates Bill Gates didn't have quote a man in Washington and he paid for it dearly with a wasteful lawsuits oysters on 'em by the department of justice\nAnd so my sense is that is it pays those fears that he fears\nThe success of Amazon getting him in trouble in in Washington and so there's also the political aspect of it I don't think this is only for a second I find it offensive when people say described as great businessmen as a crony I think he also did this to kind of signal to Washington look at me\nI'm doing these things that you want a instituting a higher minimum wage that's going to force other business to do it [noise] um I think he would have done it any way but I think there is that fear\nBecause Bezos is often in the news because we're watching him he said global businessman he's looking out\nAnd the future for Amazon I I think the anecdote is that they're they now have warehouses I think it might be in Hong Kong but I'm not sure where there are very few employees I remember the number four and because\nThey're mostly are going to what we can call robots how do how to Fifteen dollar minimum wage fit into the world that Amazon is going to which is to automate as much as possible\n[noise] [noise] well actually it doesn't it at all but it doesn't not in a way that most people think pesos doesn't want low wage employees\nAs any businessman nose blow wage employees are expensive he wants to higher paid employees and so ideally the scenario would be to automate that would be the reward that would enable him to grow the business even more and attract workers would command\nEven higher wages for being much more productive and this is important to be as some people said in response to basis as decision that he was just calling for a Fifteen dollar wage as a way of putting out of business his less automated competitors\nHold a more realistic assertion is the basis wouldn't have time to focus on them and this scenario\nAll businesses want to automate\nAll businesses would want to automate whether the minimum wage was zero or whether it's Fifteen simply because when you can automate\nEmployee functions you can pay your workers a lot more and when you can pay your workers a lot more than ... able to do that because they're more productive they are less likely to leave it cannot be stressed enough that low wage workers are very expensive no business would go out of its way to grow with them\nIs Jeff Bezos crony\nHe's the opposite of a crony I think but he needs to be stressed is that because Amazon is so large because it's so valuable and successful he has to worry about Washington in the ... in ways that a small business does not and so it I don't begrudge him\nThat need to occasionally throw bone to Washington to say oh I'm for a Fifteen dollar minimum wage he's not foolish he knows that this can be a barrier to employment for some people but he has to police masters who don't care\nThat he's a great businessmen and precisely because he's a great businessmen wants to cut them down to size so he must needlessly and and unfortunately play the Washington game on occasion\nI Know John in parentheses in your column you mentioned that Bezos was interested in cutting down the number of workers he must pay he wouldn't have bought whole foods that you just say that labor intensive is an understatement good heavens\nWhy isn't that true he's doing this as he's starting to add a brick and mortar stores in the form of bookstores and he's doing it as he buys whole foods um the ... the best way to reach customers is to have\nOn the ground stores and so this is not about taking out as competitors again no one wants low wage workers think about any business you weren't you want to get the most talented workers who logically cause more\nThat's the path to grow businesses don't become really successful by exploiting their workers Amazon's not going to be the first\nWe go from one self made man Jeff Bezos and the future is bright for Amazon that is a solar system brand for heaven's sakes do another self made man or is he he is now the president of the United states Donald J Trump the New York times has reported\nThat they can document and I don't doubt that Mr Trump inherited more than four hundred million dollars from his father who was a very successful real estate developer in New York and in the boroughs\nJohn the puzzle here is does receiving four hundred million dollars from your father make you a self made man when you're worth billions\n[noise] uh yes it most certainly does make you a self made man\nLet's look at the forty four hundred\nThe employment to population ratio that tells us the right now that American Jobs will just get better and better in the foreseeable future what is the employment to population ratio called the E. P. O. P. good evening to you at\nGood evening a well that's a standard measure that economists particularly labor economists like to use the typical number that people are familiar with of course the unemployment rate\nThe employment rate isn't quite the opposite of the unemployment rate but it's close to the opposite and it's a it's again the metric that economists prefer we actually prefer uh employment rather than unemployment so let me just tell you what that is here's here's how you want to think about it take the\nTotal number of people working that's essentially the number of people who have jobs and divide that by the number of people who could have jobs now when I say could have jobs the way that the bureau of Labor Statistics defines that\nIs I'm a in a particularly grand way and that is anybody sixteen over could have a job so Ninety year old could have a job\nSomeone who's in school and high school could have a job so what that means is that the employment rate is never going to be a hundred percent because you're going to have a\nSignificant fraction of retirees it's never going to be a hundred percent because you're going to have a significant fraction and school but the number that we tend to see is going to be somewhere in the neighborhood of sixty one sixty two percent then in the last a recovery at the peak\nBack in two thousand seven\nThe employment rate reached sixty three and a half percent uh and that was about as high as it got for a while and then it started to go back down as we hit the recession\nSo the question is where will it go and where does it mean to be in order to in order for us to be at full employment and just in in a one sentence answer is sixty one percent it's right now about sixty and a half percent so we have about another half a percentage point to go\nThat means that there's growth ahead and that translates into lots of jobs but I learned from you also that it really matters this idea of full employment that really matters having to do with the Federal Reserve and everybody watching this\nHour lately are the people who who follow I think it's called the Philips curb are they aware that we have room to grow on is that\nIs that reflected in the feds remarks\nThey are this is a debate that has been going on inside the fed and actually with me I've been in touch with a lot of fed officials\nAre about these issues for a couple of years now and you know to be honest that everybody was on my side I think that history has actually proven correct because a couple of years ago\nI remember the unemployment rate it just you know ... below five percent everybody said wow you know things are great at full employment and I said we've got a a long way to go and again it was because I was looking at the employment rate rather than the unemployment rate and a couple of other indicators as well\nBut based on those I said we're going to go we're going to continue to grow or going to continue to see rapid job growth for another couple of years and in fact that's what happened so the fed it certainly aware of this but the reason is is relevant\nAs you just pointed out it's particularly relevant because the fed is concerned that uh we may be overheating and they're trying to get ahead of the curve and in order to do that of course they've been raising interest rates and uh uh as we know that's a cause some volatility on the stock market over the past couple of days\nThe White House the Kevin Hassett and Larry Kudlow they're ... they're watching these numbers as well\nAnd they got a persuasive case given these I mean there are some surprising demographic numbers now and I've never seen before the lowest unemployment for some of the most vulnerable populations in a generation maybe two generations is that there is that significant for growth\nOh it is it is absolutely I mean it's it's significant in two respects first of all it's a measure of where we've been so it's a measure of growth it's a measure of our success\nBut the other thing it tells us is where we can be going and for that I Would say you always want to focus on the prime age workers and particularly in the last couple of years and those workers who are between twenty five and thirty for your years of age\nAnd mostly men actually in that group ... mostly men because the women have been doing fine but the men have not\nAnd recently if you look at the past few months what's happened is the employment rate among those among that group is twenty five to thirty four year old\nHas picked up and picked up dramatically so that's good news for a couple of reasons first of all those are people who we'd like to see back in the labor force of the ones who should be working\nBut second it also tells us that there is demand out there for people there are jobs available and when those jobs become available people will fill those jobs so again another indicator that the economy is continuing to expand\nWage growth that is also an indicator to watch how does that translate because there's been a complaint especially bipartisan and the Democratic party that the wages in not growing means that there is a rich man's economy and not for everyone what his wage growth tell us about overheating and about jobs grow\nRight okay well you know you raised a couple of points one is that the distribution of the wage growth who's getting the wages and who's not\nThat's one issue but I I'm going to speak about your second one because that's the one that really it's more closely to your earlier but issue about whether the fed should be concerned about this\nWhat the fed worries about is that wages are growing more rapidly than they would be permissible and permissible is kind of a funny word but they have a rural\nAnd their role is look at the wake of wage growth and compare that to the summer of two things one productivity growth\nAnd second inflation targeting inflation so we know that the feds targeting inflation rate is about two percent they'd like to see about ... percent inflation in the economy they think if you're below that that's not good they didn't give your above that that's not good so they'd like to see two percent in addition to that\nThey are quite happy if wages grow by the rate of productivity and and the reason is that if you're producing more output and that out but it's going into the economy than if wages are growing at that same rate that's not inflationary because the output is there to cover those wages\nSo what that says is that if you look at the numbers for the recent years\nThe fed would allow us to have wage growth that about three point three percent that's the some of the two percent plus the productivity increases\nOver the past couple of years actually passed here it's been two point eight percent so we're still below that which means we have room in terms of wage growth before we're in a situation where the fed worries that if there is overheating in terms of ... ... it's sometimes called wage pusher cost push inflation\nAnd was there was chairman of the president's council of economic advisors two thousand six to nine he is now a

and second stage two separate incidents the core stage in the middle separate slightly after the strap on his release this is somewhat pulmonary we don't know yet they picked up some debris of the first stage\nThey're still looking into it they've opened a criminal investigation this is very Russian [noise] um but in this case considering that we had a a someone drill a hole in ... before there was launched hiding it\nI don't blame the Russians here for being a little bit paranoid even if it is is that culture\nUm if the status fire down the road is interesting job so I use capsule have a two hundred day life span in space and so when a crew goes up on it's a law so I use a capsule should be used to return within two hundred\nDays which was like seven months um eight months something like that well the crew that's up there now there's three people up that they were going to come down in December because that's when they're soy use a capsules warranty runs out\nWell right now the Russians have said they're not going to launch a manned mission until they launched at least one on land so use first to make sure everything's okay [noise]\nUm [noise] but these guys have to come back in December that's why they weren't too runs out on this all use lifeboat so what I think is probably going to happen is that the December flight they're going to try to figure out what went wrong and get it fixed\nAnd do the December launch 'em no without anyone on board and what that with all due is\nThat will give them a new life fault that can give them two hundred extra days that way I assessed will not have to be left\nOn his nails and they put an unmanned craft up to par cat I ss\nExactly and the craft that thin now they stuff it with stuff why not you can take advantage of this stuff\nAnd they'll just send it back on a tone um attack the I don't know off that that's probably the grass it's got the hole in it or there's another reason maybe not to put people on it um and so uh and this actually might work out very well\nIt's not great for the crew onboard because they're basically going to have to extend their mission and um I've been told by it costs ... to take a long missions like a shooting you know how long emissions supposed to be and you kind of pace yourself to do that mission\nAnd now suddenly you have to extend it it's hard but they can do it\nAnd so that's where we stand it might be that this will be ... and uh that would be the first time in Eighteen years that no humans who are in space is pretty impressive situation um there'll be a tragedy will lose ... I was really hoping that ... minutes were up in space for the rest about human history\nBut that might not be the case I assessed self they say can be man didn't stay operated in space for that anybody on board with a bike mission control\nBut less maintenance questions involved for example the two astronauts that we're going to be on the soil use craft one of the they were trying to to certain space walks to do maintenance on the station well they're not bad\nAnd the Russians have said that launched the same two guys in April because they got to get them\nThey had to do those maintenance space walks this also might impact the investigation and they only because they were saying they were going to do an Arab during one of those space walks able can inspect from the outside the whole uh and so this is a complicated situation will shift to see how it plays out in the future job\nI Want to press on this because he has you know there was talk of a criminal investigation has dropped or is that still on\nThe TV um the science V. engineering investigation\nAnd the panel that's doing that has also opened a criminal investigation of Russia's mentioned the Russians\nWho are and that's not unusual to open criminal investigations this kind of thing they have a different attitude than we do but considering the fact that they had what looked like might've been sabotaged on the Soyuz capsule it's at all but right now\nAnd considering this has happened and considering they have so many problems they've had\nThey've had six failures of soy use various as the Saudis rocket and the last two years I'm Sorry for failures but either way that's a lot\nAnd so they're paranoid right now and even little culturally that normally similar power line the Russians you know the whole statement just because your parent does not mean someone isn't out to get you and it could be very well the case here that there is\nThey could be great dissatisfaction within the engineering a cruise build these things because they don't get paid much ... pay pittance compared to engineers the rest of the world\nAnd the management is not great\nAnd the tactics generally been poor and so in Russia's around happy country right now so I wouldn't be surprised if the criminal investigation\nThey must go to the U.S side how can we get a base crap ready to do routine back and forth to the INS to operate as if it ... argues\nWell right now our schedule is that a space X is going to do its unmanned test sometime in January and then five months later it's first manned mission that that's not that's not an operational mission that's still a test mission\nAnd Boeing is going to go in April with on land in August manned so that sometime next year and those are still the test flights\nI'm One of the reasons the January the January unmanned test flight of safe sex was delayed was because there was scheduling conflicts I SSI say they should take advantage of this situation and push\nThe stay six long shot but then it might not make sense better to get the Russians in shape a first\nUm there is problems the bureaucracy that says safety panel which would would get upset if if I had a pay cut\n'em is talking about how well they haven't really handle all the factors that need to be handled and we don't see these launches happy as scheduled well I think the safety battle is going to be told to shut up and not interfere with the need for getting", "show_name": "The John Batchelor Show", "year": "2018", "city": "Fairhope", "day": "13"}
