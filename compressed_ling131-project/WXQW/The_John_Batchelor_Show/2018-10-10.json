I wrote it down here and my theory of the Cold War as we win and they lose is that Donald Trump's opinion he's a witness it went up through an All right uh that opinion was\nBacked up by the effort to solve the Reagan Administration to make the case why it is we're better than the Soviet right that is something that's been missing for since the attack on New York actually been missing since the first attack on the world trade\nCenter has it has and and that is why\nI said in the book I said and why we fight I truly believe whatever happens in the next six is the president's President Trump's wall so speech will be one of the most historic speeches he gives as the forty fifth president\nBecause it's the language that we recall from the Nineteen fifties it's full of the transcendental it's full of the godly but it's also about Judeo Christian civilization in it and it has a heart stopping moment in the ... paragraph\nIt's not a happy ... speech it is a serious way the speech and he says the only question before us today and I'm paraphrasing\nIs whether we have the will to defend the values upon which all civilization is built on the fact that he gave that speech way he did we we the British Government wanted to have\nHim in some fancy location downtown we said no the president ... states will give this speech next to the statue of the Warsaw Uprising where those brave\nOr polls

said what difference is that what I call the threat do you remember that\nYeah there's actually addressing candidate Trump bought differences at what I call the threat\nBut clearly in twenty eleven it made a big difference to the Obama administration because in twenty eleven before ISIS befall it'd be before the collapse of Syria\nThe White House decreed in a memo to the shadow of the joint chiefs

probably out there were still ... bog down in Russia gate mysteries or we have a midterm election always ... there's always been term election that's the way we we run frequent elections\nIt was my

comment you\nJohn John show I welcome Robin you're on the surface monitor is going to worry a little bit mob is the author of genesis now available in audio formats\nApollo away the great success of December Nineteen sixty eight\nHowever he is also the author of the universe and the mayor the story of Hubble and Hubble needs our attention now because there's trouble Hubble Bob a very good evening to you the trouble on a hub a humble let's put it into the safe mode what is the nature of the problem\nThis is the ... this is the this is probably been the most systemic problem that hold his head since its launch after it was repaired\nThe gyroscope that they used to keep the telescope oriented precisely um they have six on the space craft and they have had three in reserve for the last few years to try to last they only need three to make sure it's pointing accurately\nUm and so the three three others and you just put in reserve they're not running them to try to preserve into lasts as long as possible to the three the running a one failed\nAnd so uh they said um actually I should correct myself for the six gyros they had for that work\nAnd they had one in reserve to no longer work so they had three good ones and water reserves so the three gyros while working one failed and so they decided will turn up the backup ... and they turned it on\nAnd it wasn't running properly and so they turned it off again that leaves just stay with only two gyroscope so\nIt it can do research with even one gyroscope but it cannot point precisely in the same manner and produced the same kind of sharp images\nCan do science but it can't do the sharp images that make it famous and so at the moment while they trouble shoot the gyroscope that they hope to work they put the space craft into safe mode to try to preserve all the gyroscope swallowed figure out what the issue is\nUm you know I wrote about the Hubble back yeah in a way yeah and at the time I said it's the telescope that will not die\nI predict didn't let that come the time when they want to de orbited the they are they going to send up a space a robot attached to it with the engines to bring it down I was predicting don't they'll they'll send up a robot to fix it and send it into higher up it and keep it going\nThis is the question is gyroscope shops have been the big problem they've replaced them all several times on shuttle missions and they are moving part that failed with time and this has been that problem\nOr they might be able to get the telescope functioning for a period of time with one or two gyroscope so this is kind of similar to what they\nDid with ... it sounds like a Kepler a reply handler yes\nThat's very similar and so they can do some research\nBut with Hubble its capital capital was was a very small optical telescope designed to look for very specific thing although it was a much larger or optical telescope design to as a general observatory all astronauts do all kinds of research and it was designed to look at the whole sky up in space\nAnd if if they go to only one or two drivers are going to have to limit where it can look and it's going to limit it to its possibilities and it well I\nI I'm pretty sure the images will not be as sharp as they were before that once again they can do good science with such slightly fuzzy images strongly rejected that up until ... launched for for the images to the atmosphere [noise] but um we could be looking at a loss of\nAll the only optical telescope of any we'll note in space and there is no optical telescope in the works to replace it this point I I I I well\nDon't wanna worry anymore right I'm going to stop or a fresh fresh positive peer Bob ... double as we come back to curiosity as well\nAnd back to be a these are wonderful little robots and they need our attention so we'll come back we want to go to honoring Apollo away they're finally getting around to it Bob you've influence them\nI think bill Anders more than anybody else into into influence and this is the\nUh he was one of the three astronauts on Apollo way back in Nineteen sixty eight the first mission to go into orbit around the moon and as you point out I wrote a book or the first history of that mission genesis starve Apollo writes about America's great triumph too when the space race in the sixties [laughter]\nWhat happened is when when they land as he was in charge of photography and he was in charge of basically putting together the maps that they would use his guidance and navigation guidance as they were coming in and around the planet\nAnd he was in a very unique position he could recommend a lot of names to go on the on the maps to help astronauts are on this mission as well as future missions Apollo eleven to figure out where they wore and when they should do things and so he picked three ... a big craters\nUm uh just on the other side of the mood\nAs Borman level and Anders and uh you know what's the tradition of the explorers get to name things well the international astronomical union that group of pop shirt\nI'm a stuffed shirt a love\nOn\nHis name's they refused to accept his name's back in the sixties and so what did he do he's been fighting them for years to try to get some of the names that he and the other astronauts picked for the Apollo and the Apollo missions\nAnd what happened this past weekend I was at an event in Chicago honoring the three astronaut they got together it was a big dinner at the museum of science and technology of fundraising for them they announced and I posted this on the Web page the day before with the picture\nUm that they have now named to craters which way in the EU during the ... in the earth famous for its rise picture the bill Anders took\nThese two creators are in that image one they named eight homework and that's actually an honor ... who was involved in those negotiations he didn't want to credit named after him but a whole board that crater was the one he keyed on when he was navigating and firing engines\nAnd the other crater they named was Anders earth rise to the bigger crater in the earth rise image and that was to honor the earth rise image itself the tea talk\nAt a third or create a third feature on the moon was officially named mountain Maryland this is a mountain that the Jim Lovell pick named it after his wife because it's a mountain and that is a key landmark for the Apollo eleven landings and\nHe named it on his own and they have finally officially recognize that this kind of a is a ... a a corrects the injustice of decades ago where they didn't name things as he as the astronauts picked\nThe A R U is is a power game and they like to control the names of every Boulder in the universe and they don't really have that right and eventually that's going to dissolve away people in space will use the names that he's astronaut picked without question\nBut tax advantage ... why Bob what what are they need Vandenberg for\nWhile

it worked in this was one of the reasons I came to the story because I was reading about the history of their mind\nWhich was founded roughly in Nineteen thirty nine to\nTeach the art of escape innovation or in the previous war a there was no such instruction there was no such a ... you weren't given supplies you were given compasses in math in case you were shot down and so in World War two they started M. I. nine to help pilots who came down behind enemy lines and Jim Bennett\nTo learn the art of escape and World War one was one of the lead lecturers going from air base to air base throughout the war and it was only until I got to a gym Bennett and read his lectures about what he did and holds men in a McCain\nDoes it occurs to me Neal and I only speculate here that the reason the a ... of the escape techniques used in your book are so familiar and we see them in the great escape movie and I read stories around the writing of that great escape movie is that Bennet is the link\nHe was teaching what you need the chemicals that camera I'm making friends with the camp a camp supernova ... a ... a ... keeping lookouts it's all recognizable and it would have been Bennett that carries that string of knowledge into the second war he\nI mean it was not just then it it was a number of of of the world war one escape heroes Bob Bennett was probably one of a line of of of a dozen lectures but they were teaching 'em the art of escape and they were teaching lessons that they learned and so they use the echoes in the stories of World War one and World War two\nUm and I will say that in my nine was remarkable organization in World War one roughly five hundred and Seventy a officers and enlisted ranks who found themselves behind enemy lines made it back to freedom in World War two those numbers amount to roughly thirty three\nThousand yes an important detail here at least in the first ... what we're talking about [laughter] it was incumbent upon the officers to attempt to escape at all times that that was their orders when they were captured they were not passive\nThey were not asked of 'em I mean there were there were a bunch there was a subset who are inveterate escape escape days I mean you'd use couldn't keep him down\nThere were others who were told and knew that they should escape to occupy the Germans are in preventing that up but the subset these escape artists were the ones who were were going after the walls at night and day from the moment they were\nCaptured and that's what we're addressing that some sad who are supported by the whole camp all of the prisoners support them\nUh distracting keeping the guards away or supporting them with supplies everything but we're going to go to Holtzman didn't via some other camps where our heroes spend time in the book is the escape artist this is the greatest escape of the ... of the great war\nOf the first for one hundred years past abandoned daredevil pilots the greatest prison break the great more I'm John bachelor the John that social\n\nBalance of nature's fruits and veggies in a capsule I thought I had a sinus headache for a few days but I had a ...\nAverage of the brain and the show and I was at my desk but I was on a respirator in a coma for thirty five days later I stay home in a wheelchair and double vision I had to learn to walk again to speak again why didn't want us to write the alphabet you know if I did a little ...
