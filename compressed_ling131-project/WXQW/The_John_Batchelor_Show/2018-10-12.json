male\nHistorically life wasn't better for you than it is and the current moment Johnny Allen St someplace and even the president was saying this was just as I say a lunch that's an outright lie\nTo the White House myself several days ago and I like that you know unpredictable as anything just what so are we there was absolutely a press release that went\nDown the way you would think actually a meeting between the president was on us Jim rallies or by the way it was said or blacks really like to get caught up in the idea of racism over the idea of industry his comment to a point police brutality is to release the love\nCome on line but when we go to our\nMan on the front lines and the new Cold War ... senior vice president of the American foreign policy counsel she liked what a flat or you know just a moment\nYears ago Malcolm Ilan wrote a book about Russia not collapse Russia what I did not understand with the irony of the word collapse I didn't realize what we were talking about was at an enemy of the liberal order and that's what we now see\nAn enemy of transparency and a what we is deemed to be the community of nations are these last week said been on display in all directions he like can you help my audience understand\nHow it is that Russia games by being a prankster at bat and Savage or worst against just neighbors against a transnational organizations what is in it for\nFor Moscow how does this advance their story good eating ...\nRight so it got so it's a great question and I think a lot of it goes to a a a sort of a stems from the understanding that\nUh the Russians or feel like a box right so so the way a a good way to think about Russia's foreign policy is is that Russia is constantly catching the contours of the box and they feel as button or putting aside a dozen years ago at\nThe end of the Soviet Union was the greatest geopolitical catastrophe of the twentieth century and I have to be revised ah in Russia's favor and so uh what Russia is doing is a constant\nProcess of probing or they're looking for weaknesses in the last week I was in Hawaiian solidarity we in political cohesion and where they find it a an entry point they act both as harsh and this and a fire fighter\nThey both create a problem you know political problems security problems and then they posit themselves as a solution to those problems and in that way they increase their geopolitical position and expanse of western nations and in particular the United states\nThey report we discuss last week and I came into the press and the way they were too about uh the uranium tobacco waiting to see for air force base to allow Russia stole the three hundred missile defense system in Syria [noise]\nSo what do you think this means is is this a Russia really advance and get ready to turn over to the Syrians is this a change in policy for both for them and and is Russian now looking at his future as an arms supplier two former allies of the United states\nSo I think it's a great question because the delivery of BS three hundred anti missile system is not without risk for the Russians the\nIsraelis have said uh you know very forcefully that the delivery of the three hundred and not going to interfere with Israeli military aerial operations in southern Syria and that they can defeat the three hundred if they want to\nAnd if they do defeat the three hundred a there is a a you know there's going to be a lot of egg on Russian faces\nAnd I told my accent is that the ... that you see a team for the uh moved\nOut of the Iranians the taking over control of by the Syrians [laughter] that's a little bit of plausible deniability gave us the Russia's political cover to say if the three hundred malfunctions or pick up and function as well as they should they can always claim user error because the wet competent people are now in charge\nThe Russians would permit cs three hundred to be out of their control he learned to eat that these that credible [noise]\nI think so and and the interesting thing is at the at three hundred is is a shame to build a [noise] a lot\nAt the top of the line right anti missile air defense system but it's actually not right though that the Russians are already and have been for several years working on the U.S four hundred and not a not a technical slouch by any sense of the word but it is technology that you've seen the Russians become more and more liberal in and sharing ... parks\nThat Malcolm but if it's in the hands of a serious threat to ride it\nPuts them at a disadvantage it's a it's a series ... yes that was really very broad implications even for the stuff we talked about Lebanon before I think in any known as ... anticipated along with others and now you have been ... by the U.S four hundred yet the Turks talking but I mean the streets\n... it's it's um it's a big move from the part of Russia now and and the exporting these things it's obviously a profit motive involved as well [noise]\nAnd and this is why I think is the point I was trying to make which is that I Am the three hundred and it becomes more and more of an export commodity as it becomes more international life\nThe integrity of the system is going to be in different ways and it from the Russian you know they used to have\nA very strict command and control over this technology increasingly\nAs they as three hundred goes into service against potential adversaries that might defeat it there is a level of political deniability there is a level of separation at the Russian seemed to create from this so that if if things go ah don't go Syria's way\nIn the case of future Israeli aerial operations and the Israelis happened to defeat the system there is a Russian argument that says well they weren't using it properly technologies perfectly viable or this is really use your air\nYou John been on the forefront of discussing and ... says thing analyzing the Chinese involvement in international

J. are the great voice of the great lakes stand Andrew McCarthy of a National Review online we are in pursuit of a puzzle the puzzle is no longer\nJust Russia gate the puzzle is also Rod Rosenstein the deputy attorney general of the United states these last days to have created a significant number of questions that do not have the answers at this moment to my understanding gentleman a very good evening to you since last week we spoke\nRod Rosenstein much in the news yes for the ride on air force one and the\nAnd the generous words by the president of United States about a conversation with Rod Rosenstein but at the same time the expectation was that this week Mr Rosen seeing would be testifying to Congress the Judiciary Committee about the events of may have twenty Seventeen much in the news since the revolution the New York times weeks past\nThat Rod Rosenstein joke to remark Joel mentioned in some fashion spoke of the twenty Fifth Amendment and that in itself is surprising given that it doesn't seem entirely logical that the deputy attorney general to be speaking of an amendment to\nRemove or ... or ... for a an unfit president to step to the side\nAnd also spoke of this report in the New York times wearing a wire which I think is just it's a ... a\nA speak for using a lifting device or in some way to and snare a person's remarks that can be used against him in future in court\nAnd the New York times reported that and it was at the time regarded as either in jest or speaking light of that is not know that is no longer the case because since then we we have just a James Baker the chief counsel of the FBI\nAre testifying the ... to the Judiciary Committee that he believes that\nMr Rosen's gene spoke of this wire and spoke of the twenty Fifth Amendment more than once and to to people it goes to report in the administration so I come to you Andy first if I've got the timeline correct\nSo we get to this moment when Rod Rosenstein expected to testify be to the Judiciary Committee not only will not appear so far\nBut also will not pass to the Congress notes from that period of may have twenty Seventeen to justify his remarks that he was not being serious good evening to you Andy\nToday John well I think that one of the things that are\nIs unrealistic about the reporting John or at least something that's being skipped over without more uh ... without the thought that it deserves is why Rosenstein was suggesting that the president the tape recorded\nIn terms of trying to make a decision about whether this is jockey or whether there was something serious about it obviously Rosenstein did not want the president a tape recorded\nBecause he was trying to make a criminal case on the president's\n... the the thought that was going for Rosenstein is mind during those eight days when he was we know distraught because of the reaction particularly of Democrats\nTo the memorandum he wrote a in support of the ultimate firing of of the FBI Director called me a what was going through his mind then\nWas the potential that President Trump because there was a sort of a radical performance because it will were different rationales offered to the public for why Comey was fired because Rosenstein was being bitterly criticized\nWhat Rosenstein was talking about was gathering evidence to indicate that President Trump was unstable for purposes of ultimately supporting\nA twenty Fifth Amendment move so the idea is they tape recording of the president and the discussion of the twenty fifth to the twenty Fifth Amendment can't be separated\nOr this aggregated there there are two parts of the same all the idea was that Rosenstein himself or others who were having meetings with Trump in the White House we're going in there too\nUh in Rosenstein is mind record the president not just so that they could have recordings of the president it was in order to try to provoke conversations that would show he was unstable in order to get some\nMomentum behind this whole twenty Fifth Amendment pushed so the thought that this was a joke\nTo me is really quite unrealistic when you think about not only those two things the recording and the twenty fifth amendments but also the fact that this whole a period begins with Rosenstein very distraught\nOver the fact that he's being criticized for the call me memo\nAnn Ann's on may seventeenth with Rosenstein not moving forward on the twenty Fifth Amendment but appointing Robert Mueller as special counsel\nIs nothing jock you'll are about anything that happened in that eight day period and again I think it makes no sense to talk about\nWhether Rosenstein mentioned tape recording the president because I don't think there's any ... its role as a frozen signed himself as admitting it but claiming it was ... that means is so much evidence that had happened\nThat he doesn't feel like he can deny it so then you have to ask yourself you must ask yourself\nWhy on earth would he be talking about that and he was talking about it in the context of the twenty Fifth Amendment Saturdays\nBanning all all because of as you said before his reputation correct It's really about him\nI really do believe so is that he is and I think again we have to go back to that timeframe it's very easy I always find in these situations when you're looking back\nIt's hard to put yourself and to put our listeners in the framework of what was going on then versus what's going on now but what was going on then if you recall is the Trump Administration was trying still to get up and running\nIt was trying to get its own appointees in place which is in large measure a still has not happened at the Justice Department but I Want to underscore at a time when it was very difficult\nFor Trump's nominees to get confirmed and get to work in the various agencies of the executive branch\nBecause there was so much resistance in opposition to Trump Rod Rosenstein was couldn't confirm\nBy a vote of Ninety four to six with overwhelming democratic support and when he wrote the call me ma'am oh\nHe was bitterly criticized by Democrats and I believe it was the first time in his life anything like that had happened and a lot of what happened in those eight days as a reaction a destroyed reaction to that criticism\nThe possible here and is this could all be cleared up with a contemporary note said we're told exists the memos banker\nStearns as early as middle school does your students talk to your school counselor about them if you're a parent to your kids

[noise]\nYou are listening to Shaun bachelor show one exclusively on six sixty W executed out when you\nI'm John ... so this is the John bachelor shows how to use McCotter my colleague we're having a conversation with our colleague Andrew ... about Rod Rosenstein and his decision\nNot to appear before Congress not to give Congress contemporaneous notes of the events of may twenty Seventeen when from James at from a Andrew McCabe the former deputy\nDirector of the FBI and Jim James James Baker the former chief counsel the FBI when we're told Mr Rosen seemed just got the twenty Fifth Amendment and wearing a wire those important days but at the end of those important as\nMr Rosen's Jane after considering other candidates appointed Bob Mueller Robert Mueller all longtime friend of James Comey the fired FBI Director to be to be the head of the special counsel investing investigating Russia gate but now we get news and who knows if you can confirm it because it's the leak through\nA known sources now we get news that\nRod Rosenstein argue with James McCabe in front of the now momentarily higher Robert Mueller\nAbout recusal and recusal over whether McCabe shorter could or should not have worn a campaign T shirt and a family picture supporting his wife's bed for state Senate I Know that is all you have to go back to twenty sixteen\nBut the ... or identified with the Democratic party very prominent in the Virginia politics\nAnd a Rod Rosenstein apparently had this argument why we know this now and the I'm not a gas that there's that there's a competitive leaking going on here from attorneys because this very much looks like Rosa themes leaning against McCain whereas it started when McCabe lead against rose machine\nOr and or the Congress with McCain were a permission leaked against Rosen gene so the public is like a tennis match Andy the public's go ahead going back and forth from court to court how do you how do you interpret this latest leak we ... we can't confirming\nThat Rosen is seen as having a an argument in front of Bob Mueller\nI Believe John that it's a ... or or maybe it's a I Would I should say is the best defense is a good options are on behalf of the Rosenstein camp and I do think that the Rosenstein camp is doing a lot of chirping in the last a week two weeks\n... not only about this study about all the ah that that important may ninth to me Seventeen period that we've been discussing we'd heard a lot about\nRosenstein in connection with that particularly after the New York times article was insurance so I think this is the case with that and why now I say that this is the best teacher and she was a good offense\nApproach on Rosen science part what I mean is it find Medicaid or frankly if I'm Jeff Sessions\nI hear\nRosenstein talk about conflicts of interest and I think\nShe kitty in in\nOf him pointing out my potential conflict of interest ... as opposed to his actual screaming concrete conflict of interest\n... is almost hilarious I mean if you think about it McKay may very well I've had a conflict and certainly people at the bureau thought enough that he did that he was ultimately removed from the case probably much longer\nAfterwards then and he should have and in terms of the Clinton email investigation um but it's conflict was in for an show from the fact that he was involved in democratic politics just like\nJeff Sessions potential conflict of interest was also in third from the fact that he was involved in the Trump campaign and there was a little factual piece of it because he had had these meetings with Russians although it seems to me that they will those meetings are much ado about nothing\nRosenstein on the other hand\nUh seems to me to have a screening concrete conflict of interest in the sense that there is number one and investigation of obstruction of justice involving the president and that\nBy the way was reported today in the Washington Post that the FBI considered themselves involved in an investigation of a criminal investigation of obstruction of justice against the president\nIf there was such an investigation Rosenstein was an essential witness in that case because he had drafted the memo\nThat supported the firing of called me and the firing of call me was the event that people were thinking of as potentially obstructing the Russia investigation so he has a very concrete conflict of interest with respect to that\nAnd then if you if you add onto that the fact that\n... becomes an issue in the sense that everybody in Congress and everybody else's data looking at these spies applications well who science to Fort ... application but Rod Rosenstein so in terms of both the criminal investigation involving the president\nAnd the congressional investigation involving the balance of the Trump campaign Rosenstein is an essential witness so he has the conflict to end all conflicts\nAnd if he was raising conflicts with other people and not recognizing the clear conflicts that he had\nA I gotta say something's wrong\nHere we've got about a minute ... go ahead\nAnd what happens now and again one minute [laughter]\nWell what happens now is I think we continue to monitor the twists and turns here but I Do think that things are are reaching it a day new mall with a with Rosenstein reaching a climax in any event\nYeah ... ... you have a feel for Congress in Congress and losing patient can you tell this as it because it's now into a year or two and Rosenstein continues to be ... ... ... troops\nI think some of them are but the vast majority of them are right now heading into reelect and that's what they're reading into it no longer so they're less than a month where that's number one thing on their mind right now\nAnd Andy that's practical he can defy them as long as Congress is at risk and if the Democrats come up in charge of the house the free\nYes if he if the Democrats come up in charge of the house he spray or other than how he comes up and mowers investigation and I don't really see that much of a problem for them\nUm it's the tongue aggression with us to go and that's

depend upon Ross cause most and not reach in and deal with the deterioration in Russian transparency these last years this special since Ukraine crisis the breakdown in conversation between Moscow and Washington\nAnd we cannot say that the space efforts were going to continue on touch by that to a breakdown you mentioned the whole that was drilled in the capsule that reached diet that that created a crisis on that although it was a momentary crisis\nIt emerged that it looked like sabotage I certainly don't think the Russians will because as a nation they practice the kind of paranoid that sabotage he's always going to be a question for\nConcerts they have launched a criminal investigation into this right away they didn't waste any time 'cause that's partly them and they let us we wouldn't open a criminal in this case till we got some evidence but this is Russia they consider the fed like as if it keeps happening to be criminal and they've all they've raised it to\nThat well total why Bob after that drilled home so\nI think it's a reasonable yes I Do\nAnd that drove the whole was aimed at the IOC says this is named it I asked that science is now the the the astronauts cosmonauts our number ... until and as we get a second launch vehicle up because I Want\nTo be clear job I got to be clear they're not more ruined on I S S. there's no way to get a replacement astronauts up they can leave anytime the question is how do you maintain I assessed that really rural their their lives are okay I\nI agree with you on this with the Congress I wrote about this a decade and a half ago when I was writing the UP I uh that Congress and George Bush proposed that we would replace the shuttle\nWe retire the shuttle without a replacement for it was ... was not a feat was not bug it was a feature and their proposals and they went along with it and they made us dependent on a Russian nation that is not reliable in terms of quality workers ship as well as power\nAnd there's a brain break down and conversation between the two states is not a it's not a small matter ... who's saying it's a scam I see not responding with lots of tweets lots of comments in social media but they're not addressing that profound problem the new Cold War\nI Would also add to this job let me while today there is a meeting of the safety panel for NASA\nAnd eat it saying on coup quickly that well we don't think all safety issues have been hell dealt with the with the private capsules and we think they're not going to be able to watch this\nYear and we want more delays and they're not dealing with the reality here either these capsules are ready to call there's no question of it all their complaints I think a bureaucratic all complaints and they should just stop get out of the way we need to have some urgency here to get back to a ability of Americans to fly out are all capsules\nA Bob and there there there's more I had bought this now is a an investigation you said it's a criminal investigation but they will apply themselves the way they do a plane crash right they're going to try to reassemble the pieces\nAnd go through step by step what happened what we know is that there wasn't a clean separation there is a video\nOf the astronauts once the emergency happens and the whole capsule vibrates as if they're on some kind of a some kind of\nA a ride at the at a\nRocket going up the space John we don't really know what happened it was it a clean separation it's not clear even at this moment in time what happened that going to have a capsule but the capsule is where the problem is they're going to have to see if they can pick up as many pieces of the upper stage strap bombs and the first stage as they can\nThose pieces to fall down in Russia in areas are under their control that are not well populated and they know where they come down they've been doing it for decades and so they're going to try to track those pieces down to try to figure it out\nAnd yes the Russians will do a thorough investigation and they will probably ten point what the problem is but the bottom line is will they fix anything and I'm not so sure they will\nThere will be more news had we moved the I.

reluctant to believe the atrocities stories because of the exaggerations and the propaganda stick abuse or what the Germans did in the first war so you mentioned however uh for example that Eisenhower
