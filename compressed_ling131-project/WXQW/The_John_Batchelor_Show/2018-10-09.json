opposed to personalities or scandal or something a ... a Republican should do better issues and with Brett Kavanaugh's victory they have\nThe rule of law they have a Supreme Court [noise] ah they have the behavior of the Democrats to run against and I think even though district by district\nMay not affect Republicans' chances I think in general is giving the Republicans issues that will fire up their base that weren't there before\nBefore they had to talk about tax cuts and all the stuff at all well you've done for us already what are you done for us lately so I think the Republicans revved up and we have a real campaign on our hands\nThat if you have questions are priced yes\nGentlemen and the media learned any lessons from the Kavanaugh confirmation battle stab than\nYou are male no [laughter] well look I mean I'm I I think there was a good reporting during the cabin a fair and I think there was so bad reporting and I don't think the media is going to be any different than it's ever been uh some of us know what we're doing some of us don't readers and viewers will make up their minds [laughter]\nI I I mean look I think the focus on the media is\nA little bit overblown I understand why ... a lot of people but you know believe it or not it frustrates a lot of people on the left to just for different reasons so they're going to hate us and that's that's just the way it goes meaning left and right I I just try and do my job mentioned\nI think the Kavanaugh controversy represented the clearest possible indication that we're moving to a British style of journalism or journalist take sides where some outlets are clearly leaning in one direction and others are leaving and the other direction\nAnd I think that was made explicit you and reporters who even though they may have been a semblance of objectivity and they're reporting were declaring their partisan feelings on Twitter\nAnd even more blatantly so because it was such a fast moving story\nSo I think it was a clarifying moment for many viewers and readers in this country that all of the things they have suspected that almost half the country and the latest ... says the coverage was tilted against Kavanaugh was unfair [noise] uh it just accelerated all the trends about media skepticism we've seen these lo these many years\nDavid you're reporting from Tennessee included in that way I Am a Tennessee\nA resident who is working for the Democratic candidate for Senate and it's not happy with President Trump was and I wanted you to comment on that because it seemed to Americans their individual if he can't generalize what did you learn from our debt is so\nFascinating um she volunteered for the brightest in campaign and that's how I met her she is a registered Republican and that always voted Republican until twenty sixteen and she is somebody that\nHas not a given up her views um even though she given up supporting Republican president she still fiscally conservative socially libertarian a one out of a way to tell me she leaves and the second amendment even though she be okay with it again what I Would label it to me style that you need to compromise\nLegislation on gun safety um and this even though in the district she is in and suburban Memphis\nShe will not make a difference because Tennessee just one of those red state that you're not going to see the blue wave blow through even if there is a blue wave she is a the quintessential ... married suburban Republican woman who doesn't like Trump\nAnd because she doesn't like Trump is voting for Democrats to send a message and when I asked her about her views because I wanted to establish\nThe Republican bona fee but also to get to the heart of what her she was and she told me it\nComes down to the president's behavior and his ... and the way she believes he treats the ball and she said if you can't do would be a decent person and lead in that fashion\nThat ... that's enough for me to X communicate you and she told me she probably would have voted for Bob Corker for reelection she doesn't see why not but just simply because Marsha Blackburn is a Trump supporter and because of all the way she feels about Trump She is voting for broader than in some there are women like this all over the country in districts that matter\nAnd if Democrats win control of the house on November sick it's going to be because of women like her\nA job in the puzzle for me about the Democratic approach to Kavanaugh was change the subject for Trump did they do that on purpose did they think that Kavanaugh could be Trump how do they how did they get to a place where they stopped talking about what was helping them which was the president's tweets\nBecause the Supreme Court was so important to them and they are at such pressure from their base\nThey had to act and do everything they could stop Kavanaugh so they thought and they threw everything into it I agree that many voters are in the position that David found this woman or the other hand the last few days I've talked to voters who say well you know I still don't like Trump\nBut at least he stood up to the bullies are no other president whether it's the name was Romney or Bush would have stood up to the bully bullies they would have pulled Kavanaugh and it would be a vacancy all the Supreme Court today so well Trump is disliked by these people there's also a sticking admiration that\nBy his methods and by as stubbornness and by his stern is he got something done that they want it done which is a seat of the Supreme Court and they're not going to vote whereas before they were going to sit home\nSaturday if you're in a blue state with a dominant by Democrats in this cycle was there any change in the attitude towards Trump during the Kavanaugh hearing that you can discern\nWhere you could see a certainly with the Republicans they may were very very engaged and this may be very upset\nAnd I think one of the things you're also see amongst the electorate especially in the same as you get towards the center is a lot of the tactics that were employed by the Democrat democratic base sort of air rabid partisans are we're not perceived as well\nAnd they were perceived as sources of Robert Kennedy recalled disorder and lawlessness and those do not play well for the Democrats here with the vast majority of the center here in the state now whether it will hold off on a blue wave I don't know Michigan I think it'd be ... best selection but people are very concerned about the way the collapse\nAnd their grassroots quote

described as complete harmony they get equal pay there is um\n[noise] a gallery harmony between the the rest of the people working there it's very successful uh in economically and\nHere comes this

this afternoon I don't know if there was any later update to the evening tonight\nBut as the safe to know what I mean really caught people or the tragedy of it was shocking for people and especially because of brutality wishy tied them up and then executed them\nAnd they some of this is an unusual conduct PS Malcolm I mean I don't remember reporting something like this before\nRight and this was in some area and it's um [noise] ... it's compounds to tragedy because this industrial zone [laughter]\nI'm a devoid of factories and other things the day or worked in the same factory um you know was

it's the incitement it's their own going incitement that that is fed into to the Palestine community that leads to these kinds of actions we can't say yet depended ugly what was\nBut certainly um you know something that a compound the tragedy and a regretful in this but should be a message him yet we see about\nContinuing the today are again all sorts of a ... a threats and and the negative comments both directed at the Palestinians in Gaza\nWhere he ordered them to cut off the the flow of fuel and threatening the boat Israel from them Israel that was going to deliver it for the next ... threatening to people who were going to work on it\nAnd at the same time we see them continuing to incite the rioting and the and know condemnation of it no combination when innocent are are killed Israelis were killed including\nI'm Mr fooled recently uh so it it it creates an atmosphere where these kind of acts even if this particular one may have had some additional motivation\nIs outrage the foreign minister of Iran meaningless ... the foreign minister Russia he was working to in some fashion defeat or work around the sanctions against Russia working with the EU Malcolm or the separate enterprises\nIt's separate enterprises but you're right on both counts on the first one lab Robbins every for meeting about uh oil and you know that Iran has accused Russia and\n... and collaborating with Saudi Arabia to lower the price of oil and yet there there's no evidence been proven given for any of these accusations and yet ... are meeting to to talk about a a energy\nAnd at the same time not only the report last week I remember the Volvo and the German banks\nAnd build major publication called for\nUm them to to pull out too for for they're not the beef or\nA ways to avoid the sanctions we see the oil industry really mobilized into town which was amongst the first to pull out or the first it's the French oil company wouldn't join us efforts to bypass the sanctions they said they can't afford to be banned from the U.S financial system any the the Italy's a major and a\nConglomerate oil conglomerates that we have no presence anymore in Iran and were whatever contracts expire in November a subset of the same that refinery in Spain said they're getting one shipment\nAnd that's it in in a I think in November and then and we see the overall numbers dropping to Europe from eight hundred and forty three to four hundred and twenty two thousand barrels and think it's um and and\nThe top executives said that they didn't see anybody willing to trade rainy and crude\nSo the efforts to bypass it we see that the Iranians are lashing out in many ways they're going today the case against the United states sanctions and seizing a property was opened at the international court of justice the headache\nBy Iran against us us I think is not at all I'm\nConcerned about it but the counter message Mitt\nAnd measures and the U.S the finding again today that Iran is leading state sponsor of terrorism and counterterrorism strategy puts the focus on Iran and its proxies Hamas has ...\nJohn Bolton spoke about it today in very strong a direct terms in and said that I'm a

cutting off\nThe source of support I eat some would say Iran\nSaturdays we also sees me us also in many ways trying to incite Israel isn't it\nA new ... is is simply outrageous and given their failure to condemn you know we have this situation in the in the south at first of all failure to press the ... to go after the new nuclear sites that the prime minister cited\nAnd while people criticize it and there's always a legitimate criticism against anybody that fact has its record is remarkable it has reached out to Israel they are working together and economic and security and other areas and other Arab countries are now turning to them to say how do you do that how do you how can\nYou balance it because many of them want to follow the model and I think when we talk about models can

really exciting things that have been found but this is in the ... cave north of ...\nWhich are a John visited in which is northern Israel it's served as a burial site for the new to the people and they found there the world's oldest brewery and it seems that they were able to for men to\nI'm a different kinds of grain and perhaps used in a burial ceremony it seems that this I'm a site was a one way where the burials took place they found a platform of flowering plants\nAnd they produce a soup like liquid an alcoholic drink and\nDifferent than what we know is today's beer brewing beer will start only to go back five thousand years but this may turn the history on his head so a lot of bars now you can have a dispute about how old the um [noise] fermenting of beer\nUh was they found these three small pitcher mortars to use the storage one for pounding the Bering grains and before the fermentation and the the side I'm sure it will become a great a visiting side perhaps a great place\nWhere is it again Malcolm review what the geography\nIt's it's it was in a cave ... south of ... which is in Israel's north it's the largest city die but a lot of Israel's ah ah north and so maybe a ...\nCity they're Malcolm\nWas ... ... settlement it was I'm a ... that they believe the people there that need to pay the buried the some of their dead in these in these caves\nAnd that the um the discovery indicates or raise questions about uh about them they they ... between the paleo lipstick and the Olympic periods and\nI'm getting up gives us insight into what they were eating and discovery of traces of wheat barley based alcohol in this case so it's really very interesting I think it's still a lot more to be found there\nBut I'm a lot of people can be posting it's\nAlright a preview Indiana Cobb the upcoming weeks\n... tomorrow there's going to be a very special announcement and it's a one by the Israel Museum in Israel antiquities authority of carbon inscription I have not yet seen it's been kept under real wraps\n'em and they're going to announce it tomorrow so next week's report we will have an update on it\nAnd also a review of some of the amazing discoveries including um the ... the seals with the names of both ... and the profit uh issue Yahoo Isaiah and the letters but while some of them are not clear by piecing it together they believe that this\nCould have been ... amazing a connection\nAnd uh the reason we're previewing Indiana's because the overpass tribes so we just have a couple of minutes here can you go over your tribes India\nWell one of them of course if we remembered this for the last theater which is I went back to to visit um which was discovered under the western wall underneath will since our\nTwitter is the number I remember

temple itself and it stands above the foundation of the western wall [noise]\nUh and this these discoveries I'm open up a whole new era underneath that we don't know yet what else uh um\n... we're going to find but did they consider that one of the remarkable discoveries um they you know it's small compared to the big Roman theaters that that have been found but ... meeting theory could well

was just shocked and and he fully understood that there was a lack of\nOf of of of property rights a part of what we're talking about a lack of entrepreneurship and most importantly as he put it a lack of freedom for people to be entrepreneurial\nThat dates to at least eight thirty one\nChief justice John Marshall declaration that says the man most important to the foundation of the Supreme Court he was chief justice for a long time he's had a lot of things in one of them was he came up to the\nAnalogy that the Native Americans are wards to the guardian which is the United states of America we now call the bureau of Indian affairs [noise]\nUh what did Marshall in ... and what is that turned into a hundred and Seventy years later [noise]\n[noise] well I I think that the story you told to begin with is part of of what a Marshall and and some of the founding fathers were concerned about\nMainly that uh the indigenous population would be taken advantage of by\nA smaller groups that would take over their land and so the whole idea was to put the United states government between the people the the settler people if you will and the indigenous people as kind of the\nGuardian says this is the term as Marshall used bitter ... of the indigenous people so that that wouldn't happen a but it hasn't been that at all it is truly been that of a war to its guardian and the relationship has been that a meaning that\nNow the indigenous people by and large are considered to be not competing in the same way that we might say teenagers incompetent and therefore might have a guardian for a teenager\nOr a person with some mental disabilities so it might have a guardian to prepare to taking advantage of that person\nNow the federal government access the guardian to these awards and where you literally in the legislation passed much later Eighteen Seventy seven legislation\nOr called them incompetent until we deemed them composite imagine today if I said African Americans are wards of the state because they're incompetent I mean yeah I Would just be that would be ... she couldn't imagine saying those words and yet that's the way we\nTo this day a treat to

advantage so much as they used survey earth and law and the courts and the assembly too slowly encroach upon Indian hunting ground now we come to\nWhat happened to the Indians the west or the Native Americans of the ... the indigenous peoples if I recall correctly carry there were a series of steps late Nineteen century early twentieth century where a large pieces of territory we're seated to the Native American reservations\nAnd then they kept chipping away so that it got smaller and smaller do I remember correctly\nYou have it but you have a perfectly correct\nI'll go back to the black sea reservation work a bird visited the black sea reservation was a lot of the reservation was easily three times what it is today a until somebody said hey there's a smooth beautiful country up there why don't we call it Glacier National\nPark and the people who really want to do that or a namely the Senate and Sears of the great northern Loyola which ran through there but he wanted the place to take tourists\nAnd so the federal government said that the black sea you know that reservation we gave you well we didn't really mean to give you the west half of that reservation we're going to protect it as a national parks and here I ... I Can't remember the number precisely but it was around ... million three hundred thousand that they pay them so there's this chunk of land [noise]\nAh so they did in some sense get paid\nBut again that was the guardian who is negotiating a contract with the guardian [laughter]\nSo the war really didn't have much say so these loans were more taken away and eh through this process of the coal

his part but then again though these are the times what is your understanding of impeaching an sitting associate justice of the Supreme Court would this suit the Democratic tactic good evening to\nJohn well I I think that you're quite right to highlight the uh the unlikely you heard of this but also that it's a it is the tenor of the times because my own view of it is but it's such an outlandish idea and it has less than zero\nChance of success at\nThe purpose of this is is clearly both fundraising for the Democratic party and also\nJoining up the base for the the twenty nine day stretch run to a to election day\nUnder circumstances where it really does look like\nThe the outrageous way that the Brett Kavanaugh's confirmation hearing was conducted has galvanized\nOr the Republicans I think like nothing else prior to President Trump's election and I suspect that Jerry ... Adler is a is reacting to that and and trying to tend to his own base\nAnd the talk of impeaching an associate justice system Supreme Court is that straightforward Andy or their twist here\nThere are there are a number of choice John one is that uh the constitution says that the justices of the Supreme Court serves during good\nBehavior or and that is a plot took a ball I Believe as well to other a judicial officer of the United states and a strong argument to be made now I don't think that this has ever been a litigated and\nI don't know that it wouldn't be litigated because the constitution really does commit a the decision of what an impeachable offenses to the house of representatives and then the Senate gets the tests on whether it's a multiple or not\nAh but the issue the issue would be can you impeach somebody from a judicial office on the basis of a a a non judicial acts and things that have nothing to do with those um responsibilities as a justice of the United states and in particular acts\nThat happen thirty six years ago that according to the people who raise them or go to his character\nBut don't say anything about his conduct does a judicial officer\nThat is going to shun granted a representative Adler is a gracious appetite for impeachment if they do\nFollow through with it for this present some problems for ... for [noise] yeah I think that would be tremendous\nFor for um\nSo Ford because I don't think and this is another reason why I think that this doesn't have the chance of actually going anyplace um wanna be astonishing things I think that he is that that uh happened\nDuring the hearing and I refer to it in a column I wrote from from the hill by explaining that you know I come from the\nFederal court rooms in New York or not from the Sigmund Freud theater on Capitol Hill but they actually have two people who have told diametrically irreconcilable\nStories to be the two versions of events are completely diametrically opposed and the good figuring out which one is true is vital to how people should think about this controversy\nAnd in where I come from which is the world of above of prosecution in courtrooms what you would say looking at something like this very simply if somebody is lying here and we've got to figure out who it is\nA somehow for three weeks in Washington they decided to tiptoe around that issue which is the main issue so we got a bunch of psychobabble regarding professor Ford that you know perhaps a she was right about everything she certainly went through a terrible traumatic event\nShe certainly was the victim of sexual abuse of some kind but she simply wrong about the identity of the perpetrator even though it's somebody she testified that she knew beforehand so this is not mistaken identity situations\nAre and she was a hundred percent sure according to her testimony that it was he\nA and then on the on the Kavanaugh side of things\nHe was such a compelling witness that nobody dared it during the hearing called him a liar to his face so the myths about him is that uh he had occasionally a few too many beers when he was in high school and\nThat maybe he committed a sexual assault while he was in a drunken stupor and forgot about it for thirty six years which seems to me to be equally preposterous\nUm but the the unfortunate worry insult of all this is we never really\nHad a\n... a real fact finding proceeding about who was telling the truth\nAnd well Kavanaugh has the better of the argument because a Ford story is completely uncorroborated\nHe gets to the Supreme Court with a cloud over him because so many people on Capitol Hill including Republicans conceded the credibility and sincerity of professor Ford's account or even\nThough they they say that you know it must be mistaken identification which is exactly what she says it wasn't\nAbout lessons learned ah quite separate from the particulars of the four remarks and Kevin remarks is it your measure Andy that this is now the ... and now to be the new standard in advise and consent to search for a revelation\nThat you keep to yourself until the proper moment and then you spring it on the opposing party and turn the hearings into a display is that is that where we are and is that where we will stay your measure\nYou know I don't I don't think so John I think that this is not so much about advice and consent as it is about the the new radical left and coming to grips with what its tactics are and how it'll proceed going forward it is my view for what it's worth\nInterference by the Russians in the twenties sixteen election Andy when this news came last week it received no attention whatsoever even on our\nA Republican channels because Kavanaugh overwhelmed the news cycle it struck me at the time with my mouth open that there is a fact that we needed for a long time did it strike you that way ending\nIt sure did it was a and it's interesting that it came out as you say overwhelmed by the cabinet story because um\nWhat this fact is is something that you would not knowing the Kavanaugh story which is called cooperation\nBut this is actually what we've been discussing and talking about all along it goes to what the FBI and Justice Department knew at the time that they went to the court and importantly John what they withheld from the bicycle or\nA we have to put underscore here that ... is basically the law firm cut out for the Clinton campaign it's the nexus between uh the FBI and\nThe ... which caught the CIA and the Clinton campaign which produced it so this is a very important development and probably even in in a time when um when we didn't have an overwhelming story like Kavanaugh or it\nWould have been ignored in the mainstream media is not the conservative media Saturdays\n... out sooner if it weren't for the ... the FBI and the deer abused regarding some of the documents are barely ... believe it was forty three something like that\nYeah well ... for no forty three is something that we we've discussed a particularly at the time when the house\nA report came out the house intelligence committees are Devin Nunes is committees a report or that ... know\nWas very important but at the time because it was indicative of a lot of the information that the FBI had that was being held back and then the moral of the story back then\nIs that while they were you know ranting and raving about how they couldn't disclose this information because national security was at stake and methods and sources of intelligence would be compromised what we find it again and again and again is that when they were withholding information it's because it's politically embarrassing\nAnd I don't want to say that you know I've lived and worked\nIn this ticket I don't want to suggest that there is not national defense information that's important that message and sources of intelligence not important uh to to protect\nBut at the same time it has long been known that the government's ability to classify things and to have this under this whole carrot pace of secrecy is a very convenient way to hide the misconduct and wash\nRod Rosenstein the deputy attorney

question about the Aspen revelation\n[noise] uh the deputy attorney general had reason to have the ... in front of him and manned twenty Seventeen when he joined the Trump Administration after all there had been free of them already and he was looking to sign the fourth in that fight the war and he had he had Michael Saltsman its name\nI'm puzzled Andy when you have evidence that the public and the Congress has not been told the full truth over the acquiring the fight the war and and the allegation by the by many that device award process with abused when you have it in front of you are you not\nCharged for possible compelled to reveal that fact as opposed to say keeping it concealed which is what Mr Rosen scene and his allies have done for Eighteen months\n[noise] they should be the most transparent\nPeople of all John and yet a there is opaque as a as anyone who came before them and I will say this for attorney general and deputy attorney general Rosenstein I think he tried very hard in his last house testimony not\nTo answer the question of whether he read what he signed off on and I would I Would caution that the attorney general's signature that you get Rosenstein is do\nWhich is not much of the attorney general's signature on a ... an application is a a basically a certification that all of the legal requirements um have\nBeen all those boxes and the statute had been checked\nWhereas the when the FBI signs off on it they are\nTerrifying or purporting to verify the information in the warrant\nNevertheless I think in a situation like this if he read every word that Warren and ask hard questions before it went to the court or is that is really a serious dereliction of duty and I would also point out or as we've discussed a number of times\nEvery single Warren\nThe warrant that ah Rosenstein signed said that the FBI believes that the ... the that not only Carter Page who was the subject of the war\nBut perhaps other people in the Trump campaign participated and coordinated in the Russian government's interference in the twenty sixteen election specifically the cyber espionage\nThat representation was made in the war and as an assertion that representation was made in the war that Rosenstein signed\nStatus and today that we've seen evidence yet I keep waiting yeah you would think that\nUm are we not only had seen the evidence but that ... that Rosenstein\nWould have seen and been aware of the evidence when he signed that warrants in June twenty Seventeen because that was the fourth warrant they had been at it for you know I mean they were essentially out of the better part of a year but they had been at it for about nine months\nAnd Michael Saltsman is not it's not in consequential that Michael assessment at Perkins call I represented the cyber wing of the department and he was connected to crowd strike\nCrowd strike you will recall from your dissent memories of Russia gate before Kevin ... crowd strike is the

a negative is no longer press in at least in this economy\nWell yeah and and but I I think you're speaking to a crucial truth here what's good for big is what's good for small one big is booming and

businesses open up shop\nThey invariably open up around the big because where the biggest is where the buyers are that's the driver of their success the conventional wisdom about inequality whether it's in in terms of individuals or businesses is entirely backwards\nAnd this is from Pew Research center at the butt moaning of inequality among Asian Americans what does that mean John inequality\nInequality ... of the economic friday as and it used to be that Asian Americans across the board were fairly equal from an economic perspective as and they were generally poor\nBut over the in modern times we've seen Asians surge in terms of their economic success and as a result the gap between rich and poor Asians has grown\nAnd it's oddly is a is a bad sign the Pew Research and they say that in fact it's going to be the driver of a lack of mobility for poor Asians which is never properly explained\nSo I understand now that Asian Americans are extremely good at um said taking care of their children very good very good at taking other children are getting richer\nAnd that's good that's a good thing because that allows them to send their children to ... to private schools and to private colleges and therefore the number of Asian Americans on campuses in America have grown and I'm to regard this as a bad thing John that this is a negative\nThat's what that's for the Pew Research center so they they said that this ... rising inequality is going to make it difficult for those at the bottom to rise up but as they are very study makes clear\nThe Asians are rising and rising very fast and the United states all men economy as individuals and they're doing very very well so it's never explained why\nThose rising to the top would make it difficult for those at the bottom to cut basically emulate what they do in fact this is a great story it's a sign that race doesn't factor into one's ability to\nUh increase one's economic output in the United states that were basically colorblind if the Asians can thrive that's a sign that we don't have a racism problem but there's just no explanation why would the implicit in this idea that I'm an increasing gap between rich and poor among Asians is bad for the poor Asians\nIs that a someone that is a black\nPerson who's very successful should stop doing that because he would be holding down other black people or the Jewish people are very successful should avoid six should avoid financial achievements their achievements would hold down Jewish people why is it\nThat Asian achievement is going to be a barrier to the achievement of other Asians are no explanation\nThey ... the puzzle in here John might be where I just recognize this talk about inequality\nIsn't the inequality an expression of success when a when a when a country has an economy that's working very well it increases in quality but of course the rich and the people were the jobs come from so its upside down to say inequality should be eliminated it should be encouraged\nOh let's be very clear yes John ... absolutely in fact\nThe the the ideas that you and I believe in and that many of us believe in our the ideas are rising inequality the free or the people look more there is inequality\nThe more that McConnell me is packs much less the more there's capital being natural talent on the way to Alan realizing its full potential\nOur ideas are all about inequality and that's a wonderful thing be as an economy it's just a collection of individuals and the countries where where people are equal or there's lots of misery in a country like the U.S we see people constantly rising up this is a sign of economic freedom\nAnd for Asian Americans he was the there's a an unhappy\nUnhappy study showing that Asian American applicants to major university did such it's Harvard I think that's the one example in front of us right now are being discriminated against with some strange formula\nSo Harvard in it's odd way a seventeenth century America represented here in the twenty first century is trying to stem the results of a successful economy that Harvard has contributed to for the last four hundred years while John that's the paradox\n[noise] ... it's an analyst paradox and and that's the one thing I'd say the Pew report adds that it's educational inequality that's helped drive this\nCleveland that's not really true look at China it's one of the least educated countries on earth and it's getting richer richer same with South Korea free people thrived that's the big driver of inequality and people are free or in the United\nStates can stay do much better and so the the ... education is just an effect of all this rich people want to educate their kids and increasingly fancy schools the Asians as long as they're free will do well they don't need Harvard to lift them up they just need freedom\nTo John time that he is the editor real clear markets he's also the author of the new the end of work
