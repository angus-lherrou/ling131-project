border\nYes exactly right I mean they are worried about um a capital flight because of the weaker the more money that goes into the system the weaker their currency is and the less people are going to want to hold money and ... says the U.S dollar euro\nAnd they also worried about the debt load\nA so so far they've been fairly careful and the only stimulus measures have really done or to try to fuel money to small business which is actually a good thing because instead of handing a cash over to the big state giants that are not terribly official and they're trying to force the banks to lend to the small entrepreneurs who actually can deliver growth and the climate\n[noise] um so we're ... we're on kind of tender hooks and as I said I just heard from some friends\nIn Beijing this morning that that they're looking at a possible stimulus measures at these import export fare next week but I don't expect it to be very large\nAndrew you're the author of shadow banking and the rise of capitalism in China or how do the shadow bangs react to these weakening numbers are they a factor\nWell that the government in Beijing about six months ago started to strip the power of the shadow bags they had grown from virtually nothing to almost half of all banking and China\nAnd the government was worried about the risk that they were taking which was actually quite a legitimate concern and so they they traveled back there still a lot of money that's bouncing around the clock controlled by the state\nAnd uh so uh everybody in the entire country is concerned about a default and the collapse of banks like we had in the United states in two thousand seven so the shadow banks and the former banks were all worried about that so there are kind of a a they're kind of understand the reasons why the government wants to crack\nDown on this does that mean that there is a hard it's harder to get access to capital if they shut down the shadow banks I mean the reason they grew is because they were attractive and they were a successful\n[noise] that's right and there was also a way for a to get money out for the stimulus um so yeah I I my ... my joke is that at some point capital will be like water and in this arid desert or people will be running around all trying to get their hands on it and I think that's what the government's playing with now interest rates are slowly going up\nI'm ... and defaults are increasing because people don't have the cash they used to have\nGordon Andy we have these peer to peer lending forums many of which have failed hundreds of thousands of investors have lost money and yet the problem seems to have gone away from the summer what's occurring with the ... platforms\nWhere Pete opinions you know it was basically just the lenders except there are more and instead of being so they don't have any ... bricks and mortar face\nUp what happened is the government of it as it tried to de risk the entire financial system based focused much on these ... guys a lot of them are fly by Dr Kurz um you know sort of like a ... put up a shingle and start pretending that there are banks so they did a pretty good job of that by however they do the government doesn't like them\nBecause often it can fuel money two\nParts of the economy that the traditional banks don't reach 'em but bear in mind it's only about three or four percent of total lending so it's actually not a huge part of the system\nHas there been a ... a sharp change in mood in Hong Kong with the weakening on the mainland or is it something people are ready to ride out like a bad storm\n[noise] well I mean how much of Hong Kong's economy depends on the property market and that's much everybody's bigger concern property prices started to slow here which may be connected to the mainland people aren't really sure [noise] um as far as the banking system and all the jobs here that depend on China yeah they're concerned because if the deals dry up\nUm than their business and basically but remember that it is capital flight increases in China it tends to go over the border into Hong Kong and even though I was part of China it's kind of a separate a financial area so there could be some benefits if China has problems ironically\nGordon Andy I'm the room and be the currency is testing the seven to one dollar hum magic limit for do you think that there's going to breach the seven to one or whether the central bank will continue to defend it for the foreseeable future\nWell Gordon as you've pointed out there's rumors that there's a traders running around the streets of Beijing offering eight Britain and beat the dollar which is much much weaker obviously\nAnd charging a five percent of whopping three and a half to five percent so that ... which is a huge a commission\nOn the list I don't think it's going to go past seven at the stage a that's a huge psychological barrier or would show that there could be even more weakening and that will accelerate capital flight and plus the central banks stepped in in the past week um and spent four billion US dollars supporting the currency\nI think the first time they've done that since two thousand Seventeen so so far it doesn't look like they're going to breach that level\nAndrew Collier is managing director of Oregon's capital research in Hong Kong he's the author of shadow

New Guinea ... to Fiji and the federal state the ... I Believe you also visited\nThe capital of the Alan I'm ... Sharma show you went to the marine Memorial Day or for the battle in the second war it collectively Tom what he is the challenge what is the mission for the U.S navy in the end what is called Oceana good evening to\nJohn thanks for having me on again appreciate it and are you accurately captured or the trip and a couple of words that you are in a word that you mentioned twice which was the word vast and uh for me that was a sort of my enduring impression of of the trip we we started in Hawaii\nA man that was my actually my first time out there to see the Pacific fleet headquarters and get a little bit of a history lesson on on what happened there and Pearl Harbor and then we we went from there to to care about ...\nUh which in and of itself as a island chain of about Eighteen hundred nautical miles from tip to tip which makes you wonder how it's possible to govern something like that I'm On there isn't an island in that chain that's more than two meters above sea level so you can imagine the challenges that they have\nWith some of the climate issues and rising sea rising seas\nUm and then from there we went to pop on your guinea and then I Want to Fiji a ... states of migrant Asia and Guam and then home\nAnd uh the amount of time we spent an airplane engine jumping from place to place really gave me a strong perspective about how fast this region is um and how important is Hawaii as you as you know from your geography lessons is only one third of the way across the ocean and so\nEverything between Hawaii and that first and second island chain is just a archipelago of a variety of different island nations that I'm most Americans probably don't even think about but many of these nations who are critical\nNations that we liberated during the course of the Pacific war\nAnd so they're strategically located all across this a vast ocean where a significant track a trade a travels through their the fishing or the fisheries that exist there help feed a large part of the world\nAnd so ah the United States Navy is obviously critical interest in ensuring that those sea lanes stay open and that uh we have access to those areas and that we have strong relationships and partnerships with the governments in those ...\nThe ... the secretary of defense there's a quote that I read about your trip described by the secretary\nWhen you look at that and you look at they added on the map they are heavily dependent this is your quota heavily dependent on access to those waters and also on controlling maintenance than these waters for fishing that the economic zones out there do they talk about\nFeeling vulnerable Tom is that what they said when you visited with them are they saying good God the navy finally here\nUm I didn't get that sense uh to be honest with you ... what I did get was a a lot of questions about where is the United states than\nUm because what we find and all these places is that the the Chinese are being very aggressive and establishing their presence and you know you mentioned that it was the\nThat the Chinese Navy it's really not so much the Chinese Navy I think they're looking at it as a potential place where the Chinese Navy could have an influence but for the most part it's it's a variety of economic influence or is that are that are occurring on these islands that\nEventually would create places for the navy to have refueling and other areas of access in case a case a there was a conflict\nYou mean they're going to build parts is that what they're planning to do or by well because that's what they're doing in the horn of Africa\nNow they're doing that yes they are contributing to all kinds of infrastructure projects there um and so some of those are port oriented others are are related to uh just basic things like agricultural centers and I'll give you an example of a and I use is one a lot but there is a\nAnd we went to my current Asia and one of the islands and Mike or an easy on the far side we had a we had a team of CBs twenty four CBs we're very proud of them they do great work and they were building a schoolhouse there for\nA high school I was going to be a vocational school and they're building a very traditional concrete and plywood structure building with a with a corrugated steel roof in next right next door the Chinese are building a big agricultural center with\nYou know a lot of the scale in terms of what they're doing what we're doing was very stark to me\nTo see the difference there\nAnd also we've just recently in that same island pulled the Peace Corps out within the last couple of years now the Peace Corps men I'm In my car in Asia since almost the beginning of the Peace Corps so um I think the question that we were we were saying more is that a ... most of these nations want us there um there are accepting of\nUh the Chinese investment and may investments in there and for infrastructure but I think their preference would be to have the United states there with a little bit more of a of a presence\nThere and I don't think we need to meet them on that scale I think there are ways that we can be helpful to them in terms of technology and other a smaller initiatives that or give them a sort of force multiplier and not give you an example and Fiji [noise]\nUm the Australian government help define the fusion center there for the ... navy where they're able to see and have a sort of real time understanding of\nThe ships that are coming in and out of their their fishery zones and they're able to understand which which of the ships are actually registered and legal to fish there and which ones are clearly not and which ones are questionable and that allows them to\nUse the whatever forces they have in terms of patrol boats to go to the places where there might be trouble\nAnd that's a that's a modest investment that goes a long way in terms of building goodwill between Australian history and government which are who are friends there and I really also very present it in the region and uh with some of the island nations that don't have that kind of resources to [noise] to invest in that type of capability\nPossibilities of correcting this with investment policy regulation and legislation to that ... that overwhelming Tom right now too many different directions is there one of those we can we can work on right away\n[noise] well I think that uh I think what happens if you only work on one and then the others overwhelm the approach or taken in one of those\nAir you need more time you need many more well\nWere trying to build a ... you know as you know we're trying to build a much bigger navy and write um Penn that's necessary but uh I think the I think the biggest challenge that we have um is is developing that political consensus and I think\nYou have to have that in order to address and all these multiple crunch that's the difficulty and I think you mentioned it as well\nUm this is a sustained effort or it has to be a sustained effort\nAnd that is one of the challenges we have in government [noise] um I experienced it last time I was hearing government trying to drive a lot of\nA transformation in the business mission of the department um and do you recognize that large organizations only change over extended periods of time or even the biggest a corporation the U. S. took when they went through their transformation journeys ten years ago they were you know ten years of sustained effort [noise]\nSame CEO in place a catalyst teams all over the organization driving change and it is a it has to be a sustained effort and so hopefully we can get that kind of focus but we know we're all we're all subject to the political wins that were most of the leadership here the senior leadership here are political appointees so we're here for a short amount of time\nThe challenge we have is setting the departments that we're organizing on a path so that those changes can be institutionalized and carried forward\nLet's look at the common sense of this I'm following the stars and stripes reporters um the fact is we depend on foreign manufacturers for some critical components for the U.S navy rocket motors machine tools gyroscope night vision systems\nAlso at the same time we have only one for him in the United states according to stars and stripes are boarding a that produces a propeller chef for your shift and is that something that can be done by just sitting at a table and saying guys we got it we we got to spread it around here we've got to diversify\n[noise] well it is I mean that that is not the only area where we have that kind of on her ability we have the same problem with sand wall castings which has are that the critical element for rotary rotary wing gear boxes and we only have one source for that and the entire United States\nThey only have one single source that supplies all the large caliber gun castings a firm orders and tank turrets and\nI'm like well we have to figure out a way to try more competition into that and to that system and it's not going to be easy but I think uh [noise] uh we I think as you mentioned uh what what our adversaries are doing are creating a sense of focus in a sense of urgency around us and so we are going to address at\nFirst finally the word incremental at them and the idea of transforming suddenly I is that a debate at the navy right now what what you can do within that timeframe is that how you think about it um\n[noise] well you know John allowed a lot of the the acquisitions that we make and as you look at our third year ship building plan the fact that we have at thirty or ship building plan tells you something about the way we think about\nOur ships ah it takes a very very long time\nTo build them and uh and to to plan for them because the industrial base cannot get it quickly uh there's a lot of long lead time material that has to be brought into those\nAnd so um there are certain things I there are certain areas where we can make rapid change but others I think there is there is a sort of a combination of ah incrementalism as well as rapid change I think right now where\nWe're at the navy has gone through a variety of inflection points in its history um I had been sort of tossing around the idea of you know where are we right now and that continue on with you start with [noise]\nYou know maybe naval force one point or being there six for it gets you know where we're under sail and cannons and getting close to each other and fighting that way\nAnd then we moved to stay in power which totally revolutionized the speed at which we could we could move ships and the lack of dependency on whether if that's maybe two point oh and then\nMaybe three point O. uh after the end during the civil war wear armor played and and the larger guns move this into the battleship air and then the battleship era than it eclipse by what happened on December seventh Nineteen forty one and the carrier strike group a ... sort of naval force for porno\nEverything since then has probably been for a one Ford or to Ford three or are we at the point right now where\nWe need to be thinking about what naval force five point oh actually means and are we prepared to ah to make that shift away from sort of an incremental approach to a more dramatic shift to something\nThat's going to sustain sustain our our maritime superiority into the future and I think those are the types of debates that we are having\nA maybe not frame that way that sort of intellectual construct that I've just been tossing around with with my staff here but something like that I think is what they're talking about the war college and in other places about are we really at that inflection point where where we need to think about things are dramatically different like\nFinally Tom a big picture\nA half years shipped Oceana and I know you're doing an audit bell which we need to know what we what we need to buy for the U.S navy um when when you travel\n... urine in Annapolis graduate and you've been navy your whole life I understand that but when you travel these days people talk about the navy as a and vital element that they must have overseas and at home do they understand that the U.S has only as strong as the navy or is that something that has to be taught again\n[noise] um I Will tell you John that I think the people that I visited on this trip and these various nations that are out there in the ocean I'm probably believe it more than people here um [noise] and I think that's because they're they're out there and they recognize the vulnerabilities that they have I think that uh [noise]\nI don't think it's a hard case to make I think when people see the data and understand how much of our of our\nOur economy is dependent upon foreign trade and how much of that trade traveled across the oceans um disruptions to that would be a extremely detrimental to our ... our economy and our society\nAt large so I think there's a general understanding but probably not a specific understanding and certainly not a visceral understanding of that sort of within people's emotions at say yes this is the most important thing that we need to be\nWe need to be focusing on with respect to our national security [noise] but um as you said before you know we are facing a challenge is now an address or is it out or a much more sophisticated\nAre not going to wait a year that is correct\nComment right Thomas ... is the under secretary of the United

election of twenty eight\nTo the concept bandied about often on campaign trail democratic socialism no longer progressive as I'm certainly no longer liberalism democratic socialism\nThere are some outspoken voices Bernie Sanders the presidential candidate from Vermont speaks often of it and Richard has an essay asking what is it and what does it mean democratic socialism Richard a very good evening to you your essay on mine\nTo me that there is a candidate for the governorship gubernatorial race in Florida his name is Andrew Gillum he is now the mayor of Tallahassee he until twenty Seventeen led a group that also uh celebrate democratic socialism and I read from their mission statement because it reminded me very much\nOf what you're dealing with when you come across young adults who want to know what happened with socialism and the twentieth century isn't it a good idea that we all share right this group led by Andrew Gillum on their website until he resigned as the segment called economic justice\nQuote we know that ... predatory capitalism is the threat to the safety wellbeing and survival of our communities and our planet\nAs wages stagnate an intergenerational wealth is concentrated in the hands of the few pathways to opportunity are becoming less and less ... than accessible to the rest of us\nWe are uniquely aware of the importance of challenging our system of predatory capitalism\nAnd working towards a set of institutional arrangements which allow us to access the necessities of life from housing food and substance and health care I'll end there Richard because I think I'm surrounded the story\nOf democratic socialism is a dream a utopian presentation of something without history of very good evening to\nWell yes I mean let's just start from the beginning of the system as being quote unquote predatory\nA predatory capitalism and going down there is actually a technical a tourist or anti trust violations called predation which has been urged by many and what this predation consist of\nIt consists of situations where vendors sell goods at lower prices and higher quality is their rivals and the ... will come to court to saying this is an unfair form of competition\nAnd it ought to be suppressed everybody who makes those kinds of claims essentially is trying to keep a prize for\nAt the cost of consumers in order to help themselves as inefficient competitors and if you don't allow these access to take place what will happen is it the in Syria competitors will either exit the market will become superior if you do allow it to take place it means that the new insurance will not be able to gain a foothold\nAnd so the stagnant economy will come because you quote unquote stopped the predators what's missing in this analysis of predation under these circumstances really quite simple\nConsumer welfare also matters and when you raise prices and what you lower or access to goods what you do you make the life of ordinary people a little bit more precarious\nThan all otherwise meet and so it unless the gums talking about is how is this going to affect consumers what you have to realize is that by protecting one set of competitors you make the life of consumers more precarious\nThat also increases the likelihood of disease because you have less food and it decreases the opportunity for employment because there are fewer jobs going around as the old firm's stagnate\nWith some kind of government tax he talks about the problem of what you're supposed to do about the health of the planet and so forth and\nIf he thinks that what capitalism means is that anytime you create a form of pollution you are going to protected against liability he doesn't understand that along with freedom of contract goes to the development of the system of tort law which is designed to protect against a wide range of aggression is\nThe most obvious so these are kind of killing and murder and theft and robbery and rape about nuisances whereby you spill pollution on private property or on public lands in waters has always been regarded as a kind of wrong for which the appropriate remedy\nIs human joined it um if you have time and you acquire damages to be paid if you don't have something to mix the two if the situation turns out to be more complicated [laughter]\nSo the capitalist system has no particularly used for somebody who thinks that the way to protect private property for yourself is to destroy private property of somebody else\nAnd the rule that you've always following these cases is that you use an anti nuisance law\nBecause you must take into account the last set the nuisance inflict upon somebody else and that turns out to be a social loss not just a profit for so competition is a positive some game a tort creation including nuisance is a negative some game the traditional capitalists theory understands that Mr\nGillum clearly does now they're trying to figure out whether or not one sister or another is going to work for the long term benefit of the community\nOverall output has to be critical\nTo take a place like Venezuela and it turns out that you destroy the means of

economic advisors Richard has linked to the report has issued the opportunity costs of socialism Richard is giving the overview very quickly we're going to plunge into this\nBecause democratic
