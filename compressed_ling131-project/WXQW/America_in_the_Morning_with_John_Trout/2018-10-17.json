uh uh ... case because I Know you've had some thoughts about that and what the proper United States' response is in this case\n[noise] well it's a difficult situation because Saudi Arabia is our main ally against Iran and the middle east\nBut it doesn't uh it doesn't change the fact that we're gonna have to do something because the teams that the ah Saudi Government it executed is man a grisly fashion inside a [noise] a their counseling in Istanbul, Turkey\nAnd yeah we just can't be having that kind of human rights violation so President Trump's in a in a tough spot [noise] uh he needs to Saudi Arabia to fight Iran and to have a cohesive alliance in the middle east against the dollar is who have been to a destroy Israel and put the region in an uproar [noise]\nBut at the same time you can't just say oh yeah well you do this and we were not going to do anything to you which is interesting to see what he decides to do\nThat it is quite a moral dilemma prologue do it or a that took place three quarters of a century ago because much of the same reasoning was taking place\nNow we know of course that after World War two is Nazi Germany was falling to defeat an awful lot of its worst war criminals managed to escape one I had not realized at least not to the extent until a reading the book killing the ss is the extent to which the United states or the Vatican and others\nAged end up better them for what reason\nWhy the United states was very fearful of the Soviet Union and style and taking over Europe so what they did was they enlisted in some of the ss intelligence people stop Bo to spy on um Stalin and is a apparatus\nAlright thank you so much for the call appreciate it Tom let's go out to Seattle good morning Mike I understand you're going to get some nice weather today so that some good news for you\nGood morning a turkey has been a tumultuous situation they locked up what three hundred journalists recently and held our American for years and they want that guy from Pennsylvania do you think turkey is collaborating with Saudi Arabia and why why don't they release the tape if they have a tape\n[laughter] yeah well that's interesting because as I say uh sent me for Turkish president air to want is not a paragon of human rights either and I've been surprised at how strongly he's been coming down on this I think it must be some kind of a rivalry between those two countries I doubt that he's that interested in a life of one journalist based on his overall record he's a tough guy\nSo that you know I Wonder what's going on there the other issue this morning as you have all these international corporations and all these foreign ministers\nFrom the G seven nations who are who are very very upset and pulling out of this big international conference and I'm Wondering if\nIf maybe this will be a wake up call to the king and the crown prince that if you want to enter the twenty first century then you need to stop this you cannot run dislike as like a medieval kingdom anymore that you're going to have to come into the modern world and you cannot just you know do this kind of thing I mean maybe they'll learn if they're looking at\nA diminished power and money as as the generations go forward here because you can't rely on what you can dig out from under the sand for much longer to support that country and they they've gotten accustomed to a pretty lavish lifestyle and they want to keep their hold on on the people in that country and wants the oil revenues drive up a good guy dry up\nAnd there's no money to give to the populous and there's no food and no jobs\nThey know the veil the overthrown they're going to go their way of uh some of the other tyrants in that area so you know maybe this will drag them finally into the modern world I think that's possible boil\nA sniff out turkey to ... there are brutal dictatorship or they got to be sniffed out along with us when we need to take the whole investigation and then we need to take baby steps and get this resolved but my bottom pale will do a perfect job\nMhm while he's meeting he's in Turkey this morning so maybe he's getting some answers and he'll come back and be able to tell the president what he learned a close up let's solve the problem\nRight there turkey\nYeah All right thanks so much for the call seven minutes before the hour let's move on to Green Bay good morning Jason\nMorning I'll make two quick points that I'll let you go on the first point is don't fully trust Saudi Arabia especially post nine eleven I think their hands aren't completely clean up so badly I don't know but we need to examine this carefully asleep it any other countries that may or may stand to benefit for us dredging\nRelationship the Saudi Arabia and the second point is whatever story this journalist is working on their obviously has to be a grain of truth to them as far as we can never would have been assassinated so I Will look closely at what he was working on the war that leaves as far as a corruption than anything else he was getting the Saudi Government\nThat's a really good point because of that that could a blow the whole thing open of course they could just be the kind of thing that they're sensitive they are not used to criticism so it could be something that to us maybe doesn't seem that critical her that bad but maybe to them it is and of course who knows what they've got their what they've got their fingers on I have no idea what he was actually\nA how close he wants to anything that would that would give them that big of a problem he apparently didn't feel that uh that afraid I guess he had a bit of trepidation which is why he supposedly according to some of the reports we've heard had his cell phone running ... you know sending back audio to his fiance who was waiting in the ...\nOr outside so he wasn't totally carefree about walking into official Saudi territory but he did it on his own free will we've seen the
