absolutely certain All right thank you so much for the call nine minutes before they our Martin is in Kansas City this morning good morning\nBay good morning I'm law take on it is um I I don't think it's going to be a bad thing you know to legalize it everywhere and this is coming from someone who don't smoke or not a smoker at all the smoke or anything so I I think it's I think it's a ... one\nOf the clean his drugs out there now do you sometimes it can it can seem pretty bad and the ... sneaky trail but\nUm I think there's a lot of the cleaner drugs out there I think that the only reason it has been\nPlayed down and as a nasty thing and as a bad thing is because the government couldn't make any money off of it and that's just my opinion you know\nSo it can now because now they can you know they're taxing it there are the states where it's been legalized to the states are raking in millions and millions of dollars because they're taxing it\nWhy they can now but I'm saying over the years they gave it a bad name are bad looking made people turn a nose up to it because they couldn't make you know they manipulated the brain that make you a bad\nOne of the things that was a big mistake was classified it with a really dangerous drugs I mean you when you start getting into\nA things like cocaine and unfettered means or heroin or in the opiates those things those things are dangerous they will kill you so when the government lumped marijuana in with those then people would actually see it in real life and realize well these drugs are nowhere near where are all like each other\nAnd so they figure well if you're lying about marijuana they maybe they're lying about cocaine let me try that and the next thing you know\nUh you know you're lying in an alley somewhere\nHere I mean that's true but you know it's I Would I Would blame them for you know putting that that stamp on marijuana when really marijuana is like I say this is a fairly clean drug did you know and and and\nI mean physically clean because I mean you could see it I guess if something's been attitude although as I remember they sprayed this insecticide on during the Vietnam War\nOr or whatever spraying everything with this parrot clock to kill the vegetation and they said got on a lot of marijuana which are soldiers smoked and then the causes severe severe health problems when they came back so I guess they couldn't see that so when you say clean what do you mean by clean\nWhat what I mean by clean is um they\nDon't cause all the effects it might cause you to you know you you know things started you know alcohol kills from the time it goes in your mouth\nTo the time he goes out it's killing sales now I'm not I'm not sure about I'm not sure about ... you know what all marijuana does but I Know alcohol is much worse cocaine much worse crack you know it's much these things are much much worse than mere marijuana\nOr know now what I Will say to the listeners is watch what you smoke it out of you know 'cause well enjoying some blood what does that paper and everything made made out of ...\nOr dangerous or you got to watch what's her smoking it out of\nNow because you're rolling up blood you know possibly you know what's your role in it up which can steal lady cause some type of lung cancer\nAnd for those who don't know those are cigars I Believe or ... or some kind of a tobacco products\nYou bet you're used to do that at the sky is I guess the the marijuana anyway Martin thanks so much for the call we're going to move over to ...
