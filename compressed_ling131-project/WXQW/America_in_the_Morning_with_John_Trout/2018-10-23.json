mind an arms race with us 'cause they think they can do to us well I did the Soviet Union\nI think this would be a great mistake or to get out of this treaty rather than negotiate over inspections or

this is just ... part because frankly I think he's in the hands of the Russian dancer tied by the Russian\nGovernment because of all the ties he has to Russia according to Craig ... book house of
