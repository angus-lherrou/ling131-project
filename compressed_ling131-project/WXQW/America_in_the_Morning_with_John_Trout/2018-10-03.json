will you see in our our wages go up significantly due to uh the regulations and also the um be demand for drivers um\nAnd so yeah I think a market takes care of it at all I'm like the last place I work at we couldn't get anyone qualified do apply unless we are starting wage was like Nineteen twenty bucks an hour bombs and I think that that's kind of how uh the market should work I mean if you aren't happy\nWith what you're making no one's forcing you to work that job you can always go out and try to learn a skill that would require that would allow you to charge more for your time we we
