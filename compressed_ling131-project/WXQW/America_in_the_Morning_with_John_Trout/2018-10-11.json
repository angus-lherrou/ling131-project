of healthcare hoping it will help bring voters to the polls on election day they want to portray the Democratic party as the champion of health care and the Republican Party as the one that wants to take it away\nThat helps to explain why Senate Democrats forced to vote on a bill that would eliminate expanded sale of so called junk health insurance plans the\nFact that they didn't get the votes to support the bill and that only one Republican Susan Collins broke ranks and voted with Democrats is not necessarily a bad thing for the Democratic party because its hands this message\nAnd we'll

the only way you can do that is through the Affordable CARE Act the Affordable\nCARE Act or Obamacare does cover pre existing conditions and Democrat Chris Murphy says the low cost insurance plans that Republican support or not worth the paper they're written on\nFighting it's really sad that we couldn't draw more than one can vote for a measure that simply says when you sell insurance should

assistant professor in the department of atmospheric and environmental sciences at the university at Albany State University of New York\nDo offer some thoughts I Know the relative speed with which Michael surged a short compared let's say with the ... the last notable storm which was virtually guilty of loitering why the difference\nWell hurricanes are or like ... and the stream where um the stream is a kind of background atmosphere flow scaring the storm in the case of Florence is kind of a slow meandering stream so state or along ... a an area over a long period of time\nWhereas I'm Michael in a fast moving stream and is there for moving quickly to the north [noise]\nI gather that the terms of wind velocity there's no connection between the speed with what just storm moves across the landscape uh if you will it fits horizontal speed if you are a compared with the the speed it but it's wins him in the circular motion but do are not related ride\nThrough the two are related yeah [noise] a storm surge again or is there a loitering stormed more likely to cause more in the way of water damage done one that moves rapidly\nIt certainly can cause a surge ahead of the storm and accounted for a long to search as a storm as making landfall this storm is moving and it had a slower speed and\n[noise] it's an impressive titles certainly you have as a assistant professor in the department of atmospheric and environmental sciences there at the university at Albany stay you of New York\nI can recall a time up in my youth when we we made jokes about the weatherman and how accurate they were and by today's standards that was certainly true pre satellite and the computer in the host of other things today I think we may go the other extreme we see all these great satellite photos and that's true about things like Doppler\nRadar which most of us don't really understand but it sounds so so\nTechnically precise and I think we tend to think if he was miracle workers and then we would get on your case of your off even the even a little bit ... let's just adjust to what is the current state of the environmental and that was very understanding\nIn terms of weather prediction we'd come a long way in the last ten or Twenty years in our bill like heat or accurately predict the weather in terms of hurricanes a week I predict uh the the ... hurricanes or

for Texas they have the slavery between um uh Mexico air than Texas so it wasn't a a band of heroes and so forth\nSo so you're cutting out on the side of of of being honest as ... I mean in our ...\nI think I think his line just went dead so speaking of the Alamo care and you're in Texas what do you think should we not remember the Alamo\n[laughter] no I think\nShe said don't go correctness has got a little out of hand and they can build on history you don't eliminate and several callers previous\nNot since I was working on a good way of putting I went ... very good way of putting that ... you know there there's good and bad and ah you know people in different times at different standards things that we think are important today\nAre but we shouldn't bury that we shouldn't just take it and remove it and bury it we need to put it in some kind of context\nAnd uh you know I I Believe that um that's a good way to go ...\nSo I guess so well remember the Alamo and what what do we do about Columbus Day because it's a federal holiday we continue that or do we broaden it out what do you think\nOh leaning allowing the indigenous people day is just discrimination and the other way that he had it all included in what Columbus yet rather than a lemon night to it\nShould we should we changed the name of the day to discovering America day then\n[laughter]\nNo I think he is already established is just getting political correctness blessed so little too far\nLet it go okay I appreciate the call\nThere are there things are bad and good about everything and you can't blame it it's just hard to erase but the white people are doing it if you want to forget that good as well yeah and call it all this other stuff\nAs long as we don't say things are good that weren't good and ... and and buried the things that are good because I think we all benefit when we get our an honest look at ourselves that our history anyway thanks so much for the call please call back exactly five minutes before the hour on first like in mourning Danny you're calling from Kansas City this morning ...\nWho did a great job this show or the other day I Love it\nMeans thank you so much love having you well anyway I listen to ... to ...
