creepy this should be lit up this should be a major part of the area just north of Panama City and there is not a light on you have a lot of a law enforcement going down here so that [noise] checking things in different areas there's been lots of reports of looting in certain areas I guess\nThat's been linked to the storm will to Justice John Roberts has worked for and judicial misconduct complaints against new Supreme Court justice Brett Kavanaugh to federal judges in Colorado a neighboring states complaints there were statements Kevin are made during his confirmation hearings judges or received complaints can dismiss them have local judges investigate them or\nEspecially one that you know the winds and the outer eye wall hit those areas you just knew and and I you and I had gone back\nAnd forth because of some of the coverage on the ah the the Weather Channel ... um you know putting on baseball helmets and things like that\nThat Jim ... you know at one point but a helmet on it and then by the way there was a smart move\nBecause I Do agree yeah I Would have thought about that I always said why you would think they would do that more often even Windsor Seventy miles an hour I Would if I'm Out there sure covering it with the the debris flying around\nBut uh you know and and a lot of them are reporting from around the vicinity of of Panama City and and and really what the worst was to the east ... uh you know a ... of them and and\nYou just knew what you just said well you know it it seems like if you're just a casual watcher you might say well there's not really a lot of damage sure well that's because when I saw one of the meteorologists had down near there\nAnd you know she talked to ... and they just said no get out get\nOut and we cannot report you cannot report from a place where you got wins of a hundred and fifty five miles an hour coming at you that you can't do right which was a very I sat there I said okay that's a very smart move right well that's it wouldn't you know I\nMean does that tells you the the strength of this storm or when the weather channel\nRun for cover ... that's one indication that that you should to uh you look at the number of people that are that stayed behind did not uh leave the area did not evacuate ah\nAnd you know of course our thoughts and prayers are all was with everyone affected by a storm and and and uh and others like it or you know we looked at the uh the situation with with foreign so we looked at the ... and and covering that\nAnd and the recent storms in taxes you and I I mean go going back to a Katrina really and then a Hurricane Rita\nAh ah along the Gulf Coast and and then these storms I mean at least so much devastation I have a friend and New Orleans you know and talking about that you know people not coming back many of them moving to neighboring states like ours\nUm and staying and saying you know there's you know there's I don't want to go back there's you know again if if there is not going to be ah that that long term rebuilding effort that is a in some cases permanent devastation\nOr you know not only the physical devastation but of course the economic devastation of of a region or like that my ah my nieces husband station right now going to school in Pensacola he's in the air force\nAnd uh I was checking in on them and they were you know they had a mandatory basically uh order to you know stay in in a shelter and ah and stay there he's a he could not leave\nA but they had of course they are on the base where he is a they had it set up of course to keep everybody safe [noise]\nAh that's you know again I was watching a couple of the storm chasers that were alive on periscope and and Facebook Live throughout the day and one of them had plans to stay or through the whole thing or two to give us much coverage as possible\nUh but uh he had already are in this building he had a a huge cement stairwell that he was going to stay in\nA but it was the one in fact a drudge linked to to his coverage or that was that storm chaser but he actually showed everybody where he was going to stay within the stairwell and it was cement I saw a ... and so\nI'm ... you do look at the I guess the job of these meteorologists and and people and and and ah news reporters that are that are out on these storms\nAh they often stay right there their hotel as white they're close to the beach in fact that's where the weather Channel's saying at this hotel\nThat was right there on the beach or in one of their locations and those are buildings that are likely a severely damaged although they are bigger buildings and can withstand a more damage than some of the other smaller buildings are coming up here just a few minutes\nAfter the bottom of the hour we'll talk once again to meteorologist a meteorologist a Tom hale\nHe's with us he was with us yesterday he was with a with a performance\nAh as well and uh and Irma doing coverage for many years in fact in his career\nOn hurricanes we'll talk to him and John trout as well we'll keep us up to date on the latest\nUh as of right now Michael still hurricane yeah yeah it was Seventy five on our sustain words wins so that puts it out a category one just just barely\nA and and we're expecting you and I talking during the pre show meeting and you were saying you expect a and I think most to mind that the next report which comes up here and I'm In uh in forty five minutes\nOr we could see that downgraded to a tropical storm\nAre still very dangerous uh you know if you think about uh the the uh a hurricane per sustained winds of Seventy five miles an hour\nWhile they're not what the ... the storm isn't what it was in terms of its power is still dumping a lot of rain man of course those winds are still damage it so uh we'll get letters from Tom hale and John trout along the way coming up here and just the\nWay you have an election coming up here in just a little under four weeks yeah ... ... breaking news uh and uh some of the polls out there is some of these ah interesting of a poll numbers off from the New York times yesterday right well we'll get to a that\nLook at the CBS headline also coming up here on the show prominent Democrats or reject taking the high road and as a viable political strategy that is at you know that's after Hillary Clinton and\nUh a ... a been a while I got my black hair or a book or a no no no the former attorney general\nOh I'm a I've gotten Eric Holder Eric Holder or coming out and saying if they go low kick them a and\nA and we you know said this yesterday in the day before a\nAnd as well we spent the day before it looks like they're heading in that direction and yesterday was obvious that that's the direction that the mainstream now of the Democratic party holds is that we're going to be it's going to be instability it's going to be mop like tactics\nOr is going to be getting in your face wherever you are it's going to be getting that on camera\n... uh in order to uh to do it and then of at you when you had Eric Holder guinea the point of saying take them that was really the first statement of using physical force against your political enemies they seem to have no shame in at this is coming from not the fringe\nAs as recently as even a month ago remember we had to call and somebody called up and said well not all Democrats are like that and we said well your party is your party and that this was really basically going to where the party is being controlled by the left uh but now when it comes to instability and getting in people's faces and wanting to film it\nAnd and getting to the point of terrorizing people with a with a mob yeah how about ... terrorizing people matter where they are that has now become\nA mainstream mindset of the Democrats if you're a Democrat you know that this isn't again when CBS right said\nYou know that even in the media are saying well what are they doing here what's the strategy by Hillary Clinton coming out and saying it Eric Holder coming out and and and and saying it and so here we go I'm\nRand Paul and his wife taking on a Cory Booker for his for his previous statements and I still have not heard one\nOr maybe and you may have heard it in one of the debates if they asked one of the senatorial debates I don't know I didn't see that but I haven't seen in any major publication where you had five and seen in any publication and to make that clear I haven't may be out there I haven't seen it where you have the one Democrat come out and\nSay stop this ... is that it's just ridiculous and as we've said\nWhen you when you think about it I I understand why they're going there because where else was there to go either you weren't going to make the decision as a party\nTo do what they said after twenty sixteen was look we've got to go to the mid west we've got to go to fly over country than we have to start talking to people we have to find out what they you know what their names are either you're you're going to go in that direction\nAnd talk about the economy and talk about those things or you were going to say our bases radical left\nAnd we need to go radical left and so this is obvious and you know that they're doing this this is obvious that the mainstream of the Democratic party have realized we can't beat this site we add to that last\nWeek there is no I knew there is no road for them to turn around basically and come back\nReverse direction will you we said that to letters again really well and and you know when we set it after the election\nUh view because there is that at once they took that break and you know ... considered going to the mid west for a moment [laughter]\n[noise] I came back from once a month wait what are we

I think ... and then of course the political discussions and that information I think it's also K without her from a number of people over the years have talked about how you know they've they've listened and\nAh they have become I guess more thoughtful in their in their political views and I think that's a good thing that's all that but as long as the left starts moving toward violence and and shouting and and what was it that Eric Holder\nSaid if it you know if they go oh you're in a low will you know kick 'em yeah right and and\nYou know when they when that happens again I don't know what at what point they come back if they ever do to civil discussion Hillary saying recently that it's the other days well when we when will return to a civil discussion that's basically with her message\nAnd her statement I I think those with the debate or with the the skills to debate and the knowledge of the ideas on which this country was founded are always going to win when\nThey go low we kick them you know when you were talking about it though but I wasn't ... you know what things that might interest you and uh this though when you talked about you know radio and I knew this when I was\nI don't know seven eight years old I knew I wanted to be on the radio I might have that ... was dominant nothing else really entered my mind\nA bit like I said for years it's what I wanted to do I never thought I'd end up doing talk radio ... thank God I did because I I couldn't sit and talk about a star is born\nAnd Lady Gaga is wonderful performance every day in and abide by the way I haven't seen the movie so I've no idea what this wonderful or not I'm just I'm I'm assuming that if I'm working for a music station I Would have to do that for what a wonderful performance in the music was just wonderful not that look talking entertainment and we'll talk about our team at once in a while but to do that every single day\nAnd have it have to be positive about what comes out of Bollywood and do that every single day would everybody knows that would kill me to be able to do this and articulate ideas and\nAnd uh there's there's two things first off the people to call you and say thanks so much because I've learned a lot that's that's a wonderful thing to have wonderful thing\nThe other wonderful thing and people are saying might think well you can't really mean that I Do is when people call you with extreme passion of how they disagree with you\nBecause I'm always amazed wow\nThey really care what I think [laughter] yeah [laughter] I always get that really ... somebody's really ticked off of me for something I said\nYou're kidding really loud and that's interesting and so I did to me that and I know it's gonna happen but you know when we talk about the Democrats and the whole instability thing I Will tell you this\nWhen I'm during during the campaign because of the way that you and I you know we've always done shows\nWe don't care whether you're a Republican or a Democrat or a you know work where conservatives you know slashed libertarian I have a lot of liberal friends right and and and I don't know if they go to your friend any more of a well we but we don't we don't care the the politicians that we analyze we don't care what your label is if we're agree with you we will if we don't we don't\nA lot of people are bothered by that even on the Republican side had been bothered over the years starting with Trump when we disagreed with him we respectfully disagree with a\nOf when I first got to talk radio George Herbert Walker Bush ... read my lips no new taxes [laughter] so it goes all the way back\nThere with a with W we disagreed with a lot and and ah I'm with a a Trump a few things not ... you know and but the things that we distribute Trump I Will say our core to our belief\nAs as conservative and free market or you know a a people when it comes to economic things are and so we may be passionate about it but the vast majority of what Trump does you know I said what he actually does substance wise and the legislation that he puts forward and the executive orders that that\nHe puts forward when you actually read into it and his foreign policy uh I've been one hundred percent agreement with but ah you know to be able to do that to be able to go on and just tab you know the freedom and creativity oh I Know the porn I Want to make that\nAs it seems that everything is getting on civil law out there and things are going crazy I don't know what it is but it's like an adult would you agree that we would never had this discussion seems like I'm getting less flak yeah because I'm\nNot really getting there are no I mean there was more anger a year ago or two years ago or ten years ago or you know from the response that we you know the ... that I Would get from the things that I Would say very few and far between now\nWell and and I think the uh\nWell the tactics clearly have changed and when the tactics change and they go the direct route as they call it\nAnd it became they become of that it's it's beyond a protester it's someone who is going to be in your face and when that happens\nThey don't have because why do they go there because they don't have a debate anymore they don't want to have a debate I'm not saying this is the case for everyone on the left in fact I think there are plenty plenty of Democrats out there right now they\nCan't stand what's going on on the left and I can't stand a first of all had no need for Hillary Clinton or or if they did and they look at what she said just a couple of days ago highly disagree with that kind of tactics\nAnd won't use it but the problem is is that that squeaky cry baby whining wheel is always going to get the grease and that's where the cameras are\nThat's where the social media is\nI I look at it and I think to myself that\nThe reason and Benin talk radio twenty nine years and I believe right now for is insane as it seems to be out there I Know the flack that I get is extremely light I think probably people who've taken it to social media but I really believe that the point is is not that are\nArguments had changed any or had become stronger we may ... and I think it should be called talk show host you learn how to debate better and put your points are for better I think it's the fact that the ...\nPosition is completely and totally insane\nI mean right now they're just\nInsane and so people are going to look and they say okay\nWe're not we're what's what's ... okay I disagree with that but uh he's not insane like they are over there I mean I really think that sort of a ... you know you if you're you're comparing and you're say okay what about ... what do I compare you too and\nStock

'cause this gets to me the time of the year where the show keeps interrupting us are spending a lot of the show and a lot of the day to day trying to make heads or tails of the polls right especially after the whole cabinet thing\nAh we still don't have a reading yet I Will say this though I haven't seen any Democrat\nWith any huge bump\nI haven't seen you Republicans mhm with huge bombs and may be one poll right ah for example or the one would\nBe a the\nArizona race mhm uh where and I've just got my bike here but the Arizona race where I'm going to send them all the Democrats ESN and uh I just can't I've I've got my bike here for the um [noise]\nBut let's see I was just looking at here and I can't find it yeah and this is the uh the seat that as being vacated by Jeff like yes in Arizona and okay let me get there is only here a year here it is a ...\nI'm Sorry uh in the ... the ABC Fifteen poll that was a ... done ten wanting to tend to nudge she was ... up by six likely voters now the CBS you go without one\nThe fifth tend to to ten five had set 'em up plus three [noise] uh but right now I mean that said you know that's a dead heat that said a dead heat with again her showing it means she's never won a poll before I'm Sally\nRide so\nAnd set of mine has been up you know by two or three over the last month and all of a sudden the plus six appears out of nowhere and so either it's an outlier doesn't mean anything or it does mean something\nBut again that only goes through tend to so that doesn't cover a lot of uh of the insanity that went on last week right\nAnd so we'll see where that goes from a from here are some of the other ones that we have a uh looked at a and again we're waiting for polls that\nGo through the week you know really do the ... this past weekend right yet we still haven't for Missouri yet\nHolly versus a McCaskill the latest is one that goes through tend to and that has a tie\nYup so you look at a at looking at Nevada Heller versus Rosen yeah ours up by two how old is up by two in the late in the New York times CNN poll also you look at the NBC News nearest fall\nAnd also a by two there are so that really is a dead heat but you look at the swing\nA those let's see here the the NBC News marathon poll what nine thirty ten free and the ... in New York Times CNN poll was a ten eight to ten ten [noise] so if you look at uh the previous poles and the swing the CNN poll going back to nine twenty five through\nNine twenty nine rose and had a four point lead and now that swing a has been a total of six points\nFor for Dean Heller in recent days this is why we talk about pre Kavanaugh post Kavanaugh but especially the hearing and then you would look at the hearing that entire week of discussion and and craziness\nAnd then the vote this last Saturday as you mentioned that's really the the period you want to look at and of course after that\nWhat changed if anything change the minds of a the voters and which voters which group the Democrats as you mentioned\nNot you can't find one that's getting a real bomb but there are a couple of Republicans that seem to be getting something from it is enough

then some you know the system arrived\nIn Georgia overnight as a category three hurricane or a storm has not here to Georgia this strong sense Eighteen Ninety eight and those types of things just to ... with us when you begin looking at you know the\nFourth strongest on record to ever hit us about just under a cat category five at a hundred\nFifty seven miles an hour\nWhile ah ... in terms of what we're looking at in the coming days here for a not just Georgia but ah the Carolinas what is the threat still from Michael [noise]\nWell we're going to see continued rainfall in areas where they don't need any more rainfall that's for sure we'll see the system move through southern Georgia\nAh most of South Carolina and the low country of North Carolina where the ground\nIs already saturated the trees are sitting in mud any amount of wind is going to topple those trees and we could see some additional flooding in those areas I mentioned also tornadoes if you picture a a hurricane coming onshore at a hundred and fifty miles an hour when it hits the land\nIt begins to slow down a little bit because it encounters homes and trees and\nThe ground friction slows the surface movement of the hurricane but as you go aloft thousand two thousand feet up the system is still advancing pretty rapidly well that sets up but when the gradient and when we get a win gradients we get rotation and\nA potential tornadoes are spawned as a result\n... and of course when you look at the the flooding are often the most deadly part of a storm that's something that as you mentioned on the ground saturated in the Carolinas but but certainly even in Georgia a with this kind of rainfall flash flooding is is the big direct correct\n[noise] it is a flash flooding and the result of flash flooding I'm aware of one possibly two deaths at this hour we're not going to believe our eyes\nWhen the sun comes up I just want to mention that we're going to see drone footage for miles up homes destroyed of the canopies over gas pumps ripped from their mornings we're going to seat cell towers down\nI'm aware of at least one death possibly to\nMeteorologist John trials on that or at West was won forest

stop\nWhy is a but my first question is why as a Joe Scarborough are pretending to be on the right again [laughter] as something happen\nAt home uh [laughter]\nI'm just asking questions I'm just asking 'cause I like the question is what I said to us we were talking about that in the ... Michel mating what's going on there [laughter] um but he's right on the ... points I'm not sure if he\nActually feel stuck whether or not but he did make the point and you look at the um\nThe dynamics of of how all this played out and they didn't win so in recent days they become a well even crazier and promoting their tactics\nYou have ... who wants to fight the president and a ring pay once that he wants to ... am I may fight for charity that you have the former candidate for the Democrats\nWho says we're not going to be civil we won't be civil again until we went\nAnd and then you have did you see the Hollywood Reporter story ... on Stephen Miller from one of the president's advisors right I\nI I'm not this is ... we're not making this up this is absolutely true mhm by we are not because you're going to say you guys are making the suffer remember we end the call from the one Democrat who was just furious and said this was a life appointment we need to investigate all the way back\nTo the womb right well there on that path\nOf investigating all the way back to the moon story from Hollywood Hollywood Reporter we are not making this up because you you if you haven't heard this story you're going to think we're making it up\nThere is a headline from the Hollywood Reporter Stephen Miller who's the one of the president's advisors Steven Miller's third grade teacher\n\nSays he was a loner an eighth glue\n[laughter] God\nIs my witness they have there is some pictures you can see right there yeah there is Stephen Miller with his fellow third graders at Franklin elementary and they have a circle around him\nAnd his third grade class picture you want to hear how the article starts in Nineteen Ninety three Donald Trump senior political advisor intend to Santa Monica is frankly moment tree where he was off by himself all the time\n[laughter] [laughter]\nDo you remember the character and peanuts the one called pig pen and the dust cloud and crumbs flying all around him that was Stephen Miller at eight years of age I was always trying to get him to clean up his desk he always had stuff mashed up in there\nHe was a strange dude I remember he would take a bottle of blue and we didn't have glue sticks in those days and he would pour the glue on his arm let it dry peel and then eat it off\n[noise] uh\nI Would say the majority of male students at that age we're doing the same thing\n[noise] [laughter] [laughter] I didn't eat it\nBut I did do the thing where you let it dry and peel it off your skin I did that all the time I remember that was the only ... that was the only reason I ...\nI remember being concerned about I'm not academically he was okay with that though I could never read his handwriting but he had such strange personal habits he was a loner an isolated and off by himself all the time so as the eye and I ended up normal oh why probably not the best defense for Stephen Miller\nIs a no a Stephen Miller responded on Twitter\nWhen I was young by egg blue sometimes I too much blue\nI I like glue I still like glue the did that [laughter] [laughter] no that's the Kevin off by like beer bears Devon alright yeah come on the project okay sorry Stephen Miller responded\nOn Twitter because the headline on Twitter from the Hollywood Reporter and you know is ah the that Stephen Miller as a as a kid was a loner band aid glue [laughter] it was a response on Twitter one of these things\nIs true [laughter] that's all that's all areas um but ... this but this is where they're going in and this was a report from his teacher now where they're getting closer to the womb or now to third grade and\nI think um they should I think they should keep going I Want to know what those infants are up to all of them well\nWhat's going on in their mind I Know what's going on a diaper ... what's going on in the mind as a you know as as a fetus\nTrump kicked his mother over and over again it was obviously domestic abuse some\nKavanaugh to\nThat's the one guy gentleman called up a couple of weeks ago and ... maybe it was last week called up and said I mean it's a lifelong apartment we need to invest it all the way back to the womb what were the third grade now yeah there were a high school yeah well now we've got we and and the thing is they skipped junior high and went right to third grade\nI uh I'm trying to think what my teachers would say oh man oh crap\nOh I've heard my better never getting involved in politics my former or a a German teacher a deal shocking Povich his I mean it is still rings in my ear today mhm and by the way I did say this I was doing a radio show didn't know he was on his deathbed and he heard me talking to them and and\nThis goes back to Ninety three I was talking about him is on his deathbed ...

currently eight six six Ninety red eye let's get an update on now\nTropical storm Michael as we turn to meteorologist Tom hello good morning Tom good morning All right so where are we with uh with my goal and what does the storm in terms of the power of the storm still looked like\nThe power of the storm is still there and about five thousand feet we got when they said they're blowing at about eighty miles an hour they haven't diminished all that much and with thunder storms in the center storm went in and sit down drafts translate some of that and so we have higher gas\nAnd so for that reason alone that wind is still an issue especially when it gets a caution to North Carolina because we talked about this for four days in advance as Florence was coming in that had already had\nSome saturation from a remnant of a tropical storm that pushed its way on through and and of course when obviously\nFlorence came through the low lying areas that are run up through a Fayetteville and a south Raleigh that entire area is still very saturated John trout touched on it\nSo the trees are sitting in mud and that's exactly what it is and we had ... cents the event that we had in the Carolinas with a very slow moving Florence\nAnd as this storm moves up through there I think there'll be a lot more ... and also there's going to be obviously a good deal more flooding now yes they're likely to get about two inches of rain in that area but it doesn't take much for a little bit of flooding to a\nReef memory and develop and gets west of there where the heavy flooding is actually going to be taking place\nA toward Raleigh and then back up a [noise] a up into Virginia\nA Lynchburg, Virginia Roanoke, Virginia everything on the eastern side of the mountains there [noise] uh up to Charlotte and nor folk that entire area I'm gonna see anywhere from a three to as much as ... inches of rain as it gets further on up [noise]\nUm and there's a you know why not to include here the folks over Allen the outer banks from okra coke island which is down towards the south end up to duck they're under a storm surge watch an effect\nFan\nNow [laughter] I I guess what is the potential there in terms of that storm surge uh and and what the the heightened might\nBe about four feet okay to do more things on there\nOr you know it'll inundate some neighborhoods some some areas where it'll come out of the banks um but um it's when you think about it and it just goes to the power of this now tropical storm\nAnd its Winfield yeah right yeah and that's\nJust amazing I mean if you look at the the power of Michael as it came ashore a a Wednesday afternoon and something that we touched on yesterday during our program and that is\nThe the because of that power because of that energy behind the storm and grew after of course we got off the air uh the intensified that\nThat means it's a longer lasting a storm so you're expecting Michael to still be a tropical storm strength in terms of uh the when it goes back out over the water\nAnd reaches Ireland yay yay so\nWell on to our friends in Europe uh you know um you can have and we hope you does it does that does that are on the water is warming up that far north in the Atlantic to keep it going then yes okay yeah\nWhile I just assume at the time we got to October probably be cool down so I was surprised to hear that but there are still warming up the up\nAnd and and that's why we're having these storms in the you know the the normal hurricane season ends at the beginning of November right and so at this point there's a reason to that extent this is the fourth\nMajor hurricane that we've had in the month of October period and so that's and that's just simply a and it was unusual to have a major hurricane to begin with in October when you consider that there's been four of them total and\nAnd so and to the last nine something and it just sticks in my mind was and I can't remember which one of you said well is it going to kind of lose some power as it comes into shore [noise] than I Am my immediate reaction was no no yeah\nAnd if you're not feeling at a TA Petra location today while you're in luck\nYou can

percentage wise it's still not as big as you've seen in the past right and so it a lot of things going on right now especially in the tech sector I think there's a lot of\nA concern about regulation that's going to cost the tech sector or at least a slow them down in terms of growth and what they are able to earn because that regulation I Believe is coming and I think there's a lot of concern for the tech sector there um but the economy is chugging along\nPretty well and when you get a correction like you saw yesterday\nOr it is expected it is not surprising at all to those\nInvestors on the floor you know I I think it said you know they're just there comes a day when you just\nI I think that many investors just say okay ah today everything combined makes\nIt so I think I'm going to pull out of this and put it into a this because not only was the tech sector head but caterpillar Mm ah companies that are involved in international trained in the United states were hit yesterday there was a reason for that\nThere's a reason and the reason is still the possibility of trade wars when you look at it you know so the president said okay we have an after agreement\nAre\nOkay but everything hasn't been solved here Congress has been awfully quiet a on it are there negotiations going on does Congress want to look that does does Congress one\nNAFTA we're the new NAFTA whatever it's called the Canada whatever United States and Mexico instead of NAFTA nations formerly known as now after the ... the nation's formerly known as North America in North America and\nUh you know a a\nR I Wonder if there's pressure inside Congress I getting this just pure speculation but inside St look if you're going to do an after we got to get the steel and aluminum done we're not going to do ... do it let's get everything done and that's putting pressure on the on on the White House for\nThe fact is yeah you know having ... going to at least stabilize the market with some good and bad\nOr as we have gone through and we have gone through a button after because we do believe that if if the new NAFTA passes\nThe trade agreement formerly known as NAFTA if it passes it's going to hurt the auto industry and it's not going to help the auto industry is going to make cars more expensive that's not a good thing now\nInitially when you say it in something that may not hit the market at that particular point you know at that but when you take everything together the worries about regulation in the tech sector or all of a sudden the the you know the the fed or raising rates are the fact that the bond yields\nAre going up again it's taken us taking us more interest money\nOr to to service the the the the dead\nAnd the possibility of the trade war with China where there isn't doesn't seem to be any type of conclusion and still a great uncertainty about\nA steel and aluminum tariffs and still and uncertainty whether you know Congress really hasn't there's been no indication from Congress or the leadership in Congress about\nThe trade agreement formerly known as NAFTA ... well you mentioned now uh the the terrorists and\nPG E checking a ten percent hit yesterday a and you know this is a very old company but talking about raw materials and across the raw materials and and so as you know there\nAre essentially they're manufacture a and and distributor of of uh of of coding and special material specialty materials but that is also part of the auto industry\nSo the the the car sales are the automobile sales\nHave are seem to have stalled out for now or what's behind that\nAh certainly you know the cost of automobiles is going up and that is directly related to tariffs then there's a greater demand for used cars when there's a greater demand for any group in terms of products that cost goes up so\nIt is it it's a number of things that hit start to hit all at once and you go back to alright ... how much of this is controlled by either the fed or the federal government and how much of this is cost of government\nAnd right now you could look at ... and I think you could look well at interest rates everywhere and and you see those two right now sticking out but everything that we just said here is related to what government regulation\nEverything that we just and I didn't even think about that until you just said there until you I'm a wow everything is government regulation\nIs so you can actually make the argument that there were it irrespective whether it's trade agreement government regulation the fed rate you know ah on on interest rates are the the debt that with the debt that we have in service seen our our debt all of it goes back to [laughter]\nIn in some way a\nGovernment or regulation and when we talk about the tech industry and what are they worried about government regulation so it all gets back to that\nWe said this before and it'll look when we we've gotten into great debates and disagreements with the administration about ah you know their their policy on tariffs therefore or new label turf babies\nAre that the president came up with a but the look in the real world you raise prices it hurts an economy Enron story but\nYou can sit there and go rah rah rah usa usa you can have all the chance you want\nBut if you raise the cost of goods and services it always hurts and economy and hurts workers and just because you wish to chant or you know just say America First does it mean America is necessarily first\nBy the policy that you put in because you love the slogan slogans mean nothing economics is related to how people respond to incentive if you make the cost of goods more expensive it's going to hurt and economy not my opinion\nIt's the reality of economics\nAnd the story well and and again\nIt is something that can be controlled through policy it as something that can be a tempered and and why do we want the ... why do we want to step in front of the progress that's\nBeen made that terms of you know we'll wait what was being done ... has done so much good that when they do bad that's going to we believe hurt them because I don't believe that\nA Republican in the United states\nCan handle a bad economy as bad as they ... a Republican president can not handle bad economic news as well as a Democrat I Can't tell you why but it's just the reality\n... Obama got elected for a second term there was nothing moving in the economy right I don't believe Republicans can survive a bad economy\nEspecially if you look good economy and then it goes down over the next two years and what is it what it was the first couple of years I think at that point almost all Republicans in this day and age are much more vulnerable because Democrats cell that better than Republicans do\n... ah you know you see that the interest rates rising and the you know any kind of slow down in in major sectors\nThan you you put those together ... the housing sector at the at the toward the end of of or I guess getting close to the actual fall out of the subprime mess the fed was raising rates so you had these\nThese loans out there that were set to balloon and mature and as they were the rates were going up which meant when it jumped to that ultimate ...\nDo you owe the IRS more than ten thousand dollars to folks had sipping tax relief can help they're professionals have over twenty five years of experience negotiating with the IRS that's critical they\nKnow the policies the procedures and the right people to contact to save you the maximum amount of money they will negotiate ... plus protect you from bank Lebanese and wage garnishment do not let the IRS take advantage of you call now for free information on the fresh start initiative experience\nAs a small business owner you make every dollar camps still what could you do with ten dollars to go to lift a printed on ... today and you'll get five hundred high quality custom business cards for only nine Ninety nine a blessing to stand for cars and\nTheir brand your satisfaction is absolutely guaranteed still have never been easier to hearing five hundred strangers to connections to visit this to print dot com and used promote code two thousand and check out that this could print dot com tunnel code to zero zero zero\nDr Drew Pinsky the tragedy reasons suicide their ... and Anthony Bourdain brings needed attention to a problem the claims of life roughly every Fifteen minutes suicide claims about forty five thousand lives a year and a fax countless millions and it is preventable\nDo not stay silent if you were worried about a friend or loved one have been called a suicide prevention lifeline eight hundred two seven three eight to five five if they won't call you call the suicide prevention lifeline eight hundred two seven three eight to five five\nTo six twenty two pm time for Steve ... when his son Dylan to do the dishes and they talk about everything from the innocent girls to the awesome nests out his soccer team sometimes they don't talk at all then\nSplash by a car and it's the best time of the day because the smallest moments can have the biggest impact on a child life take time to be a dead today goal eight seven seven for dad for one one permitted fatherhood ... by the U.S department of health and Human Services and again council raised there oh\nJoin the conversation using the shell row tell a hotline eight six six nine zero seven three three three nine radio in St Joe hotel on making your hardworking journeys more manageable\nOctober twenty six visual Texas Chicken ... you know you're kind of restaurant is celebrating without electricity chicken fried steak and eggs or chicken fried steak dinner for only five million I\nWondered how you feel the same as I Am as you can slice schools and roads smoker who go to agree with his his flags on you know all these things just learning I celebrate Texas Chicken products that are just going to restaurants in central suffering sitters October twenty six you understand the\nOwner operators we know everyone has brought bed ... these days to make the best for your business in ...

morning do let that fully right\nYeah because uh you you you look at the footprint of of a tropical storm my goal now a which has been wreaking havoc on on a Georgia and headed for the Carolinas and it's it's the satellite photos or just a\nAmazing or just darling and and and this this storm again still has plenty of energy or what are we looking at a I Know we're a scheduled to get an update or within twenty five minutes or so\nBut yeah the last debate has it at sustained winds right now at roughly sixty miles an hour I'm guessing we can expect and the next report that to decrease\nI Would think so too drunk to probably fifty if that um it may still maintain itself but I think a ten mile an hour drop it was reasonable\nAlthough it looking at all in radar and just kinda clocking it died I I don't think it'll drive more than ten miles might pick up a mile and forward Spain gone to the north east it may be Twenty one miles an hour earlier predicted it would accept the United states it about twenty three to twenty five miles an hour [noise]\nUh but that's not going to be until it gets up into Virginia but for the exits out of here [noise] yeah it's a uh it it it's an incredible storm it let me give me a little kind of a broad overview okay along the coast and the outer banks they're going to see storm surge from the storm\nIn the Carolinas of two to four feet that's water inundation wise and then you can at high tide waves which could cause some problems [laughter]\nIt's not the biggest one and then we'll be another one or not the biggest one it will be ... feet are banned soon we'll be talking about the potential for tornadoes now these tornadoes and the feeder bands to feed her bans are coming in from the eastern moving off to the west so that kind of curbing from southeast northwest\nAnd the bans have an individual storms at 'em and they're moving out to about forty miles an hour\nNow those individual storms are capable of breeds spin tornadoes\nIn the individual little super Sal soon as we get into the afternoon those storms will be heating up\nIn the afternoon maximum paid and that's going to happen primarily over the Carol North Carolina's where you're going to say that the greatest potential for tornado activity [laughter] but it's a win and so whether it's the tone adequate and\nOr it's a sustained tropical forests winter forty to forty five miles\nIt's an hour [noise] it's going to do damage and a lot of that damage is going to be treated damage and it's going to be in North Carolina because what's going on in North Carolina\nOr what has gone on as Florence and so it's saturated soils and so these trees that we've noticed most of them because of the wind have been toppled over we've seen a lot of ... mall photos right on on television mhm so boom overcome the trees now one of the trees hit\nThe power lines\nBingo so we got the trees hitting power lines and we currently have seven hundred and thirty five thousand\nCustomers now that's they count customers is homes right okay multiply that by two assuming there's only two people affected by every home and we know that number is low and and your it already one and a half million people already without power\nAnd that number is going to grow as it gets into the Carolinas and I think the next big numbers for power outages\nAre going to be in the Carolinas during Florence between the Carolinas said over seven hundred and fifty thousand power outages and I think this is capable of of if not repeating it at least bring in another four to five hundred thousand customers\nNow and so we're going to get a will get over the two million mark on on people affected without any kind of power and then you have the question they were staging people for power in Pensacola and just draw circle around from Pensacola around this whole area\nA thousands of power of of trucks utility trucks right\nNow they're going to go into the areas they can get into first so maybe the Carolinas Georgia and so forth are going to have a better shot at getting power even though they did stage I Believe the number was up to Nineteen hundred power trucks\nUh around the uh Pensacola area and around the panhandle\nAnd so now they're going to be working as hard as I possibly can but just the physical flooding and inundation and the damage and the debris is going to limit the time and that is kind of take for them to get their power back so I still believe that\nThe landfall area the panhandle but took the greatest Bryant is going to have the longest period of time to restore power I mean [noise]\nFace it there's a lot of places they don't have to restore power to any more but they still have to be able to address the power lines that went there\nSure yeah the infrastructure itself has to be restored and and as you mentioned there may not be a a customer are there any longer unfortunately but still is a a a a an infrastructure because down that line of course there are other customers that that has to have to be a", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Red Eye Radio", "city": "Fairhope", "day": "11"}
