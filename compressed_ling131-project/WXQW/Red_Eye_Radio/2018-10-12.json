I was talking because the cameras were were on prom yet\nConyers doing this because the cameras will be on ... as long as he's doing this but they don't get it\nWell the uh the the the token or a comment let me just to get them through here some of the the different\nUh headlines of salt on our White House that came from MSNBC\n[laughter] yeah that died\nI Will tell you that I did like a a ... a ... like a ... that one um\nThat a Trump\nIs a\nExploiting a mentally ill her so\nOkay that also came out yesterday um\nAnd what was the the\nUh then the other one you know that you've basically who's being controlled by\nYou know white supremacy stay white supremacist that is controlling it basically you have the master and the slave is what you have that in ... she was also made a a a yesterday the one thing the left can have\nIs somebody of the status of Kanye West in popular culture not endorse everything\nThat they do yeah\nUh as I said county was just not a\nA a Balter Williams or a a a Mia Love or even explaining things the way that you know Kansas ... um he's a rap star mhm he's going to be all over the place has he has been a has been all over the place and his politics that's not the point it's not the point is not what the point is non\nDissecting the ah the ... the legitimacy or accuracy of the specific economic and political [laughter] any\nAllergy of Kanye West ... it's the fact that he's in a room with Trump complimenting them and it ends there and so at that particular point and we said this for the longest time before a lot of other shows were saying that\nAnd that the\nUh the liberal elites and the liberal black leadership in this country\nA bully was in the bigoted and racist idea that all blacks must think alike and if you don't think alike you are not truly black\nYeah that's it yeah\nThey don't have to go much further than that and that's what you were seen uh yesterday ... book\n[laughter]\nAnd the more attention you give a Kanye West\nHe's he's always up for publicity peacemaking the headlines and it's not even about a tour or a song\nWhen does he not made headlines the ... the whole point is is that why he does kid rock was an afterthought mhm\nHe was there yesterday apparently they asked him a question where I reported it and didn't like the answer and at some point what where do you what age do you drop kid\n[laughter] I I'm just asking questions I like the guy\nBut you can't call them rock because we already have raw\n[laughter] see [laughter]\nIt started out I never thought about that when I was a kid [laughter] starts out well meaning high and then how do I have a career at sixty\nYes exactly you know kid rock not so much anymore ah so ... ... ... it could be has a kid rock\nI'm not sure if he has ... on the air one time you know I was in ... when he first time I was like oh come on in the nineties I can remember I stopped and then I uh\nI uh\nWas behind the music to the biography of his life and you see how hard he worked to get where he got ... that he had nothing right and you see how Harvard and I went oh\nYou know have a completely different opinion of him and it has just you know you're sort of prejudices you every kid rock ... and kids and stuff\nBut ah but ah for um\nYou know yesterday's again this is now I'm I'm not going to spend five hours are going over the economic and political philosophy of Kanye West hold on let\nMe tell staff had guys or cancel all that stuff that I wrote down for the next\n... exactly uh but because because you don't need to go that far all you need to do is he likes Trump therefore to the left he's not black he's not truly black ...\nWhile they are this about me a lot of say no meal yeah you know and and that's but\nThat's the backward thinking that's that that's like that's some\nBigotry and tolerance on the left today it's the racist mindset\n\nTo the point where you know the coming up with the analogy the Trump is the master and Kanye is the slave should really try to convince America that you're going to you're going to try and convince a millennial something\nBad thrive\nOn the west in his mind views himself as a slave really you know\nBut this is this is the what's great is that they're actually proving comedy a write in there from their behavior this is ... and\nSo maybe we will spend some time talking to both the accuracy of the ideology of God he he was\nSo I mean you know in the past talking about you know why can't someone just ah decide they you know or or for whatever reason a you know they why can't they think this way does it matter who they are we've been saying that for now ages and it doesn't matter who they are\nWe we talk about um Hollywood conservatives and you and I both know some that and I haven't seen where they've come out you know and you know on back in the day on Jay Leno or or whatever over the years um uh and and claimed to be a conservative some have [noise]\nBut I I Know a couple that that\nAre have not\nAs far as I Know and so I'm not going to you know I'm I'm not going to talk about who they are in it that really doesn't mean anything\nOr it's just the fact that they know James Woods has set it I just want to have better just to hang it up yet he hung up and and and retire and go play some poker is pretty good at that but um\nAnd and be able to issue his opinion than to have to walk on eggshells around people 'cause he wasn't going to get hired\nYou know he knows that that more and more you're not going to get hired um Kelsey grammar talked about it openly on the Tonight Show one time just said look I mean you can be a conservative in Hollywood and expect you're going to be treated the same\nI'm paraphrasing but that that was his message on that night and it's true\nBut why is that the side that preaches tolerance has none no\nAnd that's that's what you saw yesterday so we'll get to more of that coming up here latest election polls are Arnold apologizes for

know I haven't seen an update on it we know that in the first half of the year steel was forty percent [noise] uh we know that\nThe trade agreement formerly known as NAFTA\nDoes not cover steel and aluminum and until there is a deal the tears from what I Know unless they uh made exceptions to the ruins and some of those cases still remain with Canada and Mexico\nSo you know we stayed in that when we looked at the you know when when we looked at the the trade deal formerly known as NAFTA for the most part they're really much there isn't much of a difference\nA ... you you know the I\nSaw especially on social media Trump promised to rewrite NAFTA yeah he did a little\nBit but he didn't do anything that he planned that he\nSaid he was going to do which was I'm going to reduce one hundred and fifty billion dollar trade deficit\nRight that this ... this isn't going to do it there were a little wins here or there\nThe problem with the the new trade deal as we said that will be a long term problem\nIs and the president views it as a victory is raising the cost or to buy a car in Mexico the United states and Canada making it more expensive to produce the car\nTherefore making it more expensive to buy a car\nAnd making it less likely that the president one of the president's number one goal which is to be able to produce products here and sell them overseas has just been flushed down the toilet because\nIt's going to be more expensive to manufacture vehicles here which is exactly the opposite if you wish to sell them overseas but\nIt's the one thing there are ... but there are a couple of things but it's really the one major thing where I have no idea where the president stands on that as we know he has changed his mind on he'll change his mind on on training the week he'll go from as he did one for me in a complete protection is just sounded like a total free trader I've no idea where he really stands\nI Do know though that in this in the the uh trade deal formerly known as NAFTA\nThat have you and what he did to raise the price of buying a car and producing a car in North America he put that as as his number one victory mhm which William said\nThat's what drives us crazy that's why we're ... babies [laughter] the original favors written the original Tara babies as the president said now you know something we you know we laughed at it I Wonder how many farmers were laughing at that comments off\nWhat because the ... you know he talks about protecting the farmers in the move on ethanol which was not a mandate and likely will have little\nIf any impact because the the the ah\nThe fuel producers do over don't want it they don't want the higher blend it it may sound like a good deal to be able to sell the Fifteen in the summer first of all here comes the lawsuit here comes a lawsuit here comes a lawsuit um but\nIt will be it but even because that the refinery level you don't have to do the special summer blend but when there's no market for it than there would be a ... a glut of the product\nAnd for the consumer that temporarily money might be a good thing but the point is we're not going to get to a Fifteen without a mandate\nAnd he knows politically outside of the corn belt you can't get that done into that so but appeasing farmers and and using that politically on on the uh on the tariffs\nAnd then they came back and said well we're going to give you billions of dollars to help you which you just admitted it's hurting them to that extent and they came back and said that's a tiny number compared to\nWhat we were losing and the fact that we're losing the ability to be in that supply chain and once we lose that and we're not dependable in that world supply chain they're going to go somewhere else so it's not just the tariffs hurt us until they were lifted it's the fact that we may never get back in those markets again because\nThese countries don't know when you'll use national emergency or trade deal you know or or the the fact of of ah the we need to get a you know a new trade deal or whatever\nTo to uh\nTo to terrify so you're not an double anymore\nYou're not consistent supply chain exactly and that is a problem that the you have but ah you know we noticed that you know it was obvious the president used the greatest victory and that's the weird thing\nOn trade to begin with countries always talk about their trade victories and they're trained victories are always when their citizens have to pay more money for goods and services but we don't know how that's a victory\nRight can figure that one out here's one thing or to media asked that question mhm\nYeah I mean because when you when you look at it and you know you you talk about their supply chain Canada saying you know or Mexico saying they're going to go to Canada and work out a deal you know for pork or as we call it\nCanadian Bacon and the\nWhen they set up that supply chain if they're happy with that agreement why do they go back to us for\n\nWhat would they are with any of those products from a domestic producer if you believe that the government is going to step in and disrupt that process then you're going to make another long term deal elsewhere with someone else\nAre we said this during the you know the um during the permit tore them\nAfter the ah the when when the Gulf\nSpill happened the BP thing that\nThat whole thing where you had companies the producers from uh the U.S saying oh we can you know go somewhere else if we're going to do offshore drilling and you're not going to give us a permit back\nYou know we can go somewhere else you don't just make that decision short term right and so you're you're gonna have to make long term plans because you can't deal with you know the the shift in policy\nOr you know on a ...\nAt the staff of finger and and frankly the\nEthanol thing has become you know ... for the ethanol farmers that's one thing but you look at the entire farming community and I'm Talking the political you know support if they're hurt going into and and this is what we haven't been able to gauge\nYou go to Iowa I mean then\nFor those people that the New York times I'm listening when you go to Iowa let me describe before Iowa is is this state in the middle of the country\nBut when you go there it is\nAll connected to farming just like Texas' oil directly or indirectly\nMean that is the driver there when you go\nTo the to the the farm belt\nThat's everything what the impact right now of terrorists politically votes for Republicans and in twenty twenty four at the midterm this year and in twenty twenty for the president and his reelection because keep in mind\nThey may support Republicans who are on board for terrorists this time\nAnd twenty Eighteen at the midterms are they going to support the president who owns a completely if it still ongoing in twenty twenty\nNot surprised by what happened the last couple of days you know you and I've talked about it but\nWe said look the big terrorists were hit on September twenty eight mhm so I'm not surprised at when you look at you know steel and aluminum and how they have skyrocketed since the beginning of the year right and we said look eventually it's gonna be a point where the market's going to say look you're raising prices too uh too much and when the terrorist went into

but it's going to they're going to have to there's going to have to be and it's not just pressure from the U.S when the ... when the president announced that he was going to or it was announced that

die that was Robert rice ... almost verbatim what he told Berkeley years ago and the former president Brock Obama again saying the same thing\nThey\nDon't care about the fact that elderly people will suffer if you if you give Medicare for all first of all they can't pay for it but I imagine you could pay for even part or half of it\nAgain pure fantasy\nBut what would happen ultimately because you can't afford it it is going to affect the benefits of the ultra\nAnd\nThere's ... there's no way to debate that the question is does elect care about the old\n\nWell Brock Obama and and Robert Reich ... one of his advisors a and a labor secretary for Clinton\nNo vote people should go home and die\nThat's the way they saw so maybe they don't care I don't think they do\nBut ah Schumer needs to say

right that the two week mark which means uh early voting will be starting in places and yeah you know you and and by the way a our friend wreck Roberts will be here all week next week to uh uh have great conversations with you\nAnd then we'll be back a week from Monday but the\nThe polls if you start looking at the polls a and you know the ... at the numbers in the house I mean I'm I'm ... it's\nIt really really really really I mean you know going up over you know\nHundreds of polls there are some that are\nYou know going to be blue with no doubt a there are some that are going to be read the thirty two are cp has thirty to\nEssentially a you know a ... that are in the middle undecided basically\nJust yet it doesn't show the polls are neck and neck and does tend to just see the some of the amounts of the undecided you're talking ten eleven ... percent and that's a big deal it is and and the pollsters um aren't as active in the house seats as as they are for the Senate ...\nI'm right they will start seeing that\nBut we haven't seen any polls post capital\nWell we don't make predictions but if you if you if you look at the number of toss ups as they call them on on our cp that's thirty two um\nThe\nThe polls in those areas you know it in those thirty two districts are really going to start juggling things are showing something here\nProbably by the time you and I get back a week from Monday or when the\nWhen I start thinking about somebody who was undecided today and again in a congressional race who knows but all I'm thinking is that if you got ten to twelve percent that are undecided it means they're not driven by Trump a traitor Trump love\nRight it's not either of that that's driving them\nSo what is it that is what is it that is driving the you know that you know that independent in that particular district and we're never going to get the specific poll polling on that\nLets pull the independence ... congressional district to find out why they are undecided and what would change their vote right would it be in their local congressman came out and said everything is free but by this time\nThey've already seen a ton of political commercials so what is it that would push them over the edge devoted a certain way\nEspecially if they're likely voters which means in all likelihood they're going to vote mhm but they're still undecided at\nThis moment what is it it's got to be an issue that's huge right yeah and what's the huge ... issue over the ... the biggest issue over the last couple of weeks we'll be capping off I don't know if there will be a bigger issue that that will come out in the in in the next few weeks in popular culture that will reach everybody\nKanye West [laughter] right [laughter]\nI'm Sorry just throw that out I I just I don't\nKnow uh you know the the the president and the president tweeting and the president coming out with outrageous comments to me doesn't drive anything anymore\nI don't I don't think in ... and I don't think in\nIn flames anybody knew or pleases anybody new\nIt's going to and playing the same people and it's going to make the people that love when he when he does that still love him\nBut it's not going to change what's it think about it who can this day and age how can tend to twelve percent possibly be undecided and death and and most definitely be going to the polls\nIn November yeah yeah okay and it's really and certainly when you think about that here's something else interesting looking at the end and it's just one small indicators of small movement but I find it interesting looking at our safety and the map\nFor the house race or the house races\nSo Republicans took one from the Democrats I haven't figured out which one it is but it was at two o five Democrats in other words likely very likely Democrats\nAnd one Ninety eight for Republicans it's now too old for for Democrats one Ninety nine for Republicans and the center of the toss up\nDistricts still remains at thirty two already too yes by ... would love to see what you district that was that that that that shifted and and again not from toss up but from the Democrats\nSo I'll go back and look at it I I have no idea um but it is interesting so you but you do look at those thirty to keep in mind to Eighteen is the number the magic number or for a majority\nRight so right now\nOnly Nineteen to those thirty to need to go for the Republicans but\nHear the one that got away with for twenty Nineteen maintenance the is there and do call now for a free consultation ... fifty

you\nAll right yeah there are actually I'm going what I go to the border where would I go to vote\nIs going to be the restoration of some show some some semblance of due process security\nAnd the court of public opinion is going to have to be reined in some ... and I think that's the Republican direction yeah\nThat's a great history by now [laughter]\nNo I think it's a great point is that you say that you know the the the court of public opinion or isn't the final determination of of uh of of anything and and a quarter of a public opinion we're talking about on the left side above a public opinion and it has to be it has to be due\nProcess that's a very that's a you know that that that's a great point that comes from the capital here it's yeah I I think it is and and people apply it uh\nIt based on their their own life you know our ... our audience\nA and a ... than new sounds and and then people who do what we do we're we're in the thick of it and we're always immersed in it but most people the average American is not but if they're still politically active in terms of boating they look at it\nAnd say okay this this is you know insanity\nThe fact that it went this way they don't uh apply the left believes that they apply their feelings directly to their feelings sleep that is the case for some\nBut most Americans look at it practically speaking and going you know this is a big deal the book to be able to vote was a big deal and if they are to the point where they are you know in that likely voter category this is one of those\nPolls start to shape up the way they do and that's why likely voter gives you a better read but they look at that and go you know it's a big deal on election day to get up and go cast my vote\nYou know I Know people show up and they're driven by\nYou know a slogan they're driven by whatever imagery but we can't forget the people that\nTake it very serious they consider things they may not be immersed in it every day like we are for whatever reason but they will show up and they make an informed decision and often it is a reaction Chuck Todd on a ...\nAnd and Chuck Todd was saying well a lot of people get it wrong and and say twenty sixteen was a referendum on Trump but it really was a referendum on Hillary that was a small part of what what Chuck Todd as we're getting here because they are discussing the polls in the mid term is is about you know the house and the Senate\nAnd not a presidential election and his point what he was implying is that Hillary's not here to be the the bad guy right well what Chuck is forgetting is the real facts of how the Republicans in districts all over America\nOutperformed Trump and that it wasn't a referendum on Hillary it was a referendum on the left\n... you know that that's a great point of the other point brought by the color and and I think you can't underestimate this is that Americans may not know the three branches of government right\nUh you know and and that's what the polls show Seventy five percent of Americans roughly could not tell you all three branches of government they might know one or two or they do the zero but they couldn't tell you all three as you said you need to know all three to understand how the government actually works they may not be able to tell you the freedoms and the first amendment\nBut think about when it comes to due process\nThink about since Perry Mason let's go through all the lawyer shows\nThat have been that had been on TV mhm battle salt [laughter] about up\nWell I'll drop us all Perry Mason I'll drop matlock I'll throw out almost\nThirty years of law and order on the television mhm everybody understands a presumption of innocence everybody even a significant portion that we're trying to tell you that the allegation is enough\nIf you actually ask them off the record if they believe that they would tell you know why that is bad is just think about that in not just in the courtroom if you've ever been in a jury but it is they're completely in our popular culture shots from the greater does on the Alabama and it's\nGreat point because you don't have to get into the details of how legislation works for the three branches of government no but in pop culture we got we got those and yes they are simple lessons for the simple lesson can be enough to recognize when the process as being distorted\nFor they asked him to destroy the process altogether [noise]\nCheck out all the latest news events trucking information jobs and podcasts at red eye radio show dot com batch red eye

team\n\nFor a forty four percent of likely voters in the district said they would support Salazar was forty two percent said they would support Shalala a difference that falls within the polls margin of error a plus or minus four percent\nThirteen percent of likely voters said that they were undecided sellers are popular Cuban American former broadcast journalist and Shalala who served as health

because it's a this district for to twenty seven as one of those on the our sleepy toss up\nA category of a total of thirty two right now toss ups\n\nBut you are you're going to start seeing that

at a state like a Texas for instance or Florida\nAnd the Senate race then it becomes a very different\nUm the the\nThe Washington politics comes into it and the Senate race but not always in the

going to win\nThey thought they were going to be part of history it really wasn't about Hillary\nFor some it was about being able to say I helped to elect and put into office the first woman president\nThat driver is gone\nI mean there's no president's voice here but but the the point being you look at the districts that she won and things have changed for Trump\nIn some areas but it's based on something\nAnd it's based on his you know so far short history is president but very active short history as president\nAnd it's not based on and and think about it or the euphoria created\nBy the first black president cannot be denied by the way it's not Bill Clinton\nBrock Obama that euphoria that was there we even had someone that we knew you and I of mutual friend that said but you know you look at it and and it was a it was that cool feeling this person is a conservative didn't vote for Barack Obama but was basically drawn into that euphoria\n\nAnd we always said well

on it I was never I'll be honest with you I really have never been impressed\nWith anybody including myself [laughter] out after us saying I'm not impressed with me [laughter] I and I think we all

S. P. S. that has not publicly disclosed\nAmazon declined to comment on the price hikes in the postal service declined to answer questions about\nAny potential impact on the company the increases for partial select or steeper than in previous as a previous years us BSO the new rights are result of a regular review process and are set to take effect on January twenty seven subject to approval from the postal Regulatory Commission\nAlright\nA Trump has repeatedly allege that Amazon is to blame for the postal services financial woes and accuses the e commerce giant ripping off the agency and treating it like a deliberate boy the president created a special task force in April to examine the postal services business model sparking speculation that he would use it to raise shipping rates\nOn Amazon ... a\nTrump equates Amazon with the Washington Post which is owned by Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos and as a target of Trump's anger about media coverage\nSo there you go this from this is from political fucking [noise] just of\n[noise]\nThen again they say have a long term deal with them they are not affected by it right that at that you know the pricing deal is in place and and look at what\nMeasles has done not a I mean just in general if you talk about or his a supply chain his delivery each a chain a from\nA to B agency I guess it was clear that that when she\nStarted making large purchases on his freight company that he was going to be doing more of his own delivery and so while he can't do it all\nBecause you have I don't know\nI don't know what they even what the numbers in terms of overall numbers of sellers on Amazon the point being is that there are things coming from all over the world that are sold on the Amazon\nAnd so it'd be impossible for although those has done other things [laughter] that people didn't see coming ah I don't think any time soon he will have it will control completely has on his own ...\nUh but he is doing that more and more and\nThat was to shut out more and more the the the um FedEx and UPS\nDelivery that was costing him more and more the costing the consumer more and more and he said this is not about shutting out the little guy and in fact is about creating more opportunity for the little guy and now they they you can go out and get your own local delivery uh buy your own local delivery a set up for\nA for Amazon and by the bands and everything else\nAnd be a part of that and and there's opportunity there it was about creating a a ... basically the ... the ability or more and more to control pricing said keep prices low on Amazon according to ...\nHave the U.
