rather simplified evaluation of worrying it go this way they are only two reasons for worrying either you're successful or you're not if you're successful there's nothing to worry about if you're not\nThere are only two things to worry about your health is going to be good are you going to get sick that if your health is good there's nothing to worry about if you're sick where there are only two things to worry about it you're going to get well or you're going to die\nAnd if you're going to get well there's nothing to worry about\nBut if you're going to die and then there are only two things to worry about either you you're going to go to heaven or not and if you're going to go to heaven there's nothing to worry about I mean so why worry [laughter] there does seem to be an obvious point in this I mean if your life's into with one who made you then there's nothing to worry about\nIs there\nI'm Larry western world radio and I care speaking for churches a Christ weekend I have a

caravan and everything else that's happened it's just maybe just a temporary low for a day or just see a like a quiet\nYeah yeah I mean I think right now especially with the house seats you're seeing so much concentration in those districts\nAre right now because the Republicans are just you know doing everything to hold on the still the chances the odds are\nAgainst that the Republicans would maintain the house but if a ... again the momentum has shifted and there's some things that we haven't seen in polls we we mentioned this earlier and at the end of last week and yesterday we mentioned it and at the end of last week as well\nYou know there are only a few polls the pollsters aren't as active in the house races so I you know there's\nThere's a lot of stuff we don't know um could this be another Nineteen Ninety four or is a\nNext silver right you know is it is a is it pretty much a given that the Democrats are going to take the house we don't know but ah next Tuesday will be\nA very interesting day well I mean has sent it to the point of the the ... the one woman or was it on on CNN who said that I Believe with CNN ... who said that ah you know a Trump\nHas radicalized more people than I and I says yeah right now she apologized later on it's ridiculous that is the GQ call them eh uh\nShe was on CNN the the lead to Julie Lafayette has apologized after claiming President Trump has radicalized so many people are so many more people than ISIS ever did why did she apologized she meant it she meant it when\nShe said it I I'm guessing she thought of saying it before she set it and uh and thought that was a good idea and and believed it and still believes it\n\nAnd you just wonder does this help motivate the Republican base when they just keep campaign you know\nIt up and we spent a lot of the show yesterday on the on the political divide to go back and forth between the ... and you know who's to blame for it is a ... in in our opinion just useless discussion to have ... or it's you know the person that did it we're not going to stop the heated rhetoric\nIs not going to stop it has never stopped in the United states from the beginning the insults are still the same remember we what we forget is social media amplifies\nYou know the the crude and and and rude and\n... or whatever you want to ... of of of called them you know Bob political outer ranges and provocative statements\nAre and so everybody gets their turn to do it so it may seem like it's more\nBut the fact is politicians used ... ... ... they used to shoot at each other mhm when it got to the point of personal insults\nWe get to this thing again where well you know we're doing things that have never happened before politicians are doing drills\nBut as far as we know what I mean we're not paying attention to every house race in you know now it it could be happening somewhere I'm thinking the viewership for sports is down\nAnd so that might be an idea from\n\nBattle of the network politicians take ten steps towards turn around but it would be more and it obviously we don't want anybody to actually get hurt but what about tasers\nI don't have a paint balls [laughter] well no but the\nTaser has the thing you know where you're on the ground for a minute [laughter] I rounded look we should idea or not I'm just asking why she didn't want to see our politicians arriving I'm just I'm just [laughter]\nWell you know and it gets to the ... uh at the social media has amplified ... everything\nWhat you think politics was clean back in the Eighteen hundreds no oh no it's just we didn't have the media where everybody could get their two cents in we didn't have and as you know you and I talked about with Twitter\nWhenever and I started to go on social media I have to go with the attitude that this is for entertainment purposes only ... you can't take it seriously because you have a ton of not cases out there and a ton of those not cases are in the media\nYeah and so you go in ... you're not going to have an intellectual discussion you know days like yesterday\nI Will admit at times I have to [laughter] hold back on the frustration as to where the narrative is going because I Know what you and I really like to talk about\nWe really like to talk about\nThe uh we love to talk about policy we love to talk about issues we love to talk about economics those are the things that really really drive us those are the passions that we have because we we understand we believe that that's\nWhat will make the country great or not re mhm\nAnd it has gotten harder\nThirty years ago until now when I started to get to that point you and I are determined that's what we're going to do not that we're going to ignore or anything else\nBut you and I've had this discussion we're going to you know we we want to make sure that you know that's what we love doing we're not going to get down into the sewers everybody does or not everybody but a significant portion of the

the scientists right you would think that the left would want\nIn the world was truly being destroyed\nBy what we weren't doing that they would insist\nThat scientists debate it and as we've said tell us one federal veto one national debate that's ever been held ever\nOn global warming scientists who believe that men manmade uh you know a middle man made up of a global you know ... global warming scientists that are in short\nAnd scientists believe that it is not\nAnd have them all debate it had the scientist debate it but we don't do that we ... politicians that debate it and all you're

an audience Bob guild off camera yeah yeah I I don't know where we're Bob guild office come out in an interview and admit that he lied about anything when it comes to what he believes about global warming but but then they moved back to ... an ounce back there twenty thirty now for those that aren't counting\nOr that gives us in a roughly eleven years or so little overlapping New Year's to you know get this all wrapped up\nA might there be a debate between the people who are\nThe scientists who believe it is manmade and those who don't\nSo then we go from not wanting to have the debate to what we see more on the left and the right even though it does exist and the populist right but we see it more on the left\nAnd and that is just to demonize if you can't argue demonize and that's it yeah\nName call label or\nIt's much worse on the left\nOr the right if they disagree with you might call you will global as you said to find a global list and they can't [laughter] or they may call

their job or saved up whatever money they get for being on CNN for her because she means\nThat ... in her heart and think about this thing about how delusional you have to be how\nOutside of reality you have to be you can look like the president for some of the things he's done that's fine and dandy we can talk about that in the arena by Eddie is sure to come pair the president and say he's worse than ISIS and that his followers are like the\nThe followers of ISIS the members of ISIS that will kill innocent men women and children is just as reprehensible and have filled\nMore than anything but I Know any Republican in recent memory has ever set us\nAnd and that is too because ... again when we talk about the the rhetoric\nWhat is it that you're trying to portray\nHow is it that you're trying to label the president\nHas a major and in this case immediate threat\n\nThat he was radicalized that it's not just him that he was radicalized a great number of people that are also a threat to you\n\nThat they would attack you the way that ISIS would attack you\n\n[noise] I I haven't seen now\nCorrect me if I'm wrong and maybe someone else to say no I haven't seen a group of Trump supporters shouting people out of a restaurant or even have you\n\nPeople wearing making a America great again hats shouting people out of a restaurant there there was some group\nThat followed below sea or that was a couple of weeks ago\n... okay\nAnd and by the way immediately condemned by all by almost every Republican out there saying don't do that yeah don't do the tactics that they do don't do it yeah and\nI guess that's the only instance we've seen yeah okay well you certainly get that at at the rallies but I mean where is where is the same kind of behavior\nI'm Talking about on the level that the left has behaved and and what's the lenses ... chasing them down at airports chasing them out of restaurants will ... that in the Senate\nOr the the thing is one of the things they've got that comes up every time one of the major points it's brought up every single time and has for a while the Trump is creating instability by stating you know by\nBeing part of the chant lock her up lock her up lock her up as we've said before though\nThat's not an uncivil comment that's a common based on the fact is we have said before\nOf many people believing that Hillary Clinton should legitimately be in jail\nWell it is based on the fact that she broke the law that is recognized I don't know who doesn't recognize that fact right she just wasn't prosecuted for breaking the law\nThe SPs the espionage law and the ... of trying to avoid the freedom of Information Act law by putting a server in her home\n\nAnd we have gone through this ... the actual law\nAnd even call me said well yeah yeah but no reasonable prosecutor would do it because we never fought an instance like this yeah because you never had a secretary of state but put a private server in their home\nTo avoid the freedom of Information Act and to allow foreign entities and she knows that she's smart enough former first lady former senator secretary of state to know that our enemies are looking for anything that's on secured\nMhm but thinking and believing though that's okay\nWe know what the intent was the end ... everybody knows with the intent was I Want to keep stuff private I don't want it to be documented by the government as is law to be archived by the government right now the lawyer for subject to freedom of Information Act right\n\nThat's what life lock her up to about it's not about locking up because she ran against Trump son about locking her up because she's married to build its not blocking her up because they produce the offspring of Chelsea Clinton who now wants is is expressing interest in front of him for political office\nWell it's not it's not based on rhetoric is based on a fast right that she broke the law and that she is not above the law\nNow you may disagree with their analysis but you cannot disagree with the fact that back up what they are saying\n\nAnd so they use it by the way they use that every single time and the like the last month where I've seen them saying what I see what you're saying that they lock her up lock her up that's on civil that's a no it's not meant to be it's actually it's meant to promote civility you locked up people who have committed crimes eyes but you believe in committing crimes Ryan\nI mean\nThat's something that is provable by the way that fact that basis is not debatable right\nActual facts in the case nobody has debate it now\nShe hasn't gone to trial or shows and gone to ... you're right but nobody debate facts right and nobody debates what the law states right it simply call me who hated Trump they didn't want a prosecutor now\nWe know the whole story when we've been through it before we've gone through the law specifically we went through the first draft of as we know the first draft of analyzing Hillary Clinton what she did and how they changed the language of it because the language that they originally had was the exact context of the law that she broke\nRight that she was not prosecuted for\nShe broke the law this is the fact she broke the law but was not prosecuted more ...\n\nAnd that's why they state lock her up\nIt's not a hateful combat\nYou want to get in we do have

was glad that Trump doubled down on fake news because this is a very definition of fake news and you guys have been making a lot of good points because when you accuse someone else or something usually you're doing the same thing they have so much hate in their heart when you compare a sitting president and\nHis followers or his supporters kill Hitler and Nazis\nBecause they won't do what you want them to do even oil allies Hitler no nobody should be compared to that sort of a monster and it should be outraged to that what Obama was in office this other point I wanted to make\nThey look at him as he was the opposite of Trump in terms of civility but you know how many cops were killed remember all the cops that we're getting killed new town\nYou had so many ... killings and shooting taking place under Obama so it's not a matter of what the president is saying is a matter of when it fell on makes up their mind to commit a crime or do something like that\nAnd do it on their own and the news media this last point I Want to make [noise] they are trying to control how people take instead of reporting the news I didn't realize Obama's middle aimless Assad\nUntil months

[noise] [noise] [noise] and\nHe's currently ... took six Ninety bread I welcome and a good morning yeah so you know and when we talk and analyze the midterm elections we've talked about the strong and weak points for the Republicans a and the strongly points for the the Democrats one thing that Democrats brought up\nA now we think they may have had it too late but it still doesn't mean that people don't recognize that especially\nIf you know this is this was a time of the year when all of us I mean we here at at at our job\nHad to put in for you know benefits here are the last uh ten days or so a lot of other companies are doing it a Obamacare but the premiums are are coming in now and we had said this back then that the Republicans leapt this thing wide open\nThat the you know they did a horrible job\nUh uh you know when it came to especially premiums that we're going to sky rocket\nAnd we said they got to come up with something as to what they are going to do when they really have it\nAnd Newt Gingrich wrote an article for Fox News and said the twenty Eighteen mid term elections are less than two weeks away this was three days ago and many polls show there was a sizable block of independent voters were not yet made up their minds at the same time health care remains the number one issue for the American people\nThe best way for the Republicans are on the boats so these undecided voters and honor commitments so the Republicans who are already support them urge to clearly articulate how they would fix the broken healthcare system\nAnd he goes to the whole thing that the distributor Republican principles\nUp for the book for America as a Republican principles for America's health and health care system we believe that every American should have the opportunity to live a long and healthy life supported by health care system that is simple to use innovative and affordable\nWe believe that every American should up his or her choice of the doctors and insurance\nThat meets his or her specific needs we believe the healthcare system should be transparent about health care cost\nAnd quality of treatment options and that this information should be available to every American and it's simple understandable wasteful patients can make better decisions about their own health we believe in protecting patients with preexisting condition so they can obtain affordable health insurance coverage\nWe believe in the importance of American Medical innovation that leads the to the breakthroughs\nThat dramatically improve health outcomes wild significantly lowering costs we believe that a doctor patient relationship is the center of ineffective healthcare system and it should not be disrupted by micro management from public and private bureaucracies\nWe believe American seniors have burned their health care benefits and that they their families and their doctors should make their own medical decisions not an elected government boards bureaucrats are private third party\nPayers or middle men we believe in a competitive health care\nMarket where private sector innovation works to strengthen public programs one size fits all government controlled healthcare interferes with doctor patient relationship knee caps new medical breakthroughs provides less has access to treatment and leads to long wait times for critical care we believe that the current health care system\nAnd America is far too expensive while it is very good at treating people when they become sick it is so much less effective\nAt helping Americans remain healthy which is equally as important we believe the goal of health reform should be to build on what's working and fix what's not destroying what's good about our healthcare system\nIn an attempt to fix what's bad is not acceptable step towards a better future and then he goes on to the Republican accomplishments and they go to the accomplishments [noise]\nYou know including eliminating the Obamacare individual mandate\nOf the uh uh six billion new to fight opioid epidemic in\nThe past the right to try legislation passed historic VA mission or or with the Trump Administration providing more affordable health care options for Americans through association health care plans and short term limited to ration plans so they go through that there's ten different ones there then they say the Republican promises for additional improvements\nIf the American people re elect Republicans to a majority in the house and Senate we pledge to enact a series of practical in specific changes based on what works in the public and private sectors to build a better healthcare system the system will keep people healthy and provide effective treatments and economic security for those who get sick\nThese legislative changes will and that goes to the pre existing condition which really goes back to the block grant right\nWe do we do so by committing the resources necessary for states to try new approaches like high risk pools and reinsurance so everyone regardless of medical history has access to affordable insurance but again it goes to the states\nThe states make a decision as to what they wish to do right and further reduce the cost of prescription drugs by requiring additional transparency and accountability across the entire\nPrescription drugs supply chain\nA lower premiums for individuals and small businesses by eliminating the health insurance tax\nReducing Washington's mandates that limited choices the drive up costs for insurance strengthen Medicare by protecting Medicare part D patients from excessive out of pocket costs maximize medical innovation that go through that but basically go through all the things that they should that they should actually do this has been a failure of the Republican Party completely\nThere is something that probably Ryan\nShould should have been talking about on a consistent basis there should have been a marketing plan for this with massive television ads leading up to the election that if you will like this ... this is our plan this is our contract ... and Newt Gingrich bringing it out and this was two days ago it's too late co yeah yeah that", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Red Eye Radio", "city": "Fairhope", "day": "30"}
