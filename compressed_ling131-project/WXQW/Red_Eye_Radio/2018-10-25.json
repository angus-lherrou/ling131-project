is Larry with some ... said came up with this rather simplified evaluation of worrying it go this way there are only two reasons for worrying either you're successful or you're not if you're successful there's nothing to worry about if you're not there are only two things to worry about your health is going to be good or you're going to get sick\nThat if your health is good there's nothing to worry about if you're sick where there are only two things to worry about if you're going to get well or you're going to die\nAnd if you're going to get well there's nothing to worry about\nBut if you're going to die and then there are only two things to worry about either you're going to go to heaven or not and if you're going to go to heaven there's nothing to worry about I mean so why worry [laughter] there does seem to be an obvious point in this I mean if you're a life sentence with one who made you then there's nothing to worry about\nIs there\nI'm Larry west with World Radio and I care speaking for churches of Christ weekend I have a Bible study course years free write me World Radio west Monroe, Louisiana seven what to nine one\n\nSees your news source for news and information six sixties got what you would execute W ... movie\nCumulus station no winner balance of power that land for answers the FBI is investigating a series of packages with explosives center several high profile Democrats than CNN Wednesday corresponded carrying came for reports\nSay the loss of devices weren't dressed in a high profile figures [noise] one of the package either ride in the mail room at the time Warner center buildings which housing CNN's New York bureau is an error package wasn't just a former CIA director John Brennan he blamed everything right or if I\nBy the way the national review also it's we just mentioned Andrew McCarthy's column but the national review had a story last uh last night that said that both Obama and the powder were harmless than they quoted a soldier one size CNN yeah the one side to CNN yes the one that was sent to to CNN was um [noise] uh the powder was harmless\nAnd but when you read the actual Associated Press story and you and I are looking at each other's said man you've got a purse everything these days you got to be very careful ... ... ... it says the powder but does out or the right will Souder along with the bomb right\nThat was and it it was that there's ... there's nowhere in the big story or any other source that we've seen that says that authorities say that the ... any source says that the a suspicious package\nThat was sent there the explosive device potentially explosive device was was harmless ... it's just the powder the powder according to a source\nRight and and early in the day the NYPD had bad that the um uh but the uh the ... there was the the the suspected\nBomb and another powder right mhm which was you know whether whether it would be you know I I don't know rice or would they suspected it might be right center you know who knows mhm\nBut it that that turned out to be harmless National Review has the story that both Obama and the powder are harmless were harmless\nAnd we looked at you know who they source for that which was Associated Press and Associated Press nowhere and their says yeah but the but their sources that\nThe bomb was was harmless but we don't know whether the bomb was harmless or not because from what I've seen in what I read the FBI has not come out and said these were bombed no no these were alive bombs ready to go off a specialist\nIn nature um and and so you know potentially harmful devices these are the phrase is they've been using the authorities have been using but the media's been using because for me what does the media do inevitably they bring on as they're covering this live they bring on you know somebody who was an explosives expert\nAnd then they look at it except they're not on site looking at it they have no idea what they're looking at really except for what it appears to be and and so the the the point being is that we have no idea what's going on here ... suppose that is somebody that supports the president and the Republicans\n... you just heard\nThe side that you support that fat fry it that found out we have no idea what it is but if that's the case in that somebody who just right for less than two weeks before a major election\nYou would just hurt their chances and and by the end and so when you you look at it as we said I mean this is a ... and we've said this all along but there was a rush Russian collusion or a case like this we look at it from the investigative ... your point of view and if you're an investigator and you're looking at something like this ah and you know some of the questions that you're thinking\nOf a base on the fact that you have a lack of information and nobody has said that these were actually live bombs where you say okay\nAh when we find out if they were you know live bombs mhm well then you know that without question was an attempt\nTo kill these people that would end so right you go from you go from it from that point of view trying to figure that out if it was they find out that none of the bombs were active\nBut none of the bombs that any potential of going off and then you look you would be looking I Believe that two different things you if you're looking at it from an investigator's point of view which would be All right this was a scare tactic to either scare these people or it was political in nature ... it was meant\nJust a couple of weeks before an election to help drive which is again something that you would have to look at it was to help drive but the motivation here was to help\nDrive an election to a a certain size mhm and at that point you would look at it and say well if ... if they did this to help Trump did to help from and then you would look at it from the other side which was okay\nAh this was to set up Trump\nAnd make it look suspicious because of the things that Trump has said the provocative things he has said\nAnd help change the the uh public discourse to blaming Trump as that's at like I said it has that started already without any evidence whatsoever but that's the most incredible thing with the media starts talking about whether it's you know soccer whatever yesterday from CNN\nIt going after the you know going after the president going after the right talking about the divisive\nComments out there will nothing could ... be more divisive than accusing another side or a person blaming them for some things\nWhere there is a complete lack of evidence as to the motivation of the person or persons\nWho did a particular deed mhm\nYeah I'm just not jumping on that show and assigning of just what I'm thinking nothing could be nothing could be more device them so as they sit there on their high horse screaming but your divisive they have committed the ultimate sins and divisiveness not\nWell Hillary comes out and says we must be more civil just days after saying there's no way to be civil with the other side that it's not possible she shuts the door on that just days ago\nWell look this this is\nMore we we have the conversation but it's ridiculous and I say it's ridiculous for for this reason uh after Steve ... was shot and you had a man who was a Bernie Sanders supporter\nWho's goal was to assassinate and kill and he ... he did not succeed in doing it thank thank goodness to the Capitol police but his goal was to kill as many Republican members of Congress as possible\nWould you say the fed has brought down the divisive rhetoric on the left over the last year and\nNo no no\nAnd none of it's going to all of this has to get a political advantage one way or another what you're hearing yesterday is about getting a political advantage because you cannot debate the point that we just made that the most divisive you have these people sitting in their ivory towers immediate elite ivory towers\nClaiming that they care about civility and their anti divisive\nThat's what they're about and they have the divisiveness that exist today and then they commit the ultimate sin of divisiveness and that is to blame somebody for potentially you know a a terrorist attack\nWith a complete lack of evidence to back up there ... there is no evidence of either way there's no one\nAnd we may not have it for a long time and the fact is they don't see that no they don't they don't see that they don't and it's obvious anybody who isn't a political understands how obvious it is\nSo\nNot really much more to talk about I mean it's we either there's a boom there's\nA again a we've said this many times on topics that we are ignorant about which means topics that we don't have the facts on mhm\nNot much you can say the only thing we can report or the the few facts that we do have a total rewrite seven now suspicious packages according to the FBI\nOr they were sent to you know prominent members\nOr or or uh or\nBackers of the Democrats and so\nThat's it\nThat's all we know about it\nAnd as soon as they release it more information will you know will pass that along\nWhen we know the whole story if we ever know the whole story than we can talk about it\nBut right now without knowing the motivation unless that person comes forward and tells us what the motivation was\nWe can't assign it to anything we have no idea absolutely no idea no idea\nAnd\nSo that that's where we stand\nFor when we find out more information we'll give you more information but speculation on these things is useless but the thing is that the kind of nation that we live in ... or short started right away and I was thinking too that you know the media getting on their high horse you know the ... but you know hey we don't ever cause any type of device of rice fried\n... and all I have to say is ...\n... built on a lie mhm\nCompletely built an ally CNN and MSNBC all over that mhm enabling\nThe the uh\nUh as in in my opinion enabling the range that existed uh attacking\nLaw enforcement you and I remember\nWe shake tapper writing and writing tapper can you believe this police are there in ... when it has been riots for the last few days of course they're going to stage police in riot gear ... they were ... they kept pushing the narrative that the\nKnow that the police rotted control hands up don't shoot you remember it right they they were they were part\nOf course Jean and amplifying the divisiveness that was based on a lie so CNN

I was in ... to the polling could be Kavanaugh could be a you know everything that has gone on it it'd be ... you know the the going into restaurants disturbing yeah Republicans whatever\nBut in order to use that term and words are very important especially words that will alienate your own party in a political ad\nMeans OK I'm Still safe from the base the the base Democrats or I don't have to worry about them I Need to get those independence\nAnd they're leaning Holly's way we believe and one of the reasons is they believe that the Democrat Party and a significant portion of those that represent the Democratic party in Congress are crazy\nThat can be the only reason you don't do that in an ad that I mean could you imagine remember\nThis isn't even a you can't even say well this is just a house race in a particular area this is the state of Missouri and this is a Senate race and\nAnd so inside her campaign which means not just in her campaign but other campaigns across the country this is something that Democrats\nWho ... who wish to promote themselves and pretend to be moderates what they're facing is a significant portion of independence who believed that the Democratic party and members of the Democratic party\nAre crazy when I ... which shows that everything that has happened in the cabinet thing\nIn going into restaurants and is having an effect on independence otherwise they would run the ad\nI think there's I I still think there's an end someone must have and and the research the the voters or whoever was you know being a part of the I I guess group that was being polled\nMust have use those words specifically otherwise it's horrible writing because\nI think a an ad by a Claire McCaskill a could could or for Claire McCaskill could do the same again we're just talking to the politics of it\nBy saying you know look we know that there are there are extremes on both sides and right now at ... proud of some of the things that are going on in my ... within my own party and people that are clearly supporting my own party\n... I Want you to know that I Am not that person ... does it but that that's\nThe point and that's the great point right there\nIt was specifically using the term crazy Democrats I'm going to have a reviews that any Democrat [laughter] some someone had to have used that in some kind of feedback that they were getting that feedback that it was crazy Democrats not extreme\nRight I'm not part of the extreme of my partying because he used that why did why the term crazy Democrats because that's the feedback you been getting back right in your own internal polling\nBecause extreme means that you've gone full on one side and in one direction and and to\nA further extent well no that's not what's going on\nIt it is crazy and and that's the perception what you're trying to you're trying to target with those words the very perception as someone who has given that feedback to you with those words that feeling when that happens that's the only way those words end up in an ad like that\n\nThey because someone must have made that that's that's where the the word crazy\nMust have appeared in feedback and unlikely multiple times\n\nAnd they're in their internal talking\nTo you you're talking about tens of millions of dollars to run a Senate race there which means they are doing every type of of polling an analytical research you can get you get down to this point here and you see the desperation of using that in an ad that means you are trying to fight the perception\nOf crazy Democrats in your election in Missouri and\nIt is the one thing\nThat is killing your chances of winning yeah it is the one thing because it is if you think about the build up to you know if you listen to that there's a buildup that word is is is one of those hot button words that you don't expect to hear but it was placed in the ad strategically\nAt a certain place right as you're listening to something and all of a sudden boom she's not one of those crazy Democrats because and there's another thing too\nIt's a poor attempt I think\nAt recreating a conversation that\nPeople are you know having out there but it's not that's not the conversation they're actually having the conversation they're having is if it were really I think accurate and and and portraying what's going on with some of the Democrats or independents interstate it would be two guys going man\nThose Democrats are crazy I don't know but I can vote for Democrats anymore including McCaskill\nThat's the actual conversation so you have to have you have to counter it with this contrived and and again I think it's a it's a it's a poor attempt but that's the only thing you can do you're not going to get Claire McCaskill coming out going hey I'm not one of those crazy Democrats\nOr the other thing I thought was interesting you know and and I'm not you know very familiar with Josh Hawley who's running against his attorney general against\nClaire McCaskill I'm I'm a I'm I'm not you know we live in we live in Texas and that's one of the things is it's it's tough for anybody ... and I mean it's tough for anybody on the national stage\nTo really have a key understanding of what's going on for example in in Missouri race in many congressional races it's it's really tough because\nA lot of times it can be local and if you're not living there you don't see the stories that are pounded at you or that each and every day but you and I both looked at each other we haven't discussed us but we looked at each other the power were well and it's claimed that\nBut Holly as attorney general made wine runs and went to the gym ... during work hours which with\nAll the heated rhetoric yeah and and use that to the only thing they are you kidding me grab your your opponent and that was that's what you use and put an atom desperation well\nHere's the thing it's the same thing oh wait a minute I Wonder if you could pick me up some wine next time he goes because people go to the gym during the day\nAll the time but what's what's the people people running errands all the time and just assume OK just to swimming right that it's it's it's on company time and it's it's well the the the the state time in this case\nAnd it's um it's being done outside of his lunch hour it's not on his time that's the worst she got well I'm assuming most\nAttorney general's don't work eight to five\nI'm guessing there's I'm a city you hours I'm assuming there's meetings there's speeches there's everything else that goes wind meetings as to why aren't they say go very far\nApart on jobs but I I again I don't know the specifics behind it but I just went ... and ... and that's but from an outsider you heard that and you went that's pretty weak well out of desperation that's pretty weak what I Would have ...

Amazed that we haven't gotten any details on may rise we address to just start that\nThe the the show a off with but a National Review and it's being picked up by you know a a social media of of the some different a conservative website said\nHas picked it up and this is where National Review of wrote the article that said the pipe bomb or and powder delivered to CNN were harmless there's just an article that came out\nI'm\nAt nine o nine PM from jak crow at National Review and the reference that he gave us is the Associated Press story right into a link to that right they hear the is the right so we linked to the story\nAnd said okay because we didn't see that anywhere else and we said what does the Associated Press story says you know what what does it say and it's funny because during our pre show me when I read it I said oh it's saying is that I read it a second time I said well no it's not saying it\nBecause what it says is a law enforcement official says tests have determined that a powder found inside an envelope delivered to CNN\nAlong with a pipe bomb\nHarmless right now you'll harmless referring to the power to do that and that's the indication as the it refers to the powder not a pipe bomb now there is no indication as we've stayed to start to show off the FBI has not it\nWe have not seen the words these raw active lie bombs that could have gone off mhm we obscene what but the potentially quote potentially destructive devices and we've asked the question what is potentially destructive devices mean we've seen suspicious packages I'm I've been looking at the last time I checked Fox News about\nTwenty minutes ago they still have the headline suspicious packages\nOr we talked about the the Wall Street journal though are actually being good calling them mail bombs but not having a quote you know from the FBI stating that they were mail bombs these little things and and again we're just two idiots overnight\nBut these are the the little things that are picked up and different websites are not picking it up just quoting the national review story and not linking him to the Associated Press story\nThat you know that the that you know that the a package sent a to CNN was harmless we don't know whether it was or not we don't know if the\nThe uh the the suspicious package separate from the powder in the ... was harmless there's like there's nothing in the a P story according to their source that says that\n... and that's what National Review has reference fight and their headline pipe bomb and powder delivered to CNN were harmless and other websites for picking that up\nWe don't know outside that Associated Press story that doesn't say that right if you read the ... yeah that's\nThat's the point is that right the the the story that their referencing doesn't actually say that\nThey could turn out to be the case and maybe National Review has sources of their own but they're not sourcing they're not eating those ... from the a P right you know so it it's just because\nThe problem is with with if you're going to you know that if that are\nIn the echo chamber of social media especially if that false information misleading information is going to be out there\nThan it is you know it it starts to become or build a narrative in the wrong direction if you start on the wrong premise everything that follows a may sound logical but it still is built on that false premise so\nYou know we've just been and we have a great deal of respect for the people over at National Review yeah they ... or just an oversight here in my opinion because that's not what the associated\nPress story all I can understand that because when I read it the first time mhm that's what I said do you write I said oh there's there's I'm reading here and says the ... and then I read it again I went oh it's not what the set in\n... Washington Post on there headline had it right there headline habit that the powder that was sent along with her was harmless you know along with the suspicious\nPackage was harmless and and so the the point being is that\nThat the narrative is going to grow obviously politically it's going to grow and and build and and still continue up until election day if not pass that\nYou don't you don't do any good by you know repeating false information now people are going by their trust of National Review you know based on the headline\nVoice which National Review to me is extremely credible more

polling\nThey realize and and as you said Eric to use the word\nCrazy not extreme but crazy right Claire McCaskill a mainstream Democrat found that in the last couple of weeks in an election where she's behind\nA still a toss up but she's still behind that she needs to use the term\nCrazy Democrats by not like one of those crazy Democrats ... and it was and and I just have to come upon this article here and I was just doing some scanning here a few moments ago\nFrom A Douglas shown who is the ... the former Democratic pollster who's on Fox News all the time right and just you know and and uh again since he's been a democratic pollster and he's identified a throughout his life as a as as a Democrat and he says the Democrats have a problem or a serious problem but one that\nHave yet to acknowledge fully or frankly at all what's the problem here it is Democrats moved so far and go while the Republicans have a tax on them for being extremists and too far in the clutches of they're tired out of touch leadership have\nBeen working in the Republican campaign is now simple just focus on how far left the Democrats are\nAnd how will be holding its candidates particularly congressional candidates are to the unpopular democratic leadership in both the house and the Senate\nI've argued here and elsewhere the Democrats need new leadership I've also suggested that those candidates were rejected their leadership are likely to do better than those who remain quiet and take the money and suffer the political consequences\nBut right now as we head into the final two weeks of the election campaign it appears that both the Senate and potentially the house races are tightening and it appears in Donald Trump's attacks on the Democratic party for being out of touch with the electorate and too confrontational as well as led by two failed leaders of the past are working\nRest assured the Republicans have failed to take advantage of what\nHas been their principal opportunity which has to run on the economy\nAnd get credit for something that voters themselves the is improving and beneficial you and I said the exact same thing that Republicans still and even the administration focus on things outside of where they have clear victories that are clear to the American public\nAnd at times decide to get into the mud when there's no reason to get into the mud

Democrats vulnerable on immigration because they have not just about the attack that they are for open borders bingo we've been saying for years\nAnd this is what we said pretty much throughout the show yesterday and and the earlier this week\nAs well\nThey have to be positioned to very clearly the question has to be asked\nWhere do you stand on the border they must be forced to say it because it's very clear to most people but but they're going to have to answer the question what level of border enforcement do you support\nWhat\nDon't use the word comprehensive\nExactly what do you support we know you don't want the wall that's a given what do you support we know what you don't want what do you want\n[noise] he said again I have argued elsewhere the party should have been braced an immigration compromise for\nThe wall would be built in exchange for a pathway to citizenship for the eleven to twelve million immigrants not here legally remember he's a lifelong\nUh uh you know a

investigators today Robert Miller George Papadopoulos with wanting to the FBI about his contacts with Russian intermediaries\nWas harmless the powder was harmless\nNot the powder and the pipe bomb right right and so that's what they're that's what they're talking about again here in in that story but it's gone viral because the the National Review again unless National Review know something that we don't but they don't state that understory they're sourcing strictly\nYou're the peace story but the reason that it's important is because as you see something like this go viral if that information is is incorrect or any information is incorrect and the discussions are surrounding this event is clearly look there's the political aspect of this can't be ignored but\nThe discussion is important because you can't discuss anything without knowing the complete facts you can't discuss much without knowing the complete facts we've discussed the reaction\nBy the media by uh the the uh Democrats and and what that has been we know very little about this ...\nAnd that's why we had said to a a mystery soccer over at the CNN or a whether it was close to your Schumer and their their comments\nA you know going after and you know and in essence blaming the president's first provocative statements claiming that they're against divisiveness it's interesting that the people that claim that we need to stop device of this are the ones that have accused somebody\nA responsibility of an incident where nobody has any idea no one has any idea who the person might be who would have done this we don't know whether the bombs were lie bombs and would have gone off or not there is so much we don't know yet they are assessing blame\nThe the ones who claimed that they are against divisiveness hard\nCommittee and the the one of the biggest sit ins of divisive this and that is what blaming somebody\nWhen you don't have the facts behind ... right\nRight\nAnd so as we've said we've discussed is a little bit and and gone through the different questions or as others have yesterday and then we we've asked the question that if it was if they are life ... if they were alive bombs\nAnd and they would have gone off\nA then you have to look at that in a different way than if clearly none of them were alive bombs mhm that it would it be there'd been an attempt to scare\nOr\nAn attempt is a possibility of an attempt to uh\nYou know look at manger figures in the Democratic party that are not liked well by members of the right in this country\nAnd you know try to you know give the tried to send the message that they're out to get them ... board that you know ... if if it was you know if it was it was a real bombing that's but if it was a big bomb it would be was it sent by somebody on the left\nTo try to blame the right there's a whole bunch of different scenarios in questions you would ask is an investigator based on whether the bombs were actually live or whether they were fake bombs right\n[noise] yeah and we can only ... will only know that if and when they find the person who or persons who are responsible\nRight and that could be never\nSo the you can bet right now they have a number of great leads especially with the fact the nature of of how males sorted or by the secret service\nOr in the in terms of the the Clintons when you look at ... and the Obamas when you look at that situation um that I think you have to\nTake into consideration what they already know about the you know patterns of behavior by people who would do such a thing\nAnd and their resources are there probably on to some pretty solid leads right now then add to that of course cameras being everywhere\nSo you will you know as soon as we get information we can start having that discussion but we want to point that out that you're seeing that story from National Review go viral\nIt's important to have the discussion base some facts based on what we know right and there is a difference and we may learn\nThat uh the authorities and and authorities will tell us or might tell us at some point that those devices were effectively harmless because they weren't set to go off\nBut that is not\nWhat you're seeing here and there's a P report that was the source of the national review article\nWhich again just looking at social media overnight it has gone it has gone viral\nThat see there was if we don't know that yet\nAnd I Associated Press story does not state that\nAnd it's important that you know facts were brought up I was reading the daily wire story where they they talked about the a reporter for CNN and the look to Martha ... who was interviewing\nOne of a one of the bomb experts but and this bomb expert gave out all the possibilities who said look could be somebody from the right ... you said it could be a you know it could be but you know a foreign state that is trying to destroy the you know this trying to disrupt the election or\nAs you said it could be a false flag from somebody on the left\nMhm so\nWhat the CNN reporter put out was only the response from this expert of that it was somebody on the left and left out when this experts said give me somebody from the ripe it could be a foreign actor or it could be a false flag from somebody on the left\nBecause the election is just two weeks away so I brought up all the possibilities and investigator would bring out\nAnd what are the CNN reporter to eat out just support that they report that apparently media matters for it out which is a left leaning a or you know media organization media\nA truth organization where they only put out just his opinion you know on the left as if that's who he blamed\nAnd Martha mckell I'm like oh yeah absolutely yeah are fascinating something like that and see if she responded they all believe in somebody for fake news will know the fake news is the actual fact checking of the news\nYou didn't include the entire statement right\n\nAnd which is our point on this entire thing with the national review and the difference between the story that they used as their stores it's important we give a lot of credibility to the national review and have for a long long time\nBut it's important that as you as you knew got twelve days here before the election this is all going to be in terms of the discussion not the investigation but the discussion about it and social media is all politically driven and has been from the start\n\nYou don't win anything by repeating false information\n\nNo you don't win anything by\nA you know at media matters by putting out incomplete\nInformation which indeed is false if you don't include the entire statement\n\nThat so we deal I mean that's the world to really deal with you and I taught of talked about this many times that much we spend much more of our time just trying to disseminate what the truth is out there right and arguing the truth versus the\nConspiracy theories that have troops that are out there and and it does become frustrating at times I Will admit that the story that the you know the national review story that when we read the Associated Press ... when I read up on so you when I read it\nThe first I said wow Erica look they're saying that the bomb and I read the first sentence\nAnd then I re read it again and went on and that's not what they're saying\nNow that wasn't on the air to see a right and it was like no they're not saying that they're saying is it's the powder that came with the the the bomb they're not saying that both were harmless right\nThey're saying the powder was harmless you know that that's what the source said the powder was harmless they didn't even mention about the suspected potentially explosive package they didn't say that either way\nRight on that one so uh again that's you know that's what we deal with\nAnd you know we saw yesterday but you saw it again you saw it from CNN you saw it from the the the Democrats are you know we're picking where well you really couldn't pick and choose the facts because she didn't have any\nVery few\nDow futures up one forty five\nI'm only a for instance\nIf you

to all wet I lay on mobile home for use in six sixty us he\nWas so here's my camera and rigor of unwritten Iranian [noise]\nGary he's six six tiny red eye okay now for the Claire McCaskill I remember\nNow she's a Democrat I that she is a Democrat because people hear this and say the Republicans see the divisiveness calling Democrats crazy no she's a Democrat and ... and in the ad because this ad was a real hear her say ... ad is approved by or\nA where she calls because it's approved by her this was her ad calling Democrats she's not like those crazy Democrats generally go All right\nThen Oklahoma Capitol candidate from the left and right now proved to nominate already know about this job Holly ... a year lawyer who worked in any support those what does he do now\nWell I think we just elected Hindu attorney general manager and he's in your criminal and it never even tried to having Holly been caught hanging at the gym now buying the line during work out for a job that\nThey ... around the one thing they did do is use our tax dollars that lawsuit and protections for preexisting medical conditions are\nTotally helping the insurance company and not I don't always agree with grandma ... works hard fighting against those tariffs doing all those town hall or Colorado greatest end up against her own party and Claire not one of those Oregon Democrat and she works right in the middle and\n\nSo a couple of things there her first of all the word crazy that was very specific they use that for a reason that was done because they came back in some kind of research\nAnd it was probably the number one board used by\nPeople that are undecided a standard center this is why they had the one guy I don't always agree with Claire McCaskill for especially when she acts like a crazy Democrat um though they wouldn't do it wouldn't be that was a positioning statement\nI don't always agree with Claire McCaskill\nWell who does except\nMaybe Claire McCaskill [laughter] I don't know one person on the planet she's probably had disagreements with everyone about it but that's the positioning ... you're going to say that the basically a ... well I Do now she's in the middle\nAnd uh you know the other guy he buys wine and goes to the gym [noise]\nTheater there there's your political argument why do we need a guy that buys wine and\nGoes to the gym\nThat's really what I what I find interesting is you know where politics says come to today and uh and in this case on that on the Democrats' side where you have\nTo say I don't agree with her all the time she's willing to compromise and she's not one of the crazy yeah use that word not one of the the crazy Democrats and I've always found that that interesting why can't a politician and say\nHere's where I stand on this issue this issue this issue if you liked me vote for me if you don't well\nNothing I can do about it I paid for by\nBecause I only vote I don't vote for people that I don't agree with the vast majority on the issues with\nA idea and by the way I Need to say something in the spirit of full disclosure here I Would buy wine at the gym if they sold it okay and if I went to gyms are but [laughter]\nIf it is one of those it's it's it's a horrible attempt I hate to contrived all geez you Bob what are you thinking in terms zero vote\nIt's\nYou can use real real people but that's not what they did here they're trying to portray real people to the sentiment of people\nUm and they probably couldn't fall into it to be\n... and all of sudden with if you look at the the issue that they were concerned about most in that\nAd uh-huh uh it was terrorists yes and we've talked about the mid west it was something that we talked about yesterday that the the the the the farmer that is some of the backbone of the Trump support Democrats are going directly at because of their loss of business because of the the the terrorists mostly due to the Chinese so\nIt is something that we uh we ... we were you brought that up in the last couple of days\nWhen we talk about okay what might affect the Democrats\nTo help them win or what might affect the Republicans to help them win what is the strategy that they're using but in that ad it was terrorists twice\nHere's in just interesting question outside of farmers that that was targeted to in Missouri\nIf you went up to the average person on the street and said what do you think about terrorists do you think that have any idea what they were in a nation or Seventy five percent of the American public cannot tell you what the three branches of government are\nYeah um do you know it's it it really is about the president's I guess in the state of the industry or the particular industry and and and that is the case in in huge farm states\nIt even if you're not a farmer or you know what to do they live nearby or yeah right now you know but you know you know the effect on the farmers and they were in very vocal about it if
