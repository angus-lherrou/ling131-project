Harrison Cory Booker and everybody is talking about free health care well forget about it you're never going to pay for it because you can't tax everything that the rich has to pay for everything that you want from it but it's interesting because they're bringing up the deficit and debt and look you know like what Trump something to death and we've all been set this for\nA ... you and I'm doing the show for Thirteen Years so we were there for the last few years with the Bush administration where we had Democrats constantly calling and saying Bush were spending too much and we said well we hope your hair when Obama is is back in in in ... bombers in power and by the way we criticize Bush on his parents we ... we absolutely did yes\nA and\nA week we criticized one of the images of of Texas a conservatism Tom DeLay when he told a conservative just shut up because we cut just about everything we can and the budget we said you're full of crap and\nSo we have no problem if you listen to the show we ... we have no problem taking on a Republicans when they claimed to be conservative but they are not and so we invited all those people back and it shouldn't be between two thousand five and two thousand eight and we said look the Democrats takes\nIt in two thousand eight we expect you to come back when they sky rocket the debt\nHow many calls we have from Democrats in the eight years\n\nOn the debt on the deficit or ... years of Obama andme can't remember one zero\n\nSo I mean that's they they have no credibility and that and and people don't care that she had two people don't care anymore Republicans used to screen the debt and they realize people don't care now the Democrats were screaming debt is people don't care they they they just don't I have\nA run a couple of things over the weekend where people are saying you got to understand the country has and I think I mentioned this last friday to this country is really going ah we're really going right we're really only right we're really going right in some areas we are\n... physically were not no not even a close eye on on economic issues for moving to the left well entertained him nobody looking party is moving to the lab yeah and you if you look at the uh the the\nThe major threat from capital to capitalism and freedom more importantly a it is that debt or because if we're not going to if we don't care about it now\nThen we're willing to let it go over the edge and at that point you can't turn back which means you have government take over control of industry when industry goes south or if there's a program that goes south or you're going to have what\nAgain or imagine a scenario forget about cutting you know we talked about the whole hair cut thing you know to two percent five percent ten percent\nBut\nThe problem was is that now you can't talk about a one percent cut\nYou can't talk about a one percent increase snow [laughter] you can't you can't live with your increase to one percent\nSo there's there's just no way you would have riots industry member in Europe when they were cutting or some of the social benefits and there were then and there were riots by young people you know they were they were talking about the especially they like retirement benefits and everything else and the young people were writing\nThere were setting cars on fire\nHow dare you take away all of our free stuff\nWell imagine you know an economy our size and we get to the point that we can service that debt anymore\nWell\nRemember it was what open that door it was the jet I mind trick of Brock Obama as president\nBut that's not a problem well today the the\nEconomy isn't collapsing but it will\nAnd I compare to saying well you're bedrooms on fire but you're in the kitchen where everything is fine\nOn on economics on on a tax cuts via the Republican Party is moving more conservative\nOn on spending uh on on a\nOn tariffs and what I'm Talking about China we're talking about the other ones and you know we're moving in the Republican Party is moving in a more socialist quite\nA of a of a position remembers we brought you friday the Commerce Department numbers ... half of the increase we talk about the increase in the GDP half of that increase is due to government spending ... not not the private market booming now half of it is the private market and preventing ... and we agree with that\nBut we look at what's coming down the pike here\nWith what Republicans have done and we're extremely concerned about where the economy\nIs going to go but to me when we talked about you know for example tariffs to get and you got as I said on friday have conservative lost their economic mind\nBecause you have people that are conservatives that would absolutely be against the increased or the government causing the increase in prices and goods and services because the goods are going up and they're claiming that's a that's a good thing that will actually make an economy do better\nActually two responses on that on friday no no no no no tears makes the economy better no it doesn't\nKnow we live in ... and so people that work conservative I rent is delusional state\nOf increasing them prices helps the economy it does it\nIt helps the ... the companies or the industry that has designed to protect beyond that no\n\nWhen we get to I mean we're talking about

which was we need to get money out of politics which was always the dumbest thing in the world Democrats aren't talking about that are they especially with better when Texas no they are in fact they were plotting better do forgetting you know tens of millions of dollars\nRaised right so taking the money I was with dumped ... was was a concept of course you're going to happen to begin with but\nIt got to the point is we know McCain Feingold we need to limit speech of groups groups shouldn't be advertising because it might be able to influence an election where they're supposed to be\nThat's where we got to the point of the dumbest ... slogan ever from the left corporations are people nobody said they were\n\nOf course corporations aren't people corporation as a set of laws set up by government to regulate business if you're a citizen or a group of citizens that gets involved\nAnd that you don't lose your free speech rights and the story that's when I looked at it and said wow it's that's an easy sell because you had McCain then agreed with it and then you had George W. Bush sign at you and I both have the same opinion back then what do you know and\nYou don't get to dictate who was free speech and who does it oh you are defending the corporations I'm not defending anybody I'm defending free speech either we have it or we don't\nThat to me going back and that's why I say roughly Twenty years ago that to me was the beginning of the push to say that the constitution had it wrong\nWell we've seen our free speech as a as has gone to write [noise] we've we've seen the beginnings of a\nNew York city human ah New York city human rights council\nA you don't use the right gender pronoun or will find you out of business California well yeah OK jail times in the law\nAnd you're not going to actually put him and I'm sure that it is as the law it was going to put it in in in in the law and so we talked about you know that we talked about the first time we've talked about free speech the left does not believe in free speech they don't believe in freedom of religion\nWe've talked about the different you know a banker cases force cases\nAre out there and as most people in America believe look don't you want to do behind closed doors\nBut don't care what you want to do with your life\nDon't force me to believe it now the ... once you wants to force you to do it remember when Obama became president oh no no no come on I mean Obama Care and I was going to be find no we're not going to force\nOr anybody who is religious to do anything against what they wish to what to do oh contraception as your contraceptives yeah we're going to force you to do this\nWe knew it all along\nSo you look at freedom of the first amendment they don't believe in that anymore they don't believe in freedom of speech I don't believe in freedom of religion Second Amendment they want gone\nThey believe is antiquated and as we as seen now and this comes from the identity politics ... created and nurtured by the Democratic party\nAre there to the point now of as we saw during Cavanaugh a woman is always to be believed due\nProcess doesn't matter when a woman makes the allegation everybody knows that's total garbage\nEvery case is on the evidence if you came

political divide is in this country then we go even further\nWith the election of Trump and the election and and what happened when Kavanaugh that now the leftist promoting and we're seeing the beginning of this\nAnd it's bad it's spreading now go to social media and see how many\nPeople on the left are picking it up well you know yeah the electoral college was wrong and now so is the Senate the Senate is wrong we shouldn't have it set it anymore and we shouldn't have the electro college which again to me there's no compromise on those issues why\nBecause I understand why they were created they were created to protect individual rights that the left used to care about we've often talked about the ignorance of the people in this country especially on the left when it comes to\nUnderstanding the constitution which they don't even wanna seemed to understand whatsoever\nBut we live in a constitutional republic not a direct democracy and there was a reason for it\nIt was sold the majority could not rule over the minority it was so individual rights could be protected but the majority could not rural your constitutional rights invalid that's why we live in a constitutional republic\nThey don't care and so now the political divide is not how much a government should provide to everybody or how much the transfer of wealth should\nBe\nNow the left has moved into the political divide is bad and we don't believe in the United states\nWe don't believe in individual rights we don't believe in the first amendment we don't believe in the second amendment we don't believe in due process under the law\nWe only care about what we want and however we at tainted including tearing down the constitution of the United states if we had the\nPower to do so where's the compromise if you sit in our states where's the compromise on that\nWell there isn't any there isn't any so there's going to be a political divide and it's going to be fierce and it's going to be passionate\nWell and that's always going to be the case and and right now the reason that it is a the the debate is so fears is because of the importance of those items\nThis is why you seen the Republican Party has been jailed especially since the Kavanaugh thing but I think the the cabinet thing was was not just about\nThe Kavanaugh process or the lack\nOf respect for the process I think it was an eye opener for a lot of those that were in the middle\nI think it was an eye opener for Lindsey Graham\nBecause\nYou and I had a one time during a pre show meeting during all that\nAfter it happened we were like I said wow\nWho knew Lindsey Graham huh but you have Lindsey Graham actually say during that are passionate speech talk about\nThe process during Sotomayor\nAnd Elena Kagan's\nConfirmation\nAnd what the discussion was about\nBut I think for a lot of them\nThey live inside the bubble\nThey don't see it as we see it every single day they follow the rhetoric but they don't follow it like we do certainly they they hear things and they see things but now they were ... people were getting in their face\nNow it had come to their\nTable right there on the committee\nOr did they start with a Senate majority leader basically being chased down in an airport\nThey saw it with with Ted Cruz and it wasn't just protester groups that kind of behavior had reached the Senate chambers\nAnd I think it was an eye opener for them to put it on perspective and say well yeah\nOf course it was bound to reach our table it was bound to get here ultimately and it has and that was the real threat\nBecause forget about the the the the protesters\nAnd and and all of those who were shouting at the faces of people you have the endorsement of that behavior since Maxine Waters and even before that of others saying it's OK er Don Lemon saying oh it's it's comes with the territory\nYou should expect this but then they go further\nWe need more of this Michael Moore just the other

what what somebody told of it we have when\nThey're currently I'm Gary ... so just having a discussion on the political divide from our point of view and and why it exists today and and it's just it's a reality of what we what we live with a worn out the first ones\nTo live the political divide in this country and we won't be the last the only difference in the political divide now is it's not a political divide anymore as I can see it based on the fact that we as a nation need to provide more\nTo the people with a bigger federal government under the constitution but now it's a belief on the left that the laws and the constitution that we have to protect individual rights and the minority\nDon't matter anymore\nAnd so you know we we've talked about capping off the caravan also brings not just illegal immigration or into the forefront but it brings in the concept of sanctuary\nCities mhm and I still believe that the Republicans have failed miserably to capitalize on this because yeah science or you think about sanctuary cities just the belief\nThat an illegal immigrant criminal and their freedom\nIs more important than the\nRights and security of American citizens that's the point that it's been brought up enough\nWhat you hear is sanctuary cities well we need to protect these people ... what are you doing you're not protecting just illegal immigrant you're protecting the illegal immigrant criminal ... by the way that's actually why it's news\nYeah\nYeah it's it is not you know this is the ... you I think the the situation\nFor now where you had a city's come out and and go after the state for sanctuary stayed policy\nAnd the\nThe concerns that were issued at those all of those events surrounding that and it's still going on it'll be ... and that will be an interesting legal battle by the way uh to watch in the coming\nYears um\nBut that threat is is very real when you talk about your cities' leaders are your county or your state leaders saying we're not here to protect you\nI mean that goes beyond think about the empty political but the political promise the promises\nOver the years we're going to be tough on crime we're really going to work to improve things that some people actually were able to get it done\nBut those empty political promises people usually scoff at\nThis is quite the opposite it's not just a political promise it's an in your face action by the government that says\nWe are not here to serve you and your safety interests were here to serve the same the interests of someone who doesn't belong here who was not a citizen\nAnd so I think it's important where the political debate has been to many people are falling into the political debate has become the back and forth on social media every tweet what's analyze it back and forth who had the worst\nInsult who made who who who made or the the social media statement that can be perceived as a little bit more violent than the other person even though it really wasn't violence and even if they were kidding around and we're like let's talk about what really the political divide in this country is really about what is the substance of the political\nDivide right and I believe from my point of view\nThat's that's what I fear\nI fear a loss of liberty I fear a loss of the protection of the uh minorities\nIn this and and and I mean across the board I'm Talking about constitutionally speaking ... the the reason we live in a constitutional Republican not a direct democracy\nAnd that's why the call to get rid of the Senate and the call to get rid of of of of the electoral college even if it's not going anywhere it shows the intent and we're the left wishes to go when\nYou see sanctuary cities when you see open borders when you see their leaders promoting lawlessness\n\nPromoting it yeah that's when you get to the point of people saying I don't know where I can compromise how do I how do I deal with you how do I talk to you\nRight\nHow do I how do I get I don't want to get across when when the cabinet thing goes on and you have\nThe main stream of the Democratic party the mainstream Democrat senators\nPromoting that a certain demographic

political divide that exist in the United states and today in analyzing it what it is let's head right back to you go to ray a in Birmingham, Alabama excuse me Randy Randy Hi you're on the Radio Welcome to the show Hi Randy\nThank you sir I Am not my opinion as is this the last is trying to take us to take the United states to the point of failure and I believe that the United states files that you know where's the rest of the world to understand\nWhere the where the savior of the world if if we're not their face of problem happens in the world we are there what happens\nKnow you you make a a you make a great point and I'm a remember when\nTrump first started running for president people wonder if you'd be an isolationist mhm he wants to back off he doesn't want to get involved he's been pressing noted states now he probably has projected us power\nWithout you know any type of major war better than any president I Know they're in in in my lifetime ...\nYou know projecting it I guess maybe you can make a case for Reagan because of the the the the Cold War or a different thing Reagan pet post Cold War say let's go post okay well sure but it's it's I don't think it's unfair because I was totally different situation when you look down at the Cold War that exist there but post Cold War\nAh I I think he's actually he hasn't been an isolationist I think he understands that even though we don't want to get involved in everybody's business you've got to project American power and I believe that he has why they want to do it is an interesting case I Do think that you have\nFor example you have left us professors that are sitting there and their thing tanks and talking about how we need to be you know global citizens and how the United states needs to you know needs to go away and to become part of a Europe or whatever but I think when it comes to comes down to the average person it's not that complicated\nI think they're not getting into theoretical political discussion leftist discussions\nI think it's about the fact that they get into the tunnel vision and say oh we didn't we\nKavanaugh's and we can't have Gavin I'll get rid of the Senate well uh it's every time they prompt trials president trying to get rid of the presidency um get rid of the electoral college at remedy we get rid of the electoral college we can't have a ... if we lose the electoral vote\nAnd win the popular vote we can't have that\nRight and and and it is pretty much the solution to everything from the lack of that didn't go away we'll get rid of that\nSo I don't I don't know if the I don't believe that the average liberal running around\nWho was outside of university\n[laughter] or liberal think tank is going through that process of saying we wish to all be global citizens I Know that's promoted\nBut you see the multiple do those kinds of comments mostly come from university\nAh type people I think it's the average liberal politician out there since her and says I Want to win the election next election what can get a bill for me open borders well I really don't want to open borders but I Want as many illegal immigrants to come in because if we claim that if we claim that we care about them than it would they can get citizenship will get their vote\nWell in that said it it's you know if we can it if we can ah posed as people as the side that cares the fact of the matter is is they only care about again their side of\nThe things that they want they want to completely do away\nWith the foundation of the nation they want to\nDo away with this what's the what's anybody who disagrees with oh\nWe want free speech but only free speech or the things we agree ...

I don't think it's needed something is needed to win but I Know it's part of his personality I to say it but as ... as the great conservative political\nPundit shots he said ...\nMember during the campaign or was it after the campaign so it was after the campaign loves messing with people's heads yeah we're from queens we mess with people right now I don't like it because I think that on so many issues he has no\nWhen he doesn't have to get personal\nWell in my in ... in a in a lot of the rhetoric where I order in order to get the when we've talked about this in great depth last week got some complaints on it that's fine [laughter] welcome to talk radio but it's not needed mhm the\nInstant satisfaction of somebody on their side was mean so you can be mean back and you get that instant enjoyment stop but we don't need it\nSo specially with the wins that this president is getting that the other Republicans haven't been able to get or weren't willing to take on in years right\nBut the wins do the talking\nBut I understand but I've come to realization of of who he is by the way I did see some I did a somebody that social media are posted well you can no longer look a Trump and say that the rhetoric is acceptable because he has good policy\nWon't know\nActually you can and you can also say for all of his rhetoric um [noise] look at the opposition mhm look what the choice was\nWhat was the choice mhm the\nAngel Hillary yeah my name's ... death ... was it like I said it's a [laughter] ...

lot of winning comprehensive immigration reform but they'll never get into the specifics of what should be included in that comprehensive immigration reform when it comes to border control\nWhat you had or you ... ... what you have a right now you think about this Trump is being blamed for the caravan\nLook you can hear me blame 'cause the guy I mean blamed for the Asia is being blamed that he doesn't care and the and the and the point is because he said we're going to stop and that the border and Democrats are saying no they all should be able to get through because they're only looking for the American dream and that's what's fair\nWell then at that point it nice there but if you believe that as the mainstream now the Democrat Party believes you may be a liberal and you may say you disagree with it but it's what your party now endorses\nThey may not you know they may not use the term open border but that's what they mean go ahead I'm Sorry go ahead [laughter]\nIt is it is unfortunate that that\nPerception of the Democratic party is now collaborated but I I Would I Would venture to tell you that no president\nIn the past three or four administrations has deported more illegal immigrants ... key deported more immigrants than any President Trump Bush Clinton Reagan none of them\nOkay and look I in my own no I Love to know the way here leaning Democrat okay wants open borders okay one day here's here's here's why are they leave we want ... here here's the point I Want I mean we\nWe can debate the numbers some other time but let's say that's absolutely true and nobody ... deported more than President Obama then why is Trump being demonized for believing the same thing that Iraq Obama believed things are hyperbole ... has a little\nBit less than ... than Obama dead when it comes to his ...\nAnd the way he talks about the way he talks about it not ... not what he wants to do ... people are against what he wants to do is that what you're trying to say\nOh I'm trying to say is the is it seems to me or as someone who is your brother is your fellow American citizen and I love you don't have a ton of conservative friends Republican friends\nWe're all brothers we're all brothers\nWhat I'm saying is that it seems to me that the and the way he characterizes people who are in need\nAnd if you were in their position if you were in the same position you want the best for your family you want you would want the best for your friends you you would want the best for yourself you want the best life it seems to me\nThat you're in a lot is not in the last ... after that we're and gestures guilty okay well let me we're shares we are using language to characterize right right well here's ... here's the point is ugly right now that people are dying in my opinion of All right okay All right bill that are dying as\nA result of hatred and partisanship coming from both sides and I will tell you that the left as justice guilty\nOkay here's what I think here's the point that I Want to get too because you this is very important because one of the things that that really gets to conservatives because conservatives have compassion\n\nYears you were listening Iranian mobiles new home use intolerant six that when you when you when you\nHave any of these\nAre currently I'm Gary ... six six Ninety row died or to the last caller we uh you know after your call and I'm sure we'll get more people saying this because they do every time both sides are responsible for creating the type of rhetoric that causes these shootings I Would disagree with that\nBut are they ... what happens after we have a shooting and and I go back to O. while when I first became a talk show host in the nineties there were a lot of the shootings that that happened I Will say this that\nThe ... from my experience sitting in my chair and I'm not going to say it's a dumb argument to get in well ... ... both sides do it well yeah you'll be able to find both sides who do it you're going to ... when you have tens of millions of people in each political party yeah somebody from both sides are going to try to make political a out of something\nBut what does the media what does the mainstream media and when you get to more official politicians off of social media what happens when there's a shooting almost immediately ... comes out and starts talking about gun control\nIt happens I mean it's it's right away they don't even ... it's ... not one day or two days it's the same it's at press conferences from\nLocal officials before\nWe even know what happened in any incident\nIs immediately politicized um\nAnd then you will have from what I normally seen it could be exceptions to the rule\nBut what I normally seen afterwards is then when the right gets involved and starts talking about the second\nAmendment ... in that\nGoes on\nA\nTo sit and discuss what rhetoric may dry\nBut a mass\nShooter to do what they want it's I guess on your part it would be a gas on my part\nNone of us know\nYou don't know what set saw people and so to say we need to ... do we need to temper the rhetoric across the board\nUm I think we should as conservatives because I think we can win every issue without doing so I understand why the left and I understand why some people on the right do it I disagree with it but I understand why they do it the leftist nothing else to go on\nThe last caller I like I said it was really interesting it was talking about how we need to get rid of the hyper partisanship and then he went into hyper partisanship\n\nWell and and and saying that he doesn't know anybody that's for open borders I don't know anybody that well the fact of the matter is is that\nThere are people out there that are calling for open borders I think we sort of convince\nAnd here's the thing I I Would ask\nYou to ask those that use side with and I mean the people running for office or that are holding office right now ask them\nWhat level of enforcement on the border\nDo they believe it it's a very simple question right up\nBut we live in a nation would free speech we're not going to get rid of free speech the second amendment isn't going away free speech is going to stay\nA there is a party that was just to get rid of it ours is not that party\nAnd they're very they're working very hard right now to to do that and and if you think to the last caller about him saying that doesn't exist then go to talk to the people of California by the way you're using the wrong pronoun there is a penalty of up to a year in jail and that law for a reason\nWhy I say ours I mean conservative mhm I said party I meant conservative because Republicans as you remember McCain was a Republican the sign McCain or that a sponsor McCain fined gold and Bush signed saying that he knew parts of it were unconstitutional but hold up the courts deal with it and you and I were in serious when he did that so there\nYou know if if you if you think that you know do your the the card in describing well where are your brothers were you know we we are trying to paint every one is\nAs someone who thinks that Sam on the left\nBut that's not the case tell me it's not extreme in New York\nWhen they say if you use the wrong pronoun we can find you up to the point that it would shut your business down in California\nIt's in the law [noise] they can put you in jail for using the wrong pronouns now tell me that's not a threat\n[noise]\nAs soon as ... radio on was good one\nMyth or show listen anywhere at any time on demand to catch up on Eric and Gary's

I come out and well there's a Toyota Prius falling in [laughter] the park you know couple of spaces down from my truck and I'm just thinking\n... [noise] I Wonder how they're gonna you know I live in a very liberal county are not very liberal county but it's a liberal county as the blue county and the town is\nLess blue but that's it's still you know gets more and more is becoming more and so you you just wonder\nI Wonder who that person is I Wonder what they think I almost want to stand out there with a microphone and and talk to them\nYou know or just do just to just know Mike flag nothing just so what are you thinking on election day you know because it ... I'm always curious as to the people\nWho do participate especially an early voting it's not just you know conservatives um it's liberals but even in our state you know it's a red state but you see that participation on both sides so you wonder what they are thinking and\nAnd if I could have a conversation with a number of them just just a roundtable you have you have mine mine said yesterday was such a nice day yeah I mean this is uh to me this is\nThis is not work today I'm In the middle of a three day vacation and I just happened to be doing this today because it's supposed to have any like eighty today in Haiti\nTomorrow and then it's gone so I'm pretending this is like a long weekend and I just happened to come in here and want to chat with you ... I wanted to bring in some alcohol to pretend I was staying out real late in the morning and ... right so I took a long bike ride yesterday Fifteen mile bike ride and I did it all throughout my huge subdivision\nThat I live in ... and as I was driving around there were probably knows I'm riding around I'm looking for one crew sign one because I told you the other day I\nI didn't think I saw on why specifically when Fifteen miles around I live in a subdivision that probably has about three thousand thirty five hundred homes I think it is relatively new\nUh south south of ... of south west to Dallas a twenty five miles southwest of Dallas or right\nBefore you get to farmlands where I live you know it was like subdivision farmland but the big subdivision\nOr probably about two or three every block I Would go down every street two or three sides didn't see one crew sign in Fifteen miles driving through my subdivision and you and I asked the question is that even an effective way to spend your campaign dollars [laughter] [noise]\nYeah I see a number of them are in my neighborhood uh there's there's a few but there's just as many Ted Cruz signs right now and yards in mind that we're\nNot anecdotally couldn't couldn't find one yeah and and but I'm driving it I'm\nGoing on man I Would love to talk to these people ...\nLike if they were sitting out there and drive wages pay how ya doing pull up my bike riding the bike and then look at it uh even for about\n... death even if I had to not be honest and tell [laughter] well and it still has and not just a volunteer information just go see a voting for better why over Cruz\nNo that's that's exactly the way I Would like to approach it especially at the polls just have like a ... just a roundtable discussion of people that are voting or just cast their vote a okay you know what do you think as you just cast your vote\nSo it would be you'd say what are you thinking not\nGet yeah so you're exactly okay what do you like what is\nIt that is you know because it is it different in every locale it's it's different in every precinct uh it's different you know state to state\nUh we do have you know Democrats that that when I mean Beto has won his district I mean and and can if he wants to serve in the house he can he can stay in that district I think for a long long time if he wants to\n'em but there are\n... you know again as you as you kind of why now through the state I'm just curious as to what the the average everyday person is thinking because clearly they're active voters so there's there's that\nIs it a routine kind of thing it almost is routine for me but I take it very seriously and it is a very thoughtful process because I Do take it seriously\nYeah but routine there's nothing wrong with routine it means just party ... is part of the culture that you grew up and vote right\nBut I Wonder are there are some people that that have a routine and it's just based on you know this is the ideology and and this is it and it's not or not even a ideology there's just no way I can vote for the other side I mean there's a number of questions that I Would have\nAnd I would sit it would probably take hours to sit around and just a just a regular you know think of Frank Luntz and the stuff that he's done you know\nFox News or the years I like Frank but I always think he asked the wrong questions you know why he doesn't ask the questions I Would ask you exactly [laughter] and and\nI think in that setting too I mean these are these are people that I I Know just voted these are people that are active especially if you were to do it like in an early voting setting mhm you know that that are active early and it's going to I Know what's going to be on both sides\nUm I Would love to see what is it that's driving you and we'll we'll see some of that I think you know after well a week from Wednesday we'll we'll learn what some of that\nWas here's a question I Would ask in Texas nobody is even talked about the governor's race\nYeah there's really not a race they can talk about [laughter] because Greg Abbott has a roughly a twenty points leap year over ... Valdes the Democrats the F ...\nA former former sheriff of ... and that's not even close you you don't hear anything about that so here's a question that I Would ask this is a very interesting question\nYou have probably a couple of hundred thousand people maybe even more that are voting for Greg Abbott but will not vote for Ted Cruz ... there are people out there that are voting for Greg Abbott who will vote for better or work why would be my question mhm\nRight because there's such a disparity if if there is\nAnd right now of a with a real clear politics I he's roughly up a a Ted Cruz roughly seven points\nThey have they moved it I think in our cp though as to now lean it's not a close to ...

over the last week or let's go to James Lewis whole Texas a James welcome you're on the Radio Welcome to the show high\nA as a news or as an American black who conservative boy when you started off the show talking about how you see a fight those values are and take\nA specially when it comes to the African American you understand let's look at when did when I go to working or interest to my everyday life because that's just to\nA group of people or by life ... centered around and they always ask me why are you know conservative and being black is because I'm a fan for myself I'm what's the alternative is a socialist type\nBut we'll go to where if you're a Christian as you say you're a Christian um those systems Adams to what you believe you know and if you are a male black male talking about racism\nUnder those that this book as you say something that the other the ruling party or rolling mob doesn't like you're you're you're going to be in jail or be ostracized so\nI mean if you're ... you're at now you're not thinking about about all these other systems that you don't even know that you're promoted just because it's not a Republican issue there you're you're not educated yourself on what you just need to really do and what they really are\nI\nI Can't argue with anything that you just said they have a date they really don't understand at times what they're promoting\nAnd James ... I've said this the biggest challenge that we face today is talk show host is not debating the issues it's debating against ignorance\nPeople actually don't know what they're actually promoting to me that's the most 'cause if I go ahead go ahead\nYeah because if I asked by my African American person that that that at dumpster with or Latino person you know I'm asked them because I learned this from you guys what are you\nFor what I mean I Know what your guests but what are you for and and most of them they were to get a check like what they're for Degas articulate what their desk\nAnd as a black person I have to say so they have that my skin color doesn't change how I live my life it informs me on ignorant people in my viral ... what does it take to me how I think how I live so therefore ah\n\nWhen you're saying right something as the problem do really well do you ever noticed and what that is America races or you're talking about individual people who act it correctly right\nIt's go down that and I I think that's what we do you know battle against all the time because\nThere had been we've changed the definition of things or people label certain things\nAnd we have to go back 'cause you just display their ... James we have to go back and ask them okay what is it that you mean by that specifically what kind of actions are behavior you talking about when it comes to people that do you believe a racist because we have to go back to every uh you know Republican\nA presidential candidate and Bill Maher said it\nYou know during the twenty six team a a ... election season while the other guys Mitt Romney and\nUh you know George W. Bush and John McCain well they weren't Hitler Hitler but but definitely this guy is really Hitler but that's the that's the moment the left they really want to\nCome out and and make you believe that this guy or whoever it is the most recent with her at the current threat is the one that is is is the biggest threat to you right now the only way they can get away with that or they think they can get away with that is by creating a monster and the person\nYou know an James I saw the a young black Leadership Conference that the President Trump spoke to the other day and I saw one of the young people that was interviewed that said I'm finally off the plantation\nAnd when he said that I went wow that's going to drive liberals just crazy but to me and I'm not black but to me when he said that\nWhat it was was I I'm I'm Out of the ... out of the mindset of groupthink that it ... you know I'm involved in group think find being told that I must think this way because of the color of my skin and then my mind is still in the plantation\nAnd that and that's what I've heard some of the ... that you're you're you're pointing the finger at a\nRepublican plantation what I'm saying what what are you a are on right now\nThat wanna allow you to think as you really think because we're but when you're talking about folks about the homosexual if a and the marriage\nThing or whatever that you're talking about ... issue as little as it up with more of a conservative mindset but because of their best so brave brainwashed and ship it up or racism racism racism racism at clouds their their their their judgment", "show_name": "Red Eye Radio", "year": "2018", "city": "Fairhope", "day": "29"}
