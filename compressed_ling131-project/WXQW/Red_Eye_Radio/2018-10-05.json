is yes he's he's rate it a hundred as as the U.S army does this he's waited a hundred percent disabled in World War one but he goes off in fights again in World War two and the south Pacific\nWhere he is again a hundred percent disabled so these Roosevelt are very brave\nGuy as junior is wounded eventually he's wounded in July of Eighteen but he's blown up with Archie Ken junior will be on the beaches of on the Utah BS right he's a famous or generals lands I think he's deputy commander of the division fourth division\nAnd they're lost and he says we start the war here exactly I has a heart attack within a couple a day that's right dies right on right on the beach or the now we've come to Clinton this is a very hard part of the book to read because you know what's coming\nQuinn is killed

October\nMassive direct assaults by our divisions against fixed fortifications of the German army first troops with machine guns and\nDepots but I'll leave that they are he's he's killed and shut the

not it's not it's Clinton it's quite quite don't tell Mrs Roosevelt and then the word comes in\nAnd it's a it's it's this tragedy in stages where\nHe's been shot down but he is he dead is he alive plug it wasn't burning when it went downhill and hope that he Lanny crash before you can survive a crash is he a prisoner\nPeople don't know and it takes a while before the word comes in from the Germans they start dropping is affected by the American lives they put a official statement\nThat Clinton is finally did he was killed with two bullets in his head says you ride right away ah the tragedy now\nWorsens because TR apparently loses all interest in almost everything except for what his grandchildren\nHis grandchildren of course he has to finish World War one he has to he has to go out is his health is increasingly deteriorating and even before Clinton's deaths he spends a month that Roosevelt Hospital on the west side here in Manhattan\nUh with with abscess is and is\nA there's an operation on his on both ears and his left ear is completely ruined in Oregon and half death yes he's got ... and he and his heart is slow yes and he's lost his balance so he has to learn how to

that\nPicture he's holding himself up with both hands against the podium and against the stench and holding the roof up and that's a very telling picture that September thirtieth Nineteen Eighteen he had\nA physician who was treating them routinely yeah she's they used morphine regularly they used morphine we know of twice and probably more in when he goes back into the hospital on armistice day on armistice day\nNineteen Eighteen he's given morphine for the pain and he has given morphine for the pain on January fist of just before he goes to bed a night of his death\nRight and now we come to the part that you piece together like a detective story was it was it a decision of him his own to take his own life or to risk his death with morphine\nThis really came to me at the end of writing the book right at the end and then the information came in in a torrent\nTo me once I started to think about having the background the T. R. and then finding more and more as sort of a means motive and opportunity\nI mean nothing definite in terms of proof and there was no autopsy there's no autopsy a he has a soup real streak of

been too emotional at times during his Senate testimony last week course started Caitlin Collins takes a closer look at the opinion\nPage thing that Democrats think critics at his phrase in recent days not just the sexual assault allegation is whether he misled Congress on his drinking habits and he has a right to conduct and timber may even be on the Supreme Court said something that they're considering clearly he's hurting us prisons and that is why he came out\nTo write this op ed publishing is an hour before they are sent to those potentially find whether or not confirming ...\nAnd the Republican Party is threatening to a row Democrats voter enthusiasm advantage because the forward debate over Brett Kavanaugh's nomination enters its final phase\nPolitical strategist suggesting the geo peas enthusiastic embrace of capping off to spite multiple allegations of sexual misconduct may have shifted the political landscape at least temporarily by injecting new energy into the Republican Party's most passionate voters\nProbably maybe we mentioned her just once or twice passing joking but why does anybody give her any type of credibility whatsoever I've always well then again if you're talking about the left I say you should give somebody credibility by the substance of their argument well that's the case you'd never hear from anybody on the Web so I I forget about what I just sat there well I don't know why\nShe's relevant is she in the current show I don't know I actually don't know I don't know why she was relevant otherwise\nI saw what those who's the boss sits runs all the time you know I'm just kidding [laughter] and she was in the the one with the er which is\nYeah yeah yeah so she was a wedge right yeah yeah yeah yeah so\nI don't know I I have no idea if she's in a TV show right now or not but I\nDon't know why because she was in something last year I don't I really I mean she's she's relevant\nTo the situation because she claims you know that she was sexually assaulted so\nI don't know that oh yeah I mean I Know I Know you see that in part of him yeah she'll probably ...\nTo ... yeah yeah\nI didn't know that she said she was sexually assaulted that's what I didn't know okay that makes that would that would be a connection that you can use to gain you know right up into this topic because that's what it's about\nRight okay but I but\nOp culture wise I don't know she still is or not I actually don't know well as I've said you know we because we hear people coming forward you know uh you know saying look I've also been I was sexually assaulted two ... and I stand with her well as we said before whether you were sexually assaulted or not\nStill does not give you any more credibility\nWhen a charge is filed\nOr you know when the charges filed against someone I don't mean legally but in this case uh in um in his nomination to the Supreme Court but the\nAllegation itself has\nTo be backed up by evidence your case for no matter how heinous an evil it might have been if you are sexually assaulted has nothing to do with this case right\nAbsolutely nothing because you were sexually assaulted does not give you a better insight as to whether Kavanaugh is guilty or not right\nNone zero right and that is portrayed\nThe you know it's one of the one falls that's portrayed\nMore than ... than you were late here in the ... because you are sexually assaulted in or what you think about cabinet carries more weight than with us and that's ridiculous I\n... statement to make or to be promoting it has promoted constantly in this you know and then it matters is the evidence and every Seattle case and you and I talked about this how long have we talked about this when you know whether it was Trayvon Martin where people were taking sides left and right and we just said look here's the problem\nMhm you've got that was that the two or three or four minute span there where he was running away and then the next thing you know uh he was on top of ... that's the only thing that people saw at that point\nAnd because of that huge blank space in there that no witnesses are there nobody can say what happened so\nThey went by the physical evidence which wars the life the uh the the injuries to Zimmerman's head but exactly we said and even a juror or a jury member said\nIt's possible that he got away with murder it's just that with the evidence we couldn't prove because he claims that\nYou know he felt as his life was an imminent danger\nAnd and we rejected at that point and the ... people uh who would call this show and with certainty say they knew the guilt or innocence site and we had people bringing up the Trayvon Martin wasn't an angel doesn't matter whether she was not an angel\nRight or any other time of his life it doesn't matter what Zimmerman hadn't said at any time in his life quite all the matter was he said\nI'm going to say that right Trayvon Martin right with it and I would have been obviously where I Would have been which are more said and\nSay ... but people were definitive in their belief of guilt or innocence\nMhm based\nOn a lack of evidence and what they think possibly happen we have rejected that we will always reject that as Americans as far as I'm concerned you're\nObligated to reject that type of this mindset I'm so you go by the evidence the evidence says what dictates everything\nThe motion is what carries the ah the the cause and and and such protests and and certainly for the families who suffer are the the loss of a loved one whether it's a Trayvon Martin's family or or Michael Brown family you can feel for their loss but also no\nThis is this is possible but many people find it impossible to feel for the last of the family but also believe and see by the evidence the what the evidence shows that\nThe evidence points to that person also being responsible now it didn't necessarily and and the and the Trayvon Martin case you had\nYou know what the physical evidence was was ... and then that's what the jury found and we we don't have\nWe don't have a everything the jury's off no no but in the Michael Brown situation with officer ... Wilson on the scene\nI'm you know the the family ah was the first to commission an autopsy and that autopsies the one that show the hands up don't shoot never heritage was alive\nAnd still being used today as a rallying cry that ever happened a that is unacceptable in America right you know we we talk about the Democrats are always talking about the fascist on the right\nWell if you listen to what we believe and what we believe about the presumption of innocence whether it's a criminal trial a civil trial or\nJust a public opinion in general or a political trial\nStill it's the same thing you judge these cases you judge cases and you'd and and you judge the guilt or innocence based on the evidence that exist not just an allegation alone and and the thing is\nI'm saying this with passion but I really don't have to because every single Democrat\nListening right now every single liberal and democratic protesting yesterday they all know it but they are willing to throw it overboard mhm you know how they know it because of the first ones many of those who are in a you know who ah were arrested yesterday\nA will would demand due process under you know due process under the law but the fact that they know it but they will reject it when it comes to their personal politics\nFascism leaves the mindset of fascism leans in them when it's what they want when it comes to how they're going to be treated you know we must follow the constitution completely\nBut treating somebody else the constitution be damned the spirit of the constitution be damned the mindset of the presumption of innocence and the evidence is the only thing that leans and shouldn't lead is\nThrown out the window because we want what we want\nYou know when it comes down to I was following a case here in Texas where a man had been wrongly found guilty of murder and all that and you have a Nineteen years in prison and\nGot out and twenty sixteen they wanted to be fully exonerated was working to that end and finally it happened it was full exonerated so that's a total of Twenty one years\nWhere she was either behind bars are having his you know his name essentially associated with a murder that happened that he was not responsible for so I was doing some research just to try and refresh my memory on other cases and there was a man who was accused of rape and spent decades behind bars\nUm it was raping assault then something else or I think a aggravated assault and rape or in a third charge that I Can't remember but he was behind bars for thirty one years\n\nBefore he was proved it was proven that he was not the person responsible now mistakes happen in the justice system or we don't have we have the DNA technology now that can prove that it wasn't a you know\nOr their DNA at the scene or whatever it is\nBut you think about\nYou know the\nThe label that goes with being falsely accused and there was a great burden that comes with that for a reason now sometimes it's that the work done in the investigation wasn't wasn't right sometimes it's an overzealous prosecutor on the ... and the legal setting looking to get a political win\nBut\nSometimes witnesses get it wrong well and and in one case in in the murder case it was it was a couple of jailhouse witnesses that helped to seal the deal\nAnd you you look at that and and you you think to yourself we often jumped to that conclusion

referring to the letter\nA Chuck Grassley Sunday a letter to the lawyers of a doctor for did said oh I'm writing in response to your letter dated October second you said Dr ... says yesterday said you said Dr Ford is going to turn over her in a documents\nTo the FBI but my request to view was not for the documents to be turned over to the FBI ... the documents the Senate Judiciary committee your response on behalf of the client\nIs an onset quarter of the constitution charges the Senate with the ... and the president and his nomination senators have a constitutional obligation to investigate and evaluate independently the president's nominees are obligation as unrelated to anything be FBI does\nThat's why we just don't vote on nominees after the president loans us or the FBI background investigation we have to make our own assessment the U.S Senate does not control the FBI if you have an objection of how the FBI conduct suits investigations take it up with director rain\nBut don't raise that objects and there's a reason not to respond to this committee's demand for relevant evidence the FBI's investigative decisions aren't our concern\nEven at the FBI never interviews Dr Porter interviews or ten times this committee as a constitutional obligation to investigate Dr Ford's allegations and that's what we've been doing since we became aware of or allegations it's not even clear to me what purpose turning old do over those materials\nTo the FBI would accomplish the FBI would simply turn that off but in sober\nTo watch this as we just said that we we stopped\nThat's the only purpose the FBI search that's always\nAn outsider's probably stop the last caller says while they're well they're they're political what the investigation by political ... the ... the the FBI only facilitates the interviews they conduct the interviews because they have the resources and the training and that's it's that simple right\nAnd and so it doesn't make it again this this is where her lawyers are bringing up something that isn't even relevant to the investigation to begin with because\nFor the million time there is no\nFBI investigation the only investigation that's been going on it's a Senate Judiciary investigation because it it just shows you how\nThe the lawyers for Dr Porter either\nCompletely clueless or they didn't want those notes to come out\nBecause had they been given to the FBI again assume the FBI decided to respond to them and take those notes those therapists notes they would have been part of the report\nThey wouldn't they wouldn't have seen the light of day beyond the eyes of a hundred people\n[noise] uh it's not even and by the way emerging as for my phone so I just happened to go into it or into the Mollie Hemingway was on it it's not even clear what purpose turning those materials over to the FBI would accomplish the FBI would simply turn that evidence over to the Senate that is precisely the outcome but I think with this request\nIs to get the information you have claimed repeatedly that the evidence ... question supports Dr Ford's allegations against judge gambled off\nShe even provided some of the evidence to\nGive me a second here as I have to go\nTo a a to a national media indeed if the evidence or supported your clients allegation you surely would produce it\nAs quickly as you could but you have repeatedly refused to produce this evidence to the Senate in doing so you are preventing the Senate from consider any evidence most crucial\nTo Dr Ford's allegation\nI don't know what other infringe we should draw\nFrom your refusal but that the withheld evidence does not support Dr Ford's allegation and quite the way you will have claimed who that's a challenge is not right I urge you once again now for the third time in writing\nTo turn over the therapy notes polygraph materials and communications with the with the Washington Post that Dr Ford\nHas relied upon as evidence in addition to the evidence I requested\nIt might Tobar second letter in light of recently uncovered information this is interesting because that was the key of look at the last sentence with recently uncovered information please turn over

member\nMy step in preparation for the September twenty seventh hearing the alleged witness was identified by Dr Ford leaving them Kaiser mark judge and Patrick Smith and a W were mirrors Julie sweat Nick or their representatives sincerely Chuck Grassley that letter sent yesterday\nSo it was like I said the last caller brought away as she was willing to turn him over to the FBI and our and our point was ... when I'm when I said no it's like because\nOur point does it go directly to the Senate to begin with yeah there is no investigation they wouldn't be in bed they simply take it and give it to the Senate Judiciary committee\nKind of ended up in the report we wouldn't see it the the the only senators were sent the only the centers would\nYou're living in ... at a place for mom partner

walking around ... thank you or the Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell for listening and and also Senator Lindsey Graham Felicity as best I guess\nAnd probably Rand Paul although he's screaming know all the time um but [laughter] we actually love ramble but if you're walking around you know in public the average person and someone just ran up to you and started screaming\nThanks you wouldn't know what they're\nDoing you know you don't you don't know what the threat level as the ...\nAnd and and certainly it's different when you were Jeff Flake and you're confronted and the way he was in you you you know why they're in your face but you can't assess the threat level in public you can you just cannot you know you don't know what the person who is capable of doing if they're good you know they're physically harm you\nUm it's it's impossible to assess that\nSo that such security has been ramped up\nA tremendous uh the restaurant in fact the where Ted Cruz was shamed out of the

Supreme Court Justice John Paul Stevens suggesting Thursday he believes Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh should not sit on the ...\nRight now the only Democrat it looks like you might be able to count on is Joe match\nSo if you've got every Republican on board assuming that a Jeff Flake is the U.S then that gets you to fifty two\nIf Jeff Flake 'cause I Know you're still on the soft headcount you're still at fifty one with mansion with match if for some reason Manchin pulls out or Murkowski or it doesn't appear the columns\nWill if Collins had concerns she would've issue that concern about the report saying I'm not sure we got everything at the very least she would've question something praising the report\nTo me you can count on that vote\nSo right now you're looking at I mean I think at the very least fifty with vice president being the cyber at fifty one ah the word from and and there was another story in the in the wall Street Journal that they you know the GOP right now\nAs a as really upbeat about the confirmation process a you know they vets um if you look at it that the the talk right now is that they're confident\n\nOr so you get through\nA cloture which will happen sometime during the day on friday as you mentioned Gary process will start mid morning um but then the actual vote may not happen until later in the afternoon when by the time I get through the procedure one with the actual voting place and then there were the third and they already our lives the clock starts starts at that point yet\nUp and they can take up to thirty hours it may not take thirty hours they could end the debate before thirty hours but\nAssuming they'll use the entire thirty hours\nAnd they might ah especially on a Saturday the media might give them the the news media on cable news might give them you know all the time of the world\nAre so do you look at the the so called hopeful for twenty twenty you're um usual suspects I'm a warrant and all of them looking to get camera time\nOr the debate might you know go on the ...\nJust assume that it will they'll that's that's why you've got the rule assume that it will so that puts it late into Saturday Night as you mentioned earlier Gary depending on where they landed on the the clock lands on the culture wrote maybe you and to early Sunday Morning\nBut that gives you know there's the I guess the wiggle room or the enough room for senator Danes to get\nYou know home from the wedding I guess or or back to work for the wedding\nAnd ah as daughter's wedding and we wish your daughter and her soon to be husband all the best uh but they'll he'll get back he's saying he'll get back in time for the vote so that tells us it's probably going to be a late Saturday Night votes\n[noise] you know I I I think about all the and you know I'm sitting here just contemplating and thinking of all the all the protests\nThe violence to civil disobedience when certain things you know that when Trump was elected to you know the the women's march show all all of these things that go on\nAnd if you look over the last eight years and the number of protest remember Occupy Wall street ... you\nKnow all all that that that uh that went on all the the\nThe be occupying a city properties and everything else that went on what you're seeing now and you have a party that constantly does that\nYou have another party that really doesn't do that at All right you see now the getting into the faces of people which can be quite intimidating but here's the question\nIs it effective for them has it been effective in and you go all the way back like I said we go let's go back to the Obama administration I mean you can look at you can look at the uh you can look at the uh the Tea Party with the Tea Party was completely and totally non non violent and not know know Ryan snow cared as nothing like that\nIn ... so you look at it and you get into the Occupy Wall Street right right where you're actually trespassing\nAnd you know taking over and wanting to camp out and you know there were riots in certain cities that that happened when the police tried to push them off\nBut it this is almost the exclusive domain ... the left and therefore\nThe Democrats sure yeah and you think about the run that they have had since all of this you know really I'll I'll look at Occupy Wall street\nAs just the beginning of of this portion of it\nHas it been effective for them when it comes to the vote do people actually respond to it or do they believe that the intimidation tactics\nWill actually work and change for example they're not you know you you you could see if they might be a you know threatening a just a a you know the the senators that are on you know a lot of you know I'm On the edge right now right okay on the margins\nBut they're not they're going after everybody here whether it's crass he doesn't care what their McConnell what do they really think that that's affected\nOr is it the fact that when you are just so full of range because that's what it is it's just insane range that they're filled with right just anger and and and range\nIs it just ain't desperation tactic or do they actually believe that it has affected by just I I really wonder and [laughter]\nAnd I was thinking to myself here before I started talking about this I'd love to sit down and talk with them all that wouldn't be possible [laughter]\nSo I'm never going to find out because I'm never going to be able to sit down and say you don't tell us what's your strategy is\nThat right I I I I think after the ... like a thing I think they feel empowered to some extent they feel that it is effective\nTo some extent but I think it's probably a ... a lot of I was going to say a little of both I think it's a lot of both actually that they believe after confronting mansion and after ...\nYou know the behavior in restaurants and everything else and shaming people out of restaurants I mean think about that Gary\nThat youre\nNot protesters in a restaurant you work there it's your job and he refused in one case to do it because Sarah Huckabee Sanders\nIs eating the food you're going to prepare and serve can you imagine that can you imagine being in that mentality you\nKnow\nIf I worked in a restaurant I don't care what I was doing in that restaurant\nAnd bar rock Obama and his family came in\nThe last thing that I Would do is refused to do my job\n\nI mean not doing my job is not going to change his politics or change anything that I disagreed with that he did\nAnd that's the mentality but that's where they that's where they live and we go back to the one restaurant\nWhere you had a man having to be African American wearing a make America great again hat\nAnd the staff was shaming him at a stable to the point that\nHis companion I don't know if it was his girlfriend or his wife was in tears\nAnd they kept it up they kept it up they kept it up I Can't imagine I cannot imagine\nI wouldn't be able to face my friends and family if I did something so despicable just shameful just shameful if you want to talk about getting a ticket and going out on the steps of ... as long as you're not\nTrespassing are breaking the law I encourage that I don't care what you believe I don't care what you're promoting are protesting for or against and I remember it\nWas about you know we've talked about it before is probably about seven years ago when um and and you know the person that I'm Talking about\nAnd it was really you know somebody who I considered it a casual friend ... you know ... do the more professionally and and uh they were in a conversation and it was a ... a black man who was a huge fan of my show now I sort of knew her politics were more of\nThe liberal bent but she went absolutely insane we know we haven't talked since that point and she completely rejected me as a friend\nBecause in a conversation a black man said he loved our show\nRight think about that and that was really my first taste of that type of insanity\nThat person you refer to as you described it before ...\nFrom zero to you know basically ... just just a small talk we do have good to see a\nThanks

I enjoy when things get insane ... who was at a campaign Griffin yeah right they basically\nAs you know everybody every Republican [laughter] Britain human I'm paraphrasing them you're like oh that's you know that's a intelligent argument [laughter] exactly [laughter]\nI'm Amazed the number of years\nOf celebrity part of it the celebrity part of it is you've gone to jump into the fray and and battle to be angrier than the ... to be the angry is\nPerson in the room they used to want to be the smartest person in the room now they just want to be the angry is person in the ... oh\nSpeaking of the first person in the world just I don't I don't know there's just a few of the stories we're going to get your calls and comments on this because a lot of people want to comment on the the Brett Kavanaugh on the cloture vote tomorrow in ... be a vote on Saturday or\nYou know what the vote count might possibly be but you when you just brought up the smartest person in the world you see we're ... or work excuse me Robert Francis or works and we don't necessarily want Obama's\nEndorsement I'm thinking you didn't mean to\nMe well there's a couple of things there because you know the ... campaign\nAs he broaden set out beyond the El Paso district where he serves look he's he's the king of El Paso no doubt politically um the ball outside of the the cartels that are operating in with all due respect to the cartels\n[laughter] um the the whole idea though is that you got to broaden it beyond the El Paso district right\nI mean he can win the El Paso district as long as he wants to run for that house seat um and I have friends there that say oh man he's got his hands and everything you know so um yeah ah\nThat's different though when you brought it out to the rest of Texas now certainly he's done better than um\nA lot of the people who jumped into different races or the former ah Dallas County sheriff Lupe Lupe Valdez uh and uh you know her running against ah the the current Governor Greg Abbott\nUm that's you know again he's he's very well then the lead but when when you broaden it out to the state right level you gotta go wild you've got to realize that you you have to pretend you're in the middle\nOr then and that's bad or he's trying to do is try and do you try to picture himself and he's not in the middle find anything no but he he realizes that he has to lie even to get ... he can't be truthful even with Democrats in taxes\nAnd hope to get elected and yet the realization I mean the Democrats used to be that way all the time they used to we need to move to the middle we need to move to the middle we got to move to the middle we've got to move to the middle and and then over the last ten years or so no they were\nReal basically this is who we are I guess my point is that when you think about\n\nTen years ago right now when you think of ten years ago mhm when Obama\nWas running for president ... wasn't it right about now right around this wasn't in October remember he held I would've been you know would have been the convention where\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBrett Kavanaugh side by side with Bill Cosby ... and they brought on the representative from the ACLU attempted to defend\nThat great abide by the way great learning moment nobody can\nEver defend the American civil liberties union anymore no and even call

be a civil rights movement that's what they needed they needed the ACLU the liberals actually need the AC\nThe or the any given issue today to be just like the civil rights movement whether it's a

Senate and what I'm saying is you know the president doesn't given us all the information on all the majority in the Senate which calls the shots mhm believe that the executive branch\nHas fulfilled all of their request ... they have stated that publicly that's why there's going to be a vote there is no fight\nAnd there is nothing that the executive branch is doing to hinder what the legislative branch is doing everything going on and the legislative branch which is the Senate is being controlled by the majority in the Senate which is how the constitution has\nHated it so I mean there's just so sick of it and does not set the boat or the timeline of the vote now he does not a set the uh the\nThe ... the Senate majority leader schedule for when when McConnell on Wednesday or gave notice for cloture that the president whereas it have anything to do with\nThe federal just going to do an injunction and they go yeah right and and then and then they go ahead with the boats white she going to take McConnell and put him in and put him in contempt of court somebody an arrest McConnell yeah because uh\nA ... from what I understand the story Merkley had had gone to the courts before this and what are you trying to do is get this that's why they schedule to hearing on Wednesday buddy that was I think a move\nWhere they filed either last week or early earlier this week and then when it looked inevitable and it did of course it was inevitable on dot as a Wednesday afternoon a that there was going to be a vote a this weekend\nThat's when Merkley said well no no no no no because we haven't had you know our our day in court with the Trump Administration\nThe Trump Administration the executive branch does not set when the Senate is going to vote\nThis is really weak I mean is this is the Hail Mary I mean this is\n... belt but here's the thing\nYou're not going to want to miss work tomorrow [laughter]\nAnd I thought well let me put it this way it's friday you might want to miss a little sleepy during the day or at least when you get up\nTurn every device that you own on and make sure it's connected because it's only going to ramp up between now and the final vote on Saturday or early Sunday when whenever it happens\nThis is ... because you're right a couple of things here again the legislative branch doesn't have the power to stop\nI I'm Sorry the judicial branch doesn't have the power to stop the legislative branch process right they don't get to say\nYou know what their schedule is now if they go through and again enact a law signed a law a bill into a a ... the president signs it into law\nThey can come in and then challenged the effect of the process but then outside of that as you point out Gary it's two separate branches that are working here you are a suit your lawsuit should be against the Senate it's not it's against\nThe executive branch who has no say so over the timeline of\nThe vote on the Senate ... but he ... he wouldn't have there he knows there's no chance that he could go to the court and say let's stop the process because I disagree with the majority right\nThat that's not going to go anywhere so what he's trying to make is that there's a debate going on between the executive branch and the Senate and because any executive branch has interfering with the Senate where you can't make that point because the Senate which is the leadership of the Senate which is the\nRepublicans have said we've got everything we want from the ... branch and the FBI we're moving forward and he's trying to say that the executive branch\nIs holding things up and not giving them the information well you don't get to make that call it's a minority member you don't get to go to the courts to try to override the majority in the Senate\nI you know this is like this is like if it's like I decided to get\nIn the ring with a an event or Holyfield bright\nAnd realize quickly that I'm greatly overpowered so I called and Mike Tyson to do my fight for me I mean this is the uh this this is like because it's basically you have a Democrat\nWho's not getting his way and his only claim is that they're not getting documents the Senate's not getting the documents\nThe Judiciary Committee chairman is the one who rules that part of it in any vetting process and you know that\nThis is the process but since you are not getting your way you're\nTrying to call mommy and daddy and to stop amino Trump or the amino Republicans because you disagree with it it's not going to change your vote it's going to delay the process but it it won't even do that now as\nWell because it's it's it's not going to happen here but but I ... and I first saw it I had was anybody who understands the separation of powers\nOh wait a minute that's the very
