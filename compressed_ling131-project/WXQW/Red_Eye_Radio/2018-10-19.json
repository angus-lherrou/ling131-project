D y\nThat's correct that's right\nAnd so the decision who decided because they knew it bring America and what a gamble they talk\nWell the one that if you want to if one of single name ooh decided to actually two names it was a foreign ending Morgan looting or if they were actually running up ... to ... they were running the country right era and the war there were in charge\nAnd um they they both they they come to the understanding and they were correct\nThat Germany was not going to win the war on the ground that she was being done in terms of material and you're right about people who are starving the winner of Seventeen Eighteen is known as a turning point or cause that's about all at the beach there was just nothing deep German Army was actually sending out pretty good\nAh groups to

both we're we're building them faster bigger and better and have a bunch of them here pretty soon we'll we can sing kill a hundred and sixty thousand dollars a month or something like\n... and the logical that is that the British we'll start with us is that what they were thinking\nOh yeah oh yeah they do think it's actually um when no when we entered the war and the admiral sim showed up in London so he went to see um the the ... the British navy was attorney the British told him that\nOf the the faded and if they didn't find a way to contain the ... war and they were convinced so they were on their on the ropes right there with the Germans and it was just about ... they had to find\nWay to sort of a decision then was to star Britain and both sides would start wouldn't lift the

contingent of soldiers there until Nineteen Eighteen to takes a lot of showing us write the Germans believe they can sink the transport ships\nThat's right they they thought they were their claim was a navy guaranteed I'm not an American troops will make it\nTo them but that's not a test that nonsense did ... recognize that it was nonsense by the by the winter of seven Eighteen it was clear that the Americans were gathering in great numbers\nNineteen Seventy and it made sense to them to the border they were when they converted ... the ... do you start to you one point five so they they those

clues about the location of Thirteen year old Jamie clause was a suspect in the death for parents\nBut I certainly become more cynical about what is going on\nAnd this one seems clear to me I think they're timing it so that their arrival at our border it's time to hurt President Trump and Republicans in the upcoming elections whoever's paying for it\nUh doesn't matter I think that's what they're up to ... tank well they don't ask me of course to consult with them but I think the Democrats are once again misreading things as they didn't earrings with the judge Canada where they clearly overplay their hand\nAnd showed you know the even the independent voters you remember most people don't follow the news like the those who are listening to talk to you guys are active in involved and you know what's going on most average people don't even know what's going on [noise]\nUh but they showed their mission to ruin a judge Kavanaugh's reputation and his life and I think most people could see that whether or not her evidence shed away when it's whether her testimony was credible or not even if they felt sorry for her I think they thought\nThe Democrats were going overboard and I think that's going to hurt them in the election so I think most Americans saw through their circuits\nAnd now they want the American people will see crying children right so is the children and distraught mothers at the border with a willing press reporting how heartless\nOr to allow such suffering to take place they just you ever notice it's always the children's ... rather 'cause people here feel sorry for children doesn't matter if they're manipulated by the way\nYou know it's as someone's kid at ten or eight or whatever that when they a spouse certain points of view you know they've been indoctrinated by the parents even if they are precocious as some of the things that come out with you know the parents are just using their own kids by the way not to like the Democrats use you know a Ford there\nAnd they're all the usual spin I oh this line drives me crazy that this is not who we are as people are not who we are as Americans as if we are not allowed to defend our sovereignty and our values that we are in effect basically what they're saying we're stupid people\nThat would let all kinds of people come through our border on their word alone now I Want asylum whatever you don't know if there are terrorists or or you don't know if they have contagious diseases which is happening more and more people have not been vetted in any way that that we're not those kinds of people either that can we be smart enough to\nHave some you know the rules and procedures about how people come into this country so when they say it just drives me crazy oh this is not who we are as people Hillary set everybody said you know it just seems like that on the left though we're not we're so compassion and we take everybody you know you guys just full of it you want them here for the votes\nAnd you didn't care about is like for whatever her name is because of the final analysis you leak that when she didn't want the stuffed leek\nAnd Dianne Feinstein the rest of your time this so do maximum damage you didn't really care about her\nBy is a bigger topic for tonight just like I Believe the Democrats don't really care about minorities that just using them they know they take their votes for granted and whether they help them or not map as it's irrelevant they are using them for them to get power [noise]\nSo I Want you to comment to continue to comment on any of those stories that I reviewed tonight at eight six six Ninety red eye and and let me know what you're thinking and I go with where you want to go there is a hot topic uh after our topic I'll go to that pretty quickly\nEight six six nine o seven thirty three thirty nine is is the same number a digital they bought colors also mentioned the reaction of some of their friends this kind of always comes out a little bit some of their friends and family members to or if their political beliefs are on the conservative\nOr you know you call them on the right I guess\nAnd a friend of mine Scott who used to live in California now lives in Colorado I'll leave that his last name because I didn't get permission to use his last name\nSo this is what he posted on Facebook yesterday he was ... just because of his political beliefs\nAnd he thought I thought he wrote a thoughtful commentary which I Am going to just read from is pretty quick a and from what I remember by the way he's a moderate Republican not even a conservative like me here's this quote we continue to learn life set lessons in many ways today I had a friend who I've known since high school an friend me\nShe was always known me as a nice person in fact I helped her out in the school and gave her job to provide her additional Lincoln\nNothing has changed as far as who I Am but today she and friends and me not because I was nasty to her or because I was mean to anyone she knew about the cause I posted a political post that she disagreed with\nKeep in mind that she posts political commentary that I disagree with and some I find very offensive\nShe asked me to never let her stuff and yet she comments on mine but sadly there's a way of our politics we can do people for years even all of our lives yet they have no tolerance for a different political view than their own\nIt's so angers them that you have a different opinion that then there's that they will not talk to any more personally I find that beyond said today that I've only unfriendly one person mainly because they're noxious and intellectually dishonest\nHas most no I guess people know and I will debate anyone on any issue and I changed my mind than issues and ... had others change their mind yeah I appreciate that too when colors have done that in the past\nAnd you'll see me say sometimes yeah that's a good point I didn't consider that but today it just seems that we're starting to forget the whole of a person is not just measure by their political views and the ... if you had a lifetime of friendship that it should be more important than a different view on one area\nHe should have said in one area of your life\nI think I'm more saddened by the fact that my experience today is more symptomatic of what our society's becoming than about losing your Facebook friends if we can find a way to be more civil to each other and then we're in for a bumpy road ahead I actually think he's under doing it\nUh and by the way the same thing happened to me a couple of years ago so I used to do in a show in Los Angeles with two Democrats two Republicans discussing the issues in the news whatever came up that we can\nThe audience and the guests loved it some of the gifts I the degree to each other and a future show I said how do you know ... oh we became good friends because of your show mark up and I I was really that touched me a despite their differing views they become friends socially and otherwise and kept in touch\nI'd love to reprise that show at some point if I was given the opportunity because of the audience loved it I loved it it it was just a lot of fun we didn't have very professional way you know but one of the guests moved to Tennessee and posted on Facebook one of the other guest the more you see what he did he posted in on Facebook after Trump won that he was defending anyone\nWho is evil enough to vote for President Trump\nYour host included obviously well he wouldn't friend me no he did in all of his appearances on my show he was one of the milder\nVery friendly and plus you guess on the other side\nAnd he ... he shares vice with me when I was dumb enough to run for office in California which\nYou can imagine for a Republican is a waste of time so I was pretty surprised when he posted his letter saying goodbye to all of us now evil human beings I'm not sure he said the word evil but that's what he was implying\nForget his past interactions with me or others he thought were his friends they thought he was there for his friend so I Want to know from you what has been your experience when people find out your views if you're a Republican or conservative or maybe you keep your politics quiet as I Do with my teaching job\nOne of the reasons I'm getting lower now I'm probably still teaching is the left just about never listens to the other side\nSo they have no idea that I'm a talk show host if they knew that might be the end of me but here uh several anecdotes you might appreciate on election day when President Trump was running it was the first day of new class in my school so I was text to go out to see the election results\nAnd I remember I tears roll down my eyes when he a Trump won Pennsylvania which was always a Republican fool's gold always stay we might wind but when it counted like with Romney we always came up short so when he won Pennsylvania real is he was like going to be president\nIt was unbelievable even though I predict that morning I predict on Facebook that I thought he was going to win so what did some students do and these are adults students they went to the system principle to complain that I was texting a lot\nSo she called the inter office at the end of the night and she said you know what mark I defend the due to the students because all of us were so upset with the results that it was not surprising that a slut tax thing going on [noise] it didn't even cross or mine for second that I could be on the other side\nAnd another time there was a teacher's meeting and the ... teacher trainer who's running the meeting said you know we have some time why don't we go around the room tall you teachers and you could tell us something that would be interesting that we don't know about you\nDo you think for a second I Would tell them about my other career life I Would have been the end of me and a final anecdote was when Justice Scalia die than another teacher said mark let's play knock knock joke so I've played along and his answer to who was there was just a Justice Scalia just died and he said that was funny enough\nI'd probably didn't hide my look of dismay 'cause he shocked me because he immediately walked away\nHaving no idea that I adore just ... and he was my favorite judge so now you know why I'm Still teaching in the public school system\nIt's kind of like the McCarthy Era to reverse but I have to keep quiet about my political views I Want to know what you do if you have to keep a quiet at your job what happens if you discuss politics with their family or friends are on the opposite side you better not do that a Thanksgiving that's the end of that dinner and its\nThe Democratic ... left us I Want to hear from you too but I strongly suspect that you are not disowned by conservatives among your family or friends if you even have such people you're friendly with I just don't think we do that on our side because we think your views are misguided and you think we are evil\nAlso looking for it's for crowded fifty years and only a forensic\nAttention all authors page publishing is looking for authors have you

and say do you do I have to like the same kind of music you listen to what do I have to love the same kind of literature you know a little different should somebody is is a good thing and I have to hide the parrot your thoughts and political views exactly is that the deal is\nAnd I tried to cut it with a smile but that you get hostility right back it is when did we become those people I just do what it said\nIt ... you you know the other night you said this is your first night you're you've been listening to the other night I was asking about who's like to see get the nomination the Democrats' side and if you were a Democrat who to like seeing the Republican side and that evolved into who would you like to have coffee with could you pick someone on the other side\nSo you you kind of give them the idea that we we can evolve this thing in would you mentioned my monologue Mary Madeline and er what's his name I just lost at a carnival\nYeah James Carville they're married and married scream Lee opposite I worked in political campaigns for a total opposite candidates so here's how this may evolve\nCould you marry mark someone who had really diametrically opposed refused to you\n[laughter] why not I mean if you're compatible in every other way and do you why oh why just one little facet of our lives defined everything you know of course I could have played by like you're\nYou're consistent but I'm going to play devil's advocate okay\nBecause it doesn't politics get into values somewhat about what people care about rights as an example I'll get in trouble with this I think a lotta times single women who vote Democrat or looking for the government to take care of them are and so you start to get into your values system I think\nSo now I'm going to play on the other side maybe not marriage because it may affect lots of things I'll give you another one maybe this is very I teach my students values or what should count not so much and I say it's my pin you don't have to agree with me nuts and you know look through obviously important at the beginning but that fades over time\nIt's it's the person's values that you should care but here's one what if you are religious as an example because of that\nBecause you're conservative and you believe in God and the other side doesn't so if you have kids some day you're obviously going to fight about that you want them to go to church or whatever she wants no part of that so I hear I'm almost contradictory myself I Do understand if it's going to be something really permanent\nThirty seconds so let's

Democrats are good and if you care about the common man you'll you'll vote Democrat and then it takes I was a Democrat who originally I teased and say it was a birthright in Brooklyn New York you had no choice\nBut when you realize why as you get older and you grow you see that that's not the case that uh they actually the Republican solutions are far better in in the long run then the emotional

think it's really come down to this country is being torn apart it seems like to me um by their politics it seems that people are kind of unable to sit down and just you know discuss their politics and work towards\nYou know a a better ... America you know together and I will have to say I'm not trying to figure out but the Republicans in the right wing or almost just as bad about it is\nYeah I don't see that as a mother I was thinking I was listening to what you said and he said snowflake and I'm thinking snowflake is not calling someone a racist or a big it will you people and I it and you could be a snowflake can be on the Republican side just means\nYou know things offend you got upset easily you can't handle things I don't mind being called a snowflake it's not anything like being called a racist\nFor um a whole for anything else and stuff like that those things I even like snowflakes so even your comparison excess [laughter] see you're laughing you agree with that\nBut yeah I mean I understand um\nYou know that is a good point uh I guess I didn't think of it that way but you know also I think a lot of you know from what I see the problem stems from also a kind of not really being able to hold your candidate accountable\nAnd I think that's one thing that you know Republicans and the right we could do to further their message and I think I Would hope you'll out so much more to kind of get your ideas out there of course is just my opinion but a a caller earlier at you know commented on the second amendment and I'm very pro Second Amendment\nBut you know you have a right wing or is like you said that really already Second Amendment we you know if that's what you agree and you want to ban bump stocks and you want to raise you know the age of Twenty one then that's fine but that's not something you agree with me you know hold your candidates accountable to that I Would think\nIt's funny you say that because it's funny I have a different view I think that Republicans do turn on their own much more than Democrats to ... uh remember at the health care vote it was all Democrats not one Republican\nOr Bill Clinton impeachment the none of the Democrats would sign on Kavanaugh you had one Democrat who the Trump won by forty points in West Virginia and so you can understand why he may have voted for his nomination\nIs the Democrats the less really stick together whereas we I don't know you've never heard me before but George W.

look back now and I absolutely love that you know and um\nBut we're really tight all the way through and and um you know similar I think it was my senior year my parents got divorced and so we've got a little you know a state of my dad and mom and and we got a little separation but we never let the distance [noise] uh I'm In between us we stayed in contact\nAnd uh she became a flight attendant for a law for jihad flight attendant\nExcuse me and she would let me use our passive and we would fly here and um and then you know slowly as family comes and you know you can maybe don't talk as much but we always talk and um\nAnd we always had the same views for the longest time you know maybe a couple of little differences here and there but um she started traveling a lot to Europe and this and that and come back\nAnd started talking about how you know America does the U.S does this wrong or the u._s. should be more like this country and this and that and so you know and it's just kind\nOf like OK okay whatever [noise] well um we never really talked about politics until this past election and um and still during the primaries um you know I hadn't made my choice that I think like most people you know that and made their choices and I was between crews ...\nAnd as she was more of a Bernie Sanders\nShe knows all about Bernie Sanders and um but she was happy with Hillary and so as it got\nOh sorry closer when I actually started leaning orders Trump we we started getting serious serious debates you know and then I'm In June and my son my youngest son was graduating as she was supposed to come out to the graduation and um\nMy son and her just had a tremendous tremendous uh a relationship and um\nTwo weeks prior to the ah to the graduation we had a conversation on a song or like a you know what when you get here when I got to talk about politics and this is about politics is about my son graduation and um and during the week before the graduation she called\nAnd she said because I'm a Trump supporter she can't come to my house and we have not spoken since that day and I I've ... or a couple of ...\nAnd a couple of times you know trying to be ... a relationship with my nephew doing nothing nothing [noise]\nI feel so sorry if you I I you know it just breaks my heart and and you have to wonder what what about your son I mean she didn't seem to care about that either the the the fact that you just pour Trump was enough to break a bowl the relationship between a brother or sister in ... so much over those years\nIt is incredible what's going on out there and I just uh you know ... cliche but it is hard to even hear the story\nThough don't give up maybe someday she'll come around the she obviously got I'm fed yeah who generally and socialism in Europe and what's going on there if you ask most Europeans I don't think many of them be happy with what's going on I don't know what you saw a but uh it's it's depressing hang in there my friend okay it'll it'll come around some time\nJust hang in there um I was just thinking of a you know people are funny that way I worked at a at a station ... in Los Angeles as I said I don't want to say too much about it except one of the whole was had a\n... have there's a gal on whose father was a famous I don't want to see what he did but it was it was pretty famous at us in this day\nAnd they didn't talk for a Twenty years or something and then um the one day of the host said to me you know mark ah her father died\nAnd she didn't even know it and I had to tell her the news and she said I'm a while I never got a chance to say goodbye so they hadn't talked to her I think it was at least Twenty years and you think that finally when he passed on but it was too late to say goodbye to him\nBecause she disowned him all those years for personal reasons so one has to think that the eventually hope people come around before something serious happens and I always tell my students you can never tell someone you love enough that you love them because life is very short\nBut when you hear the family story as a brother and sister daughter whatever that because of politics they disown their parent\nOr their brother who they know their whole life assuming there's nothing terrible going on in the relationship just over politics and you see that almost always on the on the left hand side\nWere discouraging but are brought

trick word that a a mind programming like they did the old shows they had back in the seventies whatever you know they so they call somebody on the phone and say a special worded they will go kill somebody that I live ... anything like that but I'm saying is when\nAbout six seven years ago my daughter wanted me to do with her to the hunting through center which is a big arena and said Ohio\nAnd it was about to interview for a job now but new dance club that was opening up in ...\nAnd so I took her and they'll\nPretty much still two thirds theory or filled up with families kids and parents editor for was a panel of\nUm people probably six people they each have their little steel to talk about this new dance club that was coming into the going all around the country opening up these clubs and the thing that struck by interests first of all was there the kids didn't get paid by the hour\nThey got paid by how many other kids they brought in now there was five hundred families are there's a ring up there is no way a little club is going to hire all these people\nBut what they were doing was trying to bring the kids in and as I listen to this bill I said told on their cells by saying\nTo the music playing and food and then throughout the night there'll be certain times of the musical stopped but we'll have announcements and it was or political announcements\nSo these people in your family especially you know what you're thinking about Twenty years old twenty two year olds watch these people and people and and people that are out there in the streets blocking streets these kids have been a doctor it almost like it's cold\nAnd you know if there was in ... who's got the money to rent the Huntington Center for this club now I tried to get in there to find out more about it\nI told my play drums which I Do and uh I'd like to get in and sometimes the kids like the answer to the extra beat suicide twelve years ago they had that and so I could get inside the walls to find out exactly what was happening but I never heard back problem\nBut this these people that your family members don't\nEven go you see that have come out in the heart do hate back it's not their fault I mean if you had a family member that was ... or ... and they're not only programs that's basically what it is I mean if I like blue and you like read we can discuss it and there's not a problem but whenever it gets into the area of\nControlling the relation of the population then you see the anger come out that's because I I really believe there are programs by son is thirty one right now\nBut she was a Jew in junior high back was a Gore and Bush was battling down in Florida he said dad who you're voting for and back then I just you know I didn't care about politics that's almost eight votes or nobody 'cause they're all crooks\nHe was all we had a mock election at school and Gore won by a landslide them thinking wow I don't know a whole lot but pretty sure that guy's really it\nSo I started listening AM radio and I don't know what a Democrat is or conservative or a Democrat or anything I mean I don't know anything about anything\nSo I'm you have an open mind\nAnd it didn't take me long to figure out that I was a conservative and even back then the hatred was prominent in the discussion on the talk shows that were more of a a liberal\nI'm democratic side and what I what I've just seen as just as I feel sorry my heart goes out to everybody you know I was driving a truck with my brother\nYears ago and started talking politics and he you know I bring up a point of fact\nAnd he didn't have a ... he got mad started calling me a warmonger like is that how you guys just name calling was basically that's all they've got they have little points\nThat makes sense you know how can you not understand it's better to have people working to have their town doing better that low unemployment I mean all these things are common sense but\nThey just you can't get through two thirds of mental problem there there's a program in Colorado I Believe my heart\nSo I can say that I wanted to let you know\nWell he did a good job Charlie at I think it's more emotionally although you ... I never thought of that so the Democratic party as a cult cult of a motor because that's what they do uh most of the people there I'm not saying that if Brian I'm not saying that a nice a lot of them they ... about that\nAnd there's many you know nice Republicans I assume it's Democrats and vice versa\nBut the fact is that a lot of it's based on emotion like you said he always a liar oh he's a racist\nWay what about the economy what about foreign policy what about the countries in really good shape in terms of things people care about they often vote their pocketbooks no he's he's just how
