I Know that's been comment like if he were brawn wind just you know had his own show on Fox News or something\nThat would be just a serious comment you know you can't look stupid 'cause you can't I don't know how we do that so what you need to do you stock up on you know dry rice and and dried beans and hoping that you're going to need because the stupid apocalypse is on its way\nIt's it's not far off not far off we don't know if if we have a significant number of people\nForty eight percent who aren't sure where chocolate milk comes from we're not going to need a purge\nNo no no no no you just sort of no see that's the thing that sort of just running around in circles just sort of fade away because like they can and can't survive\nIt reminds me of the the old magnetic football thing game you just turn it on that just all go in circles [laughter] that's ... I had\nNo idea that when I got frustrated that a game has a kid\nCome on cans you guys running just wandering around in circles little felt football the one guy was old I\nRemember they had the little kicker and you tried to kiss at it too much like never in word it never got past the center\nIs [laughter] [laughter] and that over and the kicker kicks up all the way to their own ... already had a game and that and that's why we all instead of plane of\nThe you know the electorate football we all took the penny and remember you put the penny underneath the finger and they took your\nOn your finger on your flipped it up in the air and the other one held the gold price right and you're like this is more satisfying electorate football right exactly I've no idea how we got to electric football from turning away with ... with ward and one woman ... dollars and twenty dollars all of the stupid people are running around like the little electric football players who says\nWhat they look they're just running around in circles so getting back originally and by the way this is going to be most of the show [laughter] us her hair in the first segment yeah by the way I question another question we have a lot a lot of questions from vacation is it a caravan or a mob\n[noise]\nI Will say this ... I think putting on our ...\nAnd we're going to be like we always do we put on our our substance at which is looking at the issues and basing it on the substance on her\nPolitical had put it on my political had I thought that what\nCame out of the the the campaign from the Republicans and Democrats I thought the best campaign slogan actually came from Trump that was jobs not mobs very a very easy to understand\nAnd very quickly on the caravan here 'cause we had a lot to talk about today Mm ah it's funny sometimes I just wonder how do people think and this comes from from the uh people that support Trump but that's just about profit it's about to get to Trump but I'm thinking to myself and you the same thought\nThink people was it was for him this works for him we're moving towards election day and the closer the caravan comes to the U.S border is going to help Republicans and help Trump\nBut I'll tell you that was gonna say it's a ... what is this is because that's all I heard this is a conspiracy sources behind it and and they're doing this in order to win the election well then try and spend more money to win the election and more caravans come in if they believe that that's an effective way to win an election because it's not\nIt's not it it the we set it and it was the time and everything going on in twenty sixteen but Trump owned immigration illegal immigration if you want if he if he is to get back on\nTrack to get funding\nFor the wall this will be part of it\nIs by about you and I were talking about if there is a conspiracy yeah it would be the Trump it\nBehind [laughter] he spends a billion dollars to make it happen\nBecause it's working for him right there is any conspiracy politically that would be called brilliant or affective in terms of a positive for one side of the other\nThey would be him behind the conspiracy because\nThis works for the president and Republicans if you've got five ... this is what we saw\nA few years ago a few years back or when you had an influx not quite like the caravan mob or whatever you want to call it um but but pretty much the same effect right\nThere are about to reach the border and you had people you had Democrats who had rank and file Democrats saying no no no no no no we're spending people on the spending money government money on people who aren't citizens and we're not spending enough and and the cities and in our town them on our kids\nAnd that's the way that went and that was before Trump was president\nAh if you think this is the conspiracy let them try it it does not work for the left coming up\nOn the show first see one over one thousand and twenty four we will we will get to because still I was you and I both on vacation very rainy vacation whether I was in New York or whether I was here didn't matter ...\nIt just it rained it was a complete ... wash out and in fact the most the the biggest thing that I accomplish was I got three room steam cleaned in my house\nAre brought up the steam cleaner and did a three rooms and how far more to go\nA so that was really what I did over ... you know vacation oh\nBy the way very quickly happy sixty seven wedding anniversary to my parents as sub Saturday we'll have to think what she said that yeah that anniversary\nA ... a but we'll we'll get to that coming up because I just when I saw that I went\nWhen I first saw that I said if she if she dumber what\nHow dumb ... ... you know for doing that and she came out yesterday and said that she did it because the world needs transparency and she was attempting to be transparent to buy a also coming up on the show Hillary is just like Mike Myers from Halloween she just won't go away or I should say Michael Meyers\nYeah Michael Meyers Michael Meyers is pretty funny ... and you know\nUh the uh the the jobs not mobs political slogan that came out while we were on vacation and the Democrats platform is what we thought it was going to be which is put a hacks on Kavanaugh\nTo those Democrats upset about ... or ... show these deaths were were you on ... right\n\nWhere were you on ... guys Z because the criticism of the administration luck none of us know everybody becomes an expert on these things go here's what happened you have no clue what happened and maybe somebody in the CIA knows what happened\nMaybe Trump knows what happens maybe somebody some of them in the house and and uh the house intelligence committee\nAnd and the Senate intelligence committee maybe they know none of us know what really happened over there but one thing we do know is the hypocrisy and the Democrats that in essence said\nWhen we found out that Hillary Clinton and the state department lied about Americans being killed in a terrorist attack\nAnd lie to the American people about it what did the press have to say this was her best day yes best week everyone Hillary right a peta says a cow's milk is a symbol of white supremacists ... car crashes rice in states with

mobiles new home for news and talk six sixty W execute out what\nWas your fingers theory McNamara and the rigor early on red eye radio than he is there currently and I'm hearing from our eight six six Ninety or read I weld him and a\nGood morning yeah so I'm the whole just we we had a comment on the Elizabeth Warren thing because we were on vacation or a vote last week but first off you've got cultural appropriation mhm right right sure I'll drill appropriations she's\nShe's a appropriating a culture ... the thing I like does want to even came up with the one sixty fourth while she could be one sixty fourth or could be won over five hundred and twenty or one over one thousand two hundred and twenty four\nAnd it was like yeah but the one or even if it's the one over sixty four and I don't even know whether this is true or not but somebody pointed other sibling all the average American is one point eight percent Native American so it doesn't even mean but the average American\nIs at that particular point so without question this is ... ...\nYou know cultural appropriation right the the ... the second thing was you are white privilege white privileges a white person claiming that they can be whatever they wish to be whatever minority they wish to be that they can be whatever minority they wish to be ... the other thing was the median jumping on this is it as if this legitimize\n[laughter] never beat or you're like well I Know that that would always thought that that ... that was at it\nBecause there were some here's what was I think great about the whole scenario I don't know that was planning on the part of the president I don't think it was it was just basic basically it was his rhetoric on his side right\nBut remember back in twenty sixteen we were saying okay when you're on a stage with Hillary and you're you're debating just throw the facts out or you know she lied about being ... she you know uh the she broke the law when it came to her email server all these things just throw the facts out and have them fact check they ended up\nChecking Elizabeth Warren's people basically doing that and then they come back as if it's legitimate right but then the ... member that kept changing it then all of a de ... was the Boston Globe way out of yeah we made about take care of and we made a mistake again\nIt just got to the point of being the most bizarre thing yeah right and I'm thinking to myself\nWow how bad are in seriously now you when I Need to reconsider ... we need to get out of this radio thing and get into political consulting\nDo yeah I Would totally do that and just say you idiot yeah when you're not going to pay\nIf you're going to waste your money waste your money on us\nYeah ... million dollar and we can be a lot better political consultants for whoever you're using right because remember this means that Elizabeth Warren got together with all of her aides and they said in a room and said okay here's our plan to counter Trump [laughter] yeah and everybody should have their heads\nGoing ha ha ha ha ha ha that's only\nGoing into was that if you think there was one guy or gal in the room that said\nNo no [laughter]\nBut they all have they all there was an overriding vote as sorry we all voted you were deciding to go with it because we are just a tactic become a good idea and and but this is not this is the mainstream remember when you have the Kavanaugh hearings the first cabinet hearings\nAnd it was the first day and remember that whole weekend the Democrats on the committee had decided whether or not they were going to do a full on walk out or yes do\nThe ... thing right and they thought that it struck destructive thing I you know with Grassley a basically would be the tactic they would use that's what they went with it\nAnd it was like\nThey had that meaning they met all weekend about it okay we can get up and walk out which ultimately they\nDid or during the a committee vote on on on Capitol you know that you had come out here it's going outside and doing the press thing and all that but it wasn't that wasn't so much the ... that was like the protests after the fact I still voted out and they still voted\nSo there wasn't offensively anything you know a show about\nBut they had the meeting that first week and they had that meaning we'll just get up and walk out\nThis is this ... this is a mainstream Democrats today this is not the protesters and we talked about how the\nProtesters ... lead the party\nThey lead the party they lead the call for the party\nBut how many groups how many different causes and different protests groups are there this is why they have no direction because they're in every direction and it's it's it's crazy and then\nThen I guess the the other point was so Elizabeth Warren\nThen does DNA matter quite right does this does is destroying transgender as if DNA\nMatters because remember the the the next thing as as as we all know uh we we've gone through the whole trans racial thing than the leftist starting to embrace ... remember you're talking about Elizabeth Warren who was [laughter] before this one of the leading liberal icons\nYou know socialist icons\nSocial justice warrior ... who broke a ton of social justice warriors ... and regulations [laughter]\nNumber one you were saying the DNA matters dizzy and does so DNA matters across the board than ... than it matters for ah your your sexuality it matters for your gender huh yeah writers for your race huh right is is that the is that the whole point or or does it

Senate mhm or the house I just I just don't know ... uh I don't think when you look back at Ninety four\nAnd Ninety four nobody really got a good read it that nobody saw that wave coming in the house nobody saw it coming right and and so I don't know about the house is it a possibility that Republicans could hold onto it yeah Mm uh I don't know how in the mid term like this\nYou can determine or\nA extrapolate what\nThe turnout\nGoing to be all I can tell you is I understand that in a in a midterm election\nThe party not empower normally gain seats and the excitement level is normally with that\nNot saying that there isn't doesn't excite voted voted Simon level and the Democrats\nI just see an unprecedented in a mid term at least in recent times where there has been so much motivation from the party in power which is the Republicans\nNot to lose that I saw the interview that was that was done with a a a bait or work Robert Francis over the weekend so do you you truly are a rock star and I looked at you and I said I heard that over the weekend and I thought well no and you and I hate that term to begin with for a politician or what does it mean we we don't like to practice and political I dollar tree but since\nThat has been made I looked at you and I said look at look at what Trump is doing\nSome still out there filling huge arenas two years later and he's doing stuff now bomb it into the same thing I don't think Obama could have done that two years later ... well it and now it's now at the same excitement well\nBecause ... and we warned in fact if you look at what happened in two thousand eight\nA than your for you that was there after that ah the inauguration and two thousand nine and then you saw what\nThe Tea Party the birth of the the modern day Tea Party or or the game I guess in terms of the the momentum of that Tea Party and ... and early about two thousand nine and ... and it kind of carried over\nBut ultimately the rock star thing was over and we warned between election day two thousand aids and an operation day two thousand nine for Obama we said okay for people that wanted the rock star keep in mind he's going to have to do things that are presidential\nAnd those things are not going to work for you by the way that\nWas ... so ten years ago because his ... leave\nOff the charts now ah to the fact that you know to the point that in fact a Beethoven does not need to the former presidents of campaigning in Texas [laughter] um but but\nThat didn't carry over the ... the Trump momentum is built on a number of things and real things it's not rock stardom\nBut if you want to talk about a political rock star and that would be somebody in my opinion that that that performs get things done on his agenda\nNot not that Obama didn't get things done on his agenda they got Obama carried through you know they had to lie about it but they got it through a\nThis president got affect them things done on the economy\nThis president got in and created more jobs is president got in and work with Republicans to bring taxes down\nAnd I don't think we've had this conversation we don't think he could have that anyone else could have done that Republicans are alone could have gotten a down on the corporate rate to Twenty one percent\nBut you look at those accomplishments that's where the following that's where the the it's that's where it's built and then as you mentioned the Kavanaugh saying something new to him what to do it woke up conservatives it woke up\nThe\nMade these some of the rhinos who had a band in too many conservative principles and had them read look I guess we are examined the threat to democracy the constitution and everything our entire system and process\nIn place during that Kavanaugh debacle that whole thing so that threat became real this is not some kind of rock stardom\nOh we think looks great or we think he's cool or we like the way he tweets\nIt's based on real things there's a big difference\nBetween skateboarding through water burger parking lot\nAnd getting the corporate tax rate down to Twenty one\nPercent while you know you and I were talking about this said that if there is a\nIs there and we had mentioned you know Beto O'Rourke here in uh in in Texas that that is viewed as the rock star mhm\nWell uh Bud Kennedy of the star telegram waited out the other day and I just read the article that he wrote based on the tweet there is a place called the originally theater molds like three to five hundred people that's it couldn't fill it couldn't fill\nYep\nThat's what it was three quarters according to Bud Kennedy who's three ... three three quarters full and did an article as beta burnout already here so when you talk about it it never exist ride or the other I ever really right did did it ever really exist or was it hype just what was it was it hype and the rank and file or high death in the media right right but it\nIs you know is it is the point so if you look at the excitement factor\nOr and again I don't look in crowds just going to visit a candidate a you know you see a candidate as the the be all end all as as to whether people will go out and vote or not all I Know is this that on the issues right now on the economy it's a plus for the Republicans\nOn on\nExposing what the Democrats really really want\nAnd and what they really believe when it comes to this country that do they even believe in the constitution do they believe in free speech that they believe in Second Amendment do they believe in due process under the law and we're finding out no they don't actually don't believe in the tenets of this country right right and those are pretty simple things to understand\nMaybe the separation of powers you don't understand maybe exactly what the role of the Supreme Court you don't understand but you do understand due process\nYeah and you do understand the second amendment\nAnd most people do understand free speech and maybe not everything that's in the first amendment\nBut they do understand the free speech everything that the Democrats now do not believe in and our voice rang again that they don't believe in in those particular things and then you have a caravan of illegal immigrants\nThat are promoting it and the media is giving them as much publicity as possible but going to show off Trump's they're coming to the border to crash the border as the mid term elections are just Fifteen days away and it would take them I Will read one thing that to go what is it the eight hundred miles right I've or if you would take them five hundred and forty seven hours\nWhich means okay so should they should be closing in on the border come election day ... probably not something the Democrats want to be promoting as much as are promoting it right or the media is promoting as much as they are going to promote it because until I think Kavanaugh\nIllegal immigration was still the number one issue of concern for Americans and as you said if there's a conspiracy out there in our pre show meeting from it in order to get them build the wall right Trump is funded this whole thing because the fact that so I mean a lot of conspiracy theory that didn't because boom\nIt worked for him if there's if there's anything that that could get get it back on track in terms of the funding for for the wall but he wants\nThe motivation right now go ahead keep promoting the care of and right up to election day do it and let's see what happens let's see what happens on election day because\nEven if the Republicans took the house\nWhat kind of solid victory is that I'm In long lines but I I I mean Democrats took the house and you know by by just you know what ten Fifteen Marge it right two or three margin best ability so\nEven if they did that what kind of long lasting ...\nIf if you think about the promise of what they've got to deliver\nWhat is it free stuff\nWell they'll the house had other funded while they were they would still have to be ... again you would you would you would still have to be the resistance how can you be the resistance and govern\nThere's there's no way you can't it's all about obstruction\nNothing else so what do you do that that delivers numbers for people of the president's marketing and and getting results in unemployment\nIn taxes and real things that people seeing

I Know this that Republicans I mean you had you had people like us that criticized soda my your ... and and criticized Elena Kagan but it was on the specifics of how she would rule as a judge\nBut they got Republican votes they weren't demonized the way the cabin was demonized\nIt did I mean so I Will say no it it would not be it would not be exactly the same based on the history of what happened to them they weren't criticized and they were severely criticized by construction is like us to believe that you should follow the rule of law we went back and looked at ...\n... who who talked about\nThe fact that uh oh sorry I'm not supposed to really talk about the fact that we legislate from the bench right right uh we had to lay in a cake and when she couldn't answer the question about a ... but she was asked by a senator whether the government should be able to tell you what food\nYou know you have to you have to buy and she didn't answer the question because it got down to what she believes the Supreme Court is actually you know a a a a buyout\nHow you're supposed to rule as a judge but no I I don't think it would have been able would have been a ... number one it wouldn't have happened you're not going to have a liberal justice uh then again with Trump never know but\nYou could you could have early voting but I asked him to the point from the color if it were a liberal president who appointed a liberal justice and there was an accused you're\nLike a you had a doctor for it but if you but then will fully reverse it being a being Dr Ford had\nRight leaning affiliation as opposed to left leaning affiliations I'm no that wasn't about what it wouldn't have played out the same way because the media wouldn't have done the same thing that they did here I mean the behavior would be different yeah I mean it would be quite the opposite\nOr use you see it all you you see it already whether it's you know senator brown\nOf Ohio mhm they're not pounding him first dating that the unfounded allegation against a a him is a political hit job not covering him not covering up the same way you know he won't\nNo no no no\nNo no I don't believe it would be the same no the last caller\nIn and I think we've seen is like you said we've seen that demonstrated I don't know how many times now along the way\nI don't know that that I don't know that anybody ex would expect it to be the same any especially any critical thinkers that's watching the entire process play out and then you give them scenario would expect that to be the same but now if that was ... all of those items were reverse\nWhat you saw from Kavanaugh was the first there's nothing to cry or that\nYou know that's right that's right great point there's no there's no way to you know that was a precedent

the Saudi consulate in Istanbul on October second when he disappeared\nI said look Trump's popularity is still there because Trump's popularity is still with the average person right\nThat he's you know he's with he's with the average person who looks at the elite and they don't look at him as as part of the uh you know it'd be ... in Washington but they look at the elite they look at the\nUm oh what a ... ... what do they call it the um oh what we found out what we know ... what we called deep state\nThe establishment what do they call it the swamp because Fox has one [laughter] yeah but when we when we we look at the the the great and they view that\nThe Trump that Trump ...\nHis opinions are the the opinions\nOf the average man there is a relation of the average person to Donald Trump right part of it was well he's also anti elite intellectual\nAnd I thought about that I go well I'm not anti intellectual I mean that's not what attracts me to trumpet would attract me to Trump is the part of his intellect where he actually has the right answers [laughter] so yeah I I don't know who actually wrote that whether it came from somebody who is more\nA liberal to say you know anti intellectual or whether it is that mindset that exist with the populace that were against anybody that we use themselves as an intellectual because intellectuals are always wrong [noise]\nUh I'm not sure where that was but the fact is he relates to the average person out there and he speaks like the average person to mhm ah but the fact\nIs he actually has intellect that solves\nA heck of a lot of problems and a blunt and this of the reality of things that we actually face\nOr in the world would still a willingness to negotiate you can look at North Korea again that still on you know that's still a great unknown as to what's gonna happen there you can look at Saudi Saudi Arabia you can look at\nUm a a China and what's going on with the with China right now we think the president has said great successes we also think that he's made some some errors especially in dealing with Canada and Mexico for example in trade we don't believe that we get a if you're a Trump supporter\nOn trade when he was talking about when he ran for office and what he actually got for two totally different ballgames completely yeah and what he was talking about on the campaign compared to what he was but he actually got and promoted look good at what he got was completely different than when he was running for his campaign and as we've said\nIf his most loyal if the always Trump ... want to support it and go with that we're fine with that because all we care about is the actual substance what did you actually get and does it promote more free trade to promote\nA more more good things but the ultimate thing that he promoted was actually a negative it raises the cost of cars in the United states Canada and Mexico and that's a bad\nThing and now I think\nThe average person who understands economics who is in caught up in the political I dollar tree will admit that's a bad part of the deal the always Trump or just ignore it ignored as if it doesn't exist\nWere not just going to go there he got the deal he said he was going to rain soon after he didn't have to for what was it enough to I don't care I don't want to know and that's fine that's part of a demographic that's going to vote for every president says sure but\nThat's not the only demographic that voted for Trump we broke it down to eight different demographics about six months after the election and there's a ton of people that in that demographics is more now more United and you can even at a ninth and there which are the never Trump ... which have now come aboard so Trump\nFor all of the good and the bad has United with the help of Kavanaugh and the help of the Democrats and then speaking bluntly about what they want this country to be calm\nOr have United around Trump and they do look at Trump he is that I think your head that isn't\nThem right\nAnd and I think\nYou look at the end and you said this earlier if you want to look at the ... the the real rock star\nLook at the terms in terms of performance in terms of getting things out Trump over ... come out and let me close because the one thing that that is going to always resonate with American people is a good economy\nIt's going to be a man I'm doing okay everybody in my family seems to be doing okay a job status doing OK and or getting better\nYou look at the unemployment numbers in and these kittens were the liberal media can't argue any of those points anymore they can't break it down because you you just simply can't those numbers now they can be manipulated but in breaking them down in terms of the performance\nAs as long as we use the same standard standard with the same standard of approach basically on those numbers\nYou cannot have a debate about\nThe unemployment or the GDP or anything else because the last president was judged by the same exact standard\nAll of this basically wraps up into one thing\nWhat is it that the other side wants to do is that a threat to this existing ... you know economy right now in other words\nA you know I'm really I'm I Am doing a little bit better you know my jobs doing better or making a little more whatever it might be I'm I'm checking home a little more taxes are lower [noise]\nNot only that but I remember you know we said this and I don't know if anybody's ever used the exact same words that we used and I think we use to probably uh I think this was early in the primaries and we continue to say it all the way through the election\nAnd we and and the media has completely missed is totally mhm but it's not just that we can do the analysis that I was telling you that I read yesterday the Trump is the average average person the average person looks at them as the average person what does that entail the average person\n... if you'd cause that to me doesn't describe the the the substance that just that's labeling people I use an average person therefore he likes Trump's because Trump relates to the average person because they believe he's like the average person what does that mean and you and I actually use the L Word back\nWay back in the in in the campaign\nI Believe that and and I believe this too but I Believe\nThe Trump loves America mhm\nAnd I believe he loves Americans and he loves Americans first\nUm\nBut he loves Americans and I think the people that support him I think part of the political I dollar tree which is different than Obama's political I dollar tree\nRight is it they look at him and they say here's a guy that truly loves America and he loves to me he cares about me yeah he is rude and yeah he's crude but when it gets down with a law that comes from the anger that we believe that he shares with us that these other people don't love America\n... and we love America and how do we love and now the luckily me it would get insulted we love America now you know you don't believe in due process\nInvolved Cuomo America's never been great right but ... exactly mhm you you really you really don't you don't really believe in the first amendment you don't really believe in the second amendment\nYou don't believe in due process you don't believe in a presumption of innocence what do you really love about America you and I had brought this up for over ten years when we've gone through certain issues and said women if you don't care about this and you don't care about the constitution\nBecause what makes us Americans do we live in the same geographical place you know\nIt's we share an idea and one is that idea but the ideas the constitution of the United state us and when you have a group of people are political party ... that\nThis isn't bumble thought\n'cause that's what the Democrats will try to do is just a bunch of basalt there so Trump Globes America we love America\nI Love America to actually if you don't believe in the constitution you don't love America\nYou may love the concept of what you as a group all think America should be but you don't love America the way that it exists under the current constitution and the rules and regulations that we have\nYou and I talked about it when you talk about the fact now they're talking about well the president needs remember the president's see there's no longer effective or that needs to go to the the electoral college needs to go to the Senate needs to go and what they don't understand are those are key words that you don't believe in individual liberty\nBecause we are not a direct democracy we are a constitutional republic and the reason we are is to protect the rights of the minority best\nTo protect the individual rights and the rights of the minority exactly what they claim that they believe the Democrats\nThat they they think about so we look at all that and that's all part of loving America so when you hear when I say that I I've always got responds all it's above the thing that he loves American we don't we'll know based on\nThe actual specifics of what the Democratic Party is promoting mhm what we're calling for which is anti constitutional mindset and an anti constitution hall yeah and we can make that point and you and I've said for the longest time\nBut it's still left that doesn't believe in the first amendment oh for them yeah mhm but for others they don't and we have broken that down before they don't believe in the second amendment and now they don't believe in due process under the law when it's inconvenient for them there was not a presumption of innocence that mindset is wrong\nFamily and friends are\nSo here's a story you might relate to I used to post a job ... only to end

Kavanaugh on that show just came up to my attention okay and then let's say was completely disarm show or a group of\nConservatives or Republicans would be like ... like ... ... ... each of it like I didn't understand who\nGo on our side will be ... or early\nNobody ... you're ... you're talking about the behavior of the the uh the uh interrupted disruptive kind of and we're getting some interference on your calls so we'll let you go\nUm if you're talking about the disrupt the type of behavior or the after the the committee vote on Kavanaugh the Kamala Harris and and uh and others walking out that kind of behavior who on the right would do that\nI don't know of anybody that would do that our point was that it would have been a different scenario based on the media treatment of a set individual had everything but that's really more about the media treatment\nUm and what we do and we did go back in and talked about the working down of the um uh you know what how they have acted or behaved as a judge\nDuring the confirmation process for Sotomayor or for oil in the Kagan and what they might do in a in a certain scenario\nBut that was based on their behavior as a judge you still had Republicans vote for them\nWe used to hide and that was their treatment of them was based on again how they would behave as a judge that was part of a what Lindsey Graham and say you know he voted for Elena Kagan and ... and so\nWhat the behavior be\nYou know I'm a a\nA ... well a Lindsey Graham getting up and walking out likely not\nBecause I think what you saw and Lindsey Graham and uh his ah emotional or the you know statements that day\nDuring the hearing when Kavanaugh was there was based on the ... the behavior of those on the left and how were they were treating\nThis and essentially a shredding the process\nAnd and I think that's what that's what that was if it had you know a liberal president and it was a a liberal justice or liberal judge\nA that had been appointed and during this process there was a conservative leaning or the you know the woman accusing him of doing something with the behavior be different by the media would have had been treated the same likely not no but it was kind of a\nYou know with all due respect to well the answer I think we all know that any critical thinkers does her\nI don't expect a Lindsey Graham or or another conservative on the committee or or Republican on the committed to get up and do what mallet Harris did you know after the committee vote get up and storm out\nThat wasn't the point\nYou know ... and again you can't make the case of the he was trying to make the case that it was the same and it was like when I was on President what happened right mhm and you either like a Justice Thomas that goes back you know twenty five\nOr ... that goes back twenty five years ago and and uh you know he those hearings were held and then but then but then he was he was you know confirmed that I Believe some Democrats even cross the line and voted for him yes they did I Believe that yes they did well I Believe it was a Democrat Senate at the\nTime [noise] yeah\nUh so yeah so you know they they ... but this was on press it\nNot being with nothing we have ever seen uh in in our lifetime or in modern times has has been like this so to even question that\nTo me uh shows ignorance and that doesn't mean stupidity it means a lack of knowledge ah on on history and that's why we brought up so that didn't happen was sort of minor and that didn't happen with Kagan there were people that disagree with that because we we believe that sort of my or and Kagan many times not all the time\nOn the cell to our\nRight to cell tower case or the cell tower that they agreed with ... day you know that ah they use the in their writings they used\n'em a prior judgment or by opinion written by ... majority opinion written by Scalia is ... exactly that was the press and the right to use\nBut in many of their many of their answers and many of their their decisions we believe they legislate\nUh we're always you know conservative or moderate crash a shaky El Paso history you know just go back to [laughter]\nI don't know it just amazes me it's like I wasted\nThirty three years in the air [laughter] and ... and even you know the constitution I may you know I write is get on Yahoo\nI understand yeah I understand there's always been there yet on the there's always been that uber service uh there there's always been the ebb and flow is I mean if you if you were walking around the Nineteen thirties as an adult in this country you would have seen\nOr you know the socialist mindset that really really really really existed at that time span the anarchist movement that uh in in the first part of the twentieth century\nUh that that existed or in this country could get a just as wild at at times one of the things is the the fact is do do as many people still hold his radical views\nAs you see maybe a little more right now I don't know how many Democrats rank and file actually hold the views\nNot believing and due process as the mainstream of the Democratic leadership now does right whether I seem to see where it is there a big just right now now we we know better than many of the issues they if you if you actually polled Democrats on all the major issues out there as to what they would want\nYou would see as we saw back in and we noted back in the twenty twelve especially when on the issues\nThe majority of the public agreed with\nA Romney yeah ... yeah on the issues they are ... and if you take a ton of the issues that rank and file Democrats believe they disagree with what the people they vote for a does and I think to a much greater extent than any Republican\nVoting for a Republican president direct site yeah\nYeah because you think about this if you think about the conservative never Trump ... the vast majority of the issues that they disagree with Trump on\nHis his tone yes\nWhich is similar to what they are a lot of the left criticizes him for his words in his town\nAnd it's not so much the job that he's done you know they may pick apart you know whatever it is the terror of babies by the way we are the original chair babies um but but but they may pick up part these things or this or that but\nUltimately if you got down and you were to ask the never Trump or is it conservative never Trump for his\nUh well okay the corporate tax rate Twenty one percent did you think that was going to happen or do you apply that do agree with that um the unemployment rate the GDP where we are right now uh do you think we're moving in a good direction and the president's done a good job on a number of items\nI don't know how you would do that even as a never\nAnd I I Believe the president should fight more when it comes to the debt he's taking little victories those I'm cutting the federal government as much but it's doing nothing to solve the budget problem but I ... yeah he throws those he throws out but the fact is he knows he's\nNot the legislative branch and yes he knows he didn't want power ... this isn't this isn't the president alone that has you know created this deficit spending these other Republicans in Congress including a significant portion of conservative or formerly conservative [laughter]\nWho wants to identify conservative Republican congressional members that are also wanting to spend on a a a ton of money well well how do\nThey get tax has done Roy Moore last year and they realized oh my gosh we got to get things done because we may lose the Senate at some point and we got this slim you know victory here are slim margin now\nAnd they didn't uh ... the Republicans and the Senate didn't get it done until after that law the president had been working toward that but again this answer tight if they're not going to do anything right\nI think the president's just to work harder and still talk about more which he does not ... it probably better and I I'm thinking the probably the White House says look we can't win this because our own party\nDoesn't care any more about the debt well you\nKnow what's the what's really disappointing I guess the downside of those Kavanaugh saying or what may have motivated a lot of people or whether it's never Trump or his or or the the moderate Republicans who now are standing up and for conservative principles again\nIt could be too little too late not not in the Senate but in the house and the president and the Republicans if the just imagine that that the Republicans maintain power in the house and the Senate\nThe motivation to get things let's now work on getting things done right\nThat's very\nReal but it can happen if the house isn't there\nIf you lose the house is going to be limited in what you can get done and\n[noise]\n\n\nAs soon as ... radio on was good one listened\nTo read I radio show wherever you are with our free app for your iPhone or

well she should have been removed a long time ago right if if putting a server in your house\nIf being so careless or with\nAt the minimum careless and then the maximum absolutely premeditated\nBy a

the oversight\nBut from the judge or I Want to read part of the transcripts\nOr from a U.S district court judge Royce Lamberth the transparency group judicial watch initially sue the department of or the state department and twenty fourteen seeking information about the response to the Benghazi attack\nAfter the government did not respond to a freedom of Information Act request other parallel lawsuits by judicial watch are probing issues like Clinton server\nWhose existence was revealed during the the course of the litigation the state department had a miniature ... uh moved to dismiss judicial watch his first lawsuit on the motion\nFor some re judgments saying in an affidavit that it it conducted a search of all potentially relevant emails in the possession and provided them the affidavit noted\nThat some more documents and emails couldn't be forthcoming but Lambert denied the request to dismiss the lawsuit at the time and on friday he said he was happy he did charging the state department officials had intentionally misled him because other key documents including those on Clinton's email server\nAnd in fact not been produced it was clear to me that at the time that I ruled initially that false statements were made to me by career State Department officials and it became more clear it through discovery that the information that I was provided\nWas clearly falls regarding the added the adequate see\nOf the search and this what we now know turned out to be the secretaries email system Lambert said on friday he continued I don't know the details of what kind of IGA inquiry or there was into why these career officials at the state department\nWould have filed false affidavits with me by the way that's perjury\nYes you do that yes you're telling the court something when you know to be something else I don't know the details of why the Justice Department lawyers did not know false affidavits were being filed with me but I was very relieved that I did not accept them and that I allowed limited discovery\nInto what had happened during a tense exchange with Justice Department lawyer Robert Prince Lambert pressing issue accusing prince abusing double speak and playing the same word games but Clinton play and\nThat was not true that's a quote the judge said referring to the state department's assurances in sworn declarations but it had searched all relevant documents quote it was a lie\nAnd I thought about this the culture because we talked about the culture of the Obama administration the\nCulture that existed in the IRS or as we know they purposely or trying to hold up\nThe of the tax or a documents what do you call it again the tax um of all I got my blank here are the\nReturns ... no no no the ... though they were trying to hold up these groups are wanting to get a a a\nTax exempt tired as I write towards ... again status his they held them up by the way we want to know why I'm against the income tax income tax for that reason right there\nI'm against the income tax because the government should never have to review any group as to their intentions as the federal government was able to do that's why I Believe there should be a sales tax mhm\nThat's why I'm against an income tax write because the government has used the income tax to get involved and to censor people and to do things that they have no business being involved in your life right\nNow and then by the way you're touching on something I referred to earlier you know that that whole process of and well it was a couple of rogue agents remember that yeah it was a couple of rogue agents yeah no it wasn't no it wasn't and we're not saying if it was a direct order from the White House down\nWhat we're saying was there was a tone a clear tone that was set we know\nWe know the ... the behavior the pattern of behavior\nDuring that administration on many levels the question is how far did that go and was the tone and the department of justice or at the state department just that look will do anything we want to we don't\nWe don't have to tell the truth even to the courts\nWell and and when I when I look at when we look at the situation with the IRS which you look at all the rest of this seems the IRS might be minor compared\nCompared to everything else when you when you when you look at for example here at the department of of of a state where the judge just saying you lied to me yes you absolutely lied to meet you committed perjury\nYou let an affidavit says his accusation right uh you know a ... to ah to to them you look at what went on so that we're looking at the FBI and the department of justice you're looking at after when the\nPfizer application was declassified on the other documents declassified but the president didn't release it but sent it to the inspector\nGeneral of the department of justice who looks at what looks at corruption\nYou look at how they were so willing the state department to lie on ... yeah and and this is why the whole thing ah with\nThe um\nOh I just I got my like your and but on the air for a while [laughter] we went on vacation I Do [laughter]\nWith could show ... ... with the ... the debt murder of of ah a poster a jump off the show he over over in Turkey or wherever it happened where we've sold on all the information because nobody has been able to independently verify what turkey has said\nI'm sure somebody in the CIA may know but the average person doesn't know and this is why the Democrats have no business on talking anything about this administration\nAnd how they handle it so far especially when there's a lack of clarity as to what actually happened in this particular case should be investigated absolutely should there be repercussions if what we believe\nMight have happened to happen and absolutely there should've been but the Democrats have no business of talk after all the Democrats and the media backed up Hillary Clinton's line about a terrorist attack that got Americans killed and they lied about it yes\nAnd she knew about it and I believe the White House and President Obama knew that they were lying about it why there was an election coming up so they lie about it a terrorist attack on that killed American citizens and an American ambassador and they lied about it\nAnd one we discovered that the evidence existed that Hillary lie about it remember when Jim Jordan brought it out what was the response of the media that day and\nThis was a great we want to Hillary's best way yeah\nFrancis\nTechnology so soft money

McNamara thanks so much for\nBeing here this morning or early voting starts so for us here today in Texas I don't know when it starts across the nation for other states but just Fifteen days away from election day in so much to talk about as we've been doing throughout the morning back here we go let's talk to Mike in Washington state Mike Hi you're on the radio I might\nThank you this whole meal or the thing is just like it's just so frustrating for the voters because it drags on and on he's coming up with nothing it's false accusations and it's I think we're going to win the house because of it because people are sick and tired of it\n... it's interesting because there there was a report that was out last week my dad said uh they expect mall or a ... to issue here is the core of his report after the midterm and I'm Wondering why after the midterm\nAnd and what's going on a wise is the media they just a band in this story and I mean they've banned in this story completely there's really nothing going on like you what you saw up until now I don't know what a couple of months ago maybe\nAnd then it ... when the house either well I I don't know that we will but it's interesting my\nThere what I don't believe was\nIs this uh like the FiveThirtyEight thing saying uh you know they an eighty five percent chance that the Democrats will take the house\nBecause you have to get into all the different polls and all these districts and I mean there's a ton of but then we can break it down much easier into those thirty one tossup states right that that right now according to RCB there are thirty one tossup\nSeats there are things like ah Texas thirty two uh Pete Sessions and his Democratic challenger is someone who was in the last poll which was twenty eight days ago today\nA was within a point now we know because we live\nHere in in this area we know that that district is a north of Dallas County uh and so there has been a ... a demographic shift that's been going on that ship has been happening really over the last uh probably\nA three to five years but really over the last few years especially because so much growth in this area brings individuals and for jobs right so there's a the the demographics change so that could be an actor appalled but we don't know my question is why are we seeing those big pollsters in these a toss up districts\nWhy are we seeing these new polls come out especially a couple of weeks out\nBecause if you're looking at the house you would think that there was some interest there by the media in order to hire these pollsters these major pollsters are to do a more in depth polls we maybe we'll see some starting this morning and then to next week or an over the next couple of weeks as election day is one week from tomorrow\nBut my question is really not if five thirty eight or any of them or wrong or because um\nWho was it that uh had the basically the the it was like a fifty fifty on the house was that NPR\nA couple of weeks ago there Saturdays ago yeah\nYeah so and and it came out to eat yesterday that in what is it likely of voters and the Republicans are moving closer right okay that came out just yesterday I think I have writers somewhere yeah the the the story here\nBut it's so much tougher to tell 'em those house seats I just I I Wonder if that if we're going to gain in the in the in the Senate mhm and so that's you know that's looking at a populations across the state and right here or that\nYou know I just wonder how they extrapolate it out to so many of these races where if they're using the public polls out there there are so few of them\nSo few and far between those now if you're going to the internal polling polling which I'm sure is being done by the campaigns you would have the better you know a better guess at that right yeah it it gets here\nIt is a a a Dems mid term advantage narrows among registered voters smear my new national poll a few weeks before the midterm election shows the chances of a blue wave are far from a slam dunk for the Democrats the NBC Wall Street Journal poll released a Sunday shows forty eight percent of registered voters\nWould prefer having Democrats in control of Congress compared to forty one percent supporting the G O P the seven point gap is narrowing from a ... point gap the Democrats headed September\nI don't know if that tells you anything though well and and again I mean registered voters we gotta talk route likely voters and then again what the motivation is on election day and it's we've been talking\nAbout this it has changed since the Kavanaugh confirmations leading up to and since I don't know to what extent\nI Can't tell you it's motivated the left or the right more we do know there is no doubt the rights is motivated Republicans are motivated right now are they more motivated than Democrats I Can't tell you that\nNow I'll I'll watch it on the Mike called before we started talking about you know the the whole Russian collusion at the top of the hour and I say that because my was not driven to call based on what we had said and therefore he you know became passionate about giving his point of view across my
