{"month": "10", "state": "AL", "station": "WXQW", "content": "For natural disaster happened then we're outside the home we were all me that the part that's our meeting for I mean\nEvery time the ... we all have a meeting my way to pay my boss is your plan any better can learn more about making an emergency plan for your family got Rodney ... by the by the U.S department of homeland security council\nYou're listening to John bachelor show exclusively on six six number you executed out [noise]\n\n\n\nJohn ... sir definitely while his book is a mad catastrophe\nAnd we will follow Conrad with his delusions about how to defeat the Russians\nHeat than for army against the Russians who are overwhelming him from all directions he gives the order\nTo march on ... which is well to the north is Nordstrom the northern a policy the northern campaign that he's going to launch but she doesn't use the few aircraft he has he doesn't use the cavalry has so we had no idea where the Russians are\nThe way you lay this out of the ... I follow you very carefully Jeffrey is this uh this well known in Europe that Conrad campaign was ignorance an amateur tourism any throw himself up against the Russians wed any idea where they were\n[noise] but I think that the Austrian surprisingly to get a pass on most of these things are viewed as having followed a gallon little war against the Russians scheme roller and this is to ignore the central reality here which is that\nWe're planning and you know in the Eighteen seventies in Vienna in Berlin had assumed that the Austrian Hungarians although numerically weaker\nThan Russia I mean remember the population of Austria Hungary and Nineteen fourteen is fifty three million population of Russian anybody does a hundred and fifty million three times larger\nA corresponding way larger army cheaply because they can afford it thanks to French financing part of the French strategy to hold off the Germans were bigger richer was to finance railways and military expansion inside Russia\nSo they knew they were they known since the you know since the late Eighteen hundreds of they were going to have to fight the Russians at some point\nIt was the strangest strategy was that the author Hungarians all those smaller would be qualitatively better they would have a faster nimble are harder hitting army better trained better morale swift or and they would strike quickly\nEnd of the Russian Empire and they would be real the the the presumably slower Russian mobilization by stray that's an orange sauce you mentioned is pushing the low blame the idea is blow this northern blow that would hinge the Russian mobilization\nCreate chaos and allow this more efficient are stronger I mean to\nAdvance deep into Russia and not not that feeds the Russian Empire because there's no chance\nAn army of forty five forty eight divisions is going to conquer the Russian Empire and march all the way to Petersburg but no they could have really thrown the Russians back retarded their mobilization allowed the Germans to win and the west and then allow the Germans to redeploy two million troops to the east to finish off the Russians and so\nYou know the common assumption to the Austrian did okay that they want a couple of frontier battles\nAnd it was only because a big Russian number that they were thrown back but in fact\nThey knew they were gonna have to cope with the Russian numbers and those frontier battles that they are celebrated for having one comb are often crossing were minor victory speaking in fact I argue in the book they aren't really victories I say it's like a a boxer who wins points in the first round but didn't get knocked out in the second round\nI mean that he won the you know in fact they win these battles these early ballots within the Russians pullback regroup and then to counterattack and destroy I mean literally destroy the stronger and all\nThe arrogance of the Austrian Empire they believed they always had to attack so they were out numbered and and Russians learn to survive by digging in\nA shooting and then at the ... as the Austrian got close to ... the Russians would run away and read position themselves for the next\nFor the next contact and the Austrians never had anything to shoot at now that was just Austrians dialing it they'll they come off as if they're too arrogant to be in the battle they don't believe the Russians should oppose them\nWell you know it it some of them some of them were certainly arrogant or you see officers you know in the book I go to Robert it'll say to them and oh just advance the Russians are hiding in their trenches there's nothing to fear from them there's some areas there certainly\nBut the office of tactics the bullet the gay tactics charging\nA Russian gun lines in trenches really had more to do with the national in linguistics problems in the army and there was just no way to get these multilingual true with any kind of precision if they'd been spread out and open order so the ... the solution to them in the\nStorm calm the ban it charges much like those used by Napoleon at the beginning of the nineteenth century and send these massive storm called that the Russian trenches and this was absolute suicide the casualties were horrendous and the and the Russians were stupid fight there were like\nWhat army fight this negligent ally and foolishly then not only were they attacking with these mass to\nBan it charges in the trenches that were bristling with ... firing artillery machine guns and magazine rifles but they were doing it without any artillery support and without\nMoving in with one machine gun purpose tallying and the machine guns often didn't work because of the point of the book the troops to try to waterproof them smeared than with lard dry oh lord clog the machine the machine gun couldn't fire so you see ... reports quit clean the machine guns\nAre not working but they didn't they only had light artillery they had no heavy artillery\nAnd uh so that the the the Austrian attacks\nAre slaughters absolute spot in his pictures in the book to these shaped up bloated black and Austrian corpses after every after every engagement\nThe two army and the one against the Serbs in the south pole T. R. S. army is turned back smashed back it will go back again and again and again but smashed back\nAnd the army for Conrad going to the north runs into the Russians and his overwhelmed and when we return we'll be or how Austria explains itself because one of the things about Conrad and one of the things about ... is that they're always wrote her thing the rationalization for their memoirs each time they lose the battle\nThe book is a mad catastrophe the outbreak of World War one and the collapse of the hops for ... to an empire Jeffrey ... the author and John ... business the John ...

arrested after a grand jury claims he tampered with evidence and the investigation of convicted dumped her Larry Nassar the indictment alleges penny ordered the removal of documents from the Karolyi Ranch relating to Nassar's activities there which is the removal was aimed at impairing the ongoing investigation of Nasser [noise]\nBy the way one of the other things I mentioned last night the left is very good at slogans right so hope and change right Obama had open change how could you argue with hope and change you have to it's much more complex to explain our position wait a second or you always for change and I'll ask my students or you know or you're happy when you're younger and your parents are\nDecided they were moving and they didn't ask you how about that change\nOr how about a chain you know the taken away your car\nNot every change is good but hope and change sounds fantastic so Lowe's on our side\nOr off and on the defensive even though\nAs I said they're playing the obvious the most recent case being parents with children\nTrying to get asylum and you know why I mentioned 'cause it's happening now but I'll get that in a minute seeking asylum and President Trump and Republicans accused of ripping children of course there's the help of the media ripping children from their mother's arms and putting these children in cages never mind\nThat this was started under the bottom and ministry Russian President Trump and Republicans are on the defensive never mind that if the parents of these children this is crucial but Yardley ever heard it if the parents\nOf these children didn't come to the border and the first place there would be no issue no one force them to come here\nThey made a voluntary choice and we have a right to our sovereignty\nAnd to protect our borders and to decide who is welcome to enter just like we do with our homes this is so obvious\nIt's incredible that we have to explain our position but again there's a simple right how can you you know you're ripping away from their parents how could you do that and we're on the other side having to explain things like\nWhat a ... coming here legally means why that's not acceptable or the left and the Democrats and the media likely do not believe in having us you know our sovereignty\nBut rather they believe in open borders but they don't like to admit that because they know they will lose the argument\nWhich is why they would rather talk about tearing children out of their mother's arms\nIs really bad they get to just set the debate and the terms of the debate when the media's on their side because no one's questioning them with comments like I'm throwing out there and that you would never mind\nThat when anyone does something illegal and they're hauled off to jail their children do not go with them to jail boys that a big one\nThat's a huge one you'll never see it when you know in the in the last time this happened and it's going to happen again with these hunters ah Honduras refugees coming you know seeking asylum that's going to happen\nVery shortly whenever they get here you never get to stay with your kid you can you can use the same phrase oh she was found guilty of robbery first degree robbery\nAnd butter child was ripped out of her arm you never hear the media say that but that's what happens in effect\nThere also and so to speak torn away from them why isn't it said and as a just indicated the latest reincarnation of this conflict\nIs is a news hundreds of Hondurans are heading for the U.S border in a mass migration to seek asylum so again President Trump\nAnd the Republicans will be on the defensive just because they want to defend our borders and the media will again show crying children and destroyed mother you know what's gonna happen but no one is forcing them to come here and we have a right to decide who gets to enter our\nHouse and under what circumstances among other things we have a right this is pretty obviously too it seems to me to protect the American people from harm\nWhere the from terrorism or disease we all know the terrorists aren't coming through our open border or disease or we checking for diseases like we used to know\nOr ... well he had to say come here and Russian or even matter this wasn't born people don't talk about this to make sure that people who come here share our values\nAnd just about every country does this including our neighbor immediately to the south of Mexico good try the same thing down there some of us think this is also obvious but there have been huge forces arrayed against this common sense the Democrats\nWon more votes they will tell you that they they know illegal immigrants vote for them in huge numbers and the country club Republicans for lack of better name they want cheap labor so you have a newspapers like the wall Street Journal I I stopped subscribing to it\nWhen they would have their editorials and I would talk about immigration in the title\nAnd then I mean they say illegal immigration the title and some are in the middle they would just sit switched immigration oh immigration has been great for America over the years how could you you're in Iowa list right how could you oppose this this is insane but they would switch on us even though they pretend to talk about illegal immigration in the title\nOf course the Republicans are also the stupid party that's my party say a McDonald's during that so you have people like George W. Bush and Karl Rove saying things like boy we can get this vote George W. Bush got up to forty percent of the Hispanic vote in Texas wonderful\nI'm not a math major but that seems like a formula for defeat all a lawsuit politics by the way politics in particular a loss of sixty percent of forty percent is huge and that is based on an optimistic assumption most illegal immigrants come here for jobs but they also take advantage\nOf government hand that says we know that the rest of us are paying for and by the way the Republican Party can never do the Democrats in offering benefits\nI uh I think I use this phrase years ago when a ever voters given a choice between Democrats and Democrats meaning larger Democrats they choose the original ones they will need us so who these people going to vote for it's not that hard to figure out and if left unchecked the Republicans will never win a national\nElection again so even on a purely selfish basis it is clear that we need to control the border\nNot to mention fairness what do you say to the people around the world who've been waiting many years I've heard of people waiting a decade to get here but has to undergo long waits and says some paperwork to even have a hope of getting here so they have to follow the rules but those who dash across the border do not\nWhich is why a border wall makes sense among other tools not the only thing but it's one of the tools so one caller this week and if you didn't hear him suggests that border walls don't work in the long run and I said but even if that were true I bet they work in the short run well we tried to clean this mess up and\nHave an orderly procedure coming to our country is to me it's the same ridiculous logic that the defenders of illegals murdering innocent America's like Americans like aids finally use and I you know I pointed ... cause I watch them do a time and time again saying oh illegals commit crimes\nPercentage wise even lower numbers the Native Americans as if that matters who cares if even if that's true if an American is killed or harmed by illegal immigrants that person would not have been hurt if that illegal had been denied entry no matter what the percentage isn't that obvious\nAnd that wall by the way in Israel preventing Hamas for murdering Israel's Israelis is working to shore room of logic these arguments is baffling to me unless you realize they have no real argument unless you change the words and the terms\nI more to say but I Know we have to go to the break Shirley let me give you the numbers and I'll go on a little bit more eight six six Ninety red eyes and that's the same as eight six six nine seven three three three nine\nSo example how can you ever justify sanctuary cities were criminal illegals or given safe harbor\nIf you come up with phony arguments like illegals will not caught you've heard this they won't cooperate with the authorities if they know they can be apprehended or sent home\nSo that's why it's important that you know we have sanctuary for them but how about they not be allowed to come or in the first place and we wouldn't need to cooperate with authorities isn't that obvious how can you ever justify harboring criminals who commit crimes that native born Americans have no asylum from\nYou change the debate watch this to the evil police officers that ice who had the audacity to arrest people commit crimes that they do these guys are really clever on the left\nSo the wrestling with long lines at hospitals ... schools and intolerable traffic\nWhile the elites often live behind walls and their gated communities so what's my solution you take away the benefits like free health care and free schools you enforce strict penalties against businesses that hire illegals even sending some CEO to jail you say in the first CEO to jail for hiring an illegal immigrant and they'll never happen again\nAnd you'd be amazed at how many illegal immigrants would return home\nRun we actually had a right to use the wrong language stuffed up there we go again with language right we're not good at that self deport we keep losing the language war to the left but I wouldn't say that those who remained right everybody would leave it there are no bad if I take 'em back not everybody a lot would leave\nAnd that's what's happened during the recession a lot we leave there are no benefits no government handouts and they couldn't get jobs legally\nWe but I Would say that those who remain that's the point I Want to make I'd be willing to have a conversation about with them because they'd be saying for the right reasons\nAnd for heaven's sake enough of the government's sending out the wrong message message with actions like ball legal education classes I'm a teacher I Know or bilingual government documents\nA country is United by language and it's shared values English is our language and immigrants need to learn the language our history and our\nByrd values our ancestors kiss the ground when they landed here at Alice island\nFriends say la\n... more now and

[laughter] ... yeah I I Do hear about the way you bring up a new story I don't know if it a lot of people know about South Africa's expert parading the land of a lot of the citizens right and that's going to be a real struggle and a lot of them are going to resist ride with a force\nAbsolutely absolutely yeah\nWe will it was you know and and thanks for your call when we meddle in other countries I don't mean coming to their aid in defense but likely did South Africa you gotta be careful what you get I pay all this talk of makes me think age of ... we helped them over to throw a\nWhat's his name and the bar and I asked them at the time I was doing national radio and I say wait a second that what they called the springs something what was the term anybody out there can tell me I've forgotten there for a second I'm\n... now and Brian was helping me ... and not the spring there was some something when spring but anyway uh the fact is we got where she got to ask that question what's what's after this so you got rid of Mubarak and you got the brother had the Muslim Brotherhood which was to radical and certainly not on our side\nAnd then eventually ... took it over there we were saying maybe it was the Arab Spring I may you may be right Brian I think you are now that I think ... the producer Brian so you know I'm I'm mentioning the fact is that you you can't just do the spine when we did that in South Africa right\nThe overthrow of what you have and then you don't ask what's next is going to be attorney right oh that's the best example might be Iran\nWe were so thrilled with Jimmy Carter to overthrow the shock yeah but they didn't ask well was next are you happy looking back and seeing what you've gotten instead of the shah\nAre the biggest enemy maybe or at least our enemy that same you might say Russia China but certainly the biggest immediate threat in terms of what they're doing to our citizens so it's very important that you not just act emotionally I'm thinking in ... in Libya right Hillary was for that Obama was for that what is your\nPlace Libya with ... didn't they killed Americans right\nIn being gutsy ... you just can't operate let me get myself in trouble with somebody you're now\nIn Saudi Arabia we got a real problem there\nWhat they did was horrendous in my opinion needed stone assassinate people like that and go inside and chop them up and some people picked on me for that is that it's none of our business but the other side in President Trump's got a huge problem now\nIs they're our biggest supporters in ... you know besides Israeli and trying to do work against Iran cause Iran's their threat to this world is very complicated and their offer no easy solutions or maybe you don't notice a stark like we had a war there was a war now we between Iran and Iraq\nAnd you know you've got to choose sides sometimes they may both be terrible we worked with the Soviet Union during the more I think about this we work

I Would say this you know process layer we're on a ... year over a bunker radicals who are worth a mob mentality\nAbsolutely well I I grade called Bruce I agree with you and you made a lot of great points and we need to protect our country you're absolutely right and I I as I said thanks for calling director ... ... and let's go to AJ in Chicago AJ you're on with mark\nHey what's up man I'm I just want to say that actually the last caller had a lot of great points [noise] um the\nBiggest cones that he had was that a lot of illegal immigrants coming to the United states uh believing that they have the right choice for landing on this country [noise]\nUm I think that you know it's a lot more than just be your it's more of contributing if he don't contribute to your community the lowest\nSense or you don't you're not valuable in that sense so\nIf you don't contribute to your country I think that's the highest sense which is what our military\nAnd most of our people who serve this country at the highest level tend to say that they do um it's nothing then immigration King County um so I Would say that\nI I agree with you should feel that um you come into this country to contribute to the absolute smokes or you don't think you can do that and I don't know what your contribution to this country is\nI'm just being here it's not enough to know what I mean\nYeah I Do in fact I think you're into something many of them come here and they wind up with an entitlement mentality right they're entitled to him they serve as the hospitals schools whatever you want to say\nAnd and then you know what here's another great point what you give away for free I called a great point 'cause it's mind what you came away for free he's usually not valued\nWhat you know you give free schools and they don't value the school you get free medical care that after a while people think it's coming to them so we even hurting them the the illegals because we're not making them value what we're giving them\nRight right so I have one final point you might find the power that\nUh if if you take away a oil given for free then what do you have you know and if you come here with nothing and they expect the most um\nYou really can view it though things so you should take at least a ... in my in my expectations of what I can give and what I can take it always has to do with what my contributions are at a comedy and I give the least then I won't be doing the worst\nIf I come here and give the most I Will be doing the best there or are you planning to anything whether it's a job whether it's a service position whether it's anything at all or giving your your on your percent\nOld law should should dictate and ... percent a pay back if you gave your absolute least zero percent you're not going to get anything out of you know what I mean so\nI knew in Europe you reminded me of a kid or if I could share yeah let me ask you remind me of a story if I could share with you\nWhen I was teaching younger kids in elementary school when I first started out now I teach adults you know what the kids would do with the free lunch you have any idea what they would do that they would throw in and they would take the Green Bay would take the green peas and toss them all over the cafeteria\nBecause they got it for free and they place no value on it\nSo in any sense exactly yeah in in a funny sense\nEven with the illegals they may not only is an entitlement mentality but we're not even helping then because they didn't earn any if this were just waiting for nothing and then we're surprised when they don't even know value being in America and they don't share you stake in the community and give it a values in fact\nWe made it so easy that there are now communities where people don't even learn to speak English because everything's done for them in Spanish and I love in Hispanic people a day they're mostly in my classes\nThat's not the issue so we've actually in a funny way done harm to them and the other gentleman the other caller said we you know we should not abandoned the fight\nYeah but you do need someone to express it in a way that the American people it is a winning issue that's what he's saying that the American people can sign onto it we're not even helping the illegals yeah you say in the short run they're getting free benefits and stuff not in the long run\nNot in the long run do they value what's so special about being in the United states of America and there are set America One caller challenge me on that break call thanks so much AJ\nAnd
