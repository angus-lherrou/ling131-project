P. S.\nAnd she went from a toss up to ... they had in the state\nThis is our states the Senate race went from ... to ah ah leans Republican and it will they and if it if the polls keep trying the way they're trying now it will likely go likely Republican before the elections and\n... and they the some of the analysis I was looking at said six percent of Republicans a will in an average election will either sit out the election or vote for the other candidate and they made the point that if that six percent of it was just a normal election\nAnd that six percent which is a huge amount ... old decided to vote for war can he would still win by five hundred and fifty thousand votes cruise would still worries would still witness\nYeah yeah I'm ... and looking at the the breakdown of it and the the uh the history of of those waters because you you and look in El Paso and his district um and and El Paso county ah\nIt's it's he can run for that house seat and keep that how safe as long as he wants it ... you when you move out to the you know the the broader much broader said of course the demographics change drastically\nUm Dallas County alright he might win that ah there's in fact I knew if you look to the polls I'm sure Dallas County would show going for him Travis County Harris County\nSo those are Dallas ah Austin and Houston are respectively if if you're if you're not familiar with the counties but that's those metro areas are tons of support tons of money coming in from uh the pack so he promised to or not ah except\nUh in terms of that and and and not he well he promised to reject the the the pac money I guess in in furnace but you really can't reject pac money pac money uh ultimately I guess but the the point being is there's a ton of a liberal money coming from out of the state a ton of\nLiberal press from out of the state\nUm and of course uh the the make up the demographics in those those areas that we talked about a bear county in San Antonio\nUh same thing so you've got all these are blue counties\nAnd these metro areas and and that's that's kind of the breakdown of it and he'll do well and and likely win and those that were that were mentioned are and some other counties and or districts and the state but ultimately it comes down to the broader state as it always does\nAnd uh right now it's got to the court into our sleepy leaning Republican\nAnd looking at to Tennessee of of for example you know as as we look at how did the cabinet thing and uh how might it have you know changed the way that that people are looking and you look at the CNN the tendency race ah Marsha Blackburn against a a Phil Bredesen a British thing was up\nBy five ... democratic challenger back from the poll taken just from the eleventh of the September to the Fifteen he was up by five ... uh from the twenty ninth to the second\nBlack burn up by five from the second to the fifth which took us to Saturday and write a note took us to friday friday that black burn up a ... that's a third team point movement\nIn a matter of a a matter of a month and that's why we've always said we don't really when you see plus or minus ... ah you know five or even six or even seven it doesn't give you an indication as to you know how the polls may tighten\nAnd this is the time right now I mean I'm Talking about right now in the election fight is when you get a much better idea we always hear from our listeners that polls are never right mhm that is incorrect analysis\nA ... you know\nPresidential elections for example you and I really paid attention a front in two thousand and two thousand twelve and two thousand six teams and after the election saying how many polls were close than normally you find\nUsually a a three or four of the polls were probably one or two we're almost dead on and three or four were pretty close then you have the you know some of the outliers out there and we always bring that to you after a presidential\nElection but the polls actually do do a good reading in the ... there were a couple of polls that were dead on they didn't have Trump winning ... because they just do the popular vote they don't do the electoral vote\nBut they were dead on us to the vote mhm what Hillary won by what two percentage points first uh and so there were a couple of polls that were dead on but they didn't figure out the electoral college so they didn't figure out in those states in those particular states because they weren't doing the electro electoral college\nAnalysis right so uh but they had the the actual vote count\nWhich again we come to presidential elections from now on if the Democrats if a case you're Cortez doesn't succeed in getting rid of the electoral college in the Senate ah you know are we [laughter] we will will they started trying to figure out are doing more detailed analysis\nAnd ah because you've had a you know a a a Trump you know have this had this victory celebration\nIt'll be interesting to see what what happens there will go be going over some of the polls but yeah\nThe un says that we're doomed unless we pay the amount\nBy twenty Twenty one hundred ... two hundred and forty dollars\nTax on a gallon of gas okay\nBy Twenty one hundred no I Know I here's what I Will commit you I Am willing I\nI cannot speak my children grandchildren great grandchildren or anyone else in my family that as president now or will be present in the future I if I Am I live in a year Twenty one hundred\nWill will pay that tax you know it's going to happen no drew some scientist is totally totally gonna mess set up for me\nAnd we found a way to make your lives six hundred years oh yeah yeah yeah well I'm going out of all ... you might come up with a new energy form like the movie the St ... with ... well no see here's the thing by Twenty one hundred\nIf we're not transporting if we if if I\nCan't just sit there and then he had him up to something ... which are giving up and all but you're forgetting word it where does the energy come from robots to disassemble and the Adams of a person and then put them back together that's got to be\nYou know it may take the energy that that a nuclear bomb would create in order to do that for human beings we're assuming that the energy source\nIs there for beaming oh it is it can be tremendously because it may beaming may leave a huge carbon footprint or a black

are not meteorologist although John trout is with us of course every\nHour and we we look at that and but you wouldn't you read the discussions the the discussions changed drastically and those reports from the national Hurricane Center on Monday morning and they started to show signs of that and that ah Michael strengthening\nA and having potential to strengthen greatly late Sunday and Monday morning but then they saw there's apparently a sheer that's involved here that they said typically would mean that it's not going to be such a powerful storm but they said despite that share and I I read the ten pm central\nDiscussion on and it said it defies all logic\nThat the sheer still in place uh this this element essentially that would diminish the strength or keep the strength from growing I guess\nI'm despite that\nAnd they think maybe it's because of the size of the I thirty five miles by a\nIt is it is showing\nGreat potential for strengthening so for our friends there

that\nFor instance what what's what's your plan here\nI think a lot of it happening here we're changing our strategy around with a lot of time baseball and\nInside the beltway here we've had that kind of turn around there are various in Oregon either when Congress and I think that organizers operate differently if I can kind of strategy and what it is very about organized old [noise]\nAnd and really thinking about that word for it and I think that people should take an accent that we're in bringing together at their strategy of putting pressure on the shoulder to only focusing pressured and that's really interesting thought [laughter]\nIt is [laughter] [laughter]\nSo this was on social media over the weekend and you know what the response was\nFrom almost ... almost universal huh no

she's only going to be in a small district you're right because of her performance she isn't going to be right now the probably the leader of the Democrats until she gets in the Congress\nAnd she

oh what a Cheech not saying anything and and and I just was criticized on MSNBC oh that's very interesting you didn't study in ...\nIf I knew what it meant it would be more interesting yeah that's it is that uh you know just kind of\nLook ... if you look if you go back to the history\nOf ah of Brock Obama's political career who he was as a political operative and and there was a lot of jokes made about community organizer right\nBut the community organizer especially in the in the Chicago area oh it can mean and a number of things but politically it means getting people to the polls that's actually what it means um\nFor politically or for any area not just Chicago but getting people to the polls they they what they did is they grew that they nurtured that and they own that\nBetter than the Republicans did in fact the Republicans didn't know how to do it and two thousand eight and in two thousand twelve\nThey be Romney's team Romney was if you you and I were following the post debate polls the polls that happened right after the debates between Mitt Romney and Barack Obama President Obama at that time\nAnd the polls showed that Mitt Romney or on the issues landslide numbers even the exit polls yes and so massive massive numbers the difference was the organization guess what happened\nIn twenty sixteen the RMC had been working in the DNC didn't see this because they were busy with you know the whole fusion GPS some you know ... the Russians and all that [noise]\nAh but they are and see\nWhere they were putting their efforts was much like they in fact uh some say that as they designed it ah after that model of getting people to the polls that's what it's all about you can call it what you want but at the end of the day it is getting people to get out and vote\nAnd

a whole bunch of people are not just miss for them but also that a lot of folks in America who have to suffer from sexual assault\nSo that is the strategy that I've found appalling a Washington these past couple of months so all of the two parties who's more energized Brian going into their mid term so\nI think we have a horse race I think his neck and neck I think that's a real question uh for November is going to be ... independents fall so what's really interesting polling shows the independents are leaning ... ever so slightly rather to uh to Trump to the Republicans and this is especially\nWho has a man a white man Hispanic man and those folks who do not have a college education in other words that as the Trump coalition and so it's the fact that can happen that that's really the phone coalition coming home for November So really benzene these strategies that that they are Democrats employed has five [noise]\nYou know the eye and here's another thing that the women and and I've talked about there's five or six woman that I Know that I've been close to for a long long time ... all of them at least over a decade all professional women when I first met them ...\nAnd I'm as ten to Fifteen Years ago not that political the majority I think one in their mid to late thirties the other in their forties ... and fifties early fifties ...\nAnd all professionals okay all executives and professionals\nAnd when I first met them none of them really political and they knew that when I first met them that I was a talk show host and it was whole hog now when I talk to them total interest in what's going on in politics all of them over the course of ten to Fifteen Years\nNot because of my influence uh want to make that clear a are extremely conservative they\nAre a whole but not at the Republicans there appalled at the Democrats\nAnd so there is this mainstream media narrative that women naturally\nUh are attracted to the side of Dr Ford\nAnd feel sympathy and hate the Republicans for what has happened well the woman that I've talked to win again\nAh you know by ... explain you know what what their background is every one of them know the fact that Dianne Feinstein could've kept a secret they look at it and they said the Democrats lose across the board here the Democrats lose because they could have kept quiet that could have kept\nThat she was she claimed she want it now they're suspicious as to who's telling the truth here but they said even if you believe Dr Ford\nAnd that she really truly wish to keep it quiet\nThen the Democrats completely betrayed her Dianne Feinstein completely portrayed her\nBecause as he said and he's a democratic strategist\nBut Democrats had the chance to keep it all quiet to fulfill her wishes and still do an investigation and they said no we don't care about the woman who claimed she was sexually assaulted and wishes to have her anonymity we are going to use her\nAs a political football we say to that earlier\nAnd I'm sure there were Democrats standing down on a there's a democratic strategist saying the exact same thing that's what will hurt the Democrats is because that's what he as a Democrat believes that they have\nDone well and that's the damage that's his job is to assess essentially damage what works for them what doesn't work for them and it is not it did not work for them on any level but not only did you have that situation where they clearly leaked it to the media\nThen beyond that\nYou had the overreach with the two additional accusers coming forward and ultimately the nail on the proverbial coughing and that\nThe sweating the allegation that came across from her by the hands through her lawyer Avon adding that was not only overreach but it was clearly a tactic by Abernathy who clearly has it out for this current president\nSo I have to ask this question because you know after on on Saturday on on on Saturday when I heard it okay\nWe're going to you know where you're Jerrold Nadler okay if we take Congress are going to impeach we're going to impeach we're going to a beach we're going to impeach we're going to a beach and I thought that would die out because I thought to myself well that's a pretty bred by you know bad strategy you have lost in a variety of ways here I don't think this is a win for you\nSo why would you go out and attempt to motivate the right unless you believe you would motivate the left but still if you could impeach him you're not going to he's not going to leave\nYou know if the Supreme Court seat you would need to go to the Senate\nNow and this is the question\nI was asking does the house or the Democrats who believe that they would be part of the house leadership and that would be the head of the house Judiciary Committee\nA you know under under you know uh what would go on it if if the Democrats won a the the the house um\nAre they saying that because they believe that the people to both of them are idiots and they believe that they believe that impeachment means we can kick them off the seat or do they believe that this will just motivate their base and completely drop\nIt if they win that they have no intention of of going after impeachment\nHim they'll scream obstruction by the the Republicans that that we wanted to get it done but the Republicans wouldn't let us get it done 'em and that we still want to get it done a it is one of those campaign promises that is definitely going to fall short they're all over the outlook in this if they had the if they had the the\nThe majority of Republicans couldn't stop an investigation of ...\nNot an investigation the investigation may happen but it's not going to be an impeachment there's there's the thing is it's the promise\nUltimately what that you'll remove him from the bench and that and not only about half of that that's not going to have and what are you gonna do Dr Ford said she she's done are he doesn't want to be part of it are you going to subpoena all these women and bring them back again Dr so\nBad would be my question is democratic strategist are out there standing you've done damage to your own party drop this and you'll get because here's a question\nWhen you start moving in that direction how did you move in that direction and go through the entire process without learning who\nLeaked to the media is not going to tell you because they don't have to reveal their source but the investigation if you look at an investigation were would go and it will be public\nI mean there's nothing here in terms of classified material that is going to be in place this will be a very public investigation\nHow do you do that without revealing who leaked it and we know who leaked it so the problem is they don't want that on ... the Democrats who leaked it don't want it on record because that has to be a part of the\nProcess and just below sea as you said does she really want to see the second background checks from the FBI ... by the way you would a bunch of Republicans who saw it and said released to release it release it and they do it because they don't want to break protocol or the next judged by\nThe Republicans are saying we wish we could release this thing yeah it's an empty and this was an empty promise that isn't going to happen um they can hold their investigation they can call for the investigation they can hold their investigation\nMillion\nAttention all authors page publishing is looking for authors have you were in a book and want to get it published based publishing we'll get

I have not seen that\nChanging the only numbers change in terms of uh I guess dollars\nAre changing hands is the credit now you would have to go through of course a Congress to get those subsidies and everything else the president may say I will push for greater subsidies what is pushing for here on the surface really is selling more ethical\nWarm yeah it's it's\nSo it doesn't well it doesn't have a mandate attached to it and the oil companies don't\nCare about the credits [noise] they don't care about the credits that's not something that helps them get the government forces a mandate and that's what was being proposed the even President Trump has talked about the past raising the mandate right ... percent right\nWell if you do that that becomes a that becomes a big\nProblem politically ... outside of Iowa\nCould I just I've read like three different articles on it and that's what I thought it was was okay you're trying to please both sides but you're not really pleased anybody well because you're not mandating it the oil companies aren't going to do it ... it's not a mandate on it so you're simply saying I'm going to allow them I'm going to allow I'm going to allow the industry to do what the industry doesn't wish to do right and\nSell it year round well I think you're probably going to see push back ... first of all I guess we'd have to see what the participation rate is well once I won't be the largest cities like Houston in LA they don't want more smog\nWhat gas stations going to be the first to put want to put a Fifteen in when you know as well as I Do on the Internet is going to be fine you could damage your car you know a a a faster you could damage your lawn mower\nFaster if you're using Fifteen mhm right but it should just be ... percent should be the max and putting Fifteen Percent is is just ridiculous so nobody's going to do it\nSo it's just the way the president's just trying to appease people without doing anything\nIt's trying to appease the farm\nBut you can't get there from here because there is no great motivator there really is no incentive even with changing how the credits work even with changing because changing it to sell it year round out us had been the benefit those that are blending\nProtect your property be ready for the next hurricane to learn more call your local emergency management officer [noise]\n[noise] [noise] you are listening to read I wait on ... for use\nIn the sixties got what you actually\nTry to radio I'm hearing come along with their highly has our Fremont or run for helping us more efficiently as ... number one goal or friends in the panhandle and Big Bend area of Florida heaping a watchful eye on\nHurricane Michael in fact a ... Westwood One meteorologist John ... who joined us live right now good morning John and John\nGood morning guys so yeah we're looking at the possibility now of a major hurricane a a hurricane at the level three or above that's greater than one hundred ten miles an hour kidding [noise] uh in in about twenty four hours from now\nWhat's changed over I guess a late Sunday and into Monday the forecast seem to change and showed the potential for the energy increasing in my goal what what was it that we were looking at or I guess you guys when we're looking at a that showed that change\nYeah well one of the things that are well a couple of things so it will slow down a hurricane would be a wind shear we don't have that one of the things that will slow down a hurricane would be\nColder ocean temperatures we don't have that or lessening of low pressure none of the none of the data that we'd like to see that we'll see uh lessening of strength is a is a part of it is protected her forecasts now\nSo uh that's where we are getting this rapid intensification as we move from a category one to a major category ... storm\nJohn where do you see at hitting on the Florida Panhandle cause most\nLike talking about yeah we're talking about the Big Bend area somewhere between the\nAppalachian coal at which was down on a state road Ninety eight over to um oh just north of saint Petersburg let's say but we are going to see some road closures definitely guys will see I ten affected from Pensacola to Tallahassee we could see sessions or by Seventy five shut down the right to in the Georgia or Florida line\nArea so are truckers are going to play an important role in this thing getting supplies in and out of the region there'll be needs for diesel fuel and some rebuilding efforts you know with Florence we talked about the reign of and this will be a rain event\nAnd a wind event\nUh we're looking at the possibility of up to twelve inches of rain all within less than twenty four hour period of time in that Big Bend area\nWhat about storm surge what is the threat there\n[noise] big time we're looking at a storm surge and a wave heights Senate around the a five to twelve foot range where it's a a major category ... storm so that's going to\nHave its impact certainly coastal erosion will see folks with a coastal interests are with the maritime industry and folks with homes along the return affected so will definitely see some storm surge effect and I don't believe we have a full moon right now but if we did that\nWould increase the likelihood of being under a higher tide certainly inundation being greater\nThan this uh Michael's moving quicker than Florence it's a fast moving hurricane\nYes just slightly faster so it's expected to a move into that area and make landfall as I mentioned in the Big Bend area we're looking right now about eight to nine o'clock tomorrow morning [noise] and um [noise]\nOr just a hope that everyone hates the warnings we've got several I mean we're talking thirty six counties I think now under a some sort of a advisory either get out or get ready to get out and of course the state of Florida it's been under the state of emergency now for uh about twenty four hours\nAs we look forward to later in the week we mentioned Florence our friends still in recovery mode after Florence what can they expect in terms of rainfall that might affect him later this week\nYeah we'll see this system move right\nOn up through Georgia and and then into portions of South Carolina\nAnd particularly southern uh North Carolina so not good news for folks trying to dry out in ... sat area from South Carolina into North Carolina uh we'll see not the twelve inches but certainly between three and five inches of rain but we got to remember\nThose those are creeks and rivers are slalom there the ground is already saturated so any amount of water\nNot good for the Carolinas\nWestwood One meteorologist drawn trout thank you so

in global tropical cycling frequency\nOver the past century and Mr lumber said we're seeing an increase in hurricane costs because we hear that all the time for global warming I mean look at the hurricane costs hurricane costs are more than they've ever been before ... he says we are seeing an increase in hurricane cause\nNot because of climate change but because more people with more well living in harm's way and\nNoting that the U.S population rose four fold over the past\nCentury he said he climbed fifteenth fold in coastal areas\nThe areas hit by Hurricane Florence has fewer than eight hundred thousand homes in Nineteen forty now eleven point three million a one thousand three hundred and twenty five percent increase homes are bigger now and they all many more expensive possessions adjusted for population and well\nUs hurricane damage has not increased since Nineteen hundred global whether damage as a percent of global GDP actually fell from Nineteen hundred to twenty Seventeen\n\nSo and I always like I said I like going to him because he is somebody who believes he can quantify but he says he believes that that global warming is happening and man has you know something to do with it but doesn't know\nYou know what percentage but he's as you said you can't stop the economy's\nYou can't put people into mass of poverty you can't do these insane things but the left is is they need to do people have to have a quality of life somewhat shipped to do is you have to prevent you gotta you gotta do the preventative things\nThat you need to be doing but everything that the left his too when he criticizes as being absolutely ridiculous [noise] well and and that's again the proposals over\nThe years have been a remember the former governor of Oregon's saying we need to or a centrally a decrease the economy\nAnd I forget what the number was but it was interesting that the thirteenth ... like I wouldn't want to entertain right I thought it was right on that but I was thinking Thirteen and and so\nIf you looked at that you're talking about effectively starving people in third world nations because if you if you are going to do this for the United states it would have to be globally\nWell you do that globally and you you think about where the supply chain in terms of food the most important item in any supply chain to third world nations\nYou look at the breakdown of that not the supply chain itself logistically but the supplies the content within that supply chain diminished greatly that the insanity\nThat is the insanity that they're proposing the fact of the matter is when you have people who are willing to have a um intellectually honest discussion about it are you and I said\nI'm we\nDon't need to be at the table how about the scientists that are on both sides of this have the discussion\nBut the ... the problem with that as the politically driven the very motivated politically driven agenda inside of that to the extent that Al Gore by the way\nWhy in the world will see telling the UN and why why is anyone even listening to Al Gore who admitted back in two thousand ten that he lied about ethanol as we try this altogether\nA it's a it just to read a couple more sentences or from Carolina ... a a coat Carolina\nCoast online dot com uh and it's an article a rich and storms worse and a and a talking about the Washington Post saying that the president President Trump is complicit and and he's and he said you're studying uh twenty six team in the Stanford law review that said\nWe call an excuse me in the September fifteenth and sixteenth Wall Street\nWeekend edition columnist Holleman Jenkins we quoted him a lot and contrasted an archaeological study of the first century a de Germans who raised dwelling mounds and built dikes in response to rising sea in storm blood levels\nAnd compare to what the us response of rushing him with federal dollars to rebuild so the next storm will always have something bigger and more expensive to knock down ... studying and twenty six team studying the Stanford law review that said we call weather related catastrophes natural natural disasters but the losses are often do to questionable government policies\nHe said Congress struggled for years to reform the national flood insurance program\nAnd has turned it into a perverse subsidies for coastal development\nHe quoted Bob sheets then head of the national Hurricane Center saint after Nineteen Seventy nine hurricane Frederick\nIt was like an urban renewal program out there he said that the uh twenty Fifteen a A R worldwide and insurance consultancy said climate change it's not climate change but the growing number and value of coastal properties as the largest factor impacting hurricane whereas today a whopping seventeenth trillion\nAnd property now exists inside the U.S storm surge zone where Al Gore when you need me continued All right the climate change crowd has become enamored\nOf coastal development because it creates a constituency for doing something about climate change\nWell not exactly for doing something about climate change but for throwing more money at coastal dwellers and calling them victims of climate change for the benefit of generating media coverage of climate politics yeah wow yeah no that's a more genius way ... altogether\nBecause think about what that what what is done\nYou know if you if you look at that and and that's that's what happens if if you look at those you know the the wealth that was created um and is very much display their on those coasts\nWith people that have the homes and I mean if you've got a beach house think about the value of a beach house right but that would be now think about what it takes to replace that right\nNot just insurance but then there has to come after the insurance there has to come public aid inevitably well\nThe left has used that are and the emotion behind that because who doesn't want to help\nWild than it is okay this is because this is happening because of climate change and so not only will we again continue the public aid that's not going to go away but on the other side of that\nIs to poor public money into and tax greatly\nThe American people based on the theory of man made climate change which is to say\nOh I don't know we'll start with forty or fifty bucks a gallon tax will start with and that that that won't be the end of the tax I mean if you if you look at it there'll be tax and this is why they wanted you know a vat tax it's not necessarily because of climate change\nIt's because you can you can implement the taxation levels before the retail level it becomes a compounding tax like the vat tax this is the kind of policy that they want until you have essentially\nTax the poor especially and the middle class because those are the groups that are affected immediately and greatest then they become what even more dependent on government\nAnd they called go home and drink and some of the wall Street Journal here factoring in social economic demographics of the population on the Atlantic and Gulf Coast said Mr lumber damaged by future hurricanes will only increase because the population is greater\nAnd wealthier men there may be more deaths sane vulnerability is the main hurricane problem facing the United states we should not allow so many houses to be built on flood plains or coastlines\nWe should insist on higher building standards and increase wetlands to handle flooding we should stop federal insurance subsidies that encourage building\nIn vulnerable areas and magazine that every news site in cable news channel will be promoting heroin and heroic stories about Hurricane Florence\nMr home and said major storms have become advance\nThey afford great footage which feeds of fall sensation viewers at storms have become more frequent and more powerful meanwhile tragedies befall Americans every day for which the federal government has not shower them with they because CNN is not present\nHe might also have said connecting extreme weather the climate change to encourage carbon reduction is today's falls mantra declaring practical steps towards living rationally\nA A R possible he said they could begin with Congress qualifying for the American people how much they're forking over annually to entice fellow citizens to live near the beach uh\n[laughter] so um\nI just you know interesting the actual politics of it but you know and and we will probably you know here it again after a hurricane Michael ... a

so I don't even read the headline yeah and so I don't know I don't even know what's going on with them even though I Know something is going on with I have no idea okay I've seen the pictures I notice hairs longer these days and so on\nAh the the the only thing I Do know that like over the weekend if you weren't talking the capital nomination ... ah on social media at least the women I Know it was all a star is born\nThere were all Gaga over Gaga oh yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah and then he had almost a UFC fight we're\nBut out of control in the fight and everything else that was All right I didn't

into my world or yeah just I I did see some of the thing it was a ten second\nClip that involved a in the ring after fight\nYes question by Joe Rogan and I can't repeat the answer [laughter]\nBut there are other things that that we've gotten emails on ... a a lot of people very very concerned a lot of our listeners who are very concerned saying you know whoa\nWhat's going on with the Pfizer worn thing it just disappeared what happened and what we did covered a couple of times nudge you know over the last\nCouple of weeks but just to just to go over it again so everybody knows and maybe do it in a little bit more detail here where we can spend a little bit more time on it\nUh the the president uh was going to declassify a Twenty one pages including the\nPies application and at the last minute before releasing it he decided not to and he didn't release it because he said\nUh there were some of our allies to did not wish us to\nRelease it so he wasn't going to do and yet when we rented we thought OK they what are they trying to do figure out of some of the classified information should stay out\nYou know ... or a should then they need to read back more and that's was I think our original thought\n... and then the president said I'm going to give it to further review to the inspector general of the department of justice Michael Horowitz but we immediately said wait a minute and even ... it's like the day after said you know I don't know why they won't release it\nAnd then we thought to ourselves well wait a minute and this is the least covered story in America right now I think ... the least\nLast time I read I read her radio exclusively [laughter] he does a covered but possibly the most important\nIn all of this over the last two years is that the president\nBecause he said and we were in and what a couple of stories said it was Great Britain because of Christopher steals involvement in it but some of our allies did not want us to\nA release sitting there were a couple of other things that needed to go over so he was going to give it to the inspector general for further review now we were initially for the first day little dumbfounded gold and couldn't understand why it was going to him\nAnd on the air this is going back ten or eleven days but as you and I were discussing why would they go to the inspector general and all the sudden it was Doug\nThat's the role of the inspector general's to do what is to investigate corruption there you ... the you don't give it to the inspector general to save review this and tell me what I can release and what I can uh you know what I can ...\nYou eat that for that you use\nYour a director of national intelligence ear CIA director uh your your uh a secretary of state it was a former CIA director those are the people you would go to for the for for that maybe your national security director and but you know good to secretary of defense\nThose are the people you would go to ... to ... to decide at least in my opinion whether you should declassify it or not and I say you're a secretary of state former CIA director because they claim that's some allies\nUh didn't want some things to be released and our initial thing was wait a minute what are the allies no they don't know what's in their right how how do they know that the\nAnd we were initially puzzled when he said he was going to give it to ah the inspector General Michael Horowitz until we realize\nThey were they unwritten pact that it and went low look at\nThis but yeah the conclusion we came to was that if you're looking if you're looking to give this to the inspector general the apartment of justice than you're basically asking him to do an investigation and to issue a report they said they ... they asked for an expedited\nDid you know that studies have shown that almost two and a half million truck drivers in the U.S have one or more serious health problems such as obesity diabetes heart disease even

at the latest in the national Hurricane Center from one am central or two am eastern uh this morning for hurricane Michael\nA maximum sustained wins at the Knight Ninety miles per hour moment north northwest at twelve miles per hour still expected to hit\nA the panhandle of close to ... of Florida right now as a a hurricane strength or three over a hundred and ten mile an hour winds uh and probably some time uh eight nine ten am tomorrow morning\nAs what they're talking about a Wednesday morning yeah\nSo uh it's a there are a number of things here ah that we're following of course on uh the the locals and the officials ah they're all all along uh the Big Bend area of the Florida a Gulf Coast\nAre and what's going on plenty of uh of of information are pouring out of that area\nBut also by the updates from the national Hurricane Center another update on the way in less than twenty five minutes and we'll bring you the latest as we get at our meteorologist or John trout is on that story of course we'll be following the storm\nOr in the coming days so I'm again our advice ... please heed the warnings of follow the advice send instructions by\nLocal authorities in state authorities there in Florida as this is a very dangerous storm life threatening and terms of ah all elements of this storm storm surge flooding from rains\nAnd wins a all combined as you expecting over twelve inches in those areas where the where the hurricane when it moves overland direct yeah yes and and\nAnd and then later in the week bringing a\nBurger some rain that they don't need to areas that are still recovering from from Florence because the ground as John pointed out earlier John trout\nAre pointed out earlier that it is already saturated there in those areas that were affected by Florence\nAnd any rain or is just going to create problems so uh not just over the next twenty four to thirty six hours but of course as Michael moves inland more a flooding and other threats along a that a storm path\nOr will certainly be something that people need to pay attention to\nA head of Michael's landing a\nKnow you and I talked about yesterday which was like wow\nA after this\nOh for the last really over two weeks of the judge a cabin on the the hearings and and the the ... the confirmation and everything\nThat has gone on the ... all the different to the allegations all of a sudden we got to Monday yesterday and I woke up and it was there is nothing\nIt was almost like a big exhale where it's like okay and where do we go next we need a day to figure out where to the news goes because it wasn't really a big Newsday fried of a a yesterday and it's when I came to the thought where I said\nWhat's the issue for Democrats with everything that you and I discussed over the last two years\nI actually woke up yesterday thinking what are the Democrats have but what are they going to you besides impeachment you know what is your what is the issue thinking about is there and we went through\nAnd and even just just before we got to the cabinet nomination it was still know Mahler investigation\nTrump illusion you and I I I remember ah the ah\nThe was it the the the Thursday or the ... the Thursday or the friday when when Chuck Todd said you'd better not miss work tomorrow that had to be like what was\nThat ... right around Labor Day yeah it was the friday headed by into Labor Day weekend and and that was because you know Mueller's going to let the investigation nobody's even talking about watching collusion now it's done on anybody's radar it seems like that was\nTen years ago and that's how fast the the cycle has has moved you know what is on people's minds and so when I woke up yesterday I started thinking\nWhat are Democrats thinking the issue is what's the issue that they can go after Trump out what's the issue that will even grab\nDemocrats right now to say oh yeah okay that's the issue you and I talked about the fact that the un coming out and saying OK it's time for our annual we're doomed to update because of global warming and we're thinking of the Democrat's gonna jump on that they've been jumping on that\nSince the beginning of the Obama administration\nThat and raised on a consistent basis and so I was looking at your earlier and saying I'm waiting for the race baiting to start some time by the end of the week\nBecause it's been their old standby says what they've always used to even though at the same time the American people have said we don't care yeah we don't believe those are the top issues we don't believe race relations or the top issue we believe we get along with each other really well\nUh you folks in Washington may not and you people that belong to certain groups\nOr or you know a ... or may not but for the most part we get along and global warming bump you haven't made your case to the vast majority of America let me go get a burger\nIs I mean seriously that's words that but you know and we ... we actually state of during the Obama administration I'll never forget it where we said are they doing this on purpose", "show_name": "Red Eye Radio", "year": "2018", "city":
