I don't remember the goose being in the movie but the ... movie I think so\nIs the the it's a wonderful scene what simple enough our our ... our ... our two heroes of steel goes from a massive dog who wants to kill them or stop them from stealing that goes but they get away and they spent all night cooking at\nA they enjoy it they they're fell and then they take what's left over to a friend of

the war is not going to and they didn't know that at the time I understand that Goldsworthy believe that a generation had been wiped out not ... not necessarily just his generation alone because he was an older man when he went to the front\nI think he he was in his near fifty when he was there but the James handily piece I'll set the scene it's two men\nCome working class one Irishman one Englishman are in a shell hole and they're surrounded by a fog they don't know where they are they can't get out and suddenly a very young and frightened German soldier surrenders to them comrade\nAnd they grow angry with them and they grow enraged with him and they murder him in the course of the short story\nAnd it's a scene that could be on stage that's how I saw this as if it more as a one act play a off Broadway in New York or\nIn the east ... in London but the horror of it is that these men are driven mad by the fact that they are doomed to end soon enough they die too and I felt like I was reading the first war the second war the Korean War the Vietnam War it felt timeless how did it to you when you first came on at the\n[noise] well I mean obviously it has a very sort of on the ground existence and it's you know it's been out of print it was occasionally it's reprinted I found it in a very shocking and I mean to\nYou know I'm not surprised that\nYou know it it it hasn't been available and it's something which you know given what we know about you know was today and soldiers and ... and everything it's obviously a behavior which is actually you know to Familia\n... war the war is madness and the behavior is not is is Savage Savage says ... and and and the ... itself is self despairing because it's aware that it if they have they have ... they have knowledge of that they've gone too far and they don't want to but they they don't want to die either it's awful\nBut there's also I mean as a sort of like quality of the dialogue it's very it's so much to rail um

they're dancing around them\nI this is John Goldsworthy of the foresight Sacco who I'd always I'd always regarded him as a nineteenth century Victorian class to class conscious a satirist and this is as grueling I'll read as I've ever had about war how did it strike you\nKnow I agree with you always go into it wasn't a I mean\nYou know I just read his writing I mean you know he did write quite a lot on the wall and he was very very involved in you know campaigning against it off to it so [noise] you know I was interested to read it and\nDid it feel like he'd had a a complete change of heart from the foresight saga there's nothing of this ... there\n[noise] you know I agree but also I mean he obviously you know it\nWas [noise] he was you know cool job and that sort of you know hatred in the ocean you know the time I mean I think [noise] you know it's it's difficult to sort of last year and you know the sort of passionate feelings that people had on either side of you know at the end of the war\nI Wonder if he had the weight to push back I don't know he died in Nineteen thirty two and then he won the Nobel Prize for literature Nineteen thirty two and he died soon afterwards but he

that have to point which has an elevation of about Seventy five hundred feet the one clear where the pier fell and from what sport\nA a a a ice says they belong Larry the cable guy or alerted the cable guy right I think it was something just to to throw them off ... so we are getting all these different stories and meanwhile all day yesterday my question is\nWhere they live bombs where they ready to go walk right not rise that makes that makes a difference if you're giving out all this other information all this other information is being leak\nOut there why isn't anyone why ... why isn't any media outlet\nI'm really insistent in asking those questions for me it was quite frustrating yesterday and then uh it was a was busy a lot of the day or a yesterday and and went to sleep in and woke up late\nAnd when I woke up late that's the first thing I saw like five hours I woke up right just about two hours ago and and as soon as I woke up I just you know but okay there's got to be the new story out there whether was alive bomb or not and the same thing\nLike wait a minute this is now four days since the first you know since the first bomb right you know what what is it why can't why can't we get a straight answer when you when you talk about Austin\nAustin a bomb went off mhm so at that point you knew that they were allied bombing here no bomb has gone off to the question would have just\nPublic safety or public knowledge are the bombs live or not and still referring to them as you know suspected or you know the devices potentially dangerous devices potentially dangerous devices that are you know that are dangerous mhm well why would they be dangerous does that mean because this will be the question I Would have\nDoes that mean that some contain gunpowder\nRight et cetera and taking an explosive device but there was no detonator in them right so they would be a potentially suspected of you know a bomb a with a you know explosive material but the explosive material\nWasn't going to go off into balls into danger to anybody unless you took a match and put it to the gunpowder right right\nYeah just simply by handling the package itself it wouldn't be necessarily a dangerous in the way that a live bomb would be but but but again ah you know that this is something where you know not not hearing at all\nAh it has been and and there's nothing wrong with an over abundance of caution by anyone and you know in the scenario except for the fact that\nYou don't have something for I guess the the public if they were armed or those bombs were ready to go off in transit\nThat's something I think that would be warnings all over from authorities saying that new wherever you might be anyone could potentially and counter one of these devices\nAnd that kind of warning I'm not I'm not hearing\nSo when you get to the press coverage of calling them bombs yeah which is you know if the Saudis have not said that they were alive bombs why are we calling them bombs right what is the purpose of of doing that is that accurate reporting if they are not bombs were telling you in real time the frustration that we have right\nRight and we think it's important to point out the frustration unless there's a reason for\nYou know unless there's eight investigative reason for for doing so accept the fact is the people that are the person or people that mail the bomb they know whether they were alive or not and they know the authorities are already know right so what what would be the investigative purpose for doing it is beyond the\nIs is beyond me and so when I finally saw some frustration because it got to be a little frustrating yesterday when you're trying to figure it out or they live bombs or not and\nWould they have gone off was it just some explosive material but they wouldn't have gone off right because that that one of the reasons that look the leaks are happening they give out information because you see it all over the place I saw the the the ... people were tweeting it if you know anything about it\nAnd now here's some of the information some of the information we believe you know it's it's the authorities now are being directed to Florida will links come out for reason\nLeaks from investigative agencies come out for a reason so why are all these other things linking and being told all the public by the media but not the one question that I think most people would want to know with with what are they live where they live or where they not lie bomb right right\n\nSo there is are we are so we'll get to that the more that coming up here or Chelsea Clinton I'd consider running for office\nMhm I just had to throw that in there yeah it's a friday why not\nAnybody shocked no\nWell you know she has experience that NBC so\n[laughter] [noise] who was it who\nWasn't on NBC I Can't remember who was the I think it was Brian Williams was it Brian Williams okay she's well traveled\nThat's how he described it for ... ... the you mean she's been on a plane I'd then was the first daughter of course she's well traveled anyone I Will never forget him that night we I Know we played it on the air\nThat that was just unbelievable yeah it was like gushing over the fact right the Chelsea Clinton was not working for NBC ...\nAnd they do that when women when George Bush's daughter went to work for NBC not so much there there are a couple of articles you know but yeah but but not ... you're doing is what I was referring to ... you can pause the news as white as that and it's like okay we'll let her in for now\n[laughter] I did a great job but it's like Megan Kelly exits stage left but once the entire contract and I looked at you and I during an appreciable meeting and said and does it seem like that NBC went\nOh wait a minute oh\nWe can make this cause they're not ... she's already making too much for what she hasn't made that kind of money she hasn't pulled in that kind of revenue yeah or so this is an opportunity to get rid of her now right well because\nThe ratings I'm I'm guessing weren't stellar\nUm\nAnd ... and if any good excuse right ah yeah we're going to let you go\nSo uh Megan Kelly and who knows will she be back on friday but it looks like she's going to be off the air for at least a while and she lost so here's here's how it went down she made the blackface comment I I don't know when that was Monday or Tuesday and then by Wednesday she had lost her\nAgent yes they parted ways and now it's basically it looks like there won't be any any you know coming back to to say goodbye or or sign off or anything else that looks like it's pretty much done\nAnd you're wondering you you just wonder okay that was the old saying that escalated quickly um she came out on Wednesday\nAnd did some kind of apology\nAnd they said the audience you know that was their gave her a standing ovation I I'm not sure why an apology ... deserves a standing ovation [laughter]\n[laughter] it's not like some kind of great performance that social side of the ... well yeah yeah\nUh but they gave her a standing ovation uh and then later on that day and just kind of went down from there and that's when the agency that she was with the atomic agency\nUndecided apart ways whether there was some celebrities that we're going to appear on the show that after the comments on black face they weren't going to appear and they decided you know the cancelled so ah\nAnd but that likely comes down to the fact that the ratings weren't great\nYou know it's just the worst things anybody has ever said ah\nNo but ... ask Roseanne Barr how much you have to say ... probably Roseanne Barr\nThat situation was much more serious in terms of of how it was viewed in Hollywood than what Megan Kelly said I I don't know I ... I don't know I might do it was my two conspiracy\nTheories and that once you know initially they weren't going to initially they weren't going to fire that wasn't in their plans for ... initially just for that for what she said they weren't going to do it as you said in our personal meaning you figured out it's\nJust better till after Halloween see I come back after Halloween but but then they went on wait a minute hold it she's not producing their own weight a mental rating we can get out of his contract we can we filed one of the lawyer said you know this could be causing if we get it for cause we don't have to pay off her contract\nThat's one side of it the other side of it as my other conspiracy theories making Kelly was thinking I don't want to be doing this is just totally sucks\nBut I Want to be able to collect my contract let me say something that's maybe a little bit controversial but not far enough for them to justify all the fire me for cause [laughter]\nWell I mean and if they try I can still collect here's the difference\nMegan Kelly saying that on her own show on Fox News would have just been another night of making ...\nYou wouldn't have heard complaints I made the I mean on social media you would've yes but it wouldn't have been treated the same\nI mean she may have had to follow up and say you know hey that's not what I meant it's not okay or whatever but it wouldn't have been what it is that NBC for a morning show there's a big difference and and and the type of a audience that you have there\nSo who knows what will happen but ah yeah maybe maybe it was amicable by both party\nComing up Chuck Grassley\nOr in Michael I have an empty and Julie sweat next to the department of justice for possible criminal action ... for making false statements about cabinet shop ... that would be interesting to see where that goes yeah the progress of the care of an eight hundred troops will be heading apparently to the border will get to that\nI'm only a for instance na\nAttention all authors page publishing is looking for authors have you written a book and want to get it published these publishing we'll get your book into bookstores and for sale on line at Amazon apple I do in other outlets they handle all aspects of the publishing process for you [laughter]\nPrinting ... publicity copyright an editing ... eight hundred times or one thirty six eighty nine now for your free authors who should get that seat under advisor or one thirty six eighty nine for your free author certainly should get again eight hundred buys zero one thirty six eighty nine\nI used to post the job boards that send me tons of resumes to find a few people who are right from my job federal process was not smart then I went to their pictures\nTaken out you can find the right people can actively invite them to apply so I get qualified candidates Martin\n... three number one by employees in the U.S try it out for free it's different ... dot com slash free met difficulty dot com slash free hip recruiter sway the higher the reading of hiring liberal [noise]\nFirst openly gay years ago [noise]\nWere small just a few of us what it was exciting [noise]\nI always dreamed of having my own business [noise]\nIt's kind of slow at first but things started picking up in the plant but in our wildest dreams we never never thought we'd have as much work with so many businesses cut off guard by the storm\nReid waste management has never been this year\nWill be kind of your business after his after\nNearly two thirds of businesses aren't prepared for an emergency and forty percent of businesses that experience that comes after an author recover make an emergency plan now before it's too late for a free online tool to help she developed an emergency plan to keep your business up and running should give that to try and\nGet ready for word flashed business brought here by the federal emergency management agency the American Red Cross and yeah camp [noise] sixty\nMrs show live anywhere at any time on demand to catch up on Eric and Gary's topics of the day but it read I radio show dot com and click on demand batch red eye radio show ...\nI'm here with a unit royal truck tires engineer to talk about the unit royal LD can drive retire\nYet the long lasting L.

borrowed right which is and we mentioned this uh in the last segment\nThat we've heard explosive material and we heard a pipe bomb so ten below dangerous potentially explosive devices a but we haven't heard actually lied bombs and so we're we're that's the question that we uh are asking that would they him\nAt all and from what we know all ten\nOf the explosive devices ... went to the u._s. postal

have gone off at any time or where they just ... did you have some explosive materials but they would have never detonated unless they might have been in a fire right\nUh and so those are the questions to understand the motivation of the person who is sending it that's why you like to get to that point now four days into this and we still don't know whether they were alive bombs are

unattended packages at the time Warner center was a false alarm correspondent McGill Marquez was in the building Thursday night when it was a backyard there were\nTwo small boxes found on the third floor of the mall\nCouldn't account for them nobody knew exactly what they were doing there so out of another mom didn't some caution cleared out the mall within minutes and wipe Haiti had asked

investigator show the slang was planned contradicting an earlier Saudi assertion that rogue officials from the kingdom kill them by mistake in the anthem boat consulate\nAnd should she be a part of the campaign for ... ... ... right [laughter]\nInteresting question what do ... do you remember these are all Democrats right so you might not agree with everything that they are saying uh but uh this is this is about Hillary Clinton and here are just a moment of the the panel\nShells hand how many of these think overall Hillary Clinton is more of a liability than an asset to the gallon campaign\nThat six out of the southern people's Alabama pass\nHenry Clinton is seen as kind of fair that they write rails again they go to rallies and they say lock her up\nClinton a rallying point for the right ... may use that messaging against Hillary Clinton drive out their vote so I think you could end up seeing a huge boost in their numbers because you you you have Hillary Clinton now and the other side being associated Gillum so close what concerns\nAbout the baggage and scandals that she was associated with 'em and how that might impact to get on the campaign her\nHer post presidential sort of\nYou know demeanor platform is a very sort of self indulgent and very much about re litigating what happened in twenty sixteen and our generation my generation doesn't really respond to you know this ... he's sixteen and I want to call whining but like at this point is kind of what it feels like\nI Am concerned and on that hey you know part of town he he now that we're going forward progress movements progressive policies and looking ahead and I think he represents an old Democratic Party\nDoes anyone think that Hillary Clinton can be helpful to the gallon campaign hiking I think she can be financially helpful because she has a history as fabulous fundraising [noise] and I think that's where she should\nAs far as I Know what we now we can and making speeches for me so I don't think so\nWhen it hits the typically saying that how might Hillary Clinton harming the gallon campaign [noise]\nHis\n[noise] ... ... people don't trust her family and I think reality is I voted for her [noise] um I supported her but\nShe does things that\nShe kept out for herself and she makes a big sakes Hillary Clinton so there you go [laughter]\nSo what you're saying is she probably shouldn't\nRun in twenty [laughter] forget about Gillum we're clear on that what about twenty twenty\nYou know because here's the thing you know the bubble that the Clintons have always lived in ... many people living inside the beltway or than side of\nThe chapel club beltway um the\n... they they when they when they go on the\nYou know a speech tour or\nYou know um if they if they go out and just do some rallies right\nIt is the case for any of them right or left that those rallies are filled with Friendly's for the most part I mean except for outside on the sidewalk they're filled with friendly\nIn other words the Clintons have been surrounded by people who have been telling them they're the greatest for a long long time when you step outside of that new step away from it a bit I think Hillary got some of this even when she was running in twenty sixteen remember the reporters that approached her\nDuring that campaign season and started asking questions about bill then they had to pretty much at that point Debbie Wasserman Schultz was hiding Hillary [laughter] where's Hillary was the question\nAnd you ... ... ... they had to create that well they had to build a wall around Hillary so that they you know she was not approachable\nSo she's been told by a lot of people oh you should run again you should run again you should run again\nBut it really will be their own internal that will tell them you know our millennials on board\nNow that's a very different question as to whether or not she should go on and endorse or she could she helped Gillum or any other candidate right now in the left\nIt is a very different question in terms of what she run or or should she run or would you vote for her and twenty twenty many of those same people that just criticized for maybe a few of them might vote for her\nBut I don't know that for sure because by the time we get to twenty twenty I don't know that you're millennials going to look at that and go yeah she's just not the ... and we need somebody new and fresher gentleman besides her\nJust you know because I was actually watching the the the video over here so you didn't have access you weren't looking at the video but the woman who said\nThat she should be there just for fundraising and she was older I'm going to get she yeah she was fifty plus I'm guessing she was the same woman a who said we don't trust her threat that she's not trustworthy and that's interesting because that somebody who is experience Hillary Clinton\nThe other two were younger there they were probably in their thirties so they probably don't go all the way back to\nAs many of us do Hillary Clinton and Hillary care way back when\nWhen uh you know she was in charge of of putting together a you know some type of single payer health care system\nIn America in the early nineties uh\nSo I thought that was really interesting she can raise money but then we don't want to hear from or we don't want to emerge around we don't want her people don't ... people don't trust her and what she means as Democrats don't trust her she didn't trust her right and I found that just to be I found that\nTo be really really really interesting one other point that I Want to make here because we hear this all the time and we've addressed it before but it came up again the media this week is at Trump's rallies when they talk about Hillary in lock her up\nBut that is it that's it you know instability that that is look you're talking about a political rally and you're also talking about you know why why are they saying lock her up you have to go back to you know what's it about just because she exist\nAnd she opposed to lock her up no that goes back to what that goes back to the whole email scandal where people can identify what the crime was you can look at the law and say this is a\nCrime that she broke and many other people who did this anybody else who did this any normal person who allowed top secrets you know to be so accessible and broke the law and she did would end up in jail that's what that's based on not just based on the\nOn what the left is attempting to portray as just pure instability they don't like her so they want to put her in jail no it's based on her behavior what she did and the fact that Republicans have looked at it and send him and many have looked at it\nEven not just Republicans conservatives with other libertarians and say she broke the law right she put the server in her house that's breaking the law she knew that people were going to have you know at that at that level as secretary of state that every foreign government is every\nUh unfriendly and probably primarily foreign government is looking to tap into anything they possibly can to find out what you're doing as secretary of state by you know doing that\nUnfriendly is where we were able to get into some of our top secret you knew it and you did it so you could hide emails from the freedom of Information Act that's a crime yup there's two crimes they're the Espionage Act and trying to avoid the freedom of Information Act that's what it's about now you might say\nWell but she never went to court it doesn't take away the fact that nobody disagrees with what the law is or what she actually did well it's\nDifferent than the chance by Rosie O'Donnell on the white or in front of the White House you know that is based on\nNothing it's based on fall so it's you know saying that this the current president is an agent of the of of Russia a and that and you know again implying\nThat and saying in some cases that he got there or to the White House illegally and the ... in the case of lock her up it's based on a crime\nBut nobody debates was broken by her\nThat that was a law that was broken by her a crime that was committed we know it we can point to it now again it is rhetoric is if the people what they're what the point that they're making is she shouldn't be in jail she's not above the law\nRight and it's also the fact that the system you know lock her up is also an attack of the system and the and the department of justice at that time run for not following the law right\nSo that isn't that isn't a again the same as in any way justifying violence and that's what is\nBeing portrayed I just wanted to hit that 'cause we'd hit that before when when the uh the you know they were being criticized at the rallies were saying that\nAnd when you would read the articles that would say it was horrible they they didn't even understand what the point was that even know why the people were saying it right they didn't even a dress that particular point so if you just hear lock her up lock her up and you have no clue as the majority of Americans don't understand the constitution if you have no clue what happened\nIn twenty sixteen and it's a millennial said we don't even care about that\nFight anymore well then you look at it and so yeah\nOr what they're saying

the hour and it was you know when we were talking a ... from an earlier conversation and talking about but you know the heated rhetoric of you know calling a Trump Hitler that you know and and going back because we brought this up months and months and months ago\nI I don't even know it might have been after the school shooting much I'm not really sure but we'll ... talked about look heated rhetoric out there and what it means you know what you're communicating now we've never been one that have drawn the heated rhetoric\nAnd blame the people have heated rhetoric for somebody resolve and kill somebody wouldn't blame Bernie Sanders or anybody else no when ... after the ... shooting we didn't we didn't do that but uh we brought up you know just\nHow inflammatory that kind of rhetoric is because what you're saying is Trump is the same as a guy who committed you know a genocide of\nSix million Jews ... which of course is just the most bizarre statement you can never make and the only reason you do that is to inflame a rage\nIn people that's why you do it ... because you believe that they'll actually by that and they'll be in theory aided or with it and then you've gotta\nYou've completed the brainwashing by doing that you and I remember that during the Obama administration you brought this up uh uh to me just now when he was being called dictator right we had to get on the air and said guys stop that right went on the issues is not a dictator he won he won\nHe was voted in by the people the United states conservatives and Republicans might have gone to distasteful but he's not a dictator\nAnd they would talk about the you know the the the idea of right the idea of\nA him acting you know again using the egg executive Penn instead of going to Congress every president

we shouldn't have the ... like they may every excuse in the book it was the Russians\nAre we got to get rid of the electoral college that's the problem um the uh the the majority of the people didn't vote for him what if this is what it comes down to this is the process we have in place we have it for a reason and we respect the constitution\nAnd that process but I think it's very important as we've talked about before for\nA ... and we we spent quite a bit of time on this this week is for us not to be that don't argue like them right\nRight they have lost because of the way that they have

remember when uh we would sit here Obama's Muslim and we said where's the evidence right\nWell his father now where's the evidence that that's what he believes in if you look at what he believes what

overall I think the consensus is more that the republic or the Democrats have a chance of taking back the house and a greater chance than Republicans keeping it but in the Senate\nI think you almost have universal agreement that the Senate is going to stay with with Republican\nYeah in fact I saw something today uh that that basically just had you know that everyone all but it was it was the headline was directed more at the Republican candidates in those races or a Republican Republicans in in general believing that they were going to keep the Senate\nOr where the houses going I think that's still up in the air because there are some things that we can't misery even through polls but if you do it strictly by the polls right now than there is a better than decent chance that the Democrats would take\nThe house that would not be shocking um when you talk about a first term president are often that first midterm is is something where the that shift of power happens that happened with a ... bomber in two thousand ten right\nAnd so you could look at at at history that dictates says now do we look at all anomalies that didn't exist before yeah trend in that area yeah Trump cabinet and that's\nWhat I was saying about the polls have you go by the polls in history and then you could look out and go okay about Democrats take the house and and the Republicans keep the Senate\nAnd then you look at Nineteen Ninety four men say Hi to bad happened I was only a talk show host for a couple of years I still remember it how shocked everybody was and said whoa really except for ... nobody really got that one did they ...

G.\nAnd ... women everything else is like from the White House what would stop this because it would be if we think it's a just assume that it is beneficial to the president potentially that would be a good ...\nLet me backtrack that many things have leaked from the White House I own say every so many\nThings when you look at the nature of something that if if the White House believed it was going to help\nWould it be the position of the chief of staff and advisors to the president that book\nHand this over to the jury\nAllow him to do what he does and don't say a word well at\nThe everybody's speculating and the media everybody mhm or about the bombs and then what the motivation is neither speculating ... nobody's even nobody's speculate\nNobody's analyzing nobody's saying why I haven't seen one story\nAnywhere but maybe one existed I haven't seen I Would love to see it mhm or somebody has made the same points that we have oh wow\nWhy did you give it to the inspector general there's only one reason the whole thing was frame the story was initially framed that uh we had foreign allies that didn't want us to release this information\nBut we heard one story said it was the British Government because of Christopher Steele said well wait a minute why would you pay attention to them they don't know what the top secret information is I don't know what the president out I don't know what you have they don't know what's in the ... of warned so why would you pay attention to them\nAnd if you were going to not release it because things were top secret you would have gone\nTo probably or secretary of state who'd be dealing with those governments and is also an ex director of the CIA and you'd be going to Dan Coats your own director of national intelligence you wouldn't be given it to the inspector general\nWho only looks for one thing\nAnd that's corruption and therefore one it was declassified\nAnd people saw what was declassified in the White House they looked and said there are probably possible crimes here and before we were least says we need to first given to the inspector general of the United states to go after the corruption that we see how come nobody has written that story\nRight and if somebody has I haven't seen it I've not seen any major publication right the possibility of that story and why this all went to the inspector general why would you give it to the inspector general you saw something\nThat you believe Warren says his officers action\n\nAnd what his office deals with is corruption so you're giving him the only the only path that you can go down as you're giving him evidence\nOf corruption in the FBI and the department of justice there's no other path to go down right\nAnd nothing on the story right\nBecause if you didn't believe if if the president looked at that and didn't believe there\nWas some kind of wrongdoing than there would be no reason to contact or what it would be only if you believe if you saw it and said wow\nThis looks like there is a possible wrongdoing within the department of justice that's up to Horowitz to write the report was handed over because that's what the inspector general does\n... and by the way we'd be bringing this up and things to many of our listeners who I get a few a week ... people running the email saying what's going on right what could you guys around things you hear anything I mean we haven't seen any stories on it either know\nWhat's going on I mean that shouldn't be one of the biggest stories right now and and who should be reporting this ... story who should be encouraging that Republicans are they no\nNo no no\nAnd I would think that that the media would be curious I think that uh\nKatherine heritage or or someone else like that would be curious you know anyone that that is a not in the mainstream media but ... but you know someone who has done some really great work\nIn ...

this one at all is zero\n\nWhen everything else [laughter] it seems like in the world has been linked to how many how many important\nItems politically would be a leak well it and so there's there's a I guess a couple of possibilities they looked\nAt it and said well there's a a chance that what was done here was illegal but was ah was someone ... acted outside of their their uh their legal bounds\nWithin the department of justice in this process but we're not sure handed to Horowitz so in that case you don't lick it because the poor which comes back and says no wrongdoing was found\nThen you look bad by leaking that information\nAnd you have burned\nYou know your connection to me I\nI don't sense because of the nature of what you know how it happened and and frankly how quickly that kind of happened\nAnd the fact that it went that direction to begin with\nTells me they see that and say there's there's a great chance here that that this is the wrongdoing and that's exactly\n... and ... and Democrats were completely quiet yes and the other part is that the violence from the Democrats when it went to the inspector general there was really nothing\nThe other side

hearing from our eight six six Ninety One of the things we love talking about the the most is the uh the economy\nUh they show you know going back in different incarnations all the way back to Nineteen sixty nine uh and and our dealings with the transportation industry as always uh had that particular issue bent on economics\nAnd so when I saw this today I said okay this is something that we have to bring up so people can understand about the economy at large it was the wall Street Journal's analysis of Commerce Department statistics out on why we're doing better what is driving the increase\nIn the gross and the GDP in the increase in economic growth\nWhat is you know what is driving it and their analysis is almost half of the increase\nFrom April of twenty Seventeen from last year till this year now new numbers are coming out this morning but based on the numbers that are that came out from last month almost half of the increase in our economy is due to increase government spending\nAnd they looked at you know really from the majority of the Obama administration worthy or economic uh growth was the average GDP was to point two percent\nAnd compared it to the two point nine percent economic growth that we've had since April of twenty Seventeen just under three percent\nWhich as you know we know is it is a good thing a defense spending has increased drastically that's one of the major reasons that increased government spending that has helped the the GDP a\nSpending was contracted at an annual rate get this Eric ... to point one percent from two thousand nine to twenty Seventy\n...\nAnd it really go back to you know the president's real you know the really the first budget when he had no influence on it just wouldn't be looking at right or to growing at a two point nine percent rate since April twenty Seventeen\nSo there's a huge difference in defense spending that turnaround added a point to one percentage points to the ... on average to the nation's overall economic growth rate according to the Commerce Department\nWhen a including faster spending on non defense items and spending at state and local levels increased government spending accounted for a point three four percentage point a to point seven percent point increase in the growth rate since April twenty Seventeen\nWhich means uh the economy has grown a two point nine percent uh since April of twenty Seventeen the last quarter was what for for one was a ... right was it was a very good courtroom or almost half of that has been because of government spending\n\nIf now it has also increased other factors are at play faster business investment due in part to energy investing contributor point contributed point three percentage points to the growth rate faster\nConsumer spending accounts for about a third of the pick up a slowdown in home building has some tracked it two percentage points from that growth rate\nThe concern in as as we've said before is wants to government spending moderate ... then that increase goes away and as we said before the true grow\nAnd if you listen to the show you know we've been consistent uh irrespective of whether it's been a Republican president or a Democratic president or the GDP is not the most accurate way\nIt's the way that we use and it's become the accepted way it's never been the most uh\nAccurate way we believe
