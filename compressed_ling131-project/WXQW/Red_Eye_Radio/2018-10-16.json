gas control of eastern airline thanks to General Motors selling it to her for three and a half million dollars and he is not a natural educated businessmen and buzz she has a driving need to succeed he has a vision for aircraft\nHe fights the great in the new deal why well\nAfter you got to remember right now so we're looking at a time when the civilian airline system\nIs just being invented their art airfields that will support that the American public has a little questionable about whether they want to get in and pay for a seat because it's still kind of dangerous so Addy at a bunch of these one trip and a bunch of others or creating\nThe infrastructure and the whole idea of civilian airlines that we live with now an FDR and wanted to kind of get a little bit Korean daddy a little bit more federal\nRegulation in that he felt was more you know and and even add\nFDR said well you know I'm going to have these uh you know army or Arab Army flyers fly you know these planes and maybe not civilians and they started dying and Eddie was a little outspoken about that so he and FDR kind\nOf ... thirty he said he got through the Nineteen twenties the flapper era or the the the great depression hits America the Nineteen thirties the recovery is very slow at chase can take control of eastern airlines\nAnd sort of the Nineteen thirties the operates it effectively it becomes a money maker once it was free of the automobile industry there was always the automobile industry contributing casually\nAviation commercial aviation within a commercial aviation becomes viable to get to the

fellow\nMetal on our winter from the president to say stop you know don't you know so they they're flying they have to ditch in the middle of the central\nPacific have not taken care to know where they are or where they were headed so the ... the the tail speed was too much there of course they're\nOff course they've made some mistakes and and you can just see how this begins to mount it's really creepy to watch it and they are two thousand miles from any continental land masses or a couple of islands here and their\nChances are they're going to run into Japanese rabbits or two and a half three it was two and a half rash swimming is small raft and these were asked about the size of the bath tub three guys any flying on top of the show he\nDidn't take the food stuffs or the water out of the aircraft I forgot\nThat this was before that he would see that this would change later but they also weren't given they weren't you know a life\nHe didn't go there for for anything to do with sex or anything like that it was just a place they were going ... in fact he was going on I can say this because it came out\nWith one of the hosts set at KBC where I used to host\nAnd a seven Ninety KBC and it was just like I said oh you want to go ... and he said yes and it was meant to spring it on him the last weekend sound familiar with Diane Feinstein or to try to show conservative voters oh look what he was willing to do to go to a unseemly nightclub to put it that way\nSo yeah I just thought of that myself now they've always had similar playbook nothing's new [noise]\nBut anyway uh he lost that we can do and one of the reason people said he lost his because if you remember a George S H Bush had pulled out of California I think in that election that he lost\nUm to Clinton and he pulled out all funds and then they use all of that to make sure box one but a fifty fifty before that we can and they pull those dirty tricks\nBut he's a brilliant man and I want says Bruce ... by the way he worked for Richard Nixon\nAnd I I think he said this on the air so I kept saying he was one of the few that said don't don't do resigned don't give this thing up you you you remember some people think Nixon was impeached wasn't um peachy he withdrew for the sake of the country even though a lot of people thought Richard Nixon was was pretty bad\nBut Bruce that I went with him there and I I tried to convince them not to resign but he said no we're going to do for the sake of the country anyway I asked Bruce wants\nWhole must be Barbara Boxer from the U.S Senate from California if he thought God was involved in the founding of our country Bruce always taught me something whenever he was on and he answered of course did you ever think how young the founders were and how they got almost everything right\nAnd it was it also Providence I Would ask myself that we got George Washington when we needed them so badly remember they want to make him king if you know your history and he turned it down and you know set up I'm going to retire a president says okay that's enough\nAnd Abraham Lincoln and Ronald Reagan when we needed the most you wouldn't get any argument from me about gossip involving\nAnd now I think you're going to take ... I think I'm Crazy we got Donald Trump with all those personal shortcomings when the country needed him most as long as I say you know Providence I don't know but I wouldn't you wouldn't get any argument for me [noise]\nYes he won and I was a strong supporter of his during the general election of course that doesn't say much either considering who he was running against ripe\nAnd remember many of us thought we would be very satisfied if President Trump would just nominate conservative judges that that was enough especially for the Supreme Court will where a lot of people I knew thought hey that would work for me that's that's enough right there and I think a lot of people across the country felt that way\nSo I thought we were way ahead of the game when he appointed a Judge Gorsuch to the U.S Supreme Court but it didn't stop there and I'll just mention some of them are things he's done a metro ... much better lists last night ending the bomb and care mandate\nOpening up the Keystone Pipeline remember Obama wouldn't do it and more reserves and in countless regulations hurting the economy and the proof is how well the economy is doing a significant tax cut lowering our\nTaxes and simplifying the tax forms by the way it was ... and the same one I mentioned who years before his time say we should be able to fill out or a tax returns on a postcard\nAnd then everybody copied them years later and uh that that is eventually they where they want to go with us moving of the U.S embassy to Jerusalem getting us out of the Paris Peace accords\nWithdrawing from the disastrous Iranian deal I didn't talk much about that last night I can imagine we paid them hundreds of billions of dollars under fifty billion under Obama gave them secret cash on a plane which he denied\nPay them off for what they are our biggest enemy do you know I Do feel like I Do that you live that I live on a different planet I mean don't you ... always of our biggest enemies or at least the ones killing our soldiers right now we give them money to ... to hurt us and hurt our people\nThat alone I mean is incredible eight six six nine to read I Want to know what you think about the Iranian deal is incredible eight six six the same number nine o seven thirty three thirty nine\nMeeting with Kim all young to possibly reduce the denuclearization of the ... Sheila getting American remains return from North Korea making sure our borders means something I admit that hasn't been solved yet\nWe're gonna talk we didn't last night about the the Marshall and people from Honduras opt to request asylum that's going to be a winning a situation for him to deal with and I'm saying that obviously sarcastically\nAppointing countless conservative just listen to the lower courts right\nYou watch federal judges and uh you know the ninth district which is a crazy district who gets overturned the most saying things like a you know he was from the president can't do is they can't do that it's a Muslim ban and all this kind of stuff and they've taken power and their own hands well supporting that he points these lower court judges are federal\nJudges to and of course the naming now of a second Supreme Court choice another conservative break out on the list goes on and on and the American people love that he's not politically correct\nThe American people are tired of all those politicians who spin and spin and spin\nAnd are afraid to see what they're really thank you so maybe he does too much but at least you you get people love his honesty or at least he says what he means you can never say that about President Trump that he doesn't say what he means he may say to watch\nBut he never says two little I came up with that one he's one of the most conservative presidents in my lifetime and he's done a great job\nAnd most the American people get it but it doesn't matter to the left or to Democrats or the comrades in the media\nI'm afraid of tell the left the Democrats and liberal listeners all the call and they let me know what you think and I said last night I bet it's said softly\nIf the presidential election were held today President Trump would easily be reelected he's kept most of his promises and the American people appreciate that and he is resonating with the American people more than ever\nAnd I don't know if you feel the same way I think each day he's becoming more and more presidential he's growing into the job if you remember Harry Truman to replace the FDR and people said often I teach government history too so I Know some of the stuff and I said he's going to be awful terrible but they said ... grew into the job also\nYou're dreaming by the way if you think he's going to be defeated I just wanted tells you cut out there and the other side you failed to get rid of him but not from lack of trying you start in the day he won that it's so obvious now\nActually we can go they started the resistance against him much before election day but it was election day came they couldn't believe that this ... so called bumbling fools had one\nAll right he was so bombed them but he's still on right no matter what the upper lead or of the FBI and the Justice Department may have guaranteed right where we've seen the text doing page and struck and all that stuff he won\nI don't know about you but I was teaching at that time at night and I was almost in tears when I heard he won Pennsylvania which was always seems to me like Republicans ... goal you know we're going to wait at this time going to win Pennsylvania we got it down\nAnd not only did he win but despite their best efforts he won he still here and he's going to be here for six and a half more years no matter the Mahler persecution or OK\nProsecution so persecution to me no matter the hostile media media no matter the never Trump hers\nWhich I can never understand them no matter all the elites in the swamp President Trump is still here which never should have happened according to them and despite their best efforts to destroy him including getting a special prosecutor appointed\nI fault attorney general sessions for that I'm going to talk about that more later he never have recused himself he played into the Democrats hands\nPoliticians typically ...\nThat's not a big deal you know we talk then you've talked to the Russians including a bomb and you remember Obama promising off Mike that things will be better when he got re elected not to get you know make more stuff happen\nI've been a big supporter sessions when he was a senator but I'm disappointed in his jobs attorney general and disappointed his lack of oversight Rosenstein but more of that later\nSessions should have made amends by fire Rosenstein especially if he threatened to congressional staffers did you hear that he threatened them as they helped their bosses conduct oversight and just as disappointed by the way is the new FBI direct to almost nonchalant attitude about corruption and his agency that amazes me\nLewis says all gotten way out of hand and it is clear to many people by now that Mueller's investigation is a witch hunt in search of a crime\nIf anything there was a soft coup to get rid of President Trump\nPerpetrated by the highest echelons of our government at the Justice Department and the FBI and I'm not sure until all the dust settles lose my production if we won't find President Obama's fingerprints all over this you wait and see we were never supposed to find out about the subterfuge because Hillary was supposed to win\nRight her champagne or celebration I was a big boat celebration it's supposed to happen in New York City [noise]\nThey were waiting for her match the only one thing it never happened Donald Trump crashed that party and they're never going to forgive him for that and all that would have been swept under the rug but she didn't win and that's where this tyranny and this resistance started if not sooner\nThe swamp must be drained by President Trump and this must never be allowed to happen again\nIt's time to free President Trump from this distraction I Want to know you think it's time to free

let's do I like to name mark in Claremont, California I liked the topic to mark you're on TALK with mark\nBut first of all before my topic I just wonder briefly emission Providence\nPersonally grateful to Providence to we have a man with the spine can talk back in the media because we just are Jeb Bush would never have done it without it he didn't have the guts and torture case itch\nWould never have done so either is is too many tics and he was a strange cat [noise] and ... if they if the American public even what Clinton but damage she would have done which was an Arab parable we would never have a chance of recovery\nSo I don't think the American people would do it as we speak have no clue of how lucky we are to have\nMr Trump is president now very briefly I just want to say that Trump should use this debt over a hundred and fifty billion dollars that we gave to Iran\nTrump can't go on go on the bandstand and say we could've built Detroit we could have put millions of black Americans back to work and train them with that a hundred and fifty billion dollars I think you should say that over and over and over again\nTo let the American people do have the bomb a ministry she just fritter that money away and why they gave it to them I don't have a clue\nI I have a clue you know he didn't feel the way we do about the who your enemies are and who your friends are writing was mean to our friends in in ... a really nice to some of our enemies I'd like your idea I think it's a great on the measure if he went around and you say in the country and the campaign stump saying he cause people get a feeling\nYou know they hear a hundred and fifty million or whatever you know and it doesn't they don't relate to say hey we could rebuild Detroit we're going to rebuild the you know shoot Chicago with the ... the violence when we could have done here and done there people can relate to that but they they gave them money away to our enemy\nYou're right I I

come on television and talk about civility and you add briefly touched on\nCivility I Believe yes ... yesterday's program\nWas so amazing and these people by now you'd have to be ... they think that we are nothing but a budget blind mice ... horrible and then when the truth of the matter is is there's nothing to that at all that could be further from the truth\nThe truth of the matter is it and I wonder why people like Hillary Clinton and and the all the so called a K bad actors\nThat they refer to know why they haven't been handed out subpoenas and why haven't they go through the judicial process the justice system and I have to wonder that\nWell why are you talking about later probably well I'm very disappointed in Jeff Sessions he showed no guts no no ah for for us what am I thinking of you know he's been so weak in in this position\nHe I was for him when he was named them but I've been very disappointed in him and by the way just to your point about Hillary civility that even the very I was thinking about this when you were talking the secret service they treated horribly who who who give their life up for them or she is and care what what you did then\nAnd then you take a look at Joe Biden you know swimming naked in the pool and and and so on and so forth these people they they're beyond the word despicable or ... or ... uh you know\nIt it it is you have to be totally

the left themselves the people that can't be educated or think that this country could survive or the constitution could survive a Hillary presidency for more of the same of what we had for eight years under Obama\nI think we've been given a gift you were talking about Providence um\nI mean Hillary had her balloons suspended in the ceiling and didn't get to\nUm shower them on her\nSo called constituency we were that close to what was supposed to be a lead pipes and\nFor her and uh you know\n\nWe gotta we gotta take advantage of this opportunity that we have I mean I I hear people tripping over the fact that Trump is saying things on Twitter that's not appropriate or this or that or the other to me it strikes me is somebody that uh\nHas lived his life financially making good decisions\nAnd uh\nHe doesn't need this job he could be doing anything else\nWith a time\nAnd he is condescending to this country and taken on the responsibility of trying to write this ship\nAnd uh\nYou know ... ... what we need to realize is he he could be a this is what she can do when you can send to the presidency and you're not in the back pocket of\nMultiple corporations or or whoever ... people say he's an outsider correct but he's not beholden to anybody so he can do these things and he can bypass the press\nAnd talk to us on Twitter and speak his mind directly to us and be a transparent president something that Obama promised to do and couldn't deliver and turns out was just more of the same\nA\nDemocratic crap that we've we've had for\nFor years and years\nAnd you know I I hear the emotion or voice and I appreciate your call very much [laughter]\nThey're right he's he's beholden to no end to no one and\nHe says what he thinks that you may have heard me say this you get the whole package is he is the ... the elite would like of course not [laughter] it's one of the reasons they dislike him so much money is getting things done and as I said and you seem to share those sentiments he he's doing a great job\nI I've been more than impressed with him\nAnd I'm thankful for every day's there and I don't know if you felt the way I did when he won and I watched his family are kind of come down celebrated victory from day one\nI was worried that someone would go after him in some way and I thank God every day that he's that he's around I I just don't trust the other side especially in one I'm telling you now is it looks like a civil war I said yesterday we talked about it\nSo I appreciate your call very much and certainly your emotions let's go to there was somebody else a a has a bumper sticker idea I got to hear this jak in Branson, Missouri you haven't had one per sticker idea God\nYes yes that's a little little hordes sign painter I'm I feel some

but\nSo I have a concept that I Want to share and the ... ... ... neither comes from a park laughter a whore All right\nAnd so we don't have to have this fear of a you know repercussions are are openly saying we support Donald Trump put my purse or has some plans that is it shows pro American it's the act\nAs ... number one goal and I didn't mention it but this call is appropriate I Love people disagree and I wish many more of you would call who do disagree with me and I think Christine in my old neighbor uh Redondo Beach California where I started teaching California is on the line I Christine\nHi how are you there or anything\nThat um I just wanted to say and where I occasionally go on vacation and and I just wanted to get a ... going on on the other side and it it's just crazy it's crazy to me that\nThey say that um we don't believe that Democrats are people out in the last that we aren't believing in America we do very much believe in America um I think when can catch then Republican alright kids that\nWe want to open up a quarter of all I watch it just it just\nApply there are things that we want to do that is not true and I think that Trump\nI Can't wrap my head around and and this is what I Want to ask you\nI Can't wrap my head and why people like him I get it you're going to stick to your Republican he's a Republican representative president kids for that party\nWill do everything that this man is not right it's not crack and I and my one and I'm just wondering how\nSo many people um and well you know those people that came out at any\n... any no no no no no no yeah I'm Sorry\nI'm first of all I I didn't say Democrats don't believe in America I'm very clear about seeing the left I don't believe believes\nIn America so obviously I Know\nThe Democrats love the American and there's no issue about that at all what you said we we back Trump aides in what things don't you like that to you know will at least clarified differences I'm not gonna argue with you but what do you think he believes in or has done that you don't like so much\nSo that everything I mean I I really I Can't even believe how are you going up because\nThe rap native named ... ... no NO NAME on it all work out okay\nLet me let me let me just tell you that psychic\nUm I don't get and maybe you can turn me I don't know\nIf he had he did something we're not going to find any prayer is correct that he had any ticket rip the election like Trump himself but there was um I mean voter fraud everything going on why Hillary president ...\nWay to say I'm just wondering what are you there are some you know your your last me do I want to answer your question is often been voter fraud that that's like you you can't blame that on President Trump the collusion with Russia has been zero Anthony stylish thing has been going on two years so there's been no zero evidence of that\nIs that what you're saying about that for whatever\nYeah so how how is it that every person here involved with and is going to jail or\nGoing to hurt during ... so how are you where the clues\nAnd yeah so it would no there wasn't there all the people that have gone to a lot of them are Russians when they mentioned the thirty six thirty ... some of these people for Russians having nothing to do with President Trump but Michael Flynn pleaded not not because he had anything to do with the Russians Paul Manafort they win some\nYou know business dealings he didn't report with Ukraine and so and none of these things had it and if you do with President Trump\nOr Syria saying why all the people everybody knows first of all it's not every but it's just we're talking about some people but none of it was with President Trump\nColluding with Russia you let me ask you questions we'll we send you really believe that he looted we put in I mean we've had zero evidence of that yes\nAbsolutely I absolutely knew and I believe I Believe they'll have proof of that and if they don't it's like with it but I kept going back to that I don't want to go back to that but it went Kevin ... it was it was a disgrace to say oh we we we believe Kevin a hundred percent but\nToward but we believe her to bed but um it just wasn't him and and that's\nThat's the way way way way now getting a chance that made me think I may even care you over but the fact is that there was no cooperating evidence for anything she said would you like I mean it was huge wait let me finish would you like to have something and have no corroborating evidence and then maybe go to jail or not get the job he always wanted\nIn this country you're innocent before proven guilty you gotta let me\nLet me let me tell you I guess in the wrong person because I was in and I was dead and my family family member if I were to say right now that this person and the guy that he was here with us\nFor that crime court justice but\nOn the line I have absolutely no\nEvidence with the tiles are similar to me I have no evidence

Trump\nIn two thousand six have her lawyer released a composite sketch or the man Trump accused clippers in April ... total time jobs concerning uh non existent man\nAnd one of the court decide they

Michael ... I'm just happy to instill some\nCommon sense in the show I think Trump is absolutely abhorrent ah I got a laundry list I won't go through 'em all but it's\nThe barbaric handling of immigrant children disgusting I'm there that Youtube video I've seen and believe me believe we do don't believe me it's been taking off for you to\nHave a talk show years ago I Believe it was a David Letterman or you said is slog carried away I'm very very intelligent so of course I'm an atheist or he's got a Christian\nUh can you\nHold on I Want to just I'll give you a chance what you said something that hit me right away so the barbaric treatment of immigrants showing her first of all they're not immigrant children they're illegal immigrant children or let's call them the way it is\nAnd I don't know what's ... why it's barbaric to say that you\nHave certain rules and laws and ways of getting in a country and if you don't come in that way then we can't accept you what's barbaric maybe his parents bringing the children here they're responsible for the families being a separate and broken up so I don't think he's being barbaric you would probably call me barbaric just because I Want some rules and I want some\nProcedures in terms of sovereignty wise that barbaric\nI don't care if the children belong to the handling was barbaric and if it was your child you'd be singing a different to you\nKnow I Would you know no no no you can't go on you don't run around you know so you don't get to go on if you don't give me a chance and when you say something so absurd if it was my first I Want to bring my child's up here if I knew that can be separated from me\nI Would do in the first place so don't tell me what I Would do I'll give you your chance but don't try to read my motivation on my mind and these people I don't blame them from trying to get away from terrible conditions but there are rules in our procedures and it's not barbaric\nTo say if you do that we we have certain laws and rules and procedures how we handle this go your turn to\nExplain our federal judge a put a stop to it is barbaric whether you want to say it is not\nThe way they handled it not necessarily join in the first place shepherding the show around here with that but if you want to go with the separation being warranted still way they they ... they say half bought handled it let's just say for instance the real quick I took my kid Chuck E. cheese recently\nI had to worry so that said one two three for example that my child at a brace at once you three that way when I was able to leave they verify the bracelets without it will go on my way they could have done something similar but they didn't do anything she got children\nEarly earth her song it was done and a half but way\nWay to first of all it's an unelected judges so you were trying to prove something by the judge is if the judge he ... he knows what's best than what's best for the country and what's best for the rest of us he never got elected to anything but leaving that aside\nThe parents shouldn't be bringing these and that's what I Do he said well you would do the same thing if you're a kid no I wouldn't bring my child up if I knew they could be separated from me and and the ones knowing that I just wouldn't do it in the first place they're the ones where there is yeah\nFind out how many hundred three seven four oh three

the last president in ... years and I'm the I'm going to tell you right straight out Obama was the worst president ever\nAnd you'll be surprised may not want us to ...\nYou may be surprised to know you haven't heard me because I've been on a number of years but until recently not back on this network\nOr I feel the same way I think President Obama is the worst presidents we've had in our history certainly in my lifetime he did more damage and he started by apologizing for the greatest country in the history of the world he was a ... going on an apology tour [noise] uh I I agree are examining\nImbalance before Saudi king and which is ridiculous I'm lying or what I like what Trump be a little bit to his speech a couple of weeks ago a and the un I well I got out of this speech was one of the things he didn't exactly say it but\nWhat I took from it when you say it's going to make America great again he was letting people know why don't you make your country great again and make it a place that people wouldn't want to leave\nYou know they walk away about that\nWhat we've done that works so well right free enterprise little regulation limited government why don't you try that for a while the guys and see how it works in your country I'd exactly\nAnd again going back to the immigration boy that guy said the uh the kids were treated the old policy was put in place long
