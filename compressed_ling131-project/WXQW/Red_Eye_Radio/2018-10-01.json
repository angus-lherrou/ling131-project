you were executed out what you fair hope movie cumulus station\n[noise] free trade deals secured Kavanaugh investigation under way of friends that are us and Canada have reportedly reached a deal on NAFTA or Crawford reports\nThrough weeks of intense worked at your country settled on a framework to update the north American free trade agreement that includes according to Reuters giving us\nFarmers more access to a candidate dairy market and shooting Canada from possible us auto tariffs America's second largest trading partner was ... when the U.S and Mexico reach the preliminary deal in August to revamp NAFTA and the Trump Administration had given Canada until midnight Sunday to sign on or faith because you're from the pack\nIn the past President Trump has railed against the tree deal blame game for the loss of American manufacturing jobs we are the worst trade deal ever made in history here Crawford Washington\nMass burial is now being prepared for more than three hundred bodies on an Indonesian ... hit hard by a powerful earthquake and tsunami toll of more than eight hundred dead from friday's disaster mostly from Powell is expected to grow as there is cut off by damage or reached\nRemember it wasn't that the president said he would get a free trade agreement done what he said was he will get a free trade agreement that will get wind of the trade deficit\n\nYes now I Know the president will be out and he will be selling its irrespective of what is in the free trade agreement and the people that love the president will say he did exactly what he said he was going to do I'm fine with that as long he'd heads\nIn reality he doesn't do what he initially said he was going to do\nWell [noise] you know [noise] [noise]\nI'm just fine with everything it's all just get behind us you know the ... the moving of well we'll do this much more over here and and this much less over here\nIt really isn't because there's there's been no promise ... the only thing I've seen in terms of the measurement of the dairy agreement is that it will mirror that\nOf the the agreement that Canada just reached with Europe and other\nThe country's other parts of the world so I have no idea what that means for the U.S [noise] [noise] I don't know how to quantify that\nAnd it's it again [laughter] there was no um target right there was nothing\nWhere they said look we must get this much increase for the dairy farmers of of the U.S\nIn a word this is what we're working on this is who were working on behalf of so I don't\nThere was never this this I guess blind or or go for them to reach the administration in fact just a few days ago they were saying yeah we're way too far apart to be reaching a deal before the deadline\nAnd\nAnd here we are a few days later so we have no idea what it means and how much of an increase for those dairy farmers in terms of being able to sell the count Canada that is\nYou know what I didn't hear mentioned it all in any ... article but right now it's early on and maybe and maybe tomorrow nothing on the soft ...\nNo I I didn't say anything on that and so you only two hours I did see a lot dairy and automobiles\nSettle that so I I guess my ... and by the way when we say win or lose we're not talking about win or lose by our standards because when and looted by our standards with training with Canada should be free trade across the board no tariffs no limits or anything if Canada put tariffs on that's wrong if the United states put tariffs on\nA you know uh the the batters wrong but is that where we made the compromise on soft timber and that's why you didn't hear the administration come out\nAnd talk about you know the the soft timber than we said okay we're not remember they were going after the soft timber industry claiming that the government subsidizes it in Canada right ah and with the duties and whatever put on soft timber\nAs we know a construction in the United states will become has and will become more expensive\nWhich will hurt the bottom line of the GDP so I you know look there's a there's a ton of things here and you just mentioned something that just a couple of days ago we're way far off we're not going to have a deal well the president knew that he had\nTo have Canada and the dealer was a no go in Congress was going to go anywhere right\nSo he was under that he was under pressure to come up with some kind of deal otherwise it wouldn't go through when he had to get it done now\nBecause they want it done before December first when the Mexican president does out right so we're right at that sixty day deadline it's got to be done now so there was pressure on the administration did the administration crumble on parts that they wanted\nI guess we shall see it was interesting that are run a couple of articles in the last couple of weeks from Canada\nBut they said you know what the Canadian government decided to do we're just not going to respond to Trump on anything he can sit there and script would just be quiet say nothing don't give them a target back\nDon't say anything and so if you if you think the Canadians have been quiet lately because of it that was their whole purpose let's just be quiet but candidate knew that they ... they understood candidates stood that look one of the things that we have against the United states in this deal is Trump have\nTo get it done he's got to get it done by a certain time period\nOtherwise you know the Congress is not going to pass a trade deal that separate from Mexico and therefore that's the pressure they had in the administration I guess we shall see\nWell yeah aids here's what I don't hear right now I don't fear\nAny um\nAny promotion of of a a massive I guess concession by Canada by the administration you know 'cause they there is a tiny\nBit and that's that's the whole thing is that the movement if there were big movement here we would know about already that would be in the media that would be the story that Trump claims\nThe fall\nSo again how much of a victory as it did it do anything did it change anything and if we haven't gotten the steel and aluminum tariffs done\nThen what does that look like\nIt because that that right now if you look at what is really impact of the economy so far it's been it's been that just the threat of those when they started talking about those tariffs\nSo let me ask you this is it are we at a point where both Mexico and Canada because we talked about how not a lot of details have come out about Mexico right so we just to the point where they said look we both got to say we have an agreement to start the clock ticking for the next sixty days right\nWe've come to terms and will work out the details later and we push off the deadline for now\nAnd we have a lot of stuff to talk about including that a cabin on the FBI investigation or how the goalposts have been moved remember last week I said that they move the goalposts\nAre basically from a a you know a of an American uh American football the Canadian football now I think the goalposts moved at the soccer field now it's that even that ... that much longer

should stay off the basketball courts for now when kids are around writes Eric Brady\nAbsolute piece a crappy job on Kavanaugh's what it was now USA Today came in and this was just it was written as a sports article\nThey deleted the toy and\nApparently made him change to the lines the lines that are no longer in the newer article is this part isn't a word says Brett Kavanaugh to justify the other day that he might never coach girls basketball again and\nThen this line was eliminated he shouldn't at least not until further investigation has concluded and the other line that then was eliminated was the nation is deeply divided sometimes it feels like we don't agree on anything\nBut credibly accused sex offenders should not coached youth basketball girls or boys without deeper investigation can we all agree on that\nThat was eliminated when USA Today took down the one story deleted the tweet and put out a new story not in the regular sports section but in the opinionated sports section doesn't matter whether you ask the question\n\nIt's a hit piece what you're trying to portray is that you suspect him as a pedophile\nAnd\nIt got me a little bit because I run there for Thirty years I knew him when I was a teenager\n\nAnd I and I look at this and and I over the last year or so I Will admit that I could see in some of his personal post\nYou know you can you could tell he didn't like Trump but that's okay I mean come on I got friends who do that by Facebook friends who do that all the time we never ever got into a political conversation ever on Facebook\nRight ah but I didn't see that you could tell that the you know that but it was in there it was in there somewhere but that's that's fine because people have their political opinions and I'm fine with that we've all got our family members and friends\nThat disagree with some politics all the time but again I haven't seen Eric what that since we were teenagers so I I you know I don't know but like I said um\nI always thought that he wrote with class this was completely classless article\nA it's a hit job it's unwarranted a it is not up at all\nTo the sports journalistic standards but I knew from Arab brainy\nWhen\nHe started writing as a local writer and then went with USA Today probably for the first you know ... for the last you know Thirty years this was just an absolute hippies and and what gets me angry about this era you know you and I'm done talk radio for a long long time\nAnd sometimes we may get a little bit of overheated whatever but we never really get we've never really gotten ourselves in any trouble where we've had to apologize for anything that we've set on the air in our management comes in you must apologized because the sponsors are all Bailey\nAnd that's because number one we don't think I you and I don't think in a kind of radical ways to begin\nWith we're not hateful people we don't hate anybody\nBut I've always said if somebody says on the radio and loses a for a little bit to me that's a little bit more understanding even if you tweet it out\nAnd it's just a sentence but rice here what he did he wrote an article this was absolutely premeditated it was a premeditated hidden job apparently because of the range that he feels of anything that's relating to Trump\nWell and this is you know the indicative of the the mentality on the left this is just one more in a long line of people that are now just\nThrowing everything at the Capitol nomination because they have room to do it\nAnd you know how you know is wrong and now he knows he's wrong\nBecause the editors or somebody got involved and said this goes to the opinion section you got to take out these sentences\n\nBecause these aren't fact based at all because he called an incredible accusation ... that's a political statement that is not a statement of fact\nNo\nAnd the the the fact that the u._s._a. today how to delete the tweet oh and then he deleted his Facebook page completely he deleted for a reason because he knew the ball back that was coming\nWhy because what he wrote was an absolute hit piece on a man and where there is zero\nEvidence except for the allegation that he's ever done anything wrong well again\nThey you know for them now the claim is reality\n\nAnd so this goes to not just a hit piece but a hit piece on his family\n\nNot he's not capable of making unbiased decisions\nNot we're against him because he might overturn roe v Wade\nNot anything else it was a hit\nJob directed toward his children it involves the activities of his children ... imagine

I'm keeping up to date on this every single week just because I Do believe I Do believe I Do believe I Do believe I Do believe that my prediction and we don't make many predictions but one of my predictions\n... come to fruition and that is where I said months ago I said I think I Know what's gonna happen here with a whole NFL kneeling thing I think is going to be basically and don't ask don't tell where they the the players association really encourages the players not to do it\nOr stay in the locker room or do whatever and have the thing just slowly fade away because contract talks\nWill ... will I mean the contract stop what in a almost two and a half years now but they'll start negotiating it a good year out ... so you're a year and a half away really year and a half year and three quarters away from\nThe the contract negotiations probably starting\nAnd they want to make sure the TV ratings are going up and not sliding down because they sign a ten year deal so we believe that the NFL players association has probably gone to the players and the reps in say encourage your people\nNot to Neal wow week for mangoes falcons\nAll players stood buccaneers it bears all players stood lions and cowboys all players stood bills in Packers all players stood\nThe bills kneeled as soon as the game began though those versus titans only Michael Bennet\nThe NFL player who lie to the police about the Las Vegas police or lie to Bob ... light about the Las Vegas police ah was in the locker room\nTexas Texas versus colds all players stood it's only the dolphins\nOnly the dolphins and a wide receiver Kenny still sell but Wilson kneel during the anthem defensive bed Robin Quinn racist fest all other players some for the national anthem jets jaguars all players stood Brown's raiders\nOf players stood Seahawks versus colonels three players were in the locker room for the national anthem so you just have the dolphins are it that's all that's left\nAnd that's all you've had a after they're gone and that sort of fades away now that it's down really to one game 'cause nobody notices if you're not that no no cameras can be on you if you're in the locker room but you've got four players in the locker room\nAnd three players on one team standing that's what you're down to know and I do believe it said that they just wanted to fade away they don't want any official announcement\nIs just slowly going to fade away and then it'll be something that will be a footnote NFL history there but I don't think because you don't hear them in what discussing this for three\nMonths four months mhm not you haven't heard anything about the ongoing him worthy I'm going to go ... going on between the end of a NFL players association and the and the owners here I thought they were doing negotiations shouldn't take longer you stand\nOr you don't well then I was no way to draw hard line in the sense no so you just let it go away and you encourage the players not to do it and finally money winds over\nYeah\nYeah that's right it's um I don't watch the show but I saw the story on a ... I think it was news busters that has the story on the show bowlers on HBO\nUm\nI think the rock is then that I think he plays an agent or something but they were talking about the whole ... thing and the people who objected to capture Nick kneeling and everything else and they use some of course it's HBO so they use some language blank them\nAnd uh\nAnd the and the dialogue and I thought to myself why is that\nThe story even for news busters I mean I Know news busters typically they're promoting the or they're reporting on the media is you know if it were CNN saying that or ESPN which I'm sure they have full blind\nThem it was a ... blank the people that are buying so that people who objected to call you I okay alright what Eric I I've said this before though\nWhen every single person when they say you're not watching known I with why not and I explained to them why\nThey go oh I didn't know that oh I didn't know that oh I didn't know that oh I didn't know that\nEvery single person that I've talked and this probably fifty over the last you know it's been over a year this at all I think it's a free speech issue for actually visited free speech issue you know what they did ... because of you know here's what it's about and here's what I object to when I tell them to go\nGet it okay I can but I didn't know that I didn't know that I didn't know that\nWe live in an ignorant nation let's be honest the majority of people on the majority of topics\nAre completely ignorant not our audience what they make a choice a majority are yeah they they make a choice to stay out of it and then jump right in the middle of it without knowing they don't know they don't even know what's going on we talked about this on economic issues we talked about it when it comes to understanding how government works the vast majority of people and we're talking over two thirds of people can't tell you\nThe three branches of government they have no idea [laughter]\nI don't even know why we live in our society and why we talk about it and why we talk about American exceptionalism they have no idea why\nAs I said before I understand why these people come out now and say America is an exceptional have no idea how it works\n\nBut I heard somebody else say they don't like it so they don't like it either but yes that's where we live right now it's on it's unfortunate that in the day and age and think about it I just I go back to when I was in high school and college and\nHow you have to search for information remember going to go you want to have a question you can go to the library it could take you it's a you know I really need to find out about this let me go to the library okay I have to get in the car drive to the library ...\nYeah and you were directory limited right fine there find the right book there's a book open a book do and that's not the right book go to a different book you got ten bucks in front of you just to find out one thing I mean\nLook at the difference in the way the media runs everybody complains about the media controls everything actually they don't these days imagined back in the day that you went to a newspaper stand right\nOr one of the machines All right so you had a newspaper machine and you put your quarter and and you grab the only one only one you grab the only one because you don't grab to matter how many coupons you need and imagine\nAt that next to that same newspaper machine or Fifteen to twenty to a hundred other machines fact checking what was in that MORNING EDITION of that\nNewspaper that's what you have today yeah\nYou can the Washington Post can come out and they can put their story out or CNN\nWell and and and that's the thing we've talked to and people say well the media controls the oil will whoa whoa whoa whoa one thing we we can tell you with age as we know how it used to be back then and not only are there more news sources out there but you just brought it up ... not not only they're more news sources out there\nBut you have to realize that heart access to information to find out exactly what's going on\nIs greater than it's ever been before and we were growing up they can say whatever they want and if you want to research it it wouldn't take serious time to do the research to actually know what was going on and yet ... we say\nThat people were actually more informed back then they are today well because they did the basics first they actually learned and paid attention to and knew the basic ideas on which this country was founded well they were taught to base and now you don't have any of that so what do you have\nPeople thinking I guess they don't have to learn it because they can Google it if they needed well they're not even willing to do that [laughter] but when you know the basics of how government works or how ... works then you can have the debate on the ideas regardless of who's reporting what regardless of who takes what position\nIf you can have the debate on the ideas because it's not about the people it's always been about the ideas and the one idea that this country\nWas founded on was was liberty freedom and so you start there and when you know the basics you can have a discussion with anybody\nRegardless of who or which side as promoting what\nYou want to get in a lot of folks don't want to while I'm there is going to happen until we finally get a

Jake Tapper asking the panel yeah ah that that you know the saying ... ... ... it's clear now that the Democrats somebody\nAh in that party bleak right and there at the end and the response was somewhat right and\nAnd so you you know they did it and so Lindsey Graham being on the Judiciary Committee to then that's in theory aiding because it's something that I Know Lindsey Graham has never done\nAnd there's a certain protocol that you're supposed to do understanding what's your role as a senator is Lindsey Graham may be at times\nA part of what was used to be could be called the swamp ... but as we know the swamp is involved in Washington DC uh especially when Republicans look at it are Trump supporters look at it or even from looks at you know what the swamp is\nAnd\nThat's I think what are the other reasons that Lindsey Graham was just so infuriated ...\nAnd why he led off at that at that point 'cause you know you you think about it remember first it was an immediate knowing he should be disqualified he's not qualified for this whatsoever secondly they handed an allegation an extremely serious allegation\nFrom the Senate Judiciary committee she got word of it\nShe's the ranking member mhm\nShe's supposed to bring it to the Senate Judiciary committee for tell the woman look or I can bring this to the Judiciary Committee but your name's eventually gonna become known we keep a secret for a while but I Need to bring it to the ... committee and then we'll have the FBI do we keep your name out of it until then but at some point if you wish to continue\nThen\nYou know we can keep it anonymous and the and the FBI in Korea but after that if you wish to continue than your name will become well known she didn't do that so and\nSo everything along the line of who paid for the the ... you know ah the ... lie detector ah the the suggestion of a law firm everything that has gone and then you get to the point where they leak or name\nMe

eight hundred dead from friday's disaster mostly from Lou expected to grow as other areas were reached\nWe'll negotiate where we need to negotiate but we're not going to get in the back and forth with them because they believe that it fuels it ... it feels his passion and then support for what he is\nDo it in the states so they said if he's just screaming and we're not responding it brings all the rhetoric down and they said Jared Kushner was the one who helped the deal really you know get through on on what the actual deal is we don't know but we don't see any major changes\nIn the free trade deal steel and aluminum or not included don't know why on that one\nYeah and and nothing is done until it's done and the signed agreement\nWill be the agreement [noise]\nAh yes because it would they haven't even worked out everything you know just a ... a lot like Mexico and I and I do think that one of the things is they they said look we got we have to announce an we have to announce that we've come to an agreement to get the clock ticking on this and we can work things out over the next couple of months\nYeah right\nSo that takes it off the political table and gets behind the the number\nOne on one of the problems as we've always said it is with the president we have no idea since he has covered every single opinion on on train we don't know where he stands we don't know what's acceptable or what's not acceptable he's gone from a complete protectionist\nOr any much of a you know we're Torah goal protection is during the campaign\nAnd then ah he had the ability about two months ago to be on Monday a complete free trader and by the end of the week was being protectionist again and so when you hold every opinion on free trade it's tough to figure where the president stands and what this eventual free trade agreement will look like\nUh but uh if it's more free trade\nAnd it's not protectionist as he promised in the campaign and his supporters are happy with it I'm fine with it\nYeah I mean it's it because it once and I think we will get the aluminum and steel chairs are those that's going to fix itself at some point it will have to just the way it did during the Bush administration and it takes it\nTakes a lot longer for that process or let's say [noise] back in the Bush years it took a lot longer for that process to play through to the market\nThis year or or or these days I don't know that that's the case actually on on aluminum and steel because when you talk about the basis of the of manufacture the base material for so much manufacturing you're going to have ... have already seen a number\nOf industries scream over the the aluminum and steel chairs ... so that's likely going to play itself out naturally the way it did during the Bush years well\nYou ... and a lot of financial publications just over the last five days saying oh\nThe indicators are already in that the economy is starting to slow down in the United states and also in China because of the tariffs that had been there and as we subtle along we believe that the president was absolutely wrong to isolate the United states if you wanted to isolate China\nBecause of their unfair trading practices here that you could win me if you didn't isolate yourself if you ... the goals should have always been isolate China don't isolate yourself because you are going to have basically the same free trade agreement that you have\nRight now with Canada Mexico in Europe were all modern western civilizations ... you're not going to massively be able to put tariffs on all of their products and all of our products going free it doesn't work that way we knew it you're not going to get rid of the one hundred and fifty billion dollar\nA trade imbalance especially when you have such a huge investment surplus into the United states so we knew that wasn't going to happen\nAnd so to us we thought there was a lot of wasted energy and the administration trying to uh have such incredible trade war rhetoric with Canada Mexico when Europe when there was really no reason to have it\nAnd and with the Asian countries as as well but I Do think that when you see it you're going to see everybody claimed their little victory Sarah they're already saw in Canada saying okay this is a great deal of great deals so they're going to be promoting their victories it'll be interesting to see the media in the United states promoting what is viewed as a victory and as we said\nYou have to understand that when it comes to trade now a victory for a particular country is when the consumer has to pay more\nFor product yeah that's how posterior backwards we are on ... it's a victory our consumers pay more\nBut somehow that's\nThat's the way that it is it so that's how it's promoted yet I was promoted that's the one that ... that have that the political positive right is what they say we're hurting the economy slightly have guns [laughter] that's because the consumers pay because the consumers pay right\nAnd if the idea is protectionism which it is for targeted industry which it is then by definition you're asking well you're allowing that industry\nTo raise its prices it's not just about being the tariff is about paying the higher prices for the industry that you say you're protecting\nAnd it's the first initial impacts as we've always talked about the initial impact as when you see that there's an over supply in the market and they can't sell it for as we've seen with the with the many different growers in the United states\nWhen the Chinese tariffs hit and then they had to sell it you know that's what it initially happens at rock bottom prices are you know everything because they need to get rid of it\nAnd then when the adjustment gums those prices will go the way up\nRight these they'll go way up afterwards after you get rid of the stock the demon tore that you already have that you have to get rid of and that's why you had so many was the pork producers of Iowa it killed over the last four to five months and because of those particular terrorists because they had to drastically lower for as we saw it all on\nA economics is simply how people respond to incentive\nThat said ...\nOr ... or you can say this and set up and send them one way distance that's it ... or anything else his opinion and the president can change that\nNobody can change that you can you can distort the markets you can help one industry wall hurting another industry but you can't change how people respond to it and send them a disincentive and so when you do that\nWhen you decide to raise prices you hurt the overall economy if you decide to raise taxes whether it's income tax for attacks through tariffs you hurt industry\nYeah\nAnd it's that simple and I don't decide that Aaron doesn't just so we get people mad when we say that or do some tax is helping economy no no\nNo no [noise]\nThey hurt an economy and so I'm\nA I Can't change that you can't change that none of us can change if the president can change it all you do is to start the market in some way\nAnd that's the that's the only effect of it and then ... then there's inevitably the reaction against that\n\nBecause when the economy if the economy starts thinking they've steel and aluminum products start skyrocketing which they will\nBy definition then the consumer is going to react to that with the consumer reacts to that the economy\nChanges that's when you have to have another political answer which is the opposite political answer that you gave the first place you undo what you did eventually\n[noise] a lot of a of our listeners lined up to talk about cabinet or the FBI investigation was some audio coming up to your calls and coming up next if you
