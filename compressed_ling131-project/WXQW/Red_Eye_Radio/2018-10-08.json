and information six sixty you execute W Barrow Moby on cumulus station\n[noise] limo crash tropical storm Michael but only a princess who investigations were underway until the worst transportation crush among us since two thousand nine after twenty people on the way we're birthday celebration more killed among women working upstate New York to count the bomb reporter\nStretch SUB little didn't stop at an intersection in the town of scary according to New York state police and it rammed a parked car in a restaurant parking lot all Eighteen people inside the limo including the driver were killed according to W. needs to bring in Chris Fiore super do treat him standing nearby [noise]\nWe're also structure insurance witnessed is that it appeared that the limo was speeding down the hill leading to the intersection but officials weren't sure yet how fast it was going but we do not have an estimate of the time is for the rest of the national Transportation Safety board is also investigating the captain Brett\nKavanaugh's confirmation to the Supreme Court has put a spotlight on but dozens of federal cases putting the Trump Administration against democratic leaning states we're all on a host of issues including healthcare immigration auto emission standards and a free flowing Internet\nBut in the great middle\nBecause it makes sense to them clearly independence understand the presumption of innocence clearly they understand due process under the law\nThe polls showed that Democrats me they just wish to ignored\nBecause what they want now is more important than anything it is about their day to day politics and so I think it's just important just alone at picking their and then I Move on\nTo ... do you remember how to do anything\nNo men were maybe ... maybe we're a little bit more content but we understand because we've been doing this for such a long time is just one battle and it's not over the next battles in a couple of weeks well it's a couple of things\nThe um the the the whole idea\nOf of this there are two parts of this the political part of it and the question is is a greater motivator a greater motivator for the right or greater motivator for the Web or a greater motivator for the center\nYou know the left a you know says there are since Saturday evening while we're more motor ... motivated now well that's what the press will have you believe we'll see about that um will look at early voter turnout as we always do\nBut really even with the right now I Know I Know the motivation on the right there we know that so\nThat's not going to go away or the motivation in the middle that's the question that's where you win the elections and so you look at the undecideds and how many of the key races right now are undecided\nOr have a great number of undecideds are certainly to the extent that they can throw that election one way or the other that grew going one way or the other end turnout\nIs is is the key so beyond that\nThe win at the highest court\nRemains to be seen because we have to go back to chief justice Roberts twice ... rewriting Obamacare for the from the bench is a victory and not the left did not get their way and their attempt to destroy the process I'm certainly\nThey they just started\nThe process will see what happens to it next time there is a a an opening on the high court and if this president is still president ah how that goes but ultimately\nNow you're going to have to wait and see what what Kavanaugh's does on the bench what effect the ultimately has and that won't be seen for years and so the when there is that it's a ... game\nAs we have been saying for for many years going back to Andrew Breitbart and his comments to us during the twenty twelve race\nAnd talking about how important the Supreme Court was when we asked the question why should we support or should conservatives support a moderate white\nRomney at the time for for president and his answer with SCOTUS\nAndrew Breitbart censor was very clear and it is an odds game because you can support\nOf John Roberts anew Gorsuch or Brett Kavanaugh\nAnd through all of it you still may not get those decisions you think you're going to get its always intriguing but sometimes it's disappointing and how they decide and we'll again we won't be able to see that effect or if that's going to happen\nUh for many years ultimately on the court term there will be cases where his decision will be key in those cases but we'll see how he decides and and what his thinking is in those opinions as they come across\nRight I mean as for what it's about if if you look at his judicial history I Would say that\nAre most likely I'll agree with eighty percent of what he may be eighty five to Ninety I don't know that between eighty and Ninety percent all agree I'm a ... with him you know we we talk about\nA true construction of some and by the way when we talk about remember what was that the or was it the location device so the location of ice on the cars\nAre ... what was the case that everybody has a cell tower K wasn't the cell tower tell you there for everybody where everybody said we're we're especially the never Trump first came out and said see folks you didn't you say he sided with all the liberals the student you didn't get your judge\nMhm and then we had to point out as many other people did no uh actually on that particular case it was the liberals on the court\nOr and and the Gorsuch that actually used the Scalia ruling a you know Scalia was probably the ... the the most\nConstruction as judge of of my lifetime paying attention to what the Supreme Court has a has a has has done Clarence Thomas always is not always the construction is right\nClarence Thomas will a judge based on at times based on what he views as a conservative win for the day but that's not what I'm looking for I'm never looked for that I Want that stuff but the legislature to decide to meet is these are all constitutional issues on one judges the litter the Constitution's say does it say that\nNo well then it's not up to me to put that in don't bend the constitution or straight from the constitution in order to fit your political agenda right so I'd say ... I'd say if I look at a a a a a Clarence Thomas he's probably about ... ah Scalia was almost Ninety nine probably Ninety nine percent\nJust doing it off the top of my head Clarence Thomas probably somewhere between Ninety and Ninety five percent depending depending on the year [laughter] yeah and and what I'm hoping is that you have a a you know you have a cabin off that uh would get to the Ninety percent level at least ah for me on\nOn the on on the important cases I'll be very pleased to greater than that but again nobody expected Roberts to rewrite Obamacare\n... and and then you look at some of his other cases you're like Oh absolutely right absolutely right absolutely right absolutely right so\nI'm a again this to me was about\nThe greatest thing that came out of this besides getting a ... Supreme Court justice that isn't a\nA roof gator ... Ruth Bader Ginsburg ... is the fact that you and I talked about the the left has made it very clear what they want\nA but I don't think that the Republican Party a\nI think a lot of conservatives knew this was this was a a part of who they were I don't think a lot of the moderates in the Republican Party thought they they were\nA and I will say some of the moderates that were never Trump or some of the conservatives that were never Trump per se but\nTo see it in action and to see them look to see the debate points that they were bringing up to see what they want it done to see that they rejected\nThe mindset of due process the mindset of a a presumption of\nInnocence stereotyping and that their convenience all women are to blame unless you're deals those type of woman over there and wait to one of the stories I saw is that now Democrats are starting to blame white women for Kavanaugh being put in well wait a minute I thought women were always right right\nAnd then I then they started the blaming of Eddie\nAnd the case that he will wait a minute thought the woman was women were always right there I haven't had a case of too many holes that well that's the whole point that the ... the so now we're just in a comparison of holes in a case where you are stating that and so they're all over the place and what it comes down to is\nThey're just trying to fit in an argument to fit their narrative at the moment in order to get the judge in that will fulfill their liberal desires and a judge that will legislate for them they're all over the place on their opinions\nAs\nTheir opinions don't have their opinions on their goalpost move all over the place right\nSo to me it was the fact that you were able to see\nThe left and them and not just the far left\nWhat you saw because we normally get calls where people will say well that's not the mainstream of the Democratic party what you saw over the last two weeks was the mainstream of the Democratic party\nIn Washington DC the leadership of the Democratic party that were jacked due process under the law reject a presumption of innocence\n\nAnd we'll slander and defame somebody's\nCharacter without evidence to do so yeah\nAnd I think a lot of I'll tell you I had a conversation with independent Bob yesterday boy he was running he was the burn in my ear ah because ah as you said you know and and I've talked about independent Bob for years and used to vote for Democrats he's sort of tell me how I can never vote for democratic get ever\nEver when I'm being told what white males thanks as always wrong and white men are always evil and women are always to be bullied because everybody knows that's not true right\n\nThat's where they are so we'll get to that or by the way last year was getting

express of what I\nYou know what I Believe so we've often talked about the fact that the left does not and this is the main stream it a lot does not believe in the first amendment they don't believe in freedom of speech I don't believe in freedom of religion the second amendment it's obvious they don't believe in the second amendment\nThey believe it's antiquated they don't believe in due process or under the law you and I talked about this during\nUh during the uh uh uh during the whole ... of Ferguson case isn't when you had a when you had a a Eric Holder and you had\nThe president giving their opinion on it when they didn't know what happened right and we said you can't be doing that just shows you don't believe in due process under the law you can't be indicted unless you know\nYou've got to take each case individually if you're not\nThen you don't believe in due process what we've seen this year the mindset of due process because what you did have heard was a political trial yes uh it wasn't a civil trial wasn't day it wasn't a a of a criminal\nI also bought many aspects of a real trial were there you're under oath mhm and you can be you can go to jail there was a legal setting it was illegal it's it's a legal maybe a political legal setting might not be a criminal trial or a civil trial but it was a trial where many\nOf the enforcement of a trial a ... like when you testify if you commit perjury you can go to jail\nFor that and they didn't believe in due process or under under the law they didn't believe in a presumption of innocence none of that mattered to them then we got to Trump putting the presidency and they didn't believe in the electoral college anymore\nNow this one when you have a ... and this is this is going to pick up now because the oh wow we forgot the Senate\nAh that ah now that the the the Senate has and we told you this was coming if you've been listening to show the last couple of years we told you the next thing they were going to try to get rid of was the Senate well\nIf you don't want the Senate if you don't want the electro college if you believe that the Supreme Court is the legislative branch and should be making up law when that was not their intent when you don't believe in the first amendment\nWhen you don't believe in the second amendment when you don't believe in due process under the law when you don't believe in Britain the presumption of\nInnocence\nYou really don't believe in this country you have no idea what the country's about and\nWe understand now on the show we believe that that the majority of our audience and the majority of conservatives understands the separation of powers we've talked about that a lot we've talked about how the majority of America though so close to Seventy five percent does not\nBut if you understand the concept of the are by camera legislature you understand why we have a house of representatives you understand why we have a set it you understand why Great Britain has a house of lords in the house of commons\nYou understand that the founding fathers of the United states\nThey wanted a separation of powers the thing that they were most scared of\nWas that a particular group\nOr either in particular group of ... a a a person\nA small group of people a particular kind of a legislature or a court or presidency\nThey were scared to death that\nPower could be concentrated in one of those areas and they ... they were trying to avoid that more than anything because they had looked at the history of the world\nAnd\nSaying how authoritarianism works and they didn't want it and the by camera legislature was a compromise made by the Congress\nAnd when you look at it the house of representatives or you have I think fifty three house members in California only one in Wyoming\nWhy bigger population and California fewer people in a few in Wyoming both have\nTwo senators a that was done for a reason that was done sold the house would more represent the United states\nBy population and by region\nBut the Senate and at one end and by the way the the reason that are you a are elected for two years is so you're closer to the people more accountable to the people if they wanted they believe that the house of representatives\nWould be closer to mob rural been set [laughter] and but so they they but they wanted it they wanted the the the Congress\nTo be closer to the people small areas you know of the country where you represented you know that area of the country and you had more power of the state\nBecause if you had more population and a bigger state you more representation in the house\nBut they also wanted and every state wanted the ability\nTo have some kind of equal employed so the big states could not rule over the little states yeah that was the reason for it the reason the bill of rights exist the reason that we are and constitutional Republican not a direct democracy is why\nSeparation of powers and also protection of individual rights and protection of states' rights\nAnd that's why it was done and do things move slower yes but\nFounding fathers were worried so much about legislation moving slowly through\nThey preferred that then mob rule the reason the electro college ... exist today is so you can't have Marlboro or you can't have the\nBig states not knowing what the future was going to be in this country where the big states would totally dominate in the executive branch mhm it was all it was all thought up not to to have the separation of powers so power cannot congregate in one area\nAnd as we said when it comes to the by camera legislature to give them to give the people one body which is the house\nAnd then the Senate which is to per state which is six\nYears so they could

understands that at all or\nCares to understand I don't think they care about it\nBecause what they want is again a and as they often engage in and fantasy that create and there might a fantasy of what the nation should be I mean they create a in their mind a fantasy of what the what the government should be giving you every day\nSo the makeup of that government needs to change to fit that fantasy most often they're okay with doing that they don't understand the process they don't care to understand the process\nThey don't care why it was set up this way\nAnd you know it's interesting

I ... I Know when the Republican base is motivated\nUm\nAnd they are quite motivated right now I\nDon't know\nThat they're uh they're motivated and their unified or when when I saw that what George W. Bush how many times and he called college ... he called her numerous times during this whole process is George W. Bush mhm to push for a Trump\nNominee mhm for for the Supreme Court that says you're not at everybody and I think one of the reasons that you not everybody is look\nWe dealt with Trump for the last two years the people in the Republican Party but just can't stand up and all of a sudden the last three weeks I woke up and what hoops he as you were really not our enemy\nIs really not our political enemy there may be some things that we don't like we don't like his tone way to like this we don't like it'd be exaggerates we don't like when he doesn't tell the truth at times but\nHe's a lot better than these insane people on the other side I Believe that that's what a lot of ... maybe not all but I think it's a ... well it was just that everybody except Bill Kristol [noise]\n[laughter] well [laughter]\nIt's interesting [laughter] and that's not going to happen\nAnd when George Will um but they [laughter] what the the the the the idea if you look at it and I I find it kind of a\nInteresting that the George W. Bush the same presidents who said well signing campaign finance and the law I Know parts of this are unconstitutional but I'll let the courts work it out [noise] called columns to make sure that the court gets it right um but but [laughter]\nThat that idea of selling the way right by the way great observation I miss yeah well I I just uh you know but but certainly anyone from the Bush family doing anything to support a a Trump nominee is is definitely notable but it also goes beyond what we as well it goes right to what we will set and goes beyond the\nThe political aspect of this and removes it from the current White House because\nIt is about the long term makeup of the court and George W. Bush of course recognizing that I'm certain um as many of us do and\nIt is also recognizing a indirectly and while we haven't and I would love to hear from the former president on this or asking the question\nUh if if it is the case with him we pointed out it is the work that the president does now we can go back and forth on the comments made a the and the communication errors and and things even on the issues that we disagree with\nAh we ... we are the original terrorist babies [laughter] and then have those discussions but we said from the beginning it is the reason that knew from the beginning so you know ultimately with your vote that it becomes\nWell as it always is that binary decision\nAnd then along the way regardless of whether or not and I saw somebody in my neighborhood with for Ted Cruz signs in their yard I thought you know not one\nNot too but a total of four\nThey're really really voting for Ted Cruz and so our time and time\nI'm ... and and I thought I thought to myself you know okay that's that's a that kind of enthusiasm um even if we were to show that uh we don't do when we don't do endorsements because again as we mentioned earlier I don't believe they really do anything and tells it it might tell your audience which way you're going but\nThere are the the point is is that we have the discussion\nOn the ideas and we believe that our audience and the rest of the country is smart enough to make their own decisions they may be willfully ignorant not our listeners but\nOthers may be willfully ignorant along the way they can make their decision or you know or are there still capable of finding the information whether they choose to or not but ultimately it is about\nAh when that person is elected if I\nIf I'm campaigning for them if I'm doing a a volunteer work for them if I donate to their campaign I'm skills from day one going to watch them on on the issues on their work you judge them on the work and then of course a head of that work\nYou are back them in order to you know uh to to have them do that work to keep them in place to do that work and you see a George W.

but\nThat's that's why you can't find for a lot of them you really can't it's hard to I identify with them and\nFor most Americans that is you know again the idea of a peaceful protest and standing up for what you believe people are quick do you know speak out and that that there is a pollster that calls whether it's kneeling in the NFL or any other as you know I Believe people should\nI have the right to be heard but how many people actually do it are active in protests most people are not the overwhelming majority or not and in fact if you didn't have a you know a Soros organization or any or the organization or that I mean we can go back to Ferguson\nFerguson vein authorities they they told they were quick to tell your look we've got people that aren't even from the state that have come here from a long ways away\nAnd that was clearly organized so when it comes down to\nHow many people are actually willing to get out there to the extent that are driven and motivated to the extent that they would get out there if not part of some kind of organization I'm\nWell we're we're the Facebook crowd a pollster calls oh yeah yeah well and so the poll a Facebook ...\nFor their own will click the like and we share it we might read tweeted but the fact of the matter is is what is it I guess the question is what is it that really drives most Americans it's the everyday things in our lives\nAnd when we go back to the point that you brought up earlier we we talked about last week\nThat the majority of Americans it was somewhere around sixty percent that said well if there was nothing to corroborate claims from this additional background check on Capitol Hill we that sixty percent saying he should be confirmed well that's a big deal now it's not eighty percent Ninety percent\nOf sixty percent will win you a fuel elections and the point being is that we stepped back from the insanity and the display the show that's being put on by the left here\nAnd the behavior by the left I mean I'm not saying it's not real I'm not saying people aren't going to react to it ah you know cirrhosis can can back\nWhatever he wants to and people can act the way they want to and even on the Senate Judiciary committee they can say the most insane things if they believe what's going to get them political points well it just might\nIn your state of Hawaii or California but if you believe it's going to win the argument with the people of America you're flat\nOut wrong and and that's why I think that and and again this is a not a an analysis of facts right this is just my my gut feeling from what I what I've seen\nWhat I've heard the personal response that I just generally talk to people over the last uh a couple of weeks were more independent or non political who\nHave paid attention to this and even though they do sympathize and because this is one of the things would just\nReally ticked off a ton of people including a ton of women that I Know and that are that are of more ... a more conservative was if you didn't believe her\n... and you're for rape ...\nIf you don't believe in the rape if you don't believe in the rape allegation\nAlone without cooperating\nEvidence if you don't absolutely believe the allegation been near as much a rapist yourself because you're enabling rape and our society right well\nThat kicked off a ton of women that I Know who just went wait a minute and I gave you the example two of my my buddy independent Bob\nWho said what what's the thing that you always believe the woman you don't believe anything but it ends and to me that's where the Democrats jump the shark\nIs ... ... most Americans which is why you see the sixty percent and I bet you that sixty percent I bet you that other forty percent that said we don't want to confirm Kavanaugh had nothing to do was just the fact that they'd rather have a more liberal judge or Trump pick somebody they don't want him\nBut I guarantee you that the majority of Americans looked at that process and said\nNo you don't always believed the woman you have to have evidence you don't believe always believe the man you don't always believe the woman you don't always believe anybody hits the evidence that you make the judgment on\nAnd yeah the senators are accusing him of being a rapist with all the evidence without the evidence and in fact their kids and being a gang rape is\nWith all the evidence of of being there they say believe all women or men or women don't tell the truth but it's a majority doesn't matter that's why we judge every case individually because that's the only way that you can do it in America and I do believe\nThat ... Americans understand that they understand the basic fairness\nAnd when they see I'm not just the radicals but the mainstream of the Democratic party the mainstream of the party that are arguably has more people supporting it mhm\nNot by much but maybe more people supporting it then the Republicans mhm just looking at the last election on the popular vote out the electoral college vote\nOr when they see that they say I don't really wished to be a part of that that's just that's crossing the line that that's no type of and and and when you find out that you know the the fact is they're the ones that burned Dr Ford it was a Dianne Feinstein shame burn\nVictim Chinese though one that wouldn't team the anonymity of the victim but it was the ... who leaked it it was the Democrats right it was either find find signs office or one of her staffers or it was the the the congresswoman mhm\nRight was it was that or her staff that said it had to be one of those two right\nAnd so when you look at it use all you see his from the Democrats is manipulation across the board character assassination across the board not no belief and the presumption of innocence the stereotyping\nThe bigotry all women all need to be believed a white man in white men are white men can't and people look at that this day and age and it's just like stomp it\nWell I think you two we have to keep in mind the and this isn't a this was recent history we don't have to go back and so the Democrats in the sixties recent history you have in it because again\nThe same side that said we're going to stand up for women called the women who voted for Trump self massage ... yep\nThey in fact the candidate herself after she lost said well the problem is\nIs that women listen to their husbands husbands tell them how to vote ... stupid because your husband has to tell you how about your son even your boss tells you how to vote your stupid and can't make a decision for yourself\nWhat which is that Democrats\nThere to be believed well not if they vote with their hearts and minds and the twenty sixteen election against Hillary no theirself massage ... which for ... they will tell you for whatever reason they hate women\n... history headlines right here or San Francisco chronicle activists blame white women after Susan Collins sociable per capita off right ah [laughter] ah critics blame white women the rap after Susan Collins a a a cabin up a a\nSpeech because we're amber was women women or worthy oppress women were the victims in general until they lost and now it's that women of color are the victims\nThey blame white women well I don't know Dr forged genetic makeup or her her ethnicity background but she appears\nTo be and a white woman and and what it comes across as is you just will do anything to get a win right you won't show compassion to of victim\nYou will slander people you will defame people you will say that the presumption of innocence should not be part of the the the process you say at one point that all women should be believed than you demonize other women\nAre there is no consistency to the mindset except we will do anything to get a win and I do believe that's why you had the reaction of many independents who say there's a complete\nTotal lack of any type of fairness any type of ... it's the Democrats were screaming for civility like McCain and as you and I said after the McCain's funeral we said by the way this week on Monday\nMhm this will be gone as soon as a hearing so there's just all completely gone and you've seen them taking it up to a level where there was a possibility that McCain was alive today and he and Lindsey Graham would have stood\nSide by side yes I could see a ... a John McCain\nAfter the behavior of the weapon this process making the same type of comments that Lindsey Graham make eight six six Ninety red eye\nDoes your basement or crawl space of a damp must be smell will watch out\nThat's a sign of too much moisture and not enough ventilation and that could mean increase to mold growth and build up a harmful toxins gases\nDon't bother with a D humidifier just circulates the same on healthier now there's a better way to remove these dangers in odors it's with the computerized wave ventilation unit that reduces moisture and expelled pollutant\nWith wave unit there are new buckets of water or filters and they cost only pennies a day to run wave can transform your home and do it drier healthier environment satisfaction guaranteed ask\nAbout our indoor air package that includes the wave ventilation unit plus so stick stage portable air purifier dealer opportunities available for more information visit drawing house now dot com that's drawing house now dot com or coal eight eight eight nine seven nine wave that eight eight eight nine seven nine W.

opinion because it does it was so did the ... case make the forward ... case heard it and then the banana case heard it even more yes but it all starts with the fact that the first case\nWas not credible yes so if we're mirrors would have come out first\nThat might have been the first one and then force would have been viewed as not credible because she couldn't remember the majority of the incident from that night except that was one hundred percent Brett Kavanaugh well and and I think\nThat's you you look at that are like the the and again it than a quarter public opinion when when we're forming opinions but it is often foreign through information that as\nA given to us by the media and and the people that represent\nAnyone making the claims but if you look at the winds teen cases right\nMhm what did we we started everything started to be corroborated through through uh the well not just the number of people coming forward and others who said that they were aware of this kind of activity but then ultimately his own from that essentially had to pay schedule find schedule\nBase on this kind of behavior if he were to be caught\nAnd and so\nThere were things where again if if if Ford made the claims and couldn't get anything to substantiate those planes that were nothing there and then Ramirez came forward and their war and then a third accuser came forward and she had things to back up her claim\nThat case would have been hard for the president or Kavanaugh to deny those cases collectively as one big situation that Kavanaugh would have been facing\nBut that didn't happen\nEnergy ... were we and the only one that the only reason the Ford came out as because it was leaked yes and so that it would not it\nWas an all likelihood would have never come out even gone through the proper a judiciary a of\nWay if ... if I Would have taken it immediately and taken into Grassley then it would have gone to the FBI didn't do a background check but everything would have been anonymous and what and what the what\nYou just heard too was the failure to recognize how Ford's story changed you know and and they talk about how the ... story change how the sweat story changed\nBut look at how the Ford story changed but but the point was on the political picture of being believable the scenario that was that was their\nStarted with a he said or she said he said\nWell then are we developing a pattern with the second and third no they fell apart and then we look back at the first one and realized it also changed and was falling apart what they what they were trying to point out here was\nShe could have been the victim the one person to centrally if she were to give him a Dr Ford or to have given her testimony and nothing else happened she could have been the one and it could have been at least plate or spend with out the evidence to back it up in a way that might have influenced boats\nBut because of the behavior and they mentioned ... making the or the you know talking about having these role in her speech\nBut it's\nThat happened all of that happened because of what because the left and made it happen because the people sitting on this panel helped make it happen\nTo you and you think about it too because of the narrative that every woman must be believed mhm and after Ford and again her story was like a story itself is incredible yet right being told that was their major talking point you've got to believe\nThat the the alleged victim the alleged victim as a woman alleged victim must be believe we've seen the science we know it\nMust be ... and then you get a second and third\nThat also are not credible then you start destroying that narrative at that point for it I Believe that's what they're probably saying even though they are the ones that plane you need to believe all the women all the time and they help even that you know they're they're yeah they're just you know even Chuck Todd is making the point about that really isn't\nTrue yeah well itself is the this is the version of a right after the twenty sixteen election or we need to go to the heartland and listen to their voices ... yeah that's basically what you see except for the fact\nThat it had greater substance and ... and relevance to I mean they ... they were right by the way in in in November twenty sixteen when they said that but there was no expectation they were going to do just that in this case they're looking back on it and and recognizing\nAnd again they were part of carrying that narrative\nHelping to form those narratives along the way and then saying yeah well we shouldn't have played it that way it shouldn't have been played that way you when the when you look at but we'll have an eddy a stormy Daniels'\nCase that\nAnd no one absolutely no one is shocked\nThat a playboy billionaire had an affair no and again not shocked not surprised and also\nNot politically motivated either way by it but the left creates these narratives they give out in the ... the the ability to introduce the credibility if you will from their perspective not ours\nTo introduce the sweat and they claim\nIt must be because he's got a legitimate claim and legal claim against Trump now there must be something that he's got was sweating it must be legit\nIt's against Trump Trump so it has to come out because ... must be some legitimacy to it even if there is that right ... the the only other point that I'd like to make is because this is what I Wonder and again this is a completely totally unfounded allegation without anything to back it up whatsoever but everybody will understand my point\nWhat is Joe Manchin have on Schumer [laughter]\nAnd Feinstein and and what does he have a Democrat leadership nobody's calling for a primary challenger to him in the next\nElection nobody is criticizing Joe mansion from the left at All right that Democrat wire their screams that he should be kicked out of the party where is that

need to find somebody who as Susan Rice spoke up\nWho will challenge her next election Susan ... always wrong Susan Rice said it's a woman who\nGot on TV and lie on fire syntax Americans leave some kind of credibility that Democrats made and\nAnd then and then I thought to myself well wait a minute how many of these liberals on social media wouldn't vote for Susan Collins has she voted\nNo on
