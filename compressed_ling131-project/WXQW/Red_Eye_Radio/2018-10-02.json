{"month": "10", "state": "AL", "station": "WXQW", "content": "The other part that has ever been telegram is that the Germans are going to begin under strict is that the unrestricted warfare was always part of a German plan of aggression to intimidate the Americans that's critical because there was a war party at an anti war party in the Congress the anti war party is very suspicious is telegram\nSuits the purposes of wide hall of the British Empire of law at George David law George the new prime minister out of money out of time they know that the British are are desperate and probably should be seeking piece terms or some armistice in fact the president at Christmas Nineteen sixteen in January Nineteen Seventeen\nWhat the president a Wilson was often in the headlines leading a peace idea an arbitration idea with himself as a referee so all of a sudden the referee is compromise but not yet the president is not ready to go to war he's holding back\nOne of the tests that they go through in order to convince Congress that the Germans are aggression aggressive and that the British did not concoct is is they want demonstration\nThat the Americans had the ability to solve this code ... one of the themes I Love more than any other than your book Thomas when a degrading job the gray the crypt analysis expert in Broome forty you actually did part of the decoding\nOthers ... telegram takes an American named bell into the ... office into ... office and allows bell or participates in belle\nTranslating that they had to demonstrate that the Americans had the ability to translate it it was a theater piece Thomas it was a fiction but haul got away with heart\nYes while they're far you're absolutely right what happened was you know when the kilogram as publisher march first there's a debate in Congress\nAnd to many um you know many many representatives and senators are skeptical and say well ... where it was actually coming from and suspicion was that this was given by Great Britain to the United states in order to bring the United states the war and this is actually voice in this congressional debate and this was ... true\nI'm ... now the Wilson Administration um then as you said I'm I'm a meeting arranges for um a Mr bell from the American embassy in London\nUm along with all the crypt this telegram [noise] um the evidence is that actually is unable to do so and then degrade takes over and do that for him\nBut then the American the American administration can truthfully say this was captured encrypted by an American I'm a so they wouldn't have to lie to Congress and say\nAh you know this ... this one actually true in in in in a in a shallow fence um but the greater truth of course was it\nYeah what they did either British call the Arab the third kind they answered the question uh they answered the wrong question very and very detail so I'll ask the right question in Iraq and in fact\nHall had constructed the ... of the telegram when it got to Mexico City or intercepting it so that they could do the code on code that\nAnd present that is if they'd interrupted the Mexican uh the Mexican reception of the\nA telegram what's critical here is that there was an agent network stringing between Berlin and London and New York and Washington on the Mexico City and you've solved all this Thomas in one of the joys of reading your book let's go to march second the route the roundtable dining club in New York\nHow the guest of honor that night as a man named captain guy gaunt around him are a lot of pro war big deals including of course the former ambassador to US ambassador to Britain Joseph ... chose\nAnd a captain gone to roll maybe it's challenged is this a fraud did you do this is this your scheme and captain gone does not tell the truth Thomas it's a joy to see him\nMislead the war party to their satisfaction people want to be convinced but gone reports to haul the Nineteen out of twenty American gentleman believe this is the fraud\nThat that's right I mean that in that that is that is very doubtful if if that was actually true to me it seems that when this telegrams that she published on march first Nineteen Seventeen ... the debates\nIt's more well is it can we take that seriously you know this this is so outrageous um um is this something to be taken seriously and you mentioned the roundtable um um dinner um how how easily these these pro American ... pro war parties companies and it goes to show\nThe telegram very quickly becomes a political tool in the United states there's really not so much about\nIs this a veritable threat I don't think many people believed that Germany mix the coal ah you know were physically capable of invading the United states and just membrane yet\nUm but for the pro war party it becomes you know yet another tool in their push for war a but then you also have the anti war party that dismisses this telegram is something ridiculous this can't be taken seriously you this is just a [noise]\nUh this is this is this is just a sign of how desperate the Germans are so um it is often has often been sad that the telegram or sort of the Pearl harbor off World War one and my argument is no no it really was and it was not it was\nUm if anything it prove divisive because it reinforced pro war sentiment were already exist that um but even after the publication of telegrams you have a very strong um um peace movement I'm antiwar sentiment in the United states\nAnd the telegrams is not unlike Pearl Harbor able to to rally the public behind 'em ... American administration going to war and when America does enter the war in ... in Seventeen my thesis is\nIt is a much more divided country than for instance Germany France and Britain were Nineteen fourteen and you can see evidence of that after the war\nWhen ah America has not signed\nA peace treaty of Versailles retreat into isolationism and really comes out of it only when Pearl Harbor all curse I'm socialism and telegram dots play a role in American domestic politics and not in Seventeen but not in the sense that it unites the American public um for intervention\nDid not unite in fact you asked cabbage the fact that the anti war faction was determined to believe that America has been tricked regardless of the ... men telegram and at the end result the hundred and thousand American casualties ... did not\nMatch the uh the cameraman telegram or the so called threat of the German the Mexicans and the Japanese that was fantastic and it was used as a as a ... but that it was the illegitimate that's what they believed even in Nineteen Eighteen is that correct\nThat is correct of course in in a narrow ... until I grow most true it was not a fraud and there were not people who are saying was the front of the same time\nThe suspicion at the time I'm by by isolationist or non interventionist senators and newspapers was that this was playing to the American I by the British with a goal of getting Americans of the war and this was of course exactly uh what had happened\nAt the facts matter solved by Thomas Bogart that there are men telegram intelligence diplomacy and America's entry into World War one hates important to know how it all started on John ...\n\n[noise]\nWhat public safety message from FEMA\nThe best time to prepare for hurricane is right now here's

says we'll talk with Brett Kavanaugh's high school friend mark judge but they say the interview is not complete the moral majority leader Mitch McConnell wants the chamber to vote on the nomination this week course one or two men who\nHas the story has been shifting in terms of what the limitations on what the FBI can do I've actually been told multiple senators have reached out to the White House Susan Collins in particular was in counsel patience with the White House about making sure that there were limits on what the FBI can do now it's worth noting when the discussions were hat on friday about the scope of the investigation\nThe focus was really on the first two accusers not the third accused of the one represented by Michael I have a lot of white\nHouse has issued new guidelines for the investigation clearing FBI agents to interview anyone they want to change coming after Democrats question the narrow scope of the investigation of the city of Las Vegas came together Monday to mark the one year anniversary of the deadliest shooting a murder in us history by dedicating a memorial garden to the people killed and the roads were\nYou know so many things have changed in this entire thing you could look at their claims and depending on what is said to the FBI and these interviews\nCould be looking at perjury for Dr Ford and I think this is what her attorneys\nAre worried about I think it's why they were so anxious over the weekend remember they said over the weekend we've contacted the FBI trying to set up the interview and as a Sunday they were saying you know no interview yet they haven't talked to her well why would you want to do it so soon after testimony\nBecause you want to keep her on track you don't want to change her story\nNow the FBI is not going to do anything against her and I don't know that there would be any action against er except for the fact\nShe was under oath last Thursday so whatever she said then her comments to the FBI are part of the process of vetting Kavanaugh\nAnd if they differ from her testimony there will be questions and so the the leftist coming out and this is why\nI think they're also going for perjury or for Kavanaugh they keep making up these bogus perjury things that aren't going anywhere and all of them have to do with the amount of hours\nThe whole that he's drinking and he was never very ... and they had he said well listen I was very clear to only have a four four ounces of\n[laughter] talking to him and telling you that data okay for those under the age of Seventeen but you kind of him was a a character in a show called happy happy days yeah yeah\nBut it was on all through the eighties all Henri was ... and now Ritchie Cunningham as a as a as a liberal a director but his brother\nYes it's a conservative that's right and so he Ron Howard who were ... anyway so is that asks him well because then I you know I just had you know as these tiny little drain so I'm going to have Seventy\n[laughter] I I had I had a [laughter]\nI Love that episode that was great I'll I'll never forget a you know the the you know they're looking at that rich he says because he actually [laughter] Ron Howard ... trunk thought man that's good acting but if if Kavanaugh come out and make certain claims\nBy was clear to only have one drink at any function he didn't say that in fact at the time in my mind when I was watching it\nI was almost critical of him and I thought\nNo actually this is exactly how judges are they're very forthcoming especially about anything that they have done and their past or to this extent this is not criminal behavior to the of throwing\nThe laws exactly throwing the ice at a bar according to one police report they might have thrown ice right yes yeah and he never says he threw eyes but in the police report someone claims they threw eyes and the guy's ear was bleeding people's ears bleed altogether the or the IRS wants that from the U.S [laughter]\nThat was from the other person's throwing their big\nBig luck I'm paying attention to this becomes damaged I Need to know hey you know\nAll that matters is that it was listed as an assault and somebody was bleeding say you got to think like a liberal okay so this is but this is the ... the insanity\nBy the way you know I'm laughing I was a club DJ for years yeah I saw a massive bar fights and why\nWould I in my time and and and all the\nOil field workers and ... are probably asleep right now but out in West Texas or screaming the guy got to leave the bar with his ear intact oh [laughter] well the recall that a good day so here's the thing I'm [laughter] actually comes from a real scenario\n[noise] um but ... ... ... the entire equation has to be distorted and there has to be this distraction\nRight and now it's about what did he know when did he know what about the claims right\nBecause the text messages now show well that that he knew about the Ramirez claim ahead of time\nBefore it got to the media well okay here's here's the concern I think for the Democrats\nIs that the president has essentially directed the FBI to talk to anybody and everybody who might be relevant to the situation will that includes people who were supposed to have corroborated if they've got the FBI agent sitting in front of them\nThey're going to be nervous they're going to ... and and I wonder how the story is going to change and again if it does I Wonder where this thing\nGoes I just it just as you're talking about this just as we're talking about this this comes across ...\nAh from our news feed from uh from Westwood One okay our company guy set Westwood One news Eric Swalwell ... the the us representative from California and I taught her curls before this guy's a piece of work yeah and it just comes across as you're talking or just got to interrupt you but it's ...\nIt's a Swalwell Senate cabin off lies or just qualified and I went well what are the lies or above house right apparently\nI've ... I've not listen to this audio cup and I'm going to play it here okay but it's just a former college costs would have kept it also is a Supreme Court nominee was not truthful about his drinking mhm here we go All right let's play this\nTypically that's for not being to qualify for any Supreme Court nominee the fact that they drank in college like most people in college too however it is to qualify him because he has painted himself as a choir boy who never engaged in any of his behavior wrong and I'll say oh\nThey lie wrong there's Iraq is that the whole point is lying this qualifies you from the Supreme Court thing you need to step down from office\n[laughter] hope\nThey will say it again CNN during the interview over the weekend was one of them cabinets former classmates I Would have stayed on the sideline if he had said I drank to access in high school I drink to excess in college I did some stupid things but never sexually assaulted anybody\nHis actual comments I drank beer with my friends sometimes I had too many beers sometimes other does I like beer I still like beer but I didn't bring here to the point of black you know and I never sexually assaulted anyone\nWho have their [laughter]\nAnd that's it I Love to ramble is so hard right now frankly I won't leave the fears thank God gave me that there are all all well and this this entire thing as a gift\nTo the Republicans\nIf you're a Democrat right now you should be worried about this at this behavior right now by your party should concern you greatly because here's the difference the blue wave may happen in the house Nancy Pelosi I'm going to be speaker again\nI'm don't grab the keys just yeah than say even if you do when\nAnd the Senate\nHe went out you were going over some polls some recent polls are some that\nHad Thursday included but not just Thursday and that's that's important because of it right the hearing but if you look at these polls in the Senate they're very close right now and if you get a a a a couple of other seats a couple of more seats for the Republicans\nIn the Senate\nThey can afford to lose the columns on the next Supreme Court\nNominee I mean you you look at it I mean we were looking at uh the the New Jersey Senate ... a pug and versus a Menendez Robert Menendez the incumbent the Democrat incumbent right and and it says if you look at the real clear politics omen ended\nUp by for well the Quinnipiac poll in August when registered voters had him up by six the Stockton University poll that goes to the twenty seventh to last Thursday of likely voters that's more accurate\nOr a has a Menendez only up by two\nYeah and that's a margin of error for points rate\nWhile again this is not over\nAnd you're a Democrat who should be absolutely worried about this because I've I never in my lifetime in my adult lifetime\nI don't remember the Republicans being the help\nOf a and motivate Kramer over high camp and just out from the seventeenth or NBC valley news from the seventeenth to the twenty seventh there's just a came out alright six hundred and fifty likely voters he breaks the fifty one percent he's fifty one to forty one over Heidi Heitkamp yeah\nNow that goes to the twenty seventh or a Donnelly in a in ... in Indiana or the Fox news poll a but that goes to the that's the latest one of just until the eleventh of September but still a his ah his ah were Republican\nI'm a\nOpposition Braun is up by two now that was before any of this\nYou know 'cause the eleven that was really before we got into any of this and and so I just wonder really what the

out of a restaurant even though that same restaurant is now hired security guards\nIs they see it as well it worked and\nThis is why we're going direct this is why we will keep doing this because they believe again they're going to get the same reaction that they got out of Jeff Flake well\nNews flash he admitted in the sixty minutes interview if he were up for reelection that would've never happened you never would have gotten him together with Coons that agreement to delay this thing and have an FBI background check this week would never have happened he admitted that\nHe doesn't care what the people of Arizona think he doesn't care what the people think he only cares what the people think if it serves him him and so this entire equation\nUm ... is is the what they see is the momentum now\nThe problem the party has and by the way to the party we need to repeat these people don't care about you either they don't they don't care that Jeff Flake cat disdain as a Republican for Donald Trump\nAfter he got was tunes and they came up with this agreement to do this FBI background check they started screaming it's not enough\nAnd so they don't care about anybody in the party but the future of the party is certainly in question when this kind of behavior derives that and paints a picture for the rest of America and as you mentioned Gary earlier that\nTwenty percent of the

be it could be Mother Teresa alive and and\nThey would still not want him to be a confirmed the\nPoint is a ... is the evidence there\nTo make her testimony credible and it absolutely is not and that's the message that you need to get about you know you need to get across and there needs to be a consistent message there you go to social media and the questions are being asked are just are just bizarre and if you look at the media and\nThat's why we started off the show with us and when you look at what a a ... the uh uh uh ... um the the person who went to Yale with a glass having other classmates and you know and she came across instead of if you don't want all you'd said this and then you look at his testimony will he did say that\nThey're actually to the point now where the liberals this is how bad is you're asking will they ever get off the brink lower to the point\nWhere they're making an accusation he's line really yes he should've said this will he did say he's line no but you said if he said that it wouldn't be lying nobody's line but he said this\nI mean that's where we are right media carries the exam media gives it life because here's here's the difference if you look at the case of the New York times talking about the the ah\nThe accusations made and the New Yorker piece they this is what they wanted to do they want to do the their their tactic on this story this claim\nWas to go find an interview as many people as possible to see if they had first hand knowledge of this happening\nThey couldn't find one NBC goes out and says\nWell we couldn't find anybody to back it up but we're going to put her on anyway ... classmate actually makes a statement that parallels what Kavanaugh said and said if you said this then I wouldn't have a problem\nBut still the media carries the story because what you're looking to do is if I were writing that story if it were my work\nTo put that story and to print or put it on TV or anywhere else it would be my approach to say uh this is going to be torn to shreds because what she said and I need to go back over to this is what I Would do I would get the transcript and I\nWould read it and read it again because she's claiming the classmate is claiming he didn't say something when he did it's an all out lie but if you're in the media and you're taking that story to print a TV to whatever you're part of the lie\nBecause it took another media organization to tear it down and say well I'm actually he did say that\nOr does it ever feel like that and and and this does not come from\nArrogance whatsoever because you know that we're further ourselves Institute idiots overnight\nBut does anyone\nEver get the feeling and it's just as doesn't include just you and me are but everybody listening right there does it ever get to the point where you just think to yourself dealing with the Democrats right now the mainstream Democrats\nIs like dealing with our children yes any excuses the children will give yeah and I'm not saying that had died of meanness I'm Talking about the arguments that they are making you know you and I said this\nUh last week said the American people when you basically they understand due process\nAnd if you talk about the due process and what the Democrats are doing here and not the you know the belief and you know that you're innocent until proven proven guilty but the fact that what they used to claim they cared about you know that's what the liberals are to care about and in fact they do and I said but if you keep pushing it the majority of Americans\nDo believe in that even Democrats who say they won't vote for Kavanaugh they still view this as a cheap shot against him yes they view it as if you if you get them alone and you ask them\nThey'll tell you that oh by the way one of the uh people that I Know on social media that uh doesn't talk much used to talk more as a liberal and has been quiet over the last year came out in favor of Kavanaugh [laughter] wow\nAnd ended in a very subtle way and I was like wow but if you actually talk to Democrats right now they're not happy with the way that the ... the the this is actually going but they won't come out publicly and criticize\nTheir party for what they're doing but they feel very uncomfortable they understand there is no evidence here they understand it and they see this just rolling and ... and that's the whole point that many Republicans look at this and go while you can either going down this path\nAnd now they're they're just taking anonymous sources and throwing it out I mean this is just so slimy and so dirty them against capital because there is no cooperating evidence there is no evidence\nAnd look people aren't stupid that will sit\nThere and say this really stinks well in that sense it because it does ... they'll look at the forward and say\nAll these go find me accounts and other now of what\nA million or over a million dollars what are the world's going on here the lawyers were pro bono you're talking about an airplane flight\n... all this money being a rate it looks dirty yes it all looks dirty and the American public and that's why when you bring it up about the cooperation and when people actually look into it and you when you said earlier to me to a off the air\nYou said this is really liked the experience that we have\nWith Capra neck but he had all of knowing he had a cat regular it's about free speech to wired you're watching the well look I'm not angry it's just I don't prefer to watch it because of and you explain what he actually did and you explained the pig socks every single person that's supporting cap ... had no that that I've talked to\nAnd it's in the hundreds over the last year I had no idea about the cop ... once you bring that up to go to a good point no idea about Michael Bennet no idea that Michael Bennett who was the catalyst\nOne of the catalysts last year and has become one of the leaders of the movement who was also you know in the locker room yesterday for Philly ... got famous and became the poster\nPerson last year ... to continue with because he lied about the Las Vegas police every single person that was supporting cap and I didn't know about that either\nAnd I went oh okay yeah that is bad\nAnd I'll leave it at that I won't judge them and but you can tell they know when you bring up things that are common sense to people when you bring up something like fairness\nAnd the preponderance of evidence before finding somebody guilty than it has to exist somewhere there's a reason that NBC wouldn't run Mitchell's report why wouldn't they run it because\nThey know that even though there are a few listeners there doesn't listeners viewers ... that are left even if they're liberal would say\nYeah not not good right\nAnd\nWhy do you do that to adults why don't you want adults to know the truth right by we don't hide anything in the show there's nothing I Would hide\nAny news item I could care less I'll bring up anything that's going on out there why won't they right why will they hide things that are important\nTo a story and even if they disagree with it analyze it right but they they as we talked about before we talked last week about lines or omission ... and a lot of stories out there now right there's your life through omission we just won't include parts of it\nAnd if and while they'll give an interview to somebody who's making claims that they as a news organization couldn't even corroborate right they will ignore\nA key piece to the actual an official piece of the actual procedure the actual process in place\nThey ignored completely but when you give Americans when you start telling Americans will look here's what's going on with this case and you lay it out to them that's why all of a sudden you go to you know sixty percent say oh\nOr fifty percent ... percent say oh we didn't know okay yeah that that's that's wrong if there is no cooperation well and if the FBI finds out there is no one sixty percent of Americans believe it that's almost all of independence\nAnd\nYeah and that's what you're looking for that's what you're looking for in any election and we always get this and we talked about the administration and said look you could have more successes\nIf you have a consistent solid message day in and day out because\nNever convince the liberals that's not your goal is not your goal and and you know it's like Jeff Flake saying you know what I'm saying when I went to Coons I was just I was telling them this is tearing our country apart we have to we have to do something who's responsible for the dam\nRight you're going to the person it's tearing the country apart yes and telling me up to stop telling them you're coming over to our side or his position\nRight then and and then he then Coons goals you know Jeff Flake the hero really\nWho's tearing the country apart who was engaged in this kind of behavior outside of Kavanaugh\nI Can't believe it that way of playing for for basketball with the barbershop quartet\nAs of a bad\nUh\nYou know I Can't believe how easy it will save hundreds of dollars in my car

the cost then the the um [noise] a solver requirements that he put on Mexico\nThan Mexico must you know raised it doesn't affect Mexico would actually affords General Motors and Ford remember the companies are talking about are all American companies and if you noticed none of the American automobile manufacturers are saying this is a great deal for them they don't like the deal\nThe deal will make it so Ford and General Motors\nCells fewer cars in North America\nAnd because you've raised the cost of automobiles in North America more expensive to manufacture what the president said he wanted which was to send more vehicles\nTo manufacture them in the United states and send them overseas is now going to be tougher to do because you've raised the cost of manufacturing\nUp cars in the United states in Mexico and Canada\nAnd you the consumer will pay for it and that is what the president viewed as the greatest victory in this ... and so as I get on with only got one email on at the one guy said to you know you and I said well wait a minute and there's some parts of it we like but the big part of it the president promoted is wrong\nAnd as I and I you know invited him to argue more than debate more than just the rhetoric\nOf it makes America great\nTo what does it actually do when you raise prices but we limit it we live in a look we live in a day and age and I understand it we live in a day and age where nobody wants to talk about when you look at these specific sub of what's going on with Kavanaugh\nNobody wants to focus in and say okay what's the actual thing here everybody's off into a different tangent the same on on on a ... economics and trade everybody picks their own little corner and they stick with it instead of saying okay what is the result when you raise prices overall\nAnd that's what the president has done in the free trade agreement and our trade negotiators have done his make cars more expensive to buy in Mexico in the United states and in Canada whirling it together\nYeah the cost of buying a car in the United states Canada and Mexico will go up in price at a time as you mentioned yesterday Eric\nYou mentioned it yesterday I don't know why I focused and said Eric ... but as you said yesterday or the and you and I've been doing some some uh the reading and analysis on this is at her prices are going up people can't afford to buy cars they run out of ways to finance them and so what are people looking to do to look into by used vehicles\nYes and that's driving by market right now which when there was a greater demand for that group of vehicles they used vehicles and the price goes up\nAnd so for some people out there they believe this is ... none of it's personal all economics how does it work I Can't tell you how the president things because the president\nOr even in this trade deal has done some good things and done some bad things and and that's one of the bad things as automobile now it could have been a lot worse from what he was promoting before but the fact\nIs it didn't affect probably Ninety percent of the free trade between the countries and that's a good thing as we said what happened and we've been predicted look\nWho's going to be all this hype all the soup ... and what we're going to basically get is the same kind of deal a little bit of nuances here there they get a little bit ... victory on dairy\nThe big problem with it is what the president and what the trade negotiators did on raising the cost of all cars manufactured in the United states\nIn Canada and Mexico that you that consumers are going to have to pay and it means we are less likely to ship cars from the United states anywhere else\nAnd the president views that as a great victory for the United states but doesn't explain why it's a great victory\nRight yeah and I think if look here's where the child will be you'll see certain industries that the reason the automobile industry has his key to the economy\nIs because you look at the the the how often now\nPeople purchase vehicles right or more and more they're holding on to their cars so that hurts the ... because well they want the stuff off the assembly line\nTo be so you make that more expensive you start hurting it industry you start seeing layoffs as a result of that then and then also make the used cars by default more expensive than you're going to see not just\nThe automobile industry but of course all the dealerships and all of the uh if if you look at the finance arms or those companies they're all going to suffer as a result of that\nBecause people will choose as they're doing now to hold onto their car for longer periods of time because that's the cost of government that's not the cost of anything else we're not talking about well\nWhether it's steel and aluminum or the parts going into the car\nOr electronics or anything else we're not saying that this stuff is scarce that it's hard to come by states that a small group of people have decided to get together and determine how expensive it is going to be for us that's the difference\nAnd we view it as a victory and as we've said nobody can explain to us why\nThat's a victory now as we said the other things when you look at the dairy you know again that's that's moving in and and in some of the agriculture stop where we do have more free trade now because of it and we had in Canada was able to knock down some of the barriers that's fine\nBut it's almost as if we make the victory over there and we've done we shoot ourselves in the foot on automobiles now the other good thing is Canada will like this meeting was we mentioned with the timber\nThat the president in all likelihood will be lifting the terror if they put on timber and now that has to go to a panel to decide whether\nA Canada is subsidizing it not the president to make the decision on his own which should sheep and construction in the United states because that timber will be coming over\nAnd that was a fear of builders that housing prices were going to skyrocket another construction\nFrom the use of a void because of the Canadian timber and hopefully in the next year that will bring those prices down\nSo there's wins and losses across the board but but overall if the president is stating\nThat the threat of tariffs on Canada and the and and and Mexico and the steel tariffs on the aluminum terrorists made it worthwhile for this he's going to have to show me the numbers on it well\nAnd that's that's again it's it's it's the second largest purchase that people make and the people are homeowners it's the first largest purchase on on vehicles and you start seeing that slide\nYou start seeing the economy's slide\nThen that will be your tell this is what the the Bush administration saw steel chairs they saw companies leaving the country and\nThey said that this can't stand we cannot keep this going you can't we cannot do this because the the job loss will be well who knows what it would have been had they not ended those still terrorists uh prematurely\nBut overall the vast majority of products unchanged right and so ah you know the president which was called a victory fine we've just do the analysis on the reality of economic\nSlump he gives me when you get these got my support if if we're going to stand strong against China\n\nThere's then and and by the way political you can get away with that all day long to it's going to it is going to hurt but if they're not going to play by\nThe world Trade Organization rules then not only the U.S but all of our allies and other trade partners with trying to pay to get in line and putting the pressure on them that's a very real strategy and it is doing it it has to be effective because I don't know how you

they're going on but it's not much to go to our urban in Chicago urban welcome you're on running I Walk into the show\nDuring the day very good you're on the radio entered\n[laughter] yeah yeah I Want to tell us about how can that Republicans cry now Clinton they created all the time that they're going through right now how in their ... their talk above moving in a field goal posts\nThey chose to fill goal post off to see where we certainly were kicked a field goal\n... explain how what are you talking about\n[noise] okay and they were or let Obama appointed ... at least ... we might not even being in a situation where Kavanaugh has okay\nLet's break this down then but All right All right well let's bring it down to break it down now let's break it down okay that's where you may you may hear what you're saying is\nThe Republicans put themselves in this particular situation okay let's say that they did because Merrick Garland was not you know given a given given a chance it yeah yeah and you know why they want the more you understand both on the way we understand let me speak let me respond okay what you are stating then\nIs that in a broader public the\nSaid get elected and the party that gets more representatives elected\nAnd by the people they get to make the rules and regulations of that particular body your state in since the Republicans won\nAnd couldn't control that body which means control that nomination because in a public it is the majority representatives of that party that get to make the decisions but since they make a decision that you disagree\nWith its own Kaine didn't defame somebody's reputation\nNo I'm not saying that\nWhat I'm saying is this first of all\nThat's a lifetime position so they get to go over your whole life when you and your miles

woman's body anymore right\n[noise] well not case sorry [laughter] well wait or not we should go back to take care one way you know but you know it goes back to what\nWe originally said the if you're in power you get to make the rules\nMhm right well keep in mind though that position was nothing new uh on the Senate for back in the day the Democrats held the same position because it was just as much out of respect for Hillary Clinton as it was for Donald Trump remember that scenario was that\nThe new president should should pick their nominee right and I don't know and that did not that was not there was not a given at that point\nThat Trump was going to win\nWill not be the end but the point is that this was like dealing with the woman that was on CNN last week was the ... the guy makes a statement we say well this is what you're saying and it's exactly what he said and then he goes no that's not what I'm saying well of course that's what you're saying because why\nHarry Reid decided to change the rules of the Senate when he was the head of the Senate when it came to federal nominations therefore when he did that\nUh you had Mitch McConnell come in and say okay you change those rules were going to change those ... these rules for the Supreme Court justice yeah the people in power we get to chat and these aren't laws\nWere not changing laws were simply changing rules and the Senate that we have the ability to do constitutionally you may not like it but hey when elections as what Harry Reid said\nAnd Mitch McConnell came in and said the exact same thing that's the reality of it and what you're saying then it's it's okay to defame somebody's ah defame somebody's character\nBecause that's the reality of how a Democratic Republic constitutional republic works uh\nAnd then you got into the point that we now have to go back into the womb when you have a life\nTime yeah\nPosition so that the that anybody agree with them that we need to go back to the womb numb all Supreme Court justices we need to go back to the boom well\nAt least they do with how often did you pick your mother that domestic abuse\nYes I'm Sorry\nThat was a little Matty to our last caller yeah just a

some of their email a\nVoters and gives them a little political coverage to vote yes\nWell there there's only works if they if the polls since Thursday which will start rolling in over the next couple of days that by the ... by the end of the week those polls show that the American people are not with them that the but more importantly the senators and those states especially where its claws are are not getting the support\nOf their voters in their states uh and ultimately it only works if the vote is to confirm\nKavanaugh because it doesn't work for the Republicans if he does not\nGet

of course it's unconstitutional you cannot dictate to a corporation who they can put on the board\nAnd what I make a pass to be right what if it's a man who identifies as a woman and and so just by saying it\n\nBut this is this is the insanity of the left that Ben Wittes appearance and because this has to control it and what is next accompany must have so many are women in certain positions fire management executive executive VP whatever it might be\nThat there must be a certain ratio\n\nWell that's again there it is I you know I really wonder I mean especially with California liberals do you

...\nAh ah the federal debt has increased by one point two trillion dollars over the last year mhm right you want to make this I'll make it simple for a okay so I did the figures in my head for something that you and I came up with ... ... what was it maybe ten years ago I Can't remember ... okay but I was thrown into my pool ...\nAnd instead of thinking things that normal people think I was thinking to myself how do I simplify\nThe budget situation so everybody can understand it within thirty seconds and then they can say okay they can relate to it because you say billions and trillions and\nBlah blah blah blah blah blah blah or\nThe situation we're in right now okay effective because the ... the budget just ended what just September thirtieth just sun ... last year or so and these are all rough estimates but but\nUm if you if you took the federal budget and put it put it\nAnd basically somebody who last year made thirty six thousand dollars\nOkay okay\nSo this is the situation that we're in right now in this country a as a person that made thirty six thousand dollars last\nYear you spent\nForty point four thousand for a ... a forty thousand four hundred dollars is what you're spat\nAnd humane to thirty six thousand right yeah you\nHave a outstanding debt\nA of a\nMissing and make sure we get this right here two hundred and Fifteen thousand dollars\nThey share\nSalary is gone down to thirty four thousand dollars and you're going to spend forty four thousand dollars and your current debt\nIs two hundred and Fifteen thousand dollars\nWith bills that must be paid over the next two years of one to two million dollars oh you do is take off a zeroes so everybody can I you know understand the situation that we're at last year you may thirty six thousand\nYou spent a little bit over forty thousand or this year you're only going to make thirty four thousand you're going to spend forty four thousand\nAnd right now you have the death of two hundred and Fifteen thousand dollars and the bills that will come do over the next ten years at a salary that she can see went down this year\nAnd at the end bills are going to have to be paid over
