are the faces today it's not Obama it's not Hillary it's not anyone else from the past right now\nWell you know when we we've heard a couple of things for example when we're brought up a case of Cortez we have callers call up and we know these are talking points to say look she's not a leader of the party why are you guys trying to make her the leader of the party we're not we're responding to be publicity if she wasn't in the news we wouldn't be talking about him mhm\nUh she's in the news why because the media is picked up on it now maybe the media is not in this case doing what you as a Democrat would like\nWhen it comes to what you think the media should be promoting or or what their role should be in a you know ... whether there should be parallel endorsements coming from the Democrats and your media [laughter]\nAnd you know at at at the same time but the fact is the media has gone guy got over okay so Cortez and the media has gone ... uh uh over a Robert Francis ...\nIs the media we played it yesterday on this week this week is a new show and Stephanopoulos goes to their reporter up there on the reporter talks is talking to him as if he's a rock star by saying you're really a rock star oh no I'm not no no no\nYou really really you really really are and you know that's not that's not reporting in any way a political reporter should never be in that type of discussion you know to you know to begin with but the fact is because the media is\nGuy got over a war and Cortez they're the ones that have anointed them as\nThe new leaders in the new faces because the new face dissolved in the media pays attention to especially the new young\nOnes and you know they're looking for new young blood because they look at it and they say Hillary can when we don't want Bernie remember a case of Cortez came out just over the weekend and wouldn't endorse Bernie Sanders who she endorsed back in in in in twenty sixteen so a Hillary as we know\nEverybody I won't say everybody there are some Democrats would like her to come back but most Democrats don't want\nYou know her to come back now you've got the you know that you knew you know a young guns they're out there and ah you know or works stadiums I don't really care whether we get\nIn Obama's endorsement and I really don't need Obama's endorsement as if look you're the old news and then okay sir protests coming out and saying Bernie Sanders nine door summit twenty sixteen we'll wait to see what happens you know come uh twenty twenty\nWow yeah and\nAnd do you look at him and say who will be the uh you know who will be the person who will be the ah you know the nominee for the Democrats are in twenty twenty we got a great show ahead and coming up uh early voting I started yesterday in Texas has already begun in other states even before taxes that NBC story out there saying that the G O P is out doing the Democrats\nIn the early voting in a bunch of different states will get to ah that ah the ah ... ... ... ... ...\nTo ... what else or there was something else I had\nTo oh yeah yeah because I mentioned uh uh uh twenty twenty and the Democrats\nAre we told you so Cory bookers plan to give out more cash mhm we talked about this yesterday that what you're going to see from the Democrats is free everything for twenty twenty mhm free everything but we don't believe in the constitution and we hate America\nThat the new that is the new narrative we don't believe in the constitution we don't believe in due process we don't believe in the first amendment we don't believe\nIn the the the second amendment we don't believe that there should be a Senate we don't believe that there should be a a a a a a electoral college we don't believe in the constitution of the United states but we wish to give you everything they get up\nTo six thousand dollars Camilla Harris now Cory Booker talking about fifty thousand dollars\nThat can be used or by the young poor in this country to buy a house or to get a college education so now they're up to fifty thousand dollars remember back in twenty sixteen to show you that Eric and I are on the cutting edge of where the leftist going\nOh we had stated look why don't you just come out we need somebody to come out to be the first one to say we're just going to give everybody a hundred thousand dollars whether or not up to a hundred thousand yet but two years after we said that and it was two years right about now mhm\n'cause we totally Hillary look if you want to get it if you're looking for that last you know to we push hundred thousand to everybody is just go all the way yeah Cory Booker now up to fifty thousand dollars and\nThat's the other problem we discussed yesterday was Hillary\nYou know with a with everything you know the the big free and and and all the money you don't forget the free will also\nPay you were going to pay you now the government's going to pay you\nSo you'll get everything for free and we're going to give you money well if you're Hillary\nThere's no way you can't be a moderate in your approach no\nShe's thinking of running you better take some numbers down they're gonna have to be bigger than what's out there now\nWhy would you well you know the the six thousand really just got blown out of the water\nJust out and ... ... ... men that in a couple of days now we're up to fifty thousand\nRight and that's not enough you can't buy a house for fifty grand mind bunkers got fifty thousand who's got mark on I got a hundred thousand a hundred thousand Erekat hundred thousand\nWhy don't we just force the home builders to build somebody there ... everybody their dream home ah the grocery stores\nThey can charge you anymore slave healthcare is the right food must be a writer yeah\nFree food as long as I mean by the way why hasn't anybody come up with a bad thing about there's been wearing for years ... shouldn't that be before cash yeah somebody come out and said look for everybody should have been before health care\nYou don't go to the doctor every day but most people most people except for supermodels eve everyday\nFood\nBy the way we don't condone just walking into a grocery store and leaving without paying\n[laughter] ... [laughter] wait wait for it [laughter]\nBut that's this is this is what you're gonna have to [laughter] it will be an auction do have an\nAuctioneer during\nThe primary for the left it'll just every every instead of debates it'll just be an option what\nA promised his campaign promise auction you've got\n[laughter]\nYou've got Democrats out there saying you know with this one point six billion dollar lottery yeah we've got to start up and the money that we're going to give people be looking at one point six billion how about if we have a let's call it the lottery that everybody when\nThat's right yes how about that is the right hand picked by the way somebody should be paying us for these ideas you know we we told the Democrats back in ah in twenty sixteen you gotta you know just start offering more money right we set a hundred thousand right or a book or something the fifties is up to fifty\nBut that story coming up about the the the fifty because it wouldn't go to everybody but they're up to fifty though that's the point it's up to fifty now because it will continue to expand but that's what I'd run on ...\nIf I'm a Democrat\nBut we wish to have is a lottery for everybody where everybody wins well it's\nFunny because you know they focus on in this case young poor people um that includes most young people\nMost young people are poor because and and the here so far as we pointed out yesterday too you start promising things and and people realize well you're not going to be able to afford that for everybody and and they will draw a line\nIt will be for some so in a rising economy and people start making a little more money they're thinking of themselves so wait a minute\nI might not get that\nThat's going to go that free stuff's going to go to somebody else but not me\nSee that's the world we live in and by the way that's the world but the Democrats helped to create\nAges ago this is where we are\nForget about you I'm Out for me I'm Out from mine\nIt's all about me so my neighbors gonna get fifty grand I'm not going to get fifty grand and meanwhile Eric and Gary have to pay for we have to pay for it\nBuilding you're you're you're building a welfare wall and making us pay for it and if you're a first time listeners because even under the Republican tax cut Eric\nAnd Eric's taxes in my taxes went up around that's why I went to early voting today and voted straight ticket Democrat\n[laughter] I'm proud of fact I Want my money do I I Want\nAll about man told you I mean if it's all about\nBlaming the Democratic vote [laughter] that's not true I didn't do that I haven't voted yet I Am going to get out this week though it's been a way to another beautiful day\nWe had a beautiful day and and I don't I just new to the first day of early voting is not the time to\nTo uh to go out I didn't check the now the polling places you normally right around the corner from me and they're not it's not there anymore I've got to go like\nFive six miles

you know very is a Republican town right toward this\nYou know the stadium is ever people probably know that across the country and uh she told me she heard news report she goes thank goodness I

is the blue wave turning purple I'm reading from the story Republican affiliated voters about pace democratic affiliated voters and early voting in southern closely watched states according to data\nProvided by target smart and independently analyzed by NBC News data analytics slap\nGOP affiliated voters have surpassed democratic affiliated ones in the early voting in Arizona Florida Georgia Indiana Montana Tennessee and Texas you know you you and I am a closely watched\nThe um the Bob\nOr a Senate race where you have a Jon Tester going up against a Matt Rosendale mhm and we you know we've noticed that you know the our CPR bridge on that the real clear politics average\nBy the way it's a great website to go to for anybody out there if you never gone to a to look at you know all the latest polls across the board a and but you and I looked at that and Jon Tester the Democrats\nIf you've seen consistently over the last month is up by three well the latest poll that was done there was was September twenty second it ended right and tester was up by four at that particular point and the margin of error was three point seven\nOr and you and I said you know how can you make a ... how can you look at that now are cp has it as a toss up right now they've they've they've got it as a as a toss up but when you see that you know because we've talked about\nWhat is what is the voter excitement level so you you when you see Montana in\nThere that makes us look and wonder what would the latest poll say I'm the tester Rosendale race in Montana\nAnd bend because there's a number of motivators but the ... the entire ah Kavanaugh's confirmation process and the hearings and then the ultimate confirmation vote\nIs there anything in that particular race that was that was motivating for one side or the other\nAnd what what are the polls saying it's frustrating for me because I I actually ask you during the break or they did they just go on vacation when early voting started\nThe pollsters they don't no no but polls are still going even if well the the problem\nIs is a major races you happen to have some in recent days you had some up\nUntil I got to go back to the Ted Cruz a O'Rourke thing but it's at least a week old\nOr that try to Montana is more over a month all well it is I'm selling I brought up about ... thirty two and some of his old gay rights a Texas thirty two is now what twenty\nNine days old in terms of that poll which is something it's a house seat but it's it's one that's been held by Pete Sessions for a long time and Pete Sessions is up by one but that was a month ago so I I have no idea I don't know why the pollsters\nAre not more active especially in this particular uh election season as as I I thought I guess I thought they would be for any first term of president their first mid term is crucial\nA so GOP affiliated voter sub surpass democratic affiliated ones and early voting in Arizona Florida Georgia Indiana Montana Tennessee\nAnd Texas only in Nevada have democratic affiliated voters exceeded Republican affiliated voter so far in early voting\nAccording to the data key Senate races are underway in seven of those ... states and we'll prove pivotal and determining which party controls the or the chamber the latest data suggest robust enthusiasm among\nEarly Republican voters that can put a dent in democratic

Jersey you know\nAnd and go out and sit down at the table or kneel down after he was the case may be ... [laughter] and just a protest and you know do that thing I Would just have your political debate we don't we don't need to play the game to see this way there would be no injuries I mean the last fight breaks out but\nMaybe that what now again ... ... we we haven't done or update in a while but as you notice there really is no talk it's the same two or three people write rats yet\n... you know Ninety nine point nine percent of the NFL players are not kneeling Brian and I still think it's what we thought\nThat it's going to be don't ask don't tell him and the fact is neither side at me he didn't neither the players association of the NFL is moving on this because remember how long they've been meeting for\nYeah remember we're going to me to try to come to some resolution and you're meeting perform on yeah it's male or female\nI mean they still have the policy but there won't be fine there won't be any kind of penalty it's don't ask don't it don't ask\nDon't tell what they're hoping what they're hoping is is that the players association because every it's tick tick tick tick tick and the contract were negotiations doubt what two and a half years away mhm but but the negotiations could be starting yeah they could be going on right now right right wow and you know go ...\nHold on a second because we talked about you know how uh the the ah\nThe players association\nCould be saying look we got to go ... coming up you could have been big eyes were starting talks right now or at least getting into the early stages of these talks and this is affecting it\nRight we can we cannot have touched down TV ratings life ah you know in another year and a half everybody has to be everybody has to be on board do protests wherever you want right of course because all of a sudden these players are saying this could affect my next contract ...\nOh well then have protests wherever you want a look we made a deal or the NFL's giving to our particular causes so we won that but no like air a greater a column camp renting it doesn't matter what the deal is struck they just they they view the deal being struck\nAs a you know and and remember the air agreed views the deal means struck to not meal and to keep Capra Nick out of the you know out of the players association that was going to decide where all that money goes to basically say no cap and you're not a part of in ... ah Arab greed wants to continue kneeling there's the there's a group\nOr the the there's the one or two are out there that wish to continue kneeling no matter what and there's another group saying what we got our cash shut up there and so now there's so many ... so the NFL the ... probably said look\nDon't ask don't tell and it's a liberal it's liberals finding liberals and it'll eventually blow up in their faces [laughter] yeah I Know that we and then we can move on\nYeah I mean I I think you're I think you're probably right on it's probably you know unofficially don't ask don't tell for me it's a don't watch don't care\n[laughter] [laughter] well here's the thing if there is no reason to watch my team anyway because they're not colonizing\nWell yeah I mean you know my my team attempting to I I just saw the headline attempted to come back you know over the uh the Redskins this past weekend and then you know couldn't get it done\nBut I I\nI think of again the bigger picture of the fact that it's not just the protests driving the people what you you you've got two big things to overcome\nYou got to bring back the people who left because of the protests but you got to bring people back\nWho left because they they're watching other things because they're doing other things I mean that's where I think a lot of the erosion is you've got to create new excitement in the NFL\nNot just in the whole protest thing you've got to create new excitement in the broadcast presentation of the game\nAnd\nThey haven't even started on that I mean\nUh you know the uh you send a lot of the movement to digital and and we knew that common there's got to be more of that and the and the in the coming years\nNo doubt but that's about reaching the audience where they are but you know you put a store where the traffic is right so you put your game your presentation is going to be where the traffic is if it's on digital if a if it's on line and that's where you're\nGoing to find that audience but you've also got to change and I think that will help change the presentation of the game\nBut that's something nobody is focusing on right now because they can't get through you know this\nIs even if it's just a handful of players if it's making the news it's like you know come on guys it's time to get back to football\nBut you can't get there because these stories still make the news\nThat's you know it's it's like the left you look at a\nA war and and oh Casio Cortez they don't represent the majority of the uh the the rank and file Democrat out there but they're leading the party if they're making the news and they're driving motivation on the other side as a result of it\nWas just a but what would we was a Tim Ryan\nYou know challenge Nancy Pelosi for four seats and and you know we've got to get away from the identity politics and and everything else\nAnd who else said that a couple of others have said that\nThey can't\nBecause it's not making the noise I mean the the I guess being a more moderate Democrats if you could they would still be far left but getting away from you know the identity politics of it or whatever it is that's driving the far far left\n... where where do you a moderate where do you because that's not making the news that's not making the social media\nOr that's not worthy interest is by the mainstream media it's boring so\nIt's you know this this is this is all you know part of well\nAnd I mean really scrambled equation and what you see here is what you see that happening and then ... in in the Democratic party where you have victims and the oppressor ... and as we've said this that the identity politics\nYou continue to cut the pie of victims becomes greater but then when the number of victims becomes greater than the number of oppressors\nA must you know must become of a greater\nOr you know we've seen it the look last ... last week you saw the most of the cycling though the

the famine is the feminist movement this\nHow insane it is and what you have here is in the in the NFL you of Eric greed\nYou know a Malcolm you know Malcolm Jenkins was part of the group that agreed\nThat okay uh the owners are going to give a hundred you know a hundred million dollars for the for the organizations that we wish to get money to to help make racism less mhm okay fine All right we will we agree that we're not going to Neal anymore ... well now\nHe is viewed by air and green and camper Nick as\nThe oppressor he is a Neal colonialist right he's a sellout price because the whole the the real\nThing is with the Catholic or a read they don't want a deal you know they want to be able to scream oppression so\nSo the victims some of the victims now that we're perceived as the victims here in the NFL or those in the NFL standing up for who they perceive the victims war\nNow they have become the oppressor they're just as bad as Trump they're just as bad as any top ... because they have decided that they will negotiate to try to make things better\nAnd the radical left doesn't want to negotiate show they want the constant ... say wants this constant the debate out there they want to be able to cry racism day in ...\nDay out and the fact that it's never going to be styled because it can be solved wants to solve or once you get to where most people believe

illegally then I saw the majority of people look at it but they have to use it\nThey have to you that that\n... of an opinion comes from the left wealth the right doesn't want illegal immigrants in the Asians are here if you don't care about the Asians you're only care about no I don't know any I've never met one conservative\nWhen it comes to a legal immigration at St ... let's let all the all the Asians in here illegally but not the people from Central America right over that\nNo my biggest concern is Canadian\n[laughter]\nWell I mean it's it's I Know but you only have only argument that

the one thing that I think even though the the people in the media understand is than those in power in the Democratic party\nActually do believe in open borders that's what they want they want open they won't project open borders and so since they want to open borders as we said whenever they talk about campaign when excuse me whenever they talk about comprehensive immigration reform you and I asked\nWell what would that be they never give you the specifics of what it would be because I Would think the comprehensive immigration reform to\nAnybody out there would be okay what we have to do is we get it would be to ... what do we do with the illegal immigrants\nThat are here in this country that had been here for a significant period of time right and you and I also often said she if you make the offer\nJust see what their response would be\nFrom the left if you said okay let's give legal ... let's give ... permanent legal status but not citizens ship or voting rights to every illegal immigrants but his but in this country\nSince yesterday yeah right\nAnd from now on anybody who comes into the country illegally a must be sent back and that we will give you\nEverybody who is in this country as of yesterday gets permanent legal status and once you think the response from the Democrats would be\nWell there's they're not they can't accept that\nThe reason they can't accept that is because now they're at the point of wanting open borders it is not about that because\nEven they realize that the argument doesn't change Twenty years from now assume that we did get politically on Capitol Hill an agreement for that amnesty and then strong\nEnforcement or the borders were Twenty years from now ten years from now five years from now there were still be people hear coming here illegally that will be here that will that will get here\nAnd stay here for five years ten years whatever it is and the argument doesn't change so they know well forget about that we just want the open borders we just don't want to have the borders\nAt all come in and stay as long as you're one I\nI Am a challenge to the Democratic party\nGet together with the coalition of Democrats and put forth a comprehensive immigration plan we always heard them say that but they never explain what it would be ... and they're still saying it\nI I'd forgot who just set a recently but I burst out laughing but we need a comprehensive immigration reform that would include why tell me what it would include and\nBe very ... be specific and tell me or at least given stages the major stages of it that would be effective the major affective stages\nOf your reform plan what would they be\nI think that you probably could go to the Republicans and you could get a comprehensive immigration plan that you can go to specific\nA congressman and uh and and senators and state to them say what would you what would you want in your comprehensive immigration plan and they could and they were they just wouldn't say\nComprehensive immigration plan so we asked the question to the left why can't you tell us what your comprehensive immigration plan would be is that a fair question right is that an outrageous question for us someone\nFor for for the two idiots overnight to ask right at any politician in Washington DC you keep saying comprehensive immigration reform tell us specifically what it would be give us the specifics and they won't do well why not\n\nBecause the leadership of the Democratic party wants open borders prove us wrong\nProve us wrong come up with a comprehensive immigration plan show it to us and prove that we are wrong I Will be the first person to say okay I was wrong I Know I won't be wrong but I Am wrong because there is your plan and you're going to stick behind it\nWell tell me one Democrat\nOr it recently who said\nAnd I mean the anyone right now either running for office or that as an office that says and there's been\nPromoting we here's what

said no one at one of the things you may be the you might be the most loyal Republican the most loyal Trump supporter a and supporting the Republican Party now sorry\nThey don't care about the debt they don't care about the deficit and nobody does now it is gone caring for the the the the deficit and that goes across whether you're a Trump supporter whether you're a Republican supporter whether you're never Trump\nConservative a few conservatives care about it but as you and I said Eric this this is how quickly this country has changed\nThat and the twenty Fifteen\nThe biggest issue remember the establishment and the swamp were who where did that originally come from ...\nThat originally came from the fact that when Paul Ryan became speaker of the house he would not go back and change the budget that they had\nPasadena had passed and there was a theory and\nThe the the whole swamp was created out of the Republican leadership including Paul Ryan that would not control spending\n\nThat's ... you think about it that was one of the major points in Trump\nSetting himself apart\nFrom other Republicans that he labeled them the swamp and said that's unacceptable we have to get spending out of control\nThat was three years ago\nWe hadn't calls left and right we have to get the deficit under control that's why I'm going to vote for Trump that's not even a discussion anymore no not nobody is having that discussion anymore aid is gone\nAs we said when you look at\nCongress right now you might have is what do we say half a senator or do we take because it would take to have some senator yes three eight of us right [laughter] 'cause even even like even Rand Paul showed he couldn't do it right\nWhen it came to the um medicate right when it came to Medicaid spending in his own state and and so\nUh it's uh it it doesn't matter anymore so if there was ever a time for Democrats to roll this out all the free stuff it's now when the Republican Party\nDoesn't even care about deficit anymore ... doesn't even care about that any more Republicans don't care for Republicans don't care that says a much\nBetter chance over the next two years of the Democrats telling you weren't going to take care of view from first mhm 'cause that's what it is right here from birth a thousand dollars in your account as soon as you're born\nAnd if you're poor two thousand dollars each and every year until you're Eighteen fifty thousand dollars that you'll have by the time that you become a teen years yet ha\nIf your parents report we know he's the baby is born\nAnd then as soon as you can maintain a that six thousand dollars which will be ten thousand dollars in free income each and every year plus free condoms you want to have one of those empty thousand right don't geography thousand

you a house\nYou're oh oh oh oh sorry I forgot where I ... I'm Sorry I forgot ... right sorry I Apologize Eric well\nBecause I because here's the thing that you look at the average cost of a home over the next let's say we start this in twenty\nOr let's say we get it done\nAnd a twenty Twenty one\nIn March or twenty Twenty one\nCory Booker wings\nOr in in twenty twenty and she is inaugurated a and twenty Twenty one\nRight so he starts his first term as president and they get this done in March and it takes effect it starts funding and twenty twenty two at Eighteen years you're down to twenty forty what is the anticipated cost\nOf the average new home and twenty forty it's going to be a lot more than fifty K. C. you didn't go big enough Mr Booker\n\nBecause of its education will no no no no no no no no\nBut you're parties already offering you know the free college so they won't need it for that so what else retirement well we've already got Social Security\nSo and well they're not going to retire at Eighteen they won't be eligible you know then we'll get that money until they're also the retirement things not an appeal\nThat would have to be to to buy a home not to put down on home to buy a home he didn't go big enough\nAnd somewhere and there's some Democrats got to come across as we talked about earlier in the show and say\nWhat about frame right because the college thing is it the Democrats are saying to him\nWell no no no well first of all\nCollege fifty thousand it just depends on which college you go to\nFifty thousand isn't going to get you there if you're talking about a four year degree at some of those major colleges fifty thousand is not going to pay for that right it's not gonna\nPay for the whole home well that's because what I Do it you can go now you have a college has already paid for a member that's the other that that's\nThat's my point your your colleagues Mr Booker already doing the whole free in college right so see so you got fifty thousand dollars close to fifty thousand is what forty six thousand next for the poorest of kids so it will be up to forty six thousand when they're Eighteen right kids from poor families\nWell they're already get free college so they can't use it for that\nA stocker bio\nSo now they could\nPut it down on a home and living home until they you know ah you know I guess the falls I mean but they're still going to have they're gonna have payments that's not helping me I'm going to have payments\nSo then the ten thousand dollars six to ten thousand dollars and guaranteed income won't be enough to pay for oh no no no I mean he'll need another program in order to pay\nThat extra ten thousand dollars a month if not a week\n[laughter] and they're not gonna [laughter] scene and and\nProbably by the time we get to that point we're not going to be able to enjoy that his talk shows by now unfortunately will be

the midterm and then the midterms over we're just we're just projecting out what will happen for the the twenty twenty election and what's already happening with Cory Booker coming out now with his new opportunity\nOr above bonds which is the fact that the you know giving a every baby born in America a thousand dollars and then\nTo the poor is two thousand dollars a year up to age Eighteen and then the poorest and the country would get up to fifty thousand dollars and then depending on your on your a level of your family level of of income anywhere between\nAh just at one thousand dollars you know initially there will be sixteen hundred dollars all the way up to fifty thousand dollars a dead along now with ... send her guaranteed income for people that would be at least a I think a six thousand dollars would be\nThe maximum aboard that level is to add along with Medicare for all which would which would be all\nOf your medical bills paid ... for every body for everything no deductible and also free college and so that's where the Democrats are\nAre are are going\nWithout question for twenty twenty and we're still a long way out because now one's gonna have to leap frog over another to say no we're going to get more and we're going to get more and we're still two years out who knows what it looked it looked like I didn't think we'd be this far\nOut of there either by wanting twenty these these plans will probably grew up in terms of the political promise behind them but they are offering these planes you'd be viewed as a right wing conservative yeah seen months up because I mean think about it\nUm you do have to offer more and more as we go along right I mean that that has to be in terms of the political promise the free stuff has to be\nYou know more and more are we broke it down earlier on the you know before on the nearly fifty K. ah that that that the poorest of children by the time they're Eighteen would have in this account and the and the treasury well\nThe problem with that is that you know you're talking about a political promise right you're talking about something that's going to happen in the future so by the time that it actually started began you know on twenty twenty two if Cory Booker to watch to become president right\nI'm not only what the you know the breakdown of you know they won't be enough but\nThe timeline will be wrong
