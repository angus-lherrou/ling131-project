{"month": "10", "state": "AL", "station": "WXQW", "content": "I'm John By sort of this is John ... show the first war on following with Jim Nelson I Will hold\nYou are most in trouble after you reach your objective\nAnd that's what tapes and the fifth and sixth regimen cheaply the six regiment was participating in this jump off on the October third and fourth reached the German trenches the rolling barrage has kept the Germans down in the readout so\nThat they weren't able to mend the machine guns and the Americans rushing up the\nIncline take the trenches and capture the Germans the Germans\nAre happy to march to uh to the American rear because they're out of the war they now they are now sitting there on the top exposed to German fire and they expect the French to the left I Believe end of the right to advance and close up\nThe uh the whole that they've opened but the French don't show up Jim why not do we know did the French claim that they were under severe to us to be as severe fire or is this like the rock and the ... the French just run away when the Americans forget to\nNo no it was it was a common complaint is there's really two books in the first two that the same complaint thoughts on that the French come up couldn't come up claims they couldn't come up\nThey always claim they couldn't come up to we know whether they were prevented whether they had bad transportation whether it was colonial troops or where they live which has it was\nIt was up and colonial jokes but I just think it could have been a matter of morale it could've been stiff resistance to tell them the Americans might have been more tenacious it's hard to say but it was a constant complaint even with the second division as well so I was\nSaying well I've wondered about the rock and the ... for example this took place in July the Americans just didn't run away and the French ran away the first the Germans ... at the moment Germans guns are opened up they run away and the Americans were unfamiliar with the idea that you run away when the Germans started shooting\nWell like I say that might have been a morale issue um it's hard to say uh you know they were anyway the story as they were supposed to come up\nOn the Burmese left and it was a there was a week out at the bottom of it this is the editor and hook the as it was\nVery well fortified machine guns they the French could not take it could not take it they finally said to fit a regiment was trailing six regiment to the left and then they they took it\nThan they left and they gave it to French and the Germans they took it so it's just yeah it was a it was a bad thing so basically gates and his men are uh it's about a mile or let's say about a mile up the hill and their towards the top of one sort of the top of their their their band and Germans their trenches they're taking it\nBut they're left is exposed and Kate's at one point looked over the course of about eight hundred Germans ended his way he went back and they they they have tanks\nWith the uh for support with assault and he called pang silver\nAnd basically in the Marines just started last day away at him and he says you know that that broke up that attack really well then they get to the top fifth regiment followed them up basically like you say the kind of like an island or left his ears that used to say about the ... and it's like ... and they're just wondering\nWhat's gonna happen are going to have some big German counterattack reports down the hill or what but they survive 'til the morning and then a regiment was ordered to attack which they did and then they got caught by that afternoon in front of the village of sent it Chan massive German force I'm\nJust artillery machine guns could not advance any further and that is that basically became the battle for the next ten days was just by inches\nDegrees until finally they were able to take to the village of Spanish channels and then the thirty six division took over\nThere was a lot of action left between October and November eleventh however part of the discovery of cliff Kate says that we're going to leave Nineteen Eighteen and we're going to travel quickly to August and September Nineteen forty two where are we were on Guadalcanal\nCliff case is now a marine veteran needs a colonel commanding on Guadalcanal and the Japanese are sending wave after wave of it all teams they're bringing them down the slots\nThe U.S navy as bugged out is left the Marines all by themselves and it reminded me as I got some of the chapters gym just like the ...\nUh just like black mall that a case again and the Marines were left to fight it out of ... and surrounded and they survived\nYeah exactly and there was one battle in particular I Believe it was about August twenty first battle of the ... river with the Marines had dug in there was a colonel a cheeky brought up the course of about a thousand men down the beach towards them and attack them in the middle of the night and\nActually they killed quite a few Marines but they never broke the line and then in the morning gates came up to the front the was it was the first marine regiment that he was commanding\nAnd they sent takes in and basically uh pretty much kill list a Japan Japanese warrior so that was broken up with his tail vicious fighting then they moved on to the rest of their portion of the Ayelet they're supposed to take and hold Anderson feel these things\nTaste week so their battle goes on until Nineteen forty three and chaos at this point is he and his diaries in his letters twenty four years later is he reflected on his ability to survive being surrounded and cut off does he talk about it to do is do as well into his relatives there was friends\nNo you know what he was a very matter of fact I uh I think you would have made a good attorney wonderfully light he should've gone back to being an attorney instead of staying with the marine corps I think he was his mind was just\nIt was a guy who is best under action went away and pick up the action is when he is the clearest and that's what makes them a great combat leader or a great leader and general um he didn't really reflect it was not a self reflect the person that is bad introspective that I kept I picked up a name was letters but he was happy\nHe did this up most given what happened in the first World War to keep us casualties down and Second World war of course they had better equipment by then too but he was very mindful\nOf the waste that going on in the first World War and what not to have a at Guadalcanal and later although it more difficult path to keep casualties down and he will Jima did what he could there too but that was just a bitter bitter fight\nOne detail that I made me like him he had a friend who went back for supplies I think it was it below what I think it was very early and he never saw him again did they find his body and did they bury it\nOh yeah he was looking for the third battalion right before the assault on Russia and a half of them was walking away with a cigarette in his mouth and they hadn't anyone looking for the body on the day that the disappears gas attack or they did find his body they\nDid and he's buried at at at those at the cemetery\nTheir fellow I Believe he is I Believe he is very there and where his case bearing Arlington [noise] well\nThat's a that's appropriate and toward the end cases people remembered him until they all left and I wonder if and now I guess the Marines from gum canal are going now to two wars of

Melvin asked to him and MSNBC anchor MSNBC tanker not Fox News also Penn Warren's decision to release or DNA results on air Monday during an interview with the Boston Globe and years ago\nGet a warrant gain anything about putting out the DNA test results Melbourne us the best I can gather according to the paper's reporting she's won one south and something like that I think I might just be is Native American and she is and he goes on I don't know who my great great great great grandmother and grandfather is\nA ... the scout responded known him at Warren's claimed heritage was pretty far back\nMeanwhile New York times New York times reporter wrote sarcastically on Twitter President Trump is shorter stop mocking Senator Warren about her ancestry now that she's provided\nDefended improve can you say stepping into further instead of putting this behind her she may have put it out front how many of you if you did this can go back that many generations and maybe you'll find I don't know\nIf you're an ancestor of Abraham Lincoln or George Washington own who knows what else do you realize what that means to go back six generations let me know if you think she just eliminate herself from the twenty twenty race I I think this was huge you remember when Ted Kennedy who was the favorite to run for president and then they asked\nHim why are you running for president and his answer was no way she couldn't take it but he hadn't thought about that yeah I was just next in line he was the Kennedy so let me know what you think eight six six nine to read I\nBeen speaking people have lost I wanted to catch up on this to Michael ... has lost another one so you heard that yes they saw me a Daniels live a lawsuit over tweet by Trump accusing her of a total con job\nWas thrown out by judges said the president was engaging in free speech the adult film star whose real name is Stephanie Clifford claim she was threatened by nano man in Las Vegas parking lot of two thousand eleven\nOr agreeing to cooperate with a magazine article about a trip she said she had with Trump in two thousand and six after a lawyer released a composite sketching them and Trump accused Clifford in a tweet of a total of Punjab concerning uh non existent man and the ... court so we agree with Mr Trump's argument because the tweet unquestioned constitutes rhetorical hyperbole\nNormally associate with politics in public discourse\nSo Trump's lawyer said this was a total when but against the law but not this this guy never goes up all we're going to peel you remember if you if you don't remember he's the one that I think her name a sweat Nick that she accused Kevin of being part of a\nA ring that allowed the gang rape I think by people and even the New York times didn't print that because there was no evidence so you could see where I may be headed I Want to know who you wait on both sides who you'd like to see to be your nominee if you're a Democrat and even on the other side\nWho would you like to see the nominee 'cause you'd think it would help us so much so let me throw before I for some names out did you hear that great phony Kamala Harris has booked her first twenty twenty ticket to Iowa by the way I think\nThat Warren did that because she's so afraid of all the publicity others like Kamala Harris and Spartacus book or that's what I call now you know we had the sparring against moment\nWhich wasn't even correct of course because the Senate if you remember had already printed the information but\nI think she's so afraid of these people that she figured I'll I'll put this behind me and I'll be ready to run no she just the opposite\nAnyway Kamala Harris will travel for the first time this year to the first in the nation caucus\nOn October twenty ... twenty third as she prepares for a potential president Sharon\nHarris a California Democrat will make appearances in Des Moines in Cedar Rapids\nWith all the stops to follow up and then South Carolina so following the visits Harris will appeared in three of four early primary states this election cycle so here's the names here are the names you can put out anything you want your the names that I was thinking about\nUh the Spartacus Booker no Cory Booker if you don't know if I'm referring to former attorney general Eric Holder did you see over the weekend he said I'm a Michelle Obama has said that when they when we meaning people on my side go ... a low they go higher\nAnd the what the Eric Holder said no that's just the opposite we we we we go down to we fight we should whatever is it\nKind of courses Bernie Sanders young Bernie Sanders he'll he'll be running again it's a favorite of any senator Pocahontas Elizabeth Warren now vice president Joe Biden in poll shows that he's kind of the leader up there maybe you know often in politics its name recognition more than anything else\nYou got in New York Sen Kirsten Gillibrand who\nEither there's a winner as she loved Bill Clinton and thought he was terrific until he was maybe someone you don't want to mention after me too movement so there there's someone you know don't trust her watch your back of your around her\nConnecticut Senator Chris Murphy I didn't even know he was Ronnie ... is a good sign I'm a talk show host\nFormer Virginia Governor Terry McAuliffe and he has that much of a chance but we know who he is former Massachusetts Governor Deval Patrick by the way you know why a lot of these people run\nThey run because then they're speaking fees go up usually I\nRemember after Jack Kemp ran for vice president is speaking fees and I want everybody in the south here this became fifty thousand dollars a speech so if you wonder why these people run their huge benefits even if they don't win Ohio Senator Sherrod brown\nActual what about case he's really a Democrat or wonder why he's not running on that side New York governor Andrew Cuomo right you know him and there's another one I did I mean I Know his name I Can't imagine what chance he thinks he has New Orleans Mayor Mitch Landrieu\nUm LA in there that's mine there Eric are say these people evolution delusions of grant or I mean you know come on mayor your mayor of Los Angeles the homeless situation is is just awful\nI I don't know what he's saying except he wants the publicity that the power\nAnd of course you heard about Oprah Winfrey but it doesn't look like she's running but with her name recognition and all the others will have to take them ...\nLawyer Michael ... or as Tucker Carlson from Fox calls them ... the sleazy porn laws as time goes by that came up with a good one there and I bet you didn't know this one Montana governor Steve bullock ... I don't think I Know\nWho's your pick like you I never heard of some of these but heck they as I said that could increase their speaking fees and if you're on the other side who would you like to face if you're on my side let me know an eight six six Ninety red eye\nThat is eight six six nine o seven three three three nine if time is the this they're already running\nAnd we haven't even gotten through the ... elections for the house and Senate but that's coming up in a few weeks\nBut by the way as I said last night and this ties it altogether I think they're all wasting their time they're delusional President Trump is going to be reelected they're going to be so surprised but again\nIf they get the publicity the name recognition eat the tower that all that stuff goes to the heads let me know what you think it's ... sitting in on right on the radio\n[noise] he's over ... million on Iran hero\n\nRight now I hate to see a and Petro stopping centers wonderfully strong and solve wanders yelled purple extremes to your show is on sale of early sixty four Ninety seven\nEveryone eventually sees one truck scary inside grocery store shelves a\nGood age to help a community\nProducts and keep the business running\nWhat they don't seeing what the trucker carries inside\nYour dry and your history ride\nWould we do we see you\nKnow we see you carry a career then help support families and communities\nWe see you carry the title of friend and neighbor parents provider we see you carry the sacrifice or severe and some other jobs will\nEach was a determination to get the job of\nHardware even women like do you\nWhat you carry inside is more valuable than they are\nBecause it's once inside\nRead I radio in our sponsors are devoted to trucking safety that's why we're proud to bring you the red eye radio million mile club for twenty seven years we've been saluting drivers\nSurpass the million mile mark what preventable accident free driving\nDown ... down twenty four\nPrincess\nTechnology so soft money like screw you have fourteen blogging passwords and do tend to remember any of them\nAre one or two does is awesome a game's awesome one two three [noise] truth it's so easy to switch and save one car insurance that guy go dot com is super cool ... percent underscore exclamation point exclamation points Nineteen eighty five [noise]\nFifteen minutes because they do Fifteen Percent or more\nIndividuals and businesses with tax problems listen carefully if you owe over ten thousand dollars in back taxes or Arab on file tax returns us tax she can help you take back control the IRS can seize your bank accounts garnish your paycheck close your business and file criminal\nCharges our team of tax attorneys couldn't stop collections and get you protected us to act shield offers a price protection guaranteed to get you protected today us to actually ... plus right in with the ... so called eight hundred by one nine Seventy seven Ninety six us to actually killed eight hundred by what nine Seventy seven ...

yeah they're very political voice I Would like to say ... first of all I'm going to predict something which\nI'm sure almost all of your listeners are going to be happy to hear it if they believe we're going to say it's gonna happen\nI predict that the we have right now if you want to for you know as far as the Senate goes well let me ... gained four seats minimum [noise]\nAnd maybe even more but you know fifty five all the way up to ... possibly uh as far as the house a typical trick year because of the suburbs and because of redistricting will will keep the house for sure but I Do I say that this ... this or maybe I'm Crazy but I'm not because\nWhat happened last time it was sixteen troubling and nobody believed that he would wait and right everybody was afraid to say analytical jump show even the exit polls the limit correctly they thought that you know we want\nBecause those that voted for Trump\nAvoid the survey board they lie to the survey now people are afraid to tell the

people that were on defense they finally had to see\nThat the media it totally in collusion speaking about to lose your not Trump with Russia but the media but the Democrats I think it's ... below the Kavanaugh became\nThe justice thank God for this kind of his teeth but keep it that he became justice I think the the left and the media outcry over this as much as they were crying and to tell the sixteen when come one but it's like\nPeople are absolutely petrified also in American than Israel following politics in both countries very closely the left always the right let me put it this way there are always does\nThree to six percent better than the prediction is brandy eight percent is not a hundred percent always like in in Israel that terrorists labor wasn't getting away same thing because the media is extremely left in America that six percent\nOr something like that the same thing goes is true in Israel and there's no question we're going to win what\nWhat cabin on the it over here you have Eric Eric's I think his name is on the block they have a Brad Stevens from the New York times used to ride in the wall Street Journal and other than you know Trump or know Trump is absolutely not they switch and saying we're going to vote for Trump\nBecause they're always got opened so there's no way in the world from ...

basically made our way easier for her\nWell I I wouldn't hold up past the Hillary otherwise the word was that she has stuff on Obama I don't know that you and stuff on lots of other people knowing Arabs I wouldn't argue with you on that could you sit down to Geneva Republican you could sit down and don't count Bloomberg that you could sit down and have a cup of coffee with\nUh quite frankly very few and far between I Would say that a Lindsey Lindsey Graham strikes me as a very profound man he's a he's a really decent guy and he's he's got a heart and he's got he's got a mind\nAnd he's got a compassion for for the people of this country\nA he's a he's a Republican correct so yeah you know I I I\nI Would think that ideally he'd make a great pie minimum at minimum you'd make or break

out\nI was in a Trump says he won't take the blame if his party loses control of the house in November arguing his campaigning and endorsements of help Republican candidates and wide ranging interview or three weeks before election day Mr Trump told the Associated Press\nBut yeah it's a you know if it's just not majority rules and that's that's a you know in all honesty that was we may still have slavery because at the time there were more people are on I didn't get\nA huh All right now you're on the spot so who would you like to have coffee with\nUh like I said Alec Baldwin out west I think that would be kinda cool yeah okay yeah yeah\nLike I just that little sick with that because I'm a disabled veteran from two different services and I I Would just love to hear somebody his rhetoric

Kansas City look through your on with mark\nAh find good evening I'm my my main topic is uh the prosecution of Hillary Khomeini and and for the ... I Can't remember the head of the CIA guy\nUm if we don't prosecute these people for the crimes that they did a weirdo were no better than a third world or the third world country we're letting these people get away with what was wrong illegal unconstitutional and basically all those things make a make I'm an American\nAnd if if we don't take the people who commit treason and prosecute him for that then they're going to keep their little following that they're going to walk around you got\nPlenty of people out there that are saying that well you know evidently it wasn't that bad they didn't break the law they didn't\nDo anything that was so evil and um it it's [noise] I just think that something needs to be done to show them and along with all that you know freezer assets because they're ill gotten games in the Clinton Foundation\nAnd I mean if we're going to go all out or go all lead on Kavanaugh for thirty five years ago I'm sure we can find plenty of people and evidence for what Bill did back\nIn the eighties so I mean why can't we go that route\nBut you can and do all those someone challenged me and said what about the civil war right they committed the certainly are illegal acts are at the time and yet we were generous and you know we we didn't Lincoln didn't want to do that kind of stuff\nBut then on this is a wartime assistant wartime this doesn't\nPeople who actually are saying that the people who did who fought on the side of the confederacy were fighting there this is\nI have a different view on on the civil war than some people do I mean I I I understand that for some it was about slavery but for most it was about a overreach with the federal government and civil disobedience and states' rights that's where that's where the basic\nThere were a lot of us were fighting and all that okay go ahead\nNo you know I was living in such good\nOkay you know what I mean that's so that that's where I mean to me the rebel flag that the rebel and actually it's not even really the rebel flag it was a a a battle flag from a particular state it took on a representation of states' rights to me that represents states' rights over\nSlavery and when I talk to people and I've actually talked to people who have flown that flag where I've had that symbol on their truck or whatever it is I asked him I said okay now what does that represent to you and nine times out of ten it does have to do with you know states' rights and an overreach from the federal government\nAnd the people that uh take the other avenue as far as slavery and white supremacists and stuff like that then I just say okay what makes you better than anybody else\nWhy why or why are you better than that person what gives you the right to enslave another human being so and I think this is also the difference between an old dove tail here the difference between conservatives and liberals I won't go party wise here because parties are\nEvidently irrelevant at this point and that is we engage in conversation we engage in discourse\nDefend your defending your principles defend what your argument is they just want to shout down they want to call you names spout that has not everybody in the Democratic party that is why I I don't associate that with the Democratic party these are the\nLeft wing way out there which comes to who I Would actually have coffee with their there's nobody really on the left politically that I could sit down and have coffee away however I have met George Clooney and she's a really nice guy and very humble and I could sit down and have a beer at a cigar with him or something that would be cool [noise]\nYeah well I appreciate your hands are tied the guys are not phone lines and\nThen ... well okay well there's there's nobody on the political left I Would want to sit down and have a except for ... somebody said Lieberman I I Would love to sit down and talk to labor went as far as the blue I Would like to see yeah [noise]\nOh no no no as you said a oh who's who's running [noise] yeah [noise] well you well I I Know that there's somebody who's actually discussed running or he used to be a rising star who\nNo longer I think it is a viable candidate that'd be Jerry Brown I'd love to see him run I'm really actually lose ... love\nI Love oh I'd love to see him run oh I don't think there's anybody out there that's\nGoing to be able to beat Trump I really don't and I think he is because he's got one a campaign under his belt for the presidency he he knows a lot more one thing you can say about him he learns and uh I I think he's learned a lot of valuable lessons\nAnd I don't think he's going to be it was a little I don't say soft but he wasn't he didn't play hardball the way other people\nThat and I think this time he would really trying to be a little bit more aggressive and the way he would uh address anybody who comes against him on the left I'd love to see Cory Booker go up because I think each I think he ... the same thing with Elizabeth Warren\nI think anybody from the left that gets out there he's got a pretty much ...\nI certainly agree with you [laughter] he's gotten much more comfortable in the job he really has become much more presidential and I think that's what you're saying he's really grown into the job and I know absolutely\nAnd and he does he's he's been doing really good on everybody's watching what the right hands doing actually I should say left because he is science with those right\nEverybody's watching what the left hand is doing and with his right hand these just sign and stop sign and science on he's getting a lot down why everybody is talking about the rhetoric and looking at the bombastic and and um\nMy my my fiance and I have been a friend did by several people that we went to school with them suffer because you can't talk politics with all these are liberals they don't want it they can't defend their arguments they they don't want to talk about\nA policy it's just Trump pay send this it's like well we're where do you see that have ... well he just talks about me examples because all the hate that I see is coming out of the left\nAll the people that I used to talking about hate or over here on this side that are represented the Democratic party\nAnd when somebody on the white quote\nRight or the Republican Party that comes out spewing hate the Republican Party shouts them down and says no you don't represent the Republican Party\nDavid Duke there have been many many uh examples of people who have come out on the quote unquote right who speaks for patriot and racism and and that kind of stuff and we won't have it in our party however\nThey will tell you I got to let you go but you've been terrific and you gave me an idea for tomorrow night who you have a great night [laughter]\nYou're welcome cut me a check [laughter]\nYeah I ... it wasn't that good an idea just okay [laughter] well I I've done this before but I Want to hear I won't do it tonight
