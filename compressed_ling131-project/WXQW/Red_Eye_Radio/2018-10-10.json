plus we'll be covering all the different news items out there\nSays the UN ambassador you know the interesting thing is we have gone now over twelve hours ... and nothing has late\nYeah and I do you know why you know why she's ... right even though it seems it seems that the media was jumping on this ... immediately in fact who was it was at MSNBC or CNN narrow as somebody who's making the thing while she's out because of the Kavanaugh stuff and it was like\nYeah come right right right but I mean I saw that on social media that's where I ... I don't I don't want to indict anybody who didn't you know make that statement right right well I Believe I saw that on Twitter ... and and I can't remember who did it because uh you know Twitter flies by so quickly\nBut they were just pounded on immediately that oh she's quitting because Kavanaugh is going to be a Supreme Court\nOr a justice apparently this had been in the works a uh a while and it seems to to be right now\nThat most people really have no idea but they sense that she only wanted to be there for two years because she's staying until the end of the year which means he right she's been there two years and by the way that happens quite frequently in in the ministry and somebody will come in and put in two years yet you go in and then they want to move on to something else everybody is\nIs trying to predict what she's going to do whether she's going to run for president\nUh and I like the you know the uh the scenario that that she's out ah you know there and what was the scenario oh I Know is the scenario had had I'm\nJust going to run and twenty twenty that he's going to be the veep it in a death you know the identity of Jeff Sessions or you know or the you know being out of a ...\nOf being attorney general I'm embarrassed sorts of conspiracy theories we look at it and say well we'll wait and see we don't really deal with conspiracy theories here right now but uh you know she she did good I mean she was ... if you look at one of the people that he brought in early\nThat actually worked out she was one of the few yeah\nWell and I I think she goes out on a strong note a test absolutely if you ah do anything could happen in the next three months but I don't I don't think it's going to change the demeanor\nAnd uh and and the fortitude of of someone like a Nikki Haley if you listen to her words at you and if you ... if you look at a you know her positions a and house how strong she's been for the\nPresident a that is\nThat is a very unique position to be in for its especially for this particular president who's not afraid to speak his mind and em self I think has been very strong we look at his un speech recently and I think he did he did a great job uh\nAnd and he's been very clear on his positions or if you look at a having a Michael Bolden at [laughter] John Bolton that is not my ... and it's not there yet\nHe was so bad remake [laughter] and the wife passed away [laughter] John Bolton I by the way I'm Michael Bolton could be a\nThey could be a good national security advisor he would scare a lot of people [laughter] oh so you're a singer not ... not the guy from office space a\nNo is there a Michael Bolden from office space yeah that was his member that was I was\nThere already named ... I didn't watch office space whoa whoa whoa you know what I'm thinking I'm thinking of the coffee office no I wouldn't know hundred percent and I don't know I don't know yeah it's a space tries face the movie right\nLook at the iconic movie the iconic movie yeah they're going to say today more coffee place yeah okay but if you have John Bolton by her side I don't know if I get to the you know I Know maybe I should have brought booze\nBut if you have John Bolton by your side as national security advisor if you have a Nikki Haley in places you in a bathroom my question is\nHow do you feel Nikki Haley shoes I Know what you an ambassador and it's\nOne of those um jobs where you know you're kind of just basically a in this case your the the mouthpiece for the president you're going to you're going to go out to the world to the other nations and you're going to\nI'm a ... advised them as to what the policy is are going to be\nBut in the scenario where you have a John Bolton and you have a my palm ... did I get that one right [noise] um the [laughter] the strength I think right now of this cabinet and staff\nA ... and and I put Nikki Haley in there is is is right now I mean and and we could maybe in the first year you could go in and you could poke holes and and people dead ...\nUh as secretary of state saying he's not the right guy and ultimately he wasn't but if you look at it right now where it's set up and I'm Talking about national security wise and where we are with countries like Iran and North Korea\nAh and and and even some of our um you know Saudi Arabia you know the president's stance on the Saudis recently um I think it requires somebody of significant strength I'm not saying there's not anyone there was going to have to be somebody who has that strength that can go to\nThe un and do what you know I don't mean to downplay the importance of the UN ambassador but it is somebody who can if if you're looking for quality ... you're you're not necessarily looking for a quality of the normal presidential spokesperson\nWhy and and I'm Out in talking about Sarah Sanders okay I'm Talking about the normal one where you know if you look at all the ... you know the the ... the presidential spokespeople over the last you know just like what Twenty years I look at them and you just said because remember their their parenting what the administration wants their parents their message right\nAnd and the thing that made Sarah Sanders how can be so great is she's directing in your face [laughter] that is actually the way and and you want to project the image\nOf the president of the United states that you represent mhm so imagery of being able to take what the president says and speak at the un with that same kind of force that she did is what you're looking for and I can't tell you because I haven't seen\nYou know I I really haven't seen in that setting any of the the people that I hear so far maybe a port I've never see them I've never witnessed them speaking in that particular matter one thing that I wanted to say about a a Nikki Haley though [noise]\nUh and and it just shows you how\nThe the the mainstream media is just nuts\nBecause they would always ask her and I love this question and rarely is asked to anybody who serves\nIn a Democrat presidents or a cabinet and but well what would you disagree with the president how do you deal with it well of course I'm going to just see what the president because my job is not to promote what I Believe it's to promote what the president believes quite so of course we're going to have differences but\nIf we have differences we talk about it but it's his administration that I serve and\nIt's like you arrive were one of the reasons we would have trouble ever work life in any administration is because we have a we would have a problem promoting something that we didn't believe in ... and there are there are people that and and again I have nothing against people who do that that your job\nYour job is to ... what the administration wants you repeat what the administration wants to the world when you are un\nUN ambassador the problem with the one eyes Ruben talk show hosts too long we just we couldn't we probably couldn't do that or we will get frustrated they are doing that even if the president was even without the president was Ninety percent right we want to get our ten percent in well you can't do that when you're a UN ambassador you\nHave to you know the national security advisor to be said to be in that position I mean not all that that he that he talks to the public but he's an advisor as opposed to someone who is mimicking or or relaying\nAnd vote and said the same thing you know because when when they asked him well you know a fight or a [laughter] heads on John both [laughter] John Button was asked that he's he's always as these they said well look when when you were ... when you were ah you know when you were whatever uh\nUh ... five years ago you said this and now you're saying this he said well this is what the president wish to do I was a private citizen back then\nThe president believes that everything has changed at this point and I do but look\nI give the president advice the president I disagree I give him advice what he does is on the national security adviser advisor they live their lives every role white I tell him what did I I can tell them this is what I think you should do right he doesn't necessarily have to follow it and then when he says let's go and do it but then I tell you what the

us right now to get to get caught up on hurricane Michael good morning Tom good morning Romney\nHow're you guys doing doing well ah what do we know about my goal\nIn the current conditions and what do we expect over the next ah twelve to twenty four hours\nWell I I Wish I could say that this is going to be a pretty picture buddy it's not um I Am encouraged by a number of the reports that have indicated a lot of people have evacuated Panama City [noise]\nAh also a down all the way through saying the\nSame show lab Appalachian coal and and that southern point then of course from their up to Tallahassee now folks in Tallahassee I some of them have been boarding up and all that\nBut what we can expect is fairly simple right now it is a category three hurricane that means sustained away and said a hundred and twenty five miles an hour and for those of you who are kind of geeky can write this down the minimum pressure is nine forty seven nine forty seven Miller bars\nAnd its moon to the north and twelve miles an hour and right now it is two hundred and twenty miles to the south southwest\nOf Panama City out it's in the northern directions so for it to actually hit the target which right now is estimated between in Panama City and the tip of Appalachia cola [noise] ah it's going to have to make a little bit of a right turn\nAnd so in simple terms what people are going to expect is in some significant or whether that they have not seen it in their lifetime [noise]\nUm well it's not totally fair to say that well no I I guess it really is [noise] um because I expected in the next advisory to go up five or six miles an hour if it goes up six miles an hour it'll qualify as a category for hurricane\n... category for hurricane hitting this coast according to the national weather service out of Tallahassee would be the strongest hurricane on record to hit the Florida Panhandle coastline that\nYeah so yeah\nAnd that's ... that's the strongest down on record\nTalked earlier that you know coming down the coast a little bit in the category five hitting in sixty nine the just the state of that that that part so you have an idea of what wins\nAnd that's the point when you talked about you know you get to a category of for hurricanes you're talking about winds over a hundred and thirty one miles an hour as a little different than maybe you're a hurricane one where you may have\nEighty mile an hour winds five mile an hour when it's a completely different ballgame as\nTo exactly and when we get to the category three it changes we call it a major hurricane a category one and two major hurricanes but they're still I mean we saw a category to Florence ... it was a category three briefly but we saw Florence come in\nAnd we did a coverage here on right on the radio for four days with Lawrence and that puppy just hung along the coastline and then this is not going to be the case here by tomorrow as this moves its way out of here it's when this will be affecting the\nFlorida and south and North Carolina shoreline and in fact\nThe last time there was a storm of that kind of situation that came through was case in Nineteen eighty five ... case\nGate at the same time is wins wrapping around the giant Winfield\nMore causing storms and a pen tornadoes along the Carolinas than the Carolinas have got a pretty good chance of of multiple tornadoes associated with this and and you know anyone in this entire area of the Big Bend\nAnd the panhandle are you are going to basically relate to a cake which happened to be in Nineteen eighty five [noise]\nUm but this is gonna blow Kate out all the water\n... in terms of the the the danger coming ashore because I think a lot of people may be who are looking at\nYou know the I coming ashore but I mean the where the danger and the potentially life threatening situation start what is that timeline where is that window and and what should we expect during that time line\nOkay when it comes to the timeline or what you should expect\nBy by tomorrow morning it's still should be off shore and it will be probably ... bill a category three but darn close to a category for it I wouldn't be shocked if in the next ... in in the in one hour from now\nMay be upgraded but by Wednesday evening it should be on shore\nAnd so that would be in line with Tallahassee it would be coming across Tallahassee bites Thursday evening it shouldn't be\nEntering the Carolina ... and cutting right across the middle of the Carolinas and so the eastern side of it will be the onshore winds and the rain and the storms so Charlotte and end up the coast\nStudent loan options wants to give you free information on all the programs that can help sooner you call the faster you can get relief\nGet the

hour or more of your calls and comments you see the story that mortgage rates are going up yeah man what a five percent now Mm wow the more resources out there as a article\nFor do you see you remember when they went down to like seven percent or ... I don't know you weren't a homeowner yet were you when they were in that range\n... when I when I became a homeowner\nThis would have been two thousand seven and\nA January two thousand seven\nIs when I bought my first home I'd buy all over the country and never you know ... never settled down so I finally bought one it was five I Believe was five point six or five point seven percent while while on a Fifteen year I Would have been there yes then I you know ... ... you know re did for I think it was\nLike four point three and then the last one I mean it won't be doing it again about a five years ago or four years ago whatever it was\nThree three point too yeah and and you look at the I remember one time refinancing a property this was years ago on a ten year no at four and a quarter and I was dancing around the house I was so happy to to reach four and a quarter\nBy the the point being is that I mean you know historically you look at the rates and where they were high I mean back when when we started I'm borrowing more or getting mortgages\nAnd the seven to eight percent range and we felt lucky you know but the this is going to ... this will affect\nA revised that will affect a purchases to what extent\nYou know the remains to be seen because right now you also have a pretty a healthy economy and so\nHow does that affect day thirty year no for younger people it's not a

Wednesday right now the strongest packing ones in excess of one hundred twenty five miles per hour they were all just Tom said her landfall\nShould be between three and six PM right now the track and the national Hurricane Center habit of\nFall as the three but it is possible still abhor we can't worry about three or four because it's bringing with it a major hurricane status that it's going to move by quickly this is not going to be like Harvey is not going to be like Florence and drive a lot of rainfall but what it will do is bring more of a punch and more of an impact in Florence ever did it landfall\nSearchers now underway to find a new U.S ambassador to the un after Nikki Haley announced Tuesday\nShe stepped down at the end of the year news has blindsided some key us allies and many congressional Republicans and vote in foreign policy matters Mr Trump says he's narrowed down the shore close to find people to replace a away including former White House advisor Dina Powell\nCat as you mentioned John truck coming up a little bit later on this hour we will chat with him a ... a last hour when we talk to Tom Haley was talking about the incredible storm surge are going to see anywhere you know when you talk about a ... anywhere in that area where it's going to hit the you know near Panama City Florida\nYou know probably going dozens of miles each way you're talking anymore between eight and fourteen foot storm surge BS which is extremely extremely dangerous and now being a category for a they expected to drop a you know right in the the Florida area\nUp to a a you know a foot of uh of rain and and even as you get inland because it right now it's going north and then it's really interesting to watch this because it's going straight northern at some point it's going to start\nOr it's going to start heading east because it does take I mean if you if you look at it uh it does almost take a forty five degree angle if you're looking at the cone and that Cohn ... you think about it\nBecause of uncertainty as I call it has been extremely consistent over the last couple of days that I noticed that it really hasn't moved that ... ... it's almost as if they know whatever that that front is and you know keeping it down you know to the south eastern port part of the United states\nMust be pretty strong because that hasn't changed at all and the track is still the same word cuts right through a you know the the middle of a of a of Georgia which the southeastern part of a of Alabama then cuts right through a Georgia and then South Carolina North Carolina and then out to uh to\nThe uh the ocean it will move pretty fast because it will be by by friday morning it will be really it'll\nBe off shore of the of of uh of North Carolina actually a little bit north east of North Carolina but you know they've been just pounded with the rain and\nAh as a Tom told us last hour they could expect three inches five inches who\nReally knows you don't know I mean it's so unpredictable you know we ... I think about yesterday where they said okay we're going to look a little bit of rain and it just poured here so yeah we had in fact we had some some flooding just based on how to rain\nRight I'm In our area so you think you think of when it's when it's a hurricane and then turn that then you know downgrades to a tropical storm but who really knows what areas how much rain\nOr you're you're going to get but an extremely extremely a dangerous storm now the update here at one am central\nUh two am eastern time a hurricane Michael now a category for extremely dangerous a hurricane now headed a really the bulls eye right now and I don't believe that has changed at all we'll find out a little bit here when we talk to me the meteorologist John trout but\nRight you know having towards Panama City yeah when you when you when you look back on the the I guess the history of a major hurricanes\nOr there will be names that that that a rise to the top there is no doubt of based on what we know about Michael already that in the years to come they will look back on on Michael as one of those again historic storms\nAre based on the size of it and and the amount of damage it caused\nA so we'll be following this and we'll talk to meteorologist John trout are later this hour again get his take on this and and the latest information\nThat he has and of course we multitask here on the show on a consistent basis and and one of the things now just a little less than four weeks before election day is\nAfter the cabinet hearings you know one of the polls doing and you and I really looking forward to what we're going to see a over the next to a couple of days by the time we get to you know this Friday and we start seeing a pulls from the actual\nConfirmation a vote and Collins speech and and how does that affect certain races out there\nUh we do have a a a few new polls out there\n[noise] uh and and again it just it we don't we don't believe that there are any absolutes when it comes to polling but it does can give you an idea or at least a snap shot\nAs to what's going on or looking at the Nevada Senate race jak euros and the Democrat against a Dean Heller the ... Republican where a andme of all the previous polls that were done in September\nA rose and was up a early one poll done in in the early September\nA she was up by one the ... poll a mid September she was up by two or by the time the CNN poll came and these are all likely voter polls\nAre from nine twenty five to nine twenty nine she was up for ... well the latest NBC News mirrors poll done nine thirty to ten and three\nSo you're really through all the hearings at that point\nA again five hundred and Seventy four likely voters\nOr however is no up by two now all of these really are in the margin of error even when she was in the lead mhm so it's all in the margin of error but if you wish to look at it from one poll to another and again they're sampling can be different\nBut you ... what you see is a a six point swing in that particular race still in the margin of error\nBut still we what we're looking for is any type of momentum or any type of ah I I think a a change in the polls movement in the polls which could be perceived to be based on the excitement level\nOf people wanting to go out and vote right we're likely voter\nIn these polls would say you know a likely voter who said yeah I'm I'm a likely voter and and I'm fifty percent sure that I'm going to go out and vote this time words I'm going out\nAnd I'm voting sure and somehow that that ends up changing the the polls are moving it or in another uh a direction so that one in Nevada you know you and I were looking at other polls of uh other polls are out there I'm ... and\nIt was like what's interesting is looking I was looking at the Florida Senate race between Bill Nelson and Rick Scott\nAnd if you look at that right now you have a you you've got a couple of the polls are the are seeing the average showing a Nelson up\nA a to point for but it really hasn't been a if you look at it a just a a really a tie because it's well within the margin of error\nA on a number\nOf polls with the exception of one a Quinnipiac poll that had no sudden a plus seven but you look at other polls here a Mason Dixon poll or from nine twenty four to nine twenty seven and also not by one a W seat TV poll\nThat was taken nine Seventeen to nine thirty which would have included a few days after the uh the the the Senate hearing um they would but that has Nelson up by one\nCall within the margin of boom way and the margin of error because of an ... poses is three and a half\nYet away and so they it it really is a it really is a dead heat there in Florida and I think you I think it'll be interesting to watch uh where where the where that goes\nUm uh I I just think that the loopholes between over the next few weeks everything from cabin on the Capitol hearing a and the vote is is going to settle in\nAnd we don't know which side it motivates more says it motivate the Democrats to get out more to to try and hold the line on the on the Senate race\nAnd and ah in in in order to make an attempt to block Trump or down the road for a possible third a nominee for ...\nAnd so we have uh the the latest uh in the Indiana Senate brown versus a Donnelly a Donnelly not vote for a Kavanaugh\nAnd ... he was up by a by three at the end of August the Fox news poll nine twenty nine to ten to has Donnelly up by two well within the margin of error three point to a five percent\nOr are they now they have there are three of a different candidates are in this race including the libertarian\nYeah so uh but right now it's forty three forty one or a dino Donnelly with the lead but the again excuse me yes with the the lead the Democrats in there but then again that really you look at that that is another a dead heat that exist out there and then we go to Missouri and uh\nUh latest Fox News poll nine twenty nine to tend to and that is a dead tied that is before the actual vote took place\nAnd before colon speech and everything else so that's the kind of thing that we're looking for the polls coming out of it may be here in the next couple of days or early next week and as we get closer to see the effect of that that has had there there are a ton of these\nRaces that are a statistical tie with even in a statistical tie\nThat's maybe up a point or two and a and so this is something that I'm sure as being very carefully watched\nAnd again when you go into and we're not pollsters you know we're not pollsters we can read them but I mean the methodology of of each and every poll has different nuances and it it all depends on you know what the sample is do they

hurricane for\nA you know we buy talked about on CNN yesterday and it was it was just a useless conversation about defining the word Martin and and all that but it but it does get to the uh you know the whole thing of not being civil you know Rand Paul calling Cory Booker machine get up in the face of Congress people and Rand\nPaul and his wife remember last week\nOf a running a letter and an end state or an op ed piece in stating that she sleeps with a gun that remember Rand Paul was attacked by actually in his in his yard by\nBy a neighbor and what they say would you know in the ... it's coming out and saying look\nYou know what you're what you're doing you're ratcheting up the rhetoric now of of complete and total instability in the end the beautiful part is ... you know just how are we a month past\nThe the uh of a funeral John McCain right now or when they were talking about civility in you and I had this isn't gonna last\nHillary decided to get involved in it you're ready for this star I ever got Hillary by the way let us know announced Hillary is batch\nYou cannot be liberal with a political party that wants to destroy what you stand for what you care about [noise] that's why I Believe if we are fortunate enough to win\nBack the house and Oregon up that ... can start again\nLet me ask you this because we we know that the left right now we we we know that ... whether it's Ted Cruz being in a restaurant ... whether it's Mitch McConnell being at an at an airport and the mob mentality that exist now let's get a mob and to intimidate people mhm\nDo they believe that's going to be effective yes they believe it's working that's my I guess that would be my point to ... to begin with that they believe and now Hillary\nOf course when it's well established that the instability in mob mentality now exists then she jumps on board oh yeah I'm going to join join now how many months later\nRight yeah uh and\nShe's no Maxie model so that I\nSaw this this this again [laughter] as well we we talked about that they believe that that they believe it's going to be affected either they believe there's one of two things either they believe it's going to be effective\nOr they're just so ... is so enduring changed they have nothing left some ... nothing left of substance to offer the people yeah so they just that's the natural I guess outlet is\nRange and getting people space wherever they are and their own private time whatever and then what they believe that's going to intimidate Republicans or conservatives really believed that\nYou really believe if you're on the left you honestly believe oh if we do this then they'll be scared and they'll back off right do you really believe that they\nDo they believe that it's going to change the supporters of Ted Cruz no I'll Wait wait wait wait\nIt is it's going to further motivate them it's going to take people who might have decided or maybe just to have been sitting on the fence may be having been enthusiastic about getting out and voting\n\nI mean conservatives or Republicans it is going to absolutely motivate them I was actually\nA online and and I was seeing a number of people that we're talking about\nEarly voting you know here's where to find out where early where the when the early voting starts in your area\nThat means they're chomping at the bit now we don't make predictions but we know right now both sides are motivated the question is which side as motivated more and historically where is that greater turnout did did you see the NBC reporter who went to the college in California ... and there was like thirty people waiting for a\nBus at a college all young people and all of them sitting right there and he said is anybody voting there and the term not one person raised their hand part finally they found a bench they found one person here they found to people that should be our we're going to vote or what's your concern well you know college and\nCost to college or ... what about the rational things on the Russian busted or we don't even know what's going on we don't know attention to that stuff that I mean it was it was ... it was really really interesting but I guess the point and think about this now because Hillary now coming aboard\nAs we said with with everything that went on the insanity from the mainstream of the Democratic party now that the mainstream the Democrat Party\nThinks it's okay to say due process doesn't matter will then Hillary can jump aboard and say a civility now it's gone too we take over when not to be civil bogus civility when we get our way right right we're not we're not we're not going to be civil and and think about what it's about now you're not civil because you believe in what\nDue process and a perception of innocence mhm that you look at any case a political case a civil case or a criminal case and you judge it by what the evidence that exists because you believe that\nThis really is the calm before the storm just at a check on the wind speed at Tallahassee, Florida and we're only looking at\nAbout Seventeen miles an hour but from here on out throughout the day today we will see those wind speeds increase we could see landfall as\nA category for what kinda splitting hairs though I mean we will see wins in excess of one hundred miles an hour we're talking almost a sustained a tornado here folks from the Midwest can appreciate the tornadoes and we're talking about not only are torn addict\nEvent but a rain event as well and possibly tornadoes spawned from this system over the next say thirty six hours or so\nWhat is the threat of storm surge and where we're will those areas the highest threat be\n[noise] ... ah for the highest be a threat to Mexico Beach Florida to ah keep ... beach nine to Thirteen feet\nNow that's just that wall of water that this wind pushes in a couple that with high tide and\nWent into a tides and those areas can range from between three and six feet depending upon where you are on the coast and its water will also push a inland Eric and Gary up through rivers and streams and those sloppy areas so we'll see smaller towns inundated we could even see some major highways guy ten\nAffected not only from the flooding but the wind event\nIs going to cause no doubt some power lines down power outages a\nWeek out ... on roadways from\nA roofs ripped off of homes were talking about a very potentially catastrophic event here what time do you see it coming onshore right now\nRight now we're still looking at the early morning hours today around eight nine AM and that's the actual\nLandfall of they say why but until then from now until then anyone listening to me in that region you gotta take precautions you've got to save your life and family and the the warnings from what the officials have been mentioning for the past\nTwenty four hours to get out of the way this thing is a potential killer\nA meteorologist John trout and I guess we're expecting another update here and just a little over two hours from the national Hurricane Center\n[noise] yeah we'll get another one and by then we'll know whether it should arrive as a cat\nThree or cat for but I don't want people to split hairs on bat when we categorize tornadoes we're only talking about the wind speed we saw from Hurricane Florence or a couple of weeks ago and we saw last year from Hurricane Harvey that the category\nDoes not matter as much when we're talking about flooding because only the wind speeds or part of the categories one of the things I dislike about this effort Simpson scale the real killer here is never the wind it's always the flooding people things they can't get through the roadways they can they can ride it out but ah [noise]\nThose floodwaters are very destructive very dangerous and very unpredictable\nCertainly a meteorologist a John ah trout we'll be following the story of course and and the storm a in a throughout the day and then uh and it has its path\nContinues inland and by the way what should we expect are we still on target or to see a few inches of rain for those areas in the Carolinas affected by Florence\nLittle less than we talked about yesterday I had mentioned or possibly a foot of rain that's been scaled back by a couple inches but a yes those areas locally or could see a some of it\nThe foot of rain fall total amounts into Georgia end to the Carolinas North Carolina and again don't forget the potential for tornadoes spawn from the system\nAll right Dr John traumatic a giant or your time we appreciate it will actually asked work as a so he'll be following this information uh of course ah throughout the day but as John mentioned that you need to heed the warnings\nAnd any other directives given by local officials and just keep in mind that the other ... going to be a number of things that cheap first responders from getting to you and so that's the point a and also uh at at some point you could lose power\nOr may not be safe to drink water ah from the tap and so there are number of things that could become extremely problematic\nAnd of course uh the officials and all of us want you to be safe and and to be able to survive this that things can be replaced that people cannot\nAnd it was just a fifty five minutes ago that the the the new advisory came out from the national hurricane service on hurricane\nOr a center excuse me on hurricane a well Michael the wanting um central time advisory that it was up to a strength for hurricane and sit in a maximum sustained winds now a hundred and thirty miles an hour or so it is a\nStrength for hurricane yeah which is extremely dangerous and will be well on on modern records the the biggest hurricane ever to hit if it stays that of or I even believe it was a tree and maybe the the the biggest ever\nTo hit their the strongest to ever write the panhandle of Florida in ... in terms of the wind and and John brings up a great point about those spin off tornadoes in those areas which you can also be destructive as well will follow the story and coming up next our in fact we'll talk with meteorologist Tom hale get an update from him\n[noise]\nAs soon as ... radio on was bored one\nEvery Tuesday and Thursday morning at one am central it's the freight minor runs smart our on red eye radio tuned in Bellevue run more efficiently

southwest of apple electrical of Florida\nFor the president is looking for a new U.S ambassador to the un after Nikki Haley announced she's stepping down at the end of the year news blindsided some key us allies in many congressional Republicans involved in foreign policy matters White House as narrow down the shortlist of five people to replace say lake including former White House advisor Dana Powell\nOf a of North Carolina so they've got a ton of ... are bringing their as we all know because of a Hurricane Florence but also their coastline could also be affected as are also tropical storm\nA of a warnings are especially long the the Georgia and South Carolina line actually tropical storm warnings there and\nWatches a\nA North Carolina side or we are right now that quite often you'll see tornadoes uh that that that spin off from storms like this and they can become destructive and they are ... and they happened very quickly\nUh the knowing and and growing up in tornado alley uh you understand that that they are the that that often there's little to no warning\nAre those tornadoes and they become of course a ... a separate a destructive force\nOf their own so certainly all the folks in the path of hurricane might go a over the next twenty four to forty eight hours heed the warnings or keep your radios on a keep batteries charged\nAnd uh stay alert or coming up here in less than thirty minutes after the bottom of the hour we'll talk with meteorologist Tom hale who did a great job and covering Hurricane Florence force or we talk to him earlier he also a covered a Hurricane Irma\nIn Florida for us uh on red eye radio so we'll talk to him about this a new report the update from the national Hurricane Center which came across at two AM eastern\nAnd what changed here and and again what all of this means in terms of the energy behind hurricane Michael\n[noise] are you getting back to what we're talking about a last hour and when we played the audio cut from Hillary Clinton sane civility is impossible until the\nDemocrats take power again so that was her call for instability and the interesting thing about that as an and we've talked about you know whether it's Ted Cruz or\nYou know in the restaurant that made a big news of a uh a couple of weeks ago or Mitch McConnell\nAre at the uh the the airport or a a been Jeff Flake in the the the elevator or what's you know what's going on right now but the ... member from Maxine Waters remember one Maxine Waters and she might have been really ignited that that political flame of\nOf actually Democrats to like the office of the way that was calling it\nA you know and and so we saw what happened this past weekend we saw what happened to Ted Cruz saw what happened to Mitch McConnell saw what happened to Jeff Flake\nOr the conversation on CNN yesterday it's not a mob it's just a people expressing their their uh their their their viewpoints and it's like well most of America looks at it and when they see people screaming and yelling and going into into a private place not an organized protest\nOr organized protest Americans are fine with\nYou go out and you protest and you're with tens of thousands of other people and it's a peaceful protest and that's fine Americans don't want riots\nAmericans don't want mob rule they don't want you go they they don't ah most Americans don't approve of the fact of going into a place that is not your property trespassing just to the point of harassing for a you know there's some you know somebody else has happened in Ted Cruz's place\nBut that call to harass people ... anywhere uh\nYesterday a Rand Paul again and you know Rand Paul's wife\nOr has been on this year for the last uh a couple of weeks talking about the instability Kentucky Senator Rand Paul on Tuesday took aim with the rhetoric employed by senator Cory Booker and others accusing them of ratcheting up the conversation or to the point where unstable people could commit violence Sen Paul\nTo Kentucky radio host I fear there's going to be an assassination\nWhy I really worry that someone is going to be killed and those who are in a war ratcheting up conversations those who are saying get in their face there have to realize that they bear some responsibility if this ... elevates the violence\nThese are people that are unstable pulse says we don't want to encourage them we have to somehow ratchet down and say we're not encouraging them the violence that violence is never okay or there was never a reason uh to resolve things that weigh directly calling out Booker\nWho last July told activists to get up in the face of some congresspeople Paul referenced his own uh salt of the hands of a neighbor\nAs well as last year's a baseball field shooting which Representative Steve ... was wounded to show that unstable people can easily take things are too far and then we talk about the fact that Hillary\nTalked about you know no civility right share her call so you've mainstream did completely now with Hillary comes out you can't get more mainstream Democrat over the last Twenty years so Hillary now calling for ... you know instability number one we talked about the fact that\nTo actually think this was an effective way to go to the actually think that politicians\nYou know calling for now to the point of Hillary Clinton saying can help civility which is to call for instability ... which is the calls to harass people in their private life\nAnd\nI that was the first thing that hit me was was they think this is going to be effective\nBut then you get to the point of a Hillary now bringing it up or she feels comfortable saying it look Hillary's a follower she'll be as you would not take an opinion on anything if she believes\nThat it is perceived as radical at all to anybody in her base ... we've seen it before\nRemember when she was up in Canada yeah and she was asked about the pipeline right\nI'm not going to comment on that because other people right now are making a decision look you're running for president if this is still a a an issue we need to know what your thoughts on a dark and she didn't want to take a side right and so now here's Hillary Clinton calling for instability and\nAnd and you think think about this\nSo now it's becoming mainstream and the un and wonder why instability over what\nWhat is the issue\nYou're calling for due process you're calling for presumption of innocence\nYou're calling for preponderance of evidence you're saying where's the evidence you're coming out because this is and we talked about this yesterday what came out of this whole thing ah you know from from Democrats is if you believe in due process than you are enabling rapists and therefore you deserve no civility because of\nIt which is of course\nThat's their definition it's not that definition of people that believe in due process under the law people that believe in due process under the law obviously are not advocating parade for sexual assault than any other crime right\n\nAnd that's the point and so I think about it that it's very important to get to the actual issue what is the point that they view that is so radical that the right is taking ... instability mislead and it's that simple point the belief in due process\nAnd evidence in any case to show the guilt to anybody and not just an allegation that is what has set off even though the mainstream now of the Democratic party to call for in civility this is\nHow far how low we always wonder we always

once in a while you get to be able to capitalize on that adrenalin rush 'em because you know a meteorologist one of the few things that we get to do and as broadcasters in our lifetime is maybe save a life\nAnd and and and here we have an opportunity because we were being heard from one end of the coast to the other side of the United states\nAnd every one of these people who are listening right now I have family and friends or know someone who as family and friends hurt along this coast and so I'm making the suggestion that you can get in touch with your family and friends and make sure that they're doing the right thing [noise]\nA simple example in Panama City beach there are six possibly now seven shelters that are open so if you've decided to stay along the beach front\nUm and not move

twenty if you want to go that's only an hour drive up the road to an interstate excuse me interstate ten hum the simple thing is that you need to get out of harm's way\nHum when we talk about a category\nFor storm I Want to put this in perspective and and and and not a slow moving storm like we saw was ...\nIt was a category for storm that hit Puerto Rico last year called Irma\nWe've all seen the pictures and the devastation now devastation is relative to what it hits so if it's a rotted tree\nIt could take a breeze to take that out um if the homes are not built to handle hurricanes or they haven't had hurricanes in a long time and the building standards and become a lax\nSweat same story you get greater amounts of devastation [noise]\nUm here this is something that they have not seen along this coastline historically period um along the\n... the Panama City beach to Tallahassee Pensacola Beach simply put the panhandle and then the Big Bend area that's the area that swoops around and and and swings down to cedar key\nThere hasn't been a category for storm hit and so that's in itself\nIs something that nobody can relate to and when you can't relate to something\nYou relate to what your cat and what you can uh if somebody has been around since Nineteen eighty five [noise] that would be Kate and Kate was quite a devastating storm\nAnd at that point you have to say to yourself well if you haven't been around for Kate\nYou know what other things that have come by well there's been very few October storms to begin with\nI'm this storm is an October storm ... he was an October storm and there was a failure but ... was a major all these are major storms but a failure was offshore and so it didn't have\nThat kind of a an effect\nOn Florida and so right now if you're listening or if you have family and friends along that area you need to understand that that on Wednesday evening one hundred mile an hour wind gusts are going to comment and that's after it's

be able to hear any warnings that come across for us\nLike a tornado or as it was being described by Tom hale a meteorologist on this story and ... again talk with him here and just a bit\nI'm Talking with him about the storm surge and the way it is a you know as he described it it's like filling up a bathtub so it is not something again or if you are not familiar with this with a a storm surge and very few people are\nBased on the the ... diction models for the highest storm surge from this storm very few people on the planet\nHas ever experienced that and again we just have to repeat that that is a deadly deadly a danger to ah to to individuals well that may not be familiar with it and not a understand fully or what the impact\nIs sad and I never lived in in Panama City but at the looks familiar the the downtown city area and with ... with a lot of residences\nRight next to the water on the bay and it reminds me of a lot of like Fort Walton Beach when when I Lived outside of Fort Walton Beach where I live actually lived in in Fort Walton Beach for a very short time but mostly in Nevada or Florida which is between Pensacola\nAnd and Fort Walton Beach and and that's in my head and trying to figure out what it would be like\nYou know when I remember sitting there right in you know residential the in in the city there and you could see the bay and I'm thinking and that would have been a in Fort Walton Beach I talked to had to May of ... that came up\nYou know fourteen feet what that would be like and that's what I'm trying to imagine in my head and as amazing I mean look at ... or ... or a look at the uh Panama City in and say you're going to have a lot of flooding\nAnd and again uh we we talked about it the the houses on the beaches that are on stilts they're roughly a the four of those houses and the deck roughly at ten feet\nSo if you're talking about a Thirteen or fourteen foot surge that means that inside those above the cells inside those homes you're still talking about three to four feet of water\nA and that becomes the you know I think that puts it in perspective for anyone who's even seen one of those homes and I stayed in one over the summer\nI Can't imagine water getting that high there's a reason that they built him on stilts so now\nThe average is roughly ten feet it's because it's thought to be above the average storm surge and and the path of a storm or you know in the average again storm but Michael hurricane Michael is no average storm\nWe'll be talking to me they're all just Tom hale coming up at the bottom of the hour trying to get in all the other stories that are out there and they're actually a quite a few stories the the one that caught my attention yesterday because uh the way you really have got no response from the White House on this especially with the president coming out really uh yesterday and and dating\nAnd Monday that a Rod Rosenstein is going to stay ... ah you know he's she's going to be there they had the talk and everything is great then the story comes out the two senior FBI officials told the bureau's top lawyer they believe the deputy attorney general Rod Rosenstein was serious when he discussed secretly recording Donald Trump\nAnd invoking the twenty Fifth Amendment to remove him from office last year according to sources close to a congressional investigation and an account that conflicts with the claims from Rosenstein and others that the comments were either and accurately reported or made in jest\nBut this is again former general counsel a James Baker more information coming out about his testimony are told congressional investigators behind a closed door deposition last week that then FBI acting director Andrew McCabe an FBI lawyer Lisa Page came to Baker after Trump fired FBI Director James Comey\nAnd may have twenty Seventeen Baker said page and McCabe relate details of the meeting where Rosenstein made the comments\nThough he wasn't personally in that meeting Baker told congressional investigators he took McKay been pages word a seriously the sources said further Baker trope congressional investigators\nHe suspected that Rosenstein was cooperating with two people in the administration to vote the twenty Fifth Amendment a source said wow the testimony would appear at odds with other accounts of those discussions Baker who's testimony was described\nAs deliberate and sober added he had not done a legal analysis and was not on sure whether it was unethical or illegal the source at it\n[noise] [noise]\nYeah I'm really just the the story that we've talked about the one that is\nHas been completely Barry where there's been a really items\nThat somebody may have written it out there but I haven't I haven't even seen it National Review mhm Henry McCarty I have an obscene write about it to get released Russell and and this is about a analyzing but the fact that the president with the Pfizer warrant application that he said let's see classify it\nAnd then came out and said well\nWe're going to give it to the inspector general to look at and he will expedite it quickly and we went for what\nFor what you're you're if you're afraid that are some things should stay or you know redacted\nWell then you don't go to the inspector general you go you you're a secretary of state former CIA director because what you're claiming some of the allies don't want somebody information out so you go to him or you go to the director of national intelligence you go to the director of the CIA\nThe last person to go to is the inspector general because the inspector general looks at what corruption oh oh they declassified it next thing you know it's going to the inspector general corruption\nWhy is does it seem to be that nobody\nIn the media is covering that story every day I wake up and I say or what am I missing\nWell because if you look at it there is there's nothing to gain the president's not going to get any kind of I guess political feedback or direction from the inspector general no that's not first of all it's not who Horowitz is\nBut it's not the role of that office of that position\nTo be an advisor to the president that's not the point the point of the ... office is to investigate misdeeds and wrong doings and possible criminal activity by people within the department of justice\nBut if you look at how that played out and nobody talked about it except for the fact\nThat nobody talked about it and I'm not talking about the\nKimberley straw souls or you know any anybody that has been covering this or even a Sarah a quarter who's been covering a number of things and\nAnd does a really good job at it I'm Talking about the liberal media who's been screaming rushing collusion Russian collusion Russia inclusion rush inclusion since before the president took office so\nIt was about that time that they went completely silent on Russian collusion\n... noon as brought it up like that I don't know why the president doesn't make sense and then he stopped talking about right\nBecause nobody is talking about it in Washington none of the politicians Adam Schiff isn't talking about it nobody is talking about the fact that they did the right direction\nAnd then gave it to the inspector general they se classified ad and then said oh we see something here that the inspector general who investing gains corruption mhm we give it to him to review it\nBecause there's only ... whether it was done for this reason or not there's only one thing that can really come of it and that is an investigation by the inspector general to look over it and write a report on it\nWould think somebody would ask the president Mr President what did the administration see in the on redacted material to give it to the inspector general who's\nFor instance\nThere's your basement or crawl space to have a damp must be smell will watch out\nThat's a sign of too much moisture and not enough ventilation and that could

winning what do we know about a\nA hurricane Michael at this point and when should we expect another uptick\nOkay we should expect an update one hour from now actually we should expect an update and a half an hour out of our yeah mhm yeah and uh and then the second question\nAnd so what is I guess they give us the latest on that uh what do we know about what's the status of Michael right now and when do we expect Michael to hit the shore in the panhandle of Florida\nOkay well the first thing is you know normally the national weather service can be kind of conservative in regards to its own language but the national weather service or the national Hurricane Center in this case describes Michael as an extremely dangerous category for hurricane or life threatening storm surge\nHurricane force winds\nHeavy rain expected along\nThe northeastern Gulf Coast\nAnd is located a hundred and eighty miles to the southwest of Panama City and it is one it is a\nOne hundred and Seventy miles to the southwest of Appalachia cola that of course when Spain's or a hundred and thirty miles an hour and it's moving to the north\nAnd twelve miles an hour now taking a look at that some of the radar um indications and said if you've been watching any of the TV stations with the radar indications that shows a little bit of wobble to it\nAnd it actually looks like it may be starting to make a little bit of a turn maybe one or two degrees\nIn the direction of Panama City um and and so it's most likely going to come ashore right in between Panama City\nBeach and down to Appalachian coal Callaway is a town along their port saint Joe is also along that same area as a category for and this is the official definition of a category for\nA category for hurricanes have sustained winds of a hundred and thirty up to a hundred and fifty six miles an hour obviously Puerto Rico so the higher end of that scale but well built framed homes and well a a sustain severe damage\nLoss of most of their roof in and possibly some exterior walls while trees will be snapped or a bird and power lines down\nFalling trees and power lines will isolate residence and power outages will last for potentially a several weeks and they have it in here or possibly months now they're writing for the worst case scenario here but\nUh several months was Puerto Rico's case and most of the area will be uninhabitable for weeks or months while\nNow that's the definition of a category four [noise] yeah that's a while um and so you know what can I tell ya I'm ...\nI worked for a company that has a group of television
