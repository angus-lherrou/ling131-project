Grady for the wall Street Journal editorial board she's the America's columnist and editor watching the story from Puerto Rico these last month since September hurricane last year\nThe debate has been about excess deaths following the hurricane to Puerto Rico I follow the story was married to her columns because Puerto Rico was what was a mess afterwards with tangled and sailed electricity generation and the inability of the Puerto Rican FEMA\nA executives to respond in a in a credible fashion uh also Puerto Rico has a longstanding problems with gas and electrification it didn't occur to me that that was going to wind up into a political toy to use against the Trump Administration in these last week's marry your reporting about\nAccess smart excess of mortality yeah after the hurricane struck Puerto Rico I think the salient fact here is that you've got nothing to compare this to because that's not how the national weather service things\nWell the headline of course was that three thousand people died in a hurricane and of course the implication as this happened under Donald Trump there for Donald Trump has not spending enough money in Puerto Rico and doesn't care about Puerto Rican people and by the way you know let's extend this to all Hispanics you know it was very much politicized\nAnd um that kind of got my attention for two reasons first of all I'm there is a very prominent meteorologist who wrote a wonderful\nEssay about his peculiar study it's a study done by George wash at George Washington university's milking Institute and what they tried to do was measure how many people died between September of two thousand Seventeen\nAnd the following I Believe all with the end of February so basically six months\nAnd hurricane was course head toward the end of September\nAnd what they tried to do was look at what would be that normal mark Halladay rate over that period of time\nAnd then what was excess of over that and they attributed that to the aftermath of hurricane\nAnd this meteorologist by the name of John ... who is actually born I think New York but I spent quite a bit of this like in Puerto Rico is a Puerto Rican mother he married a sensible statement that number one and this\nIs not how anybody measures hurricane Talladega so to all of a sudden is extending the six months when hurricane fatalities are generally measured in a shorter period of time is kind of a disingenuous on top of that you have this\nStudy at the milk and then you have another study at Harvard and you have another study at I think it was Penn\nAnd these studies can have different time frames\nAnd they they can they can use different methodology and his point was that for example if you look at the Harvard study that was that they have the Harvard study came out and said that somewhere between seven hundred and some people and a thousand and some people were excess mortality\nEnded up for a month or three months after the hurricane that's a huge\nYour window and so what the reporters do if they choose the midpoint of those two numbers and they said this is how many people died well that is far from an exact science and something similar or was that it wasn't such a broad window but it was something similar was done with the milk and Institute\nAnd so I just wanted to point out that\nYou know you have the period of\nTime during the hurricane that of course you you know off the obviously find ... people who have died that you didn't count initially and I think the government's count is somewhere around sixty four expand\nThat to three thousand you have to start assigning problems of the hurricane to problems in the aftermath in other words it wasn't really the storm it wasn't a high when\nIt was for a infrastructure and the uh the emergency early and that's\n... that's not how hurricane death are counted that's point number one point number two is to blame this on the federal government I think is really disingenuous when you look at\nThe way that Puerto Rico has an ... I mean if I Would say over the last twenty or sadly [noise]\nUm do you have a lot of the of basically run away populace to the point where the electricity company was giving away electricity and when you don't collect a revenue for your electric company can't oriented best you can strengthen that go ahead and you become extremely vulnerable to the store\nThat's what happened in the government running electricity company this in a private company\nBut married don't remember correctly that the executives in charge of FEMA's office in Puerto Rico were locked in politically to the governor of the island and that a lot of blame shifting has been going on because that's political advantage in Columbus in Puerto Rico nothing to do with Washington\nHe I mean I was very critical at the time of the hurricane awake after of the way that FEMA behave but not I mean you know the implication is always that Washington doesn't care about Puerto Ricans but in fact\nThe the guy the guy on the island was a Puerto Rican and the guy who was running the operation and he basically in my mind you know stop\nBecause he was saying and then a week after the crisis when there still is no electricity for dialysis patients and all kinds of basically the hospital for and really bad shape and you add\nThe people who needed electricity\nAnd he said well I have the generators but how are they supposed to know that the companies who are not going to be able to deliver the hill\nNow I think that's preposterous here an emergency management ... and he was a Puerto Rican and so and this wasn't a you know the idea that that bunch of people over here on this on the mainland didn't care about Puerto Rico issue that messed up and and that included have\nMary we have thirty seconds there's Puerto Rico learned a lesson is there any indication that they're going to be prepared for another storm thirty seconds\nYou know I don't think so I mean they're still blaming a President Trump and not taking responsibility and until they when they're rewriting the narrative in this way indicate that they just want to Cape May shutting off their responsibility for managing the island to the rest of

connected to somewhere on blurbs into the Pentagon on Tuesday those two pieces of mail delivered to the Pentagon ... also tested positive for the poison books were not passed on to the White House were Pentagon officials\nCompletely yeah yeah right right and and it's I think the\nYou know what you're saying here really is that I mean it goes back to that buzzfeed um the the editor at at at buzzfeed saying this is how we see are you know are journalists out\nAh and for the foreseeable future basically as activists this is what he was saying that was the message and that's exactly what you're seeing right now since saying well we got a ton\nOf things to ah to talk about the background check could be completed today was interesting the story that said you know we're discussing our pre show meaning ah where the lawyers for Dr Ford are are\nAre you saying look she hasn't been you know you haven't interviewed her yet no by and I saw store yesterday saying the FBI may not interviewer because she's already been interviewed for what we keep ... and we even because again\nBecause when you talk about the FBI everybody thinks about an investigation this is not an investigation\nRight so all they are looking for is more witnesses and any new information\nWhat other witnesses are there are a you know are out there what were the allegations that were made right\nWhat were the allegations that were made again here or in you know at at that that uh\nIn the hearing that caused because it was after the hearing okay we need to have the FBI do a further background check okay what's the new news out there\nAnd I started thinking I said why wouldn't they interview and I went oh it's not an investigation into background check they already know what you said not him now I don't know I mean they may interviewer but I I was thinking well why wouldn't they and I went oh she's already been interviewed ... interviewed by the Judiciary Committee\nAnd so what they're looking at is okay what other information is is out there one of the witnesses are out there what did she say at this hearing right\nAnd we will go talk to those people because she's the one making the allegations she's the one that testified under oath we don't need the interviewer\nWell she made her statement in fact she made her right to the Senate if there were any thing uh\nShe anything else she wanted to introduce introduced to this scenario to this a process ... she can do right now she could what she could still do it right and ah she and she had the opportunity to do it last Thursday but the great point you just made she still has the opportunity it's still open\nRight and so what they don't have is they didn't have we didn't have witnesses making statements\nSo she's the one making allegations so they're checking out\nHer story mhm and if she doesn't updated with the Judiciary Committee the FBI made me looking at the same welders ... look to see the allegations you may hear some people she mentioned\nWe talked to those people we give you a report because here's what the people said we don't need interview her\nHer statement is on record winning the interview all the other people that she made the allegations against or claimed that they were witnesses she has made her statement right we have that and if she wishes to change if she can go back to that she can write a letter to to the Judiciary Committee stating ah here's more information and then the FBI can go check that\nBut they're not doing a here's the point they're not doing a background check on Dr for now they are not\nThere doing the background check or on the allegations that she made against Kavanaugh\nThat we've talked in recent days about the the possibility\nOf her perjuring herself by telling a different story to the FBI\nBut really when you think about it and you back away from the whole thing and you look at the the entire forest and not just the the you know the trees here than you or do you very quickly come to the conclusion that there is likely\nZero political will to go after her for perjury\nUnless she came out and said everything I said was false and my testimony right and I\nI admit that I was lying about that they could they would then but but any kind of you know variants in a story to the FBI likely is not going to be pursued a by the chairman a grass or by anyone in the house I\nKnow and I you you see Grassley saying they want to investigate the fact that her boyfriend says something is something else because she was asked to specific question have you ever helped anybody a you know to counsel them about you know how to take a polygraph test and she said no and her boyfriend is said yes but I view that\nAs putting pressure on her credibility politically in order to get the votes look once the votes on ...\nBoat has made if he is if he is confirmed it's done it's over yeah right so this is this won't even be a topic next week we'll be back on moving back to Russia collusion yeah\nYeah yeah it is not a ... and and I guess this is it is it the whole I on the ball thing\nWas asked to be the process\nIs is really to determine you know ah whether the ... those handful of senators actually um believe he should be said it or not and that that's it that's actually the only question here the media and the and the left in the media and social media want you to believe it's about\nKavanaugh and you know and and you must think that he is you know a rapist or whatever they want to label him as now that's how you build political\nPressure but actually just bought a five weeks out from the mid term election\nIt's it is it's different because they're going to look at the polls if the polls that build that pressure and I mean the polls on the candidates themselves not\nWhether they believe you brought us to pull the other night of ... when you introduce the facts to the case more people believe in fact it was a majority yeah ... do you see it at a fifty fifty seven percent\nThan a change what they think and then when asked well if the FBI comes back with their report is once ... once they were told that the three witnesses the cooperating witnesses that she named\nDidn't cooperate and they said oh okay and then he should be confirmed and then writes sixty seven percent then they said well if the FBI does the background check and finds out no new information was sixty percent of Americans I Believe that he should be confirmed\nA at a you know at that point of course you're gonna forty percent of America as we said you know roughly it's forty percent Republican forty percent Democrats and the rest are into the other twenty percent is roughly independence and that's what you're trying to\nUh you know that that's who you're trying to convince\nThose in the middle which are those are the senators were looking at as well right\nAnd so uh that will that that you know who knows that that poll probably was looked at by a lot of those\nUh uh a lot of those or a senator so I'm\nA you know I I think the whole thing of the doctor for commit the you know about perjury ... on that will remain a you know will remain an issue I don't know whether they would say I doubt I'd be surprised if they if they confirmed him this weekend and I think it's all done\nYet either good or not I ended up and they will do anything they they move on\nThey move on to the the the the next thing they move on to promoting the fact\nAh if I was the Republicans I Would promote the fact that\nYou know we you know the ... the we you know the Supreme Court you know we've got we've got the Supreme Court going up to the ... election\nAnd it'd be promoting math to irks me NAFTA or whatever it is now us MCA [laughter] that I'd be promoting the the the the trade deal and Republicans you know do you know a minute we're going to be voting on ah the bat before the term I'd be talking about all the positives\nAnd that I'd be talking about also what your political enemy uh spouses\nAnd you would reflect on what has happened you know in the campaign and I think that's what they would focus on at that point uh I just don't think that they would look backwards who knows I mean whether they could have a a a separate committee of you know continuing investigation as to whether she did commit perjury\nAnd ... and and not make it high profile because there would be no hearings it would just be an investigation and down the road\nA as a warning shot to anybody who might do it to a a you know a future nominee with you know try and come in and and commit perjury if they could ...\nFries perjury ... you know they might they might do that as long as it was low key Adam you're not going to hearings on that or a big to do on that because once they confirming him the battle is over we must callers before they go after every Democrat\nNo the winner is you can you get him\nA on the Supreme Court hip after that that the victory bats the super bowl\nYeah that's it uh and and I think Republicans to ah you you also campaign on look ah\nThis this this kind of battle may not be behind us necessarily while it is specifically with Kavanaugh there's a real possibility that this president whether in this term or maybe in his second term would not would have the opportunity to see another\nJustice and that's a big deal we know how now we know what levels the ... to which the left is willing to go and we need people to vote\n[noise] eight six six Ninety right I [noise]\nReady to

guarantee this will be the last piece of paper and there it is it's the last piece of paper\nSo at the bottom of the ... yeah I got this from Stanley uh yesterday send us an email saying\nThe president declassified certain types of documents and emails it's been over two weeks a will that info be made public what do you think is going on ... Danley thanks so much we appreciate it\nA nice sometimes to us ah yesterday and ah we had talked about briefly last week I mean the capital thing has just dominated the news but it's when you and I actually on the air because there were so many of the things going on and we're just having a conversation on it\nOnly what oh yeah\nAnd uh the the the president\nA ...\nOn Twitter and this goes back to what the just the twenty first and I met with the department of justice concerning the classification of various on redacted documents they agreed to release them but state of the doing so\nMay have a perceived negative impact on the Russia probe Trump wrote on Twitter\nAlso a key allies asked us not to release or for the inspector general has been asked to review these documents on an expedited basis I Believe he will move quickly on this\nAnd hopefully other things which she is looking at in the end I can always declassified but proves necessary speed is very important to me and every one\nSo the story came out and it just sort of died down and and you and I and this that maybe it was probably the very beginning of of of last week\nAnd we said good in a few days have gone by and the cabin up thing was just huge and we just went\nWait a minute inspector general\nOh if the if he allies are saying you know that the you know we believe that some of the information to censor\nWell then you go back to your director of national intelligence ... and you may go back to the department of justice and you say okay what do you think should were released this or you talk\nYou talk to a Palmdale right former CIA director who's now\nSecretary of state and the and you say okay the you know should worry releases how would this affect what we're doing you know because what they came out was it was Great Britain that said they didn't want information coming out and Christopher Steele apparently it was one report and Christopher Steele is\nIs the former British I'm\nA spy who was part of the Democrats colluding with the Russians to change the outcome of the electorate to Christopher Steele a ... just to lay it out again the DNC and Hillary Clinton camp a campaign gave money\nTo the law firm Perkins ... who gave it to the opposition research firm\nI'm fusion GPS who then gave the money to Christopher Steele who got the information\nOr from people he claims inside the Kremlin the unverified dirt on Donald Trump and we know who's done with that on verified dirt so that's where the Christopher Steele you know the whole thing comes a comes in a to this [noise] uh\nAnd so and one of the key players they're fusion GPS or was married to still is married but at the time her husband was a high ranking a department of justice official Bruce\nBruce or and then we know what they used to be you know the the Pfizer worn and all that well\nSo we wanted well wait a minute just doesn't make sense if you don't give it to the inspector general the inspector general only looks at corruption and\nAh\nAnd by the way that's almost a replay of what happened I think maybe it was a ... a week ago Monday or Tuesday and we brought it up yeah because there were just other things and we just started going over it and we went\nWe don't understand why would you give it to the inspector general inspector general you know you get this information at some redacted you're looking at it and and and\nAh all of a sudden oh the light bulb goes off it would be an internal matter which would be in a scenario of like this if it is a fact\nPeople at the Justice Department are under in the Obama administration\nOr more work\nTo get information and use that false information that dossier or to get a warrant knowingly using it to get a Pfizer war it\nThen that would be corruption that would be abuse of power that would be a massive\nWell and it leads to the the the claim a from Rudy Giuliani ... that ah the he believes they committed perjury

looking at what judge Kavanaugh says at age fifty three not what he did that age Eighteen we're looking at his credibility now is grown adults\nThat test all on the Senate floor comes as the FBI continues its one week investigation into the allegations and its leader McConnell says the Senate will vote on friday Lenny can young Capitol\nHill New York Times is reporting that President Trump received at least four hundred Thirteen million dollars from a throng of the road but decades much of that through dubious tax Dodgers ... possible fraud and time claims Trump in his father for the voted gifting inheritance taxes by setting up show corporations undervaluing assets to authorities\nThe story and the ... and the and the the narrative change she says she had witnesses or she had people with knowledge of the event and then they said um\n\nLook at it this is what it comes down to is a there are but it it is a very real thing\nLet's let's step back just a second\nRemember for those in the in the middle those on the left ... ... honestly\nAnd I can't tell you which is which some people might believer and some people might\nNot care whether she's telling the truth or not if it's something that can keep ... off the bench and something else to block Trump\nKeep in mind who left is and what they're doing right now and when you think of somebody making up a story line I don't I have no idea what did or didn't happen\nI'm just talking about the possibility not necessary\nWith a very real fact that the left or right now is in ... literally and everybody's face that gets in their way I mean you got to look at the very behavior toward Jeff Flake and the elevator\nThey don't see that as wrong they don't see that as as uh if if someone did that to Feinstein I Know he's not a you know flakes not a Trump fan\nBut if someone did that the Feinstein or Kamala Harris as if a Trump supporter did that\nTo come out here is are you kidding me that would be\nA verbal assault that's what the that's what the media would label it as it was a verbal assault on Kamala Harris\nThis is who they are this is how they act is not a stretch to think\nAnd believe that false accusations even at this level\nAre absolutely possible\nIt's just not\nBecause the left has determined that anything and everything the resistance doesn't have boundaries standards or any of it they have one mission defeat Trump regardless of of the method\nEight six six Ninety right I listen to your calls and comments we go to Shannon in Illinois Shannon you're on the road I Radio Welcome to the show\nSay [laughter] I I Would say I'm not sure if I knew who have all four but he said that side or ...\nYou get all you want you want a speaker phone we can't hear what you're saying I Would get off if you can get on a speaker phone we can't understand what you're ... you're saying here\nAre are her finger gr better if I don't know if you're on the earth fire going to say that common aren't performers who are very unprofessional under the Chrysler crack\nThe great I I I think in ... I think you can retire or her back to our current life people that come out ... ... ... ... who could not ... do not know that\nNo no no I don't I don't I don't care whether it's Trump is Trump doesn't it doesn't even come into the discussion here ah this is about\nHis performance in his performance when you have the the mainstream Democrats in the Senate on the United states come out and make the claim that due process doesn't matter that an allegation enough\nIs enough for them to charge you and believe that you committed a sexual assault upon someone without any evidence I Believe in his totally justified in that manner to get angry\nHis crying started not because of him his crime started because of his compassion for his wife\nHis daughters and when he really got emotional it was of the women that has stood by him knowing that in the atmosphere the highly charged atmosphere that we live in today were Democrats\nAnd liberals will do anything to destroy your life that these women stood behind him for him to get emotional I thought\nWas extremely appropriate based on the unfounded accusations against him and the certainty of one side of the Senate he committed this crime these crimes with all the evidence there is no\nI Love it it's\n... ... as a judge you should you should\nNever show emotion never show emotion you should never be human I disagree I think judges should understand compassion well if if if he had been very clear calm\nAnd directing the response he would've been cold they would have been said that they would have been set by the left\nThis guy doesn't have feelings right\nI I disagree professional has nothing to do you can be emotional if you believe that you are being\nUnfairly charged I on the rare cases [laughter] and I believe you probably have to in our professional lives have shown the anger\nAh [laughter]\nAnd uh I Will say this I Am shown [noise] anger management and I believe when I've shown anger\nAnd sometimes we're not at this management by the way I Want to make this clear and management measures Greg has enough to know or will ever do any serious and was no seriously I mean that there's never been with the people that we that we know it it is not with as a member of it but but in my career and there have\nBeen people that bit you know it has gotten you know in your face I Believe it was completely appropriate for the situation at that time to say anger or compassion\nFor people is something that is considered unprofessional I Would disagree with everything depends on the scenario at that time what are the allegations against you and then how\nDeeply personal it has become the jak has become first so not not just in that room on that day last Thursday\nBut in his home\nAnd and and dealing with his children and the people suggesting that he has no place in working with children as a volunteer right that's deeply personal and frankly I'd be concerned if he didn't get upset about it but\nThe the things that I Know I got angry about were strictly professional ... they weren't personal attacks on me and still professionally I bilaterally run if you look at him professionally professionally when it came to asking him questions\nAbout anything he was ... about his job and his decision he was calm and he was a cool and he answered all of those are questions with a with a great sense of humor we're talking about the first hearing ...\nAnd he answered all the questions there was no anger it was the personal attacks\nCame his way the unfounded in his mind\nPersonal attacks came his way that he again and by the time we got to that particular point of the the uh the the the hearings a you know the it was certainly the un committed sexual assault mhm\nYes\nAnd it was a label visually by Democrats as a gang rapist\n\nThis is that's how far they were willing to go right\nSo\nIt was personal and it was more subtle from it and people take that personal and and I believe that is how I Would expect someone who believes that they are innocent how they would respond I Know it's how I Would respond\nAnd if you think the judges aren't human and they don't get angry even when they're on the bench presiding over a case\nThen you know ... you know very little about courtrooms kids just and we understand that the last caller Shannon we understand your your allegations are falling apart around you and so you're reaching for something we understand that yeah you don't want cabinet\nBut it likely has nothing to do with his demeanor on Thursday night eight six six Ninety red eye\nTips

polygraph examination of Dr Ford all written audio visual or um\nAny information given to a reporter or anybody else at a media organization\nA\nAnd has said that some of the material has been passed down to a national circulated newspaper or not provided to the Senate and he proposes a a bit proposes to suggest to last a lack of candor\nAdjacent to those requests there's a curious paragraph this National Review the full details of Dr ... polygraph are particularly important because the Senate Judiciary committee has received a sworn statement from a long time ... doctor forge a sworn statement he's been under oh now\n... stadium that he personally witness Dr Ford coaching a friend on polygraph examinations when asked under oath in the hearing whether she'd ever given any tips for advice to someone who was planning on taking a polygraph Dr Ford replied never the statement a racist specific concerns about the reliability\nOf her polygraph examination results he continued the Senate therefore needs this information\nIt'll be interesting well they give them a two\nOr a is Grassley using this as\nAnd that when they don't\nThen they can expect to send it to delay it any further right right and or make any other choice in terms of the vote because I think this is clearly by the chairman yeah I think this is well it works in on both levels they handed over\nA new review it or they don't handed over fanned you\nEssentially look at the you you send it on to the Senate majority leader and say well we've done our due diligence because if you're looking for and looking at evidence and and you can't get any other witnesses to back up what she's saying then what you want to see is All right what was the process especially with the\nUh any video or audio that was recorded during the polygraph ... you know they they ask for that before the hearing they ask for that ah\nThe weekend before the ... the hearing a couple of weekends ago and her\nAttorney basically said no it's not relevant of course that's relevant because you say that she took and passed a polygraph test well we need to see the methodology and the polygraph test\nTo see that you know what questions were asked um and and again how the how the process on that level of work I think that's fair\nYou know the thing is when you make an allegation you have to be willing to provide all the evidence that you have used to cooperate kept your allegation to begin which which is a lie detector test threat if you don't end and nobody is above it I'm sure somebody's brought that up but\nThat has to be brought up because just like the fact that when you use and say these the witnesses these people witnessed it and they say no and then you say I took a polygraph of a test will have you ever helped anybody else to take a polygraph test you know and and you know trying to beat is what they're trying to say no I never did well when you get a sworn witness dating you\nKnow I Know she I I you know I Know she did well then you want\nAll relevant notes because she is using the she is using the polygraph as cooperation that there is credibility tour accusation therefore she she'll be willing to give everything over\nTo the Senate Judiciary committee so they can verify\nThat the lie detector test was done in a legit way\nRight and and and that's again\nPart of the process because if you believe it was legit you're promoting it as legitimate then you have no problem you're telling the truth right and the process that part of the process\nWas done thoroughly

Radio Welcome to the show\nDoing good\nYeah I just wanted to make a point with uh with this was a four lady\nYou know I think late in the FBI doesn't really want to talk to her because she said anything more I mean everything she said right now has been leg\nIf she says anymore and expose herself the perjury or perjuring herself becoming one that's not going to be a good look for the FBI I mean they don't want to be picking on someone that obviously has mental problems\nBut I think there are attorneys trying to push her to actually try and stop war isn't it her best interest at that kind of obviously shows were there and yet it is ... ...\nWell I I I actually there and and I'll add to that I'm questioning whether or not they're being genuine in that in that situation whether they already knew that the FBI would not be talking to her and it and now they're going to be able to label this as an unfair\nUh interview process because the person may not even the person making the claim was interviewed and that's how the ...\nAnd when the FBI and you know again when you call it an investigation you would have a ... interview they need to investigate you know everything that's going on here was not an investigation into background jak they have her statement\nThey had his statement all under oath and so what do they do they go and talk to all the witnesses or that they that they have but that they had mentioned wild bean under\nOh that's what you would do in the background check and you know and and\nI don't know and now they're going to cost a Geisha yeah by the minute it becomes an investigation she opens us up to having committed a crime along with a few other people but I think she's lucky this just this is just an inquiry into his background\nWell look I you know ... they don't want to give you know the ... the ... one piece of cooperating evidence that we have an exam and is the polygraph test and they're not at all and and and the therapist notes and they're not willing to give any of that to the Judiciary Committee\nRight why not why not\nBecause they're going to tell a completely different story than what she said and there and that that would have well I I think that's they they know that it's going to likely destroy\nA further destroy erode away at her credibility\nAnd by the way as I said earlier if she has if she has something to say to the Judiciary Committee under road she can put it in a letter and and state any corrections look I Want to correct Warren Jeffs ...

Ninety\nOr read I was buying we were just talking to yeah by the way he's Eric I'm Gary ... a just a a couple of things quickly here that that I respectfully disagree with him a on when he the one of the first thing she said was that uh\nThe these these Democrats are saying all this so they know they're not only democratic as they're not in a crowd of wind and rhinos or Ronald ... while he's ... he's a conservative or liberal yeah he's a conservative okay well then you're talking about something different button but these are mainstream Democrats\nOr the day these are the Democrats up today and they may not be Bob my grandfather who was say who will say hey I'm by\nMy grandfather and my dad's side today who was a Democrat he helped form the Democrat Party in the town that I grew up in New York because it was a Republican town or early early part of the twentieth century\nAnd when he came very he immigrated from Canada and he ... to because of the but the prejudice against a Irish Catholics in Ontario is family came in and so when he came out was the one party Johnny ... among other party\nMy grandfather today would be considered an absolute right wing conservative ... of uh so uh you know to just sit there and but but when you look at the Democratic party today\nWhich are seen as the mainstream meantime find signs of mainstream of the Democrats mhm this is the Senate Judiciary committee that you're talking about right this is mainstream Democrat as you can get\nAnd so I Would disagree with you when you say the the the uh the what's going on at today's Democrats today's Democrat right uh uh rhinos aren't ...\nUrban but rhinos ah our Republican\nThey're the they're the ... if you look at it as how many are right now on Capitol Hill the Republicans have you do the headcount and and and do the put the real test in terms of being a real conservative well that many of them are in fact most of them failed that test\nWhat we forget were rhinos came from because everything from by the way the swamp as involved as about\nEverything about from what the original meaning was rhinos used to be those Republicans who would spend like Democrats ... well ... almost all the Republicans today including the president ... one day when they're not talking about the tax write nobody's talking about the debt anymore\nOne of the reasons Trump got elected\nWas because when Paul Ryan\nWas what have you know after John vein or accidents days left and Paul Ryan came aboard\nAnd Republicans were furious they were screaming but Trump Trump was talking about it about how you know they could they came in and he said no the budget that rubber Ryan came in the bunch it's been done has done and we're going to move on and people were furious and Paul Ryan became the rhino\nThey they they've got to care about spending that help motivate from\nMhm\nYou know to where he became you know a problem that we need to get this budget down we need to you know do these things now the Republican Party they don't care about spending you\nKnow so now rhino rhinos may not be conservative but rhinos are the mainstream of the Republican Party right today they are and even the administration mhm\nIt would not have been acceptable it would not have been acceptable\nFrom any previous Republican administration before this one as we talked about yesterday we talked about the trade deal to do the trade deal with Canada and Mexico and had the stipulation on the automobile companies like we had that would've been absolutely unacceptable and and the debt and then what\nThe projected deficit yes Hi is somewhere around a trillion or or more you know when you when you look at that are over the is it over the next year I think they have next fiscal year bomb that wouldn't have been acceptable in fact I remember\nWhen Obama came in to to power came into the presidency\nHe was talking about well I inherited that huge deficit remember that mhm which by the way we had to point out while you were actually a part of it 'cause you voted for that seven hundred billion dollar package so you were part of that you didn't inherited you helped to make it happen it wouldn't have happened\nAh without the Democrats voting for it as well including him but the point being is that back in two thousand this would have been you know early two thousand nine to two thousand nine\nThey were talking about it even the Democrats were talking about it as a you know the now they were talking about it because they want him to put that on on George W. Bush and they wanted to you know they wanted him to own it completely because everything was Bush's fault remember but Robert\nReich rhinos Renault started before that but then you either rhinos became the swamp yes but rhinos on the swamp was when ... were really came to the fruition especially when McConnell and pain or\nThey were saying we're tough enough of the bunch is when you look at you know twenty twelve twenty Thirteen twenty fourteen the Republicans were furious and conservatives still had a solid hold of the Republican Party that's gone when that was it that\nWhat you really need is a new start on your bank Texas\nIn your face would garnishment celebrities or ... years of ... tax returns will fight to get you a new start even deserve\nCall one eight hundred three one two Ninety nine Seventy power a new start program could stop collection efforts remove any leans the IRS as employees and he'll be reduce your back taxes by as much as eighty percent that's right eighty percent\nDon't wait until another tax season is at another year penalties in interest or editor your balance a view at least ten thousand dollars to the IRS\nAnd need a new start on your back taxes coal one eight hundred three one two Ninety nine Seventy that's why you know two or three one two Ninety nine Seventy ... they'll professionals that coast one financial group fight to get you a new start you deserve again that's one eight hundred three one two Ninety nine Seventy\nYou wouldn't put a square peg in a round hole so why would you to play a traditional fire well in a modern decentralized network fire walls up new requirements for businesses leveraging fast paced applications and public clap platforms like a double us\nAsher and Google Cloud we're in the cloud generation now see your fire walls have to be engineered to fit right in\nSpring claim your club network trying barracuda called generation network or application firewall free at ... dot com slash fire walls\nAttention all authors page publishing is looking for authors have you written a book and want to get it published based publishing we'll get your book into bookstores and for sale on line at Amazon apple I do in other outlets they handle all aspects of the publishing process for you ...\nPrinting ... publicity copyright an editing ... eight hundred fines or one thirty six eighty nine now for your free author submission get that seat under advisor or one thirty six eighty nine for your free author submission get again eight hundred buys zero one thirty six eighty nine\n\n[noise] he was listening to radio mobiles you home for use in six sixty how you would execute out [noise]\n\nRadio he is currently and I'm hearing ... eight six six Ninety a red eye the presidential alert system ah we'll talk about that coming up on the top of the hour because uh you and I were just getting into some of the discussion on there's a lot lawsuit been filed on that\nAnd they're supposed to test it I think this afternoon two hundred and twenty five million smartphones will get the uh we'll we'll get the text\nOr an ... and the funny thing is people have been thinking because the way it's been promoted we're getting a text from the president well that's terrible he can control our phones known all part of the emergency alert system that's all it is right but I noticed that the way they've been covering it is you know because it's called the presidential alert system\nUm you know that it's going to be Trump ... that's going to be texting you know no he's not going to be nothing you today though\nIt's not going to be from the president so we'll get to that story coming up here in just a little bit eight six six Ninety or red eyes were talking about Cabot off the FBI investigation and a whole bunch of other stuff we go to Dustin in Decatur, Alabama Dustin Hi you're on ...

your calls in common so it's we've been dominated for the last couple of weeks on the cabin on the thing and and we continue to talk about it we'll have more to say and more of your calls and comments are coming up the story ah\nAmazon now to pay Fifteen dollars an hour minimum wage and and now after they announced that they are now going to promote\nThat the government raise the minimum wage presented fifty an hour it's like oh you're doing it now that you've raised at yeah right ah not unexpected tight labor market that we have today while and there was a lot of flak\nOn a ... as the especially early on as they were setting up the distribution centers for Amazon or receiving a lot of negative press on the the uh the workers being overworked underpaid and that kind of thing\nYou set the new standard which goes above I think even the Cosco a starting or or maybe it's the same as Cosco I Can't remember we're Cosco when a Walmart what's the ten dollars an hour a few years ago on starting wage\nAnd the starting wage now you know will be Fifteen dollars an hour by the way private sector companies can do that if they wish but it is about\nAnd here's what happened at Walmart um they you know they were clearly they were changing not just the pay that that there's a a public relations point to be made there no no problem\nBut it's also to attract a people who might stay with an end and retain people for a much longer period um they did the same thing with our college which uh they're they're offering college if you work\nPart time or fulltime at Walmart for roughly a dollar a day they basically take it out of your check and you go to an online courses to universities\nAnd but you have to do a business a business degree or a degree\nAnd a in a logistics but but either way a logistics management I think it is but what they're trying to do is get people train people to be at a company for a long time that's what every private sector company\nWants to do and they're going to pay 'em you know and I think the the market has changed\nFor an Amazon because Amazon now you know essentially being the biggest and they're taking on Wal Mart and Wal Mart's taking

how the most sales said that that that that's what they want done in so automation whatever they possibly can do any of the labor work they're trying to find\nSomebody else did you know as you know somebody else or or not somebody else whether they subcontracted another rather for for cheaper they want another method than they have their own employees are doing it but\nI look on his develop that they were Amazon has developed at and their warehouses for shipping so there's a lot of automation going on in those warehouses where you know well why would I pay someone to you know do this part of

disagreed with the fact that she kept the letter yeah but she should have given it to the so days she's not winning that\nOne at all no not at all and you know because for Democrats are liberals they would see that as look you could have done something early on about this\nAnd it would have been a bigger story but potentially if you would have done something about it then and then him for uh the
