I think that's the name of the Portland airport or even in the city of Portland\nWas organized by patriot leader Joey gifts in response to Portland mayor ... wheelers oversight of the city's police department you may remember he doesn't want the police department to do anything most of the time that's what's great part of the problem [noise]\nSo in my opinion is preventing them from doing their job I bet you if you interview the police they would say the same thing hey just let us do our job we they cannot I Can't imagine that they like to see violence take place on either side\nBut this is just one indication of how the nonviolent civil war is turning violent\nAnd you're currently I Know you know this you certainly can't speak on college campuses without interruptions or the threat of violence if you're a conservative on college campuses that's not a problem for the left or liberal thinking to speak\nWhere the you know if you remember the free exchange of ideas was supposed to be the role of the day if you go to college campuses you'll often see that somewhere that they talk about truth and an exchange of ideas that's not taking place anymore and of course now you can't even go to a restaurant or have privacy in your home\nIf you're on the conservative side of an issue and the opposite side recognize you or knows where you live they were giving out one guy I ride he was arrested last week\nFor giving a phone numbers of various senators and addresses and he does on the government computer and just this past week the state Republican Party headquarters in New York was vandalized\nThey smash windows and spray painted the doors with anarchy symbols an outlet bonded the building read that the attack was putting the Republican Party on notice mentioned this\nThey continue there's a code heart attack is merely a beginning we're not pass if we are not civil and we will not apologize uh-huh unquote [noise]\nBy the way maybe they were following up on Hillary's remarks did you hear what she said this week where she said Democrats can't be civil with Republicans during Donald Trump's presidents\nI Wonder what would have happened if she had one and Republicans said the same thing we certainly can't be civil until Hillary Clinton's term is over\n... of course get it if you were a make America hacker anywhere you're you're in danger in jeopardy I mean it's amazing what's going on out there you may be putting your life in danger and even putting a sign in your yard or on your car risks great property damage\nBut it may even be getting worse than that\nWith the shootings of congressman so what was it about a year ago who serious injuries to see the skull lease cars Minsk Elise who could have been murdered and of course on an operation day from the very beginning I forget which actress or sing or whatever was I don't fault those people there was a threat to blow up the White House or worse you know I remember that\nAnd Senator Rand Paul said recently he voiced fears about possible deadly force being used and who can say for sure that he's wrong and you said it's it's going to happen if this continues at something like that is going to happen\nThe left and the Democrats and the media which kind of resolve St like these days the money's not supposed to be like that but I'm sure seems to me that they're on the left they can't accept the fact that President Trump won the resistance as you know that's what they call it started before he was even president\nAnd there may have been we're finding out now a soft coup against him to remove him from office more and more information is coming out about that\nBut you by the way we were not supposed to find out the information Hillary is supposed to win and Obama said she was gonna win and there was no reason that she wouldn't when we went and found out about any of the stuff\nThat that makes me think like a banana republic but there were those in this country they were ready to overthrow the will of the people in whatever fashion they could\nSend my opinion that was the beginning of the civil war may have started before that but that than what's been going on with the President Trump\nTo overthrow sitting president to go against the will of the people just because you don't like the results let's let first is right and it continues\nThey have President Trump so much that anything goes because they have truth on their side\nThey can't imagine this little shocked and when I say it on other shows that there probably an equal number of people that were devastated by the election of President Obama I Do for many resistance but I got to be honest I I like to count the days are okay this year is over you all you have three more years left of him [noise]\nBut that I didn't never occurs to them\nBecause they're so arrogant to begin with so I Want you tell me if you agree with me how bad things have gotten between the two sides in this country and do you think we're fighting for the soul of our country\nThat there is such a thing as I Believe as American exceptionalism that is under attack along with our basic institutions free speech by my that's under attack what we're used to think of traditional marriage\nFrom individual rights to free market capitalism these are all under attack and if I Am right\nWhat are you doing about the upcoming elections to make sure we don't lose the house\nWhere impeachment hearings they said this now learn some of the others who by the way if you imagine who is going to lead these committees like Jerry Nadler Maxine Waters no she's going to the banking or what you would do\nI Want to know what you're doing about making sure this doesn't happen impeachment hearings will likely began the day the Democrats are sworn it they're going to try to teach President Trump and they've got they've already said they're going to try to impeach cabinets and you're gonna have hearings for ever\nTell me what you think of what you're doing about this at eight six six Ninety red eye and this whole week I'm filling in on red eye radio but just a couple of more points to consider while you're calling and I want to add that the extreme hatred for President Trump is palpable you can feel it\nI Know Hillary was all set to be crowded and they were shocked by President Trump's win\nBut the hatred for him knows no limits\nPart of it I'm sure is what they regard as unsophisticated behavior in a good part of it is his personality which can easily alienate people I knowledge that he's difficult sometimes especially with the things he says he often says things you shouldn't especially on Twitter and he picks fights where they should be not\nHe demeans the White House see I'm being a spy answering some of his outrageous critics\nAnd he's clearly incapable of accepting much of any criticism I get that all of a few of us are but despite his personal short ... it's I think I'd better say the softly so some of those on the left don't have a breakdown\nOf the ... mayor credit that fact breakdown judging from what is going on these days I think President Trump has done a great job as president\nThat's right I didn't even say a good job I said great job now you can disagree with me but then vote him out of office don't try to undo the election results\nThose on my side didn't try to undo a modest when there was no such thing as resistance make sure you guys on the other side you get the vote on on your side if we lose fairly we lose but don't set up the dust Sears and use the power of government to destroy your opponents\nThis what happens in banana republics not the United states of America don't destroy what makes this country so unique and so exceptional\nSo I Want to know do you agree that there's civil war going on in our country are you prepared to fight back to save our country let me know what you think an eight six six Ninety read I\nI'm more fights are filling in on

thirty three thirty nine Robert in San Antonio you're on with mark Hi Robert\nHey good a good evening I Believe you're completely correct\nWhen you say that the left 'cause uh convince themselves they're good and the right as bad I Wonder how you can correct me if I'm wrong but I Wonder if the right uh you know sort of copying their civil war language can be dangerous I Know I'm twenty five and are just getting off the coast campus\nUm the younger Lee is a really um [noise]\nThey're they're in love with this idea of you know not your grand puppies GOP so they're they're\nReally getting going along with the idea of punching back against the less but I Wonder if our energy should be more focused on convincing the left that it's not this um this good versus evil that they probably don't even they kind of a justified in their ...\nYeah I don't think you can convince the hardcore left it there is no talking them and you'll find out there maybe some independence you can reach maybe some of the Democrats I used to do a show in Los Angeles where I had two Democrats two Republicans on every week\nAnd those kinds of people you could convince and by the way there's a you can almost distinguish the left from liberals liberals used to be like Alan Dershowitz where if you disagreed with people you know you followed it through the ideas and and the ballot box but the left or people like the antifa groups or where they won't even let you speak\n... there the new fascists even though the accuser enemies of being fascists so I don't think there's any talk to the left if that's what you meant\nBut I Do think there's great middle that she might be able to reach and even some perhaps conservative Democrats are and that is true of our best to my best to the the hardcore conservatives right wing conservative you're probably not going to change their minds\nWhat you try to do and the reason fashion people who are open to it have you met people at school that you can talk to as opposed to some you can't\n[noise] uh no no no not at all\nSo you can't talk to them at all\nYeah no and again you're saying yeah they've they've completely censored who they want to\nUm yes I I I get what you're saying yeah your your friends on your side [noise] [noise] yeah\nYou know like a young Republicans group\nRight and it's you know their neighbors hundred and one\nYeah how about your professors and teachers on camps and you don't have to say where you go\nYeah no that that's a pretty it's pretty left leaning to you can't really get a word in and then when you do it just kind of a shame fest\nYeah pretty discouraging uh what's going on on the campuses especially you can never hear conservative speaker they won't let them talk my right\nSo you know you're absolutely correct\nYeah so I think you have to join the organization you do so you don't feel alone and trying to work on people you can how about your family how do they feel that way the think did they think you're crazy\n[laughter] no neither do you ah thankfully I grew up in the Christian also so probably a pretty level headed\nYeah well I I Would suggest to that you you know keep up a fight with people who are willing to listen and try to work on those people who might be persuaded by the facts many people don't know right they live their lives they work hard at their jobs and the you know they tune in occasionally maybe that's why the Kavanaugh hearings will be effective\nBecause I think to me the great majority of people were not happy about the way he was treated and and what went on there the idea that allegations are enough\nTo convict you at least in people's minds or some people is is that raises is against the whole system where you're innocent until proven guilty he was guilty just because he was accused of it and so maybe that influence some people I think people are going to be surprised by the elections but Robert I I think for your call and hang in there okay\nThank you

congressmen and playing baseball\nThat's all we've come to I I really worry about this country\nIs really crucial and if you don't vote come uh what is it for about four weeks from now I don't even know what it is in early November and the Democrats take back the house and that's the prediction of a lot of so called polls now and of course the polls wrong before so we're hoping for a bigger turnout on our side\nThey use you won't believe what's going to take place they'll have hearings half the hearings they'll subpoena people it won't be safe to work for the Trump Administration anymore they'll catch on something and they'll get you on everything\nSo this can't be this can't be what you want to happen in America even good liberals on the other side I Wish you'd call me\nAn eight six six Ninety red eye that's eight six six nine o seven thirty three thirty\nNine you can't walk this because just like the reason we now only need fifty votes to elect a Supreme Court justice or fifty one on the vice president votes in case of the pie is because Harry Reid started that\nYou know the Democrats the left and liberals can't want this 'cause it's kind of come back to haunt them the next time they went and in American history it goes back and forth between Democrats and Republicans and ... all one side and the other side you you can't want that's\nThe problem is you're you're not seeing you open up a new can of worms where you are guilty just because of an accusation you open up a new can of worms if you will do anything to get rid of the press in the United states because you disagree their views and I'm Trump's case even worse\nYou don't like who he is a your personally soul pose Tam you and you can't believe this ... bunk and this fool this guy is not an elite is like the rest of you that he ever could have one and by the way\nHe's going to win again I really believe that the election was held today in two years a long time he'd win re election\nSo as an ... we're we're in for a battle and we've got to make sure that the house is not taken over by the Democrats I'm pretty sure we're going to keep the Senate and we're probably when a few more seats in the Senate but in the house of representatives they a lot of people I I did a show\nA week or so ago and I had some experts on the third our including off there they said to me it looks bad Laos represent us it was a guy that I Know well in orange county part of California Dana roar back I think he's been at twenty or Thirty years he's in trouble they're spending millions and millions of dollars to defeat him\nDo it and then they are so passionate about this the other side they are so angry about this election this past election that President Trump is in office to get what he's done\nAnd remember the courts were so significant because if they couldn't win elections the other side would make sure judges rules right like the Muslim ban that President Trump because of what he said some federal judges and decided it was a Muslim ban doesn't matter if the president have the right to do that\nSo that they love the idea that the judges could make laws that's partially what this battle was about also [noise] so ... says that's not what the first hour was and I want you to react to it I think we're going to another civil\nWar going on I'm just hoping that it doesn't get violent\nThat we can get through this thing and I'd already there is sort of on the magic you can't go to a restaurant that would have been unheard of ten twenty Thirty years ago going to a restaurant with your family and having people champ around you to make sure you can eat there or having waiters and waitresses not serving police or not serving people on the other side\nWhat what are we coming to does the other side I really want that\n[noise] so ... I I Want to know what you're thinking that you know it's\nPretty sad what's gonna happen if you don't do something the next few weeks I mean get everybody can devote where we're going to lose this this is going to be a real battle worse than what you saw a with just the cow and all of the week or so ago\nEight six six Ninety red eye eight six six or seven three three three nine\nMarcus they're

a garlic Margot Adler\nBack with you again and it's a pleasure to be with\nYou this week they'll be back on Sunday night when you and let's go to the on in Kirkuk Iowa you're on with mark\nHow are you uh how do I just had a quick a little observation uh myself I'm I'm pretty politically neutral um but you know I myself have been in as young as I Am I watch a lot of uh you know media and and uh getting on the social media and just the way that they're portraying\nThe current president Mr Trump is just a little ... it seems a little unfair and the way that they're doing it it seems like they're just a ... point to actually get into the political side they want to just pinpoint\nYou know a lot of like more scandalous things like that stuff but he says and stuff\nAnd the way that the cultural edge just purely for content it seems like it seems like\nA lot of these uh these two that are um are showing this stuff or they just want to do it for the money and I think that's just kind of a a dangerous thing to do because if you're um you know pushing the fact that we need to get all these young people out there and and vote and then you want to only\nReally show one side of the story it it just seems like it's almost an agenda and that and I just think that's kind of a dangerous thing like especially you know like I said if you're going to have all these people\nExcited about voting and not really know exactly what they're voting for 'em I just seems that that that could be dangerous situation\nYou're pretty perceptive how old are you a credit card\nYou pretty young and uh it seems to me that you you reflect what I think a lot of people are feeling after the hearings especially which is the way they treated the the judge pretty badly they're treating President Trump pretty badly now some of it um honesty I support him big time but he does bring it on himself with some of the tweets and so on\nBut the personal vendetta the hatred they have for him is way out of bounds or I I did not like President Obama\nI didn't like that I'm not sure I agree with him more than one thing on his policies\nI certainly wants to know harm to come to him and I certainly didn't wasn't part of any resistance I I just knew you had to get rid of him the next term and I lost that one you didn't see people out in the streets he didn't he see people for threatening that and the press I guess they didn't want it to the ... I'm like that\nBut but in general the anger towards this president I Know that you may not remember this you're pretty young towards George W. Bush it was pretty angry but this this is even surpassed that\nWe actually have to in this country trying to get rid of him even though he won the electoral college\nAny ... fairly elected president United States we have people in the FBI and the Justice Department working in collusion hours where the Clinton was to try to get rid of him to undo an election that it's not supposed to happen in the United states of America I don't know I mean the first hour\nThat's a banana republic where that happens\nA year pretty good and uh how about your friends do they agree with you or you're by yourself\nI yeah I Know a lot of the the people that you know I surround myself they they do seem pretty much the same way again like I said I'm pretty\nPolitically neutral myself in a lot of my friends are but they do understand what\nThe media is trying to get people to see and the way that they're presenting it and it it's definitely outright like I said I I don't really put myself in the middle of all that but I I definitely don't want to see people that are expecting one thing and then they go vote and they don't know what they voted for it because you know growing up everybody's always like okay you're voted good account but\nIt doesn't really count if you're not voting for something you don't really understand\nSo that's really all I Want it to me or now just to make sure everybody's you know whether it be\nBefore you go in and sounds like you to go but I I'll say that everybody else out there the fact is I'm not one of those people that wants to make it easier for people to vote\nI think if you don't know enough about what's going on and you don't care enough to go out of your way to vote I have a feeling you're not one of my voters that you're going to do it based on emotions and feelings which is what the other side is anyway to begin with as opposed to as our caller just said\nA knowing the facts and and knowing the issues and that's what can you don't have to agree with me but at least go in there and don't do it based on emotion you you have President Trump so much or he he's a man and you know we don't want to listen and so you're the woman that I remember that was years ago maybe it is again\nThe vote for him because they don't share your philosophy or the principles of course there's another issue\nWhich is as a teacher part time teacher I can tell you this most students don't know our point of view but I often use the minimum wage laws they'll say oh of course I Want my re or want to get a raise or what do they call it also not just minimum wage livable wage I Love that one like it's a job of a business this may sound heartless\nA job of a business to give you a livable wage no it's not it's a job I teach economics java business

six Ninety red eye eight six six or seven three thirty three thirty nine\nAnd these people discuss me I Can't watch or listen to them Kavanaugh was not even my first choice to get the nomination but it wouldn't have mattered\nThey could have picked for example the pope and he's a leftist but they would have been against him if President Trump had appointed him\nWhy in heck did they even need hearings or further FBI investigations when they announced tell they were going to be voted on very few exceptions\nAnswer to soccer and people like Jeff Flake talking about it I'm sure people says I'm not the only one to talk about being named directly by the way\nHe said he would vote for cabinet are Kevin he was all set to but it did you see this as a woman confronted him in the elevator\nAny your method that was part of the reason he was for an additional FBI investigation Jeff Flake is a fool ... did not unite the country as he suggested or placate the Democrats it further divided us\nThis was all a show to delay the process so they can get in power Lindsey Graham had it just right\nThis is all about power\nAnd I could take it more easily if they just said what they felt hey we just wanted to let you guys because we want to get in power and then you can't have the Supreme Court judge on I Wish they would be honest about that\nBut there are a bunch of phony Hippocratic\nHypocritical leftists they disgusts me tell me what you think at eight six six Ninety red eye but it's worse than that\nBecause we have now taken away one of our most basic rights the presumption of innocence you can charge anyone I said this before with any crime you want and you don't even need to have ... evidence it doesn't matter if they're innocent you can still ruin their lives and there are no consequences for the ...\nBecause you have to prove they did it with malice if they didn't intentionally do it then they get away with this do you remember I don't know if you remember this Reagan's secretary of labor I think it was secretary Donovan lets the name that comes to me\nHe was asked after it was found innocent after he was accused of I don't even remember what it was they said something like what are you going to do next and he said something like\nWhere do I go to get my reputation back\nAnd some like Feinstein Senator Feinstein has the nerve to question Kevin O's belligerence and demeanor at the hearings why was he supposed to do some in Feinstein after you've helped destroy his life act ever so serene as you ruined his life I wouldn't have I Would have let them it\nWears his bank account for all the good work he's done for all these years later\nHow did Bill Clinton stay as president after what he did with the complicity of use Senator Feinstein and others in the Senate\nThose hearings were not a good week for America and I wanted to know what you think because it relates to my whole point about civil war I Want to know what you think eight six six nine to read I\nNow for Christine for I'm getting a chance you guys hear me I was on another show a few weeks ago so I'm getting this off my chest the second time I'm very fortunate I Do I think she was attacked yes she appears credible in that regard\nThe judge Kavanaugh commit that attack I doubt very much\nEspecially since no one could corroborate her story I when I say I think she was attacked I don't know exactly what happened\nAnd whether some of this could have been in her imagination because there are a lot of inconsistencies in her story she doesn't know how she got there how she got home when it was exactly why she didn't tell others at the party or anyone else for decades after that\nSo now as I said we've reached the stage where all you need are allegations\nSo what's to prevent hundreds of people from now on making accusations and stalling every nomination they don't\nWant and ruining everybody's reputation in the process now there's going to be no way to get off this merry go round just accuse of cues and accused [noise] it's a new Democrats strategy that has not worked thanks for Senator Flake and Murkowski flick at least voted for it\n[noise] but Murkowski didn't I think she does I think there's some movement to recall her and she needs to be recalled\nThe rest of the bills fools who allow this process to take place look by the way that sleazy lawyer what his client claimed about Kevin a famed can be yours with a flick of your cell phone do the Democrats as I said last hour understand where all of this is going\nTo remember Harry Reid starting the nuclear option with the judges and now we can just do a fifty fifty one\nAnd yet the reaction did you hear the reaction of the righteous Senator Feinstein as a quote it showed him to be aggressive and bowling here's what Joe Biden said\nHe witnessed a degree of invective blind rage and Bruce partisanship that threatens not only the Senate and the Supreme Court it threatens the basic faith and fairness and justice that binds the country together\nIs he getting that's a Democrat play book and Mitt Romney or another genius I mean I was a delegate for them by the way I've got to make and full disclosure he announced the support the decision to wait a week another example of why he lost he doesn't know how to fight these people and that's a point do you have to know how to fight them\nI was going to ask you your least favorite person that you watch during that week and perhaps senator Mazie her on her own or however you say your name my top your list especially after comments that men should just shut up\nShe and she by the way a week or so ago she was asked if she was confident Democrats didn't strategically league Christine forms accusations against capita just days before a committee vote\nI think it was here's a quote are confident the Democrats didn't leak that letter and how to respond to senator Graham's charge that it was inappropriate for the Democrats to refer to a doctor for a referred to a lawyer hosts George Stephanopoulos asked her own on ABC's This week\nAnd you what a chance of she spelled spotted all these things called do not focus on what we should be focusing which has the credibility of judge Kavanaugh she responded before calling Kevin O's claims of political conspiracy against them bizarre\nShouldn't answers like a rat to me and her and she goes on and by the way even as all of these accusations about this being politically motivated being tossed around everyone acknowledges including judge Kavanaugh that Dr Ford is not being politically motivated\nBy the way she her own has suggested Kevin did not deserve did you catch this he did not deserve due process because of his outcomes driven conservative legal philosophy that is very clear again if you're on the right\nYou don't want to serve the process of being a the a proven guilty just the accusation is not\nSo she may not have been politically motivated for what you used her you and your masters and deception used her\nThis is all just crazy and I I Love what Graham said he's going to get to the bottom of its suggesting that someone then find science officer one affords attorneys may have been responsible for strategically delaying the leak deploying the link to harm Kevin O's chances\nAre it's just amazing as he said those actually Senator Hatch so this the goalposts moving never stops\nAnd here's my summation and then we'll take your calls and the only force is the way you and your cronies conducted the circus and maybe the ... to ... us the ACLU the American civil liberties union yeah right they chimed in because they too are left this group before they are civil lists\nThe group and so they came out against his nomination and I quote\nThe failures board of directors deeply concerned by the allegations raised in recent weeks has made a rare exception to its longstanding policy and voted to oppose the nomination of Brett Kavanaugh they passed a resolution stating they oppose the confirmation of judge Kevin as the Supreme Court there aren't credible allegations\nThis'll the ACLU allegations that judge Kevin I was engaged in serious misconduct you mean like Bill Clinton did you say anything then that have not been adequately investigated by the Senate what would be advocates adequate seven FBI check eight nine what does it Dr Ford's credible testimony subsequent allegations of sexual misconduct\nFor instance\nIf you have a hard one or the lime scale not only leads white spots plugs pipes and breakdown

think Ford was credible or not credible he wasn't treated well\nAnd then and then when it's all done I mean they have them he couldn't win for losing as they say when it's all done they said oh he was belligerent uh\nYeah I was supposed to just sit back and take the whole stuffer destroying his reputation for ruining his family life and that's what the his girls think of him now I mean maybe they haven't changed but imagine what they have to go through forget the security and other threats against him\nOr even a Ford has some she's going to go out of the limelight although I like the way they

sure she lost so much but if if Jerry is right and he represents the frustration that uh I think a lot of people feel out there\nThere may not be this blue wave it may be much closer than people think\nAnd because the thought of the ad and said this tonight the thought of the Democrats retaking the house and the hearings and the subpoenas and if the if you think the Kavanaugh hearings were disgusting and revolting wait till these people do it for two years to do everything possible to impeach Kevin out to a beach Trump\nThere are a lot of started there you know how ... works the house does at first and then he's tried and the Senate doesn't matter that they can't when they didn't care that they couldn't win against Kavanaugh\nThis'll be show and then so they and their basis so angry yeah I have never seen anything like this I remember I Want to be fair they hated George W. Bush and you know they thought Al Gore had won in Florida which\nWhen they did the results say I think they newspaper's editorial boards or whoever did it and only one even came out for Gore and even that was assuming\nThe absolute the best scenario for him\nThese people just take a if it's possible aid Donald Trump that much more\nAnd that's why you have the resistance that's why you had a soft coup in the U.S Justice Department and with the FBI\nAt the top echelons where these guys were the lady and that page and so on they were text each other where they set up a Carter Page\nOr two for the ... you know that he was a if you're watching that he was a spy with the Russians and he was in on the Trump campaign trying to you know uh make sure that the Hillary last I mean it's all incredible what these people are up to they literally were acting like a banana republic\nAnd try to take the election away from President Trump these people are angry but if you get out there and you vote there's a there's gives me a lot of hope and it should give you two Charlie natural ... with a more\nA good show up use comparing it to the civil war and that was just saying if you if you don't learn from history are doomed to repeat it and I think\nAt least waves where I went to school they don't teach to the real division of the country in the civil war or one side on a slave I was a bit and Lincoln's he wrote you know you get into the real civil war there's a lot of the ... a lot of\nDifferent issues that were divided the nation and we're at that point now\nAnd mhm\nJust saying that but there is a way the Republicans can win and if you look at the map if the Republicans can get eight nine percent of the black vote\nThe country will be\nTotally agree it for for the rest of this country's existence I mean if you look at Florida if you look at those key states were there for the black vote really swings to the Democratic side\nThat's all we have to do is get that and the Democrats play they they go after the black vote\nBy offering you know public housing all kinda entitlements and anybody can see that it would be better to make eight hundred a week then to get eight hundred a month\nAssistance and that's that's what we that's what Republicans need to preach in poor neighborhoods and that's my comment and I'll listen to result of their self fault\nRight and you said a very Well Charlie I appreciate it two things come to mind one that's why the Democrats so I was with illegal immigration 'cause they win hugely in that category are in fact that always bothered me when Karl Rove and\nGeorge W. Bush or said that uh you know they'll get forty percent they can get up to forty percent of the Hispanic vote and I thought oh forty percent use to lose every time but you're on to something really significant which is the black vote and President Trump they said Romney got six percent I think Trump got eight percent\nOr if we start to get more of the black vote on the Republican side the Democrats are in huge trouble because they've counted on that Ninety percent Ninety three Ninety Ninety five sometimes I don't know what I bought my God I think it was way up there they count on that\nIf ever they lose an interesting percentage of that even the Jewish population they they started to go the other way they the Republicans and I'll START I think at twenty five thirty percent [noise]\nThey're in trouble ... big trouble as you suggest that if they can't count on those votes\nAnd they shouldn't shouldn't get those votes the Democrats have controlled every city just about every major city every major school district and think about the last thirty forty years how the schools have a function of how well they've been doing I'm saying that in the opposite direction they're not doing well or how well our cities are doing\nAnd you come to Hungary inclusion one of the Democrats done for the people living in the inner city that's a real issue if ever the Democrats
