where where men were real men were comfortable being met and we're proud of being men and it's great to be men and men are great and you know what else are great\nWomen women are great especially when they love men\nAnd they love the man who love women which is why we are you seeing where normal people you people are all mental cases at this point and you really need help maybe Dr Ford has some opening on her\nBecause she's a psychologist and she's got all this stuff figured out she was given a lot of thought but this is more this is more projection from the looney is on the on the left then this insane piece Victoria spotted this morning\nThe rallying cry was Kavanaugh's enraged plea of innocence before now I mean there are how about you guys do a story on whether he's actually at a center not that'd be that'd be worthwhile\nAnd set up this sexist missing dreary this this racist anti white racism which the Democratic party is their history is steeped in racism there the the only racists in the conversation every single\nDemocrat involved on the conversation how's that I have faith in white man [laughter] do you think white men can ask good questions I Believe they can have a
