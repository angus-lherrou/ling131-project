Robert De Niro you know he's an actor and he says beep from ... like the pumped punch Trump in the face and and all this stuff so uh we're supposed to believe that some some right wing hillbilly making bombs which aren't designed to go off\nA head Robert De Niro so much that I Wonder Robert De Niro and it was a restaurant\nIn New York where he also has a I happen to go to a birthday party at the Tribeca Grill ah last January and a private room upstairs and there was a theater there and and all this stuff\nAnd it's very De Niro right but who cares seats that beep Trump if you're going to go down that far down the ladder whereas Kathy Griffin whereas or a Saturday Night live ... whereas Alec Baldwin whereas uh I don't want their they all want bombs to come to them\n'cause now it's a it's a thing it's a I feel left out or MSNBC is obviously feeling very left out this morning that they didn't get one of these apparently ... devices because it'll be a badge of honor for life\nOh I was a victim of a terrorist attack that they'll say they'll say things like that so we were evacuated and by the way they are but in New York the overreaction to the mail room incident at at a Time Warner tower and Columbus Circle in Manhattan\nWas extraordinary they cleared out an area that would be appropriate for\nA small thermonuclear device now get back get back I mean again it's a pipe bomb if it went off in a car\nOr if you were in the car behind that you'd be fine but bank cleared out shutting down Central Park west and Columbus Circle and it looked like on September eleventh and and Andrew Cuomo the didn't win at Google or of New York has there say\nWhen it comes to terrorists to change our way of life or we're going to put National Guard of the tunnels\nBecause this is an invading army apparently coming now ah and and I'm a marveling at the absurdity of it all and\nAnd he wanted one Andrew Cuomo wanted re desperately wanted a device so he claimed yesterday we got one in our place we got one we got one where we're in with the crowd and then an hour later the plays Kevin all clear\nThere was nothing there was nothing or was it wasn't done anything of the kind of a newspaper in San Diego evacuated their offices because they said they had a\nSuspicious now this happens a lot everybody starts panicking because everybody's a little girl\nIn America and two thousand Eighteenth so they evacuated the building because somebody saw package\nYou know and there was nothing and uh so they all went back to work but a lot of hysteria yesterday and there were more incidents says well\nOf these false alarms false alarms public panic and uh and all of that\nAnd and I honestly it's it's it's going to be like oh you didn't get one we got one\nWe're cooler than you because we got one especially when you learn they're all ... now they're at a at MSNBC instead they're saying oh it's like nine eleven [laughter] they were treating it yesterday the reaction was like I I was waiting for Time Warner center to fall to the ground\nOh no it's nine eleven all over again as the buildings are going to collapse because somebody got a thing that would blow up a car I honestly it was a the the overreaction has been a shorter and then once you learn as New York times on the New York post both have\nThrough their sources in New York law enforcement and so on\nThe devices are not actually designed to detonate they don't have the requisite\nParts the ... if you will that would allow the devices that night and when I was looking up at the ... the um yesterday again texting with my friends and\nWith my friends at work here as well so well how are they going to detonate how are they gonna whether they're in a time so the timers so they're going to go off in the mail room how does that\nThey they package already been opened a ... and the pictures that I saw so they weren't designed to go off when you open the package\nSo when we're these exactly when exactly what they're going to go off and and now the New York times and the washing the New York post excuse me the New York times and the New York post both saying based on sources that these look like fake devices\nAnd uh and uh between the two of them there is no blasting cap there's no detonator there's no electronic detonator there's a written wire and a black wire there's outcome at the clock boys digital clock in there because they saw it on TV and they made a um a plastic tube pipe bomb which is fine that would work\nIf you had the right detonator and all of that but it looks like they're ... they're just scares drive\nAnd whoever sent them got the big American flags stamps and stuck him all over the place even though they were going to be delivered by courier why would you do that\nWhy would you do that with a writer you do that with her writing misspell Florida when he printed up the mailing receipt on his computer and not noticed that the computer was saying hey you're misspelling Florida with the reds quickly line ah\nOkay that's possible it's possible that some right wing Unabomber is really really dumb\nAnd a smart enough to build these devices without blasting caps indicators\nButton dumb enough to misspelled Debbie was mentioned it's his name this misspelled shelves misspelled Brennan that's not a real hard one to spell and misspelled Florida you're computer will catch on that\nAnd so these all went through the the giants stamps that and then I honestly the the biggest clue is that every package has the return address uh Debbie was a man Schmitz of Debbie Wasserman Schultz\nWho hasn't been in the public eye for months so that's a big clue why her\nWho's angry with her Bernie Sanders people are angry with her that she was angry with her\n... Republicans aren't angry with the right wing or is it live on cabins on mountainsides aren't sitting there stewing about Debbie ... that ain't happening right\nAnd if you look at who's included on who was excluded Robert Deniro gets one but Alec Baldwin doesn't get what I mean look there could be more in the pipeline of course so to speak or there could be lots more\nBut now we kind of know\nThat um [noise] New York times reporting on the New York\nPost reporting that these things were never going to explode there were never going to go off so now we're dealing with the person who is so stupid that they built these bombs that are incapable of going off or somebody who was never really planning on causing any harm to anyone but wanted to create this\nPanic and this news media thing on an interesting way on the lead up to the mid term elections which the Democrats have said are so important well there's a big debate about civility and who's aside as more violent and obviously it's the left I mean throughout my lifetime the left has been blowing things up\nThe Unabomber was a radical left wing environmentalist academic wannabe\nI Know first hand that when we start going down that road that can be very very deadly so I condemn that I condemn what happened today obviously we need to get the facts\nBut we've we've really seen a collapsing of our political discourse\nMobile police have arrested a second man and connection to a deadly shooting and raven Dr Saturday Eighteen year old miles cables was taken into custody last night he's charged with murder and two counts of attempted murder another man Patrick Thomas is also in jail charged in that same shooting\nCommand accused of killing to iron Dale motel owners has been extradited back to Alabama Stephen ... was arrested last month in Virginia He's now in Jefferson County charged with capital murder Smokey was caught on camera entering the motels office and assaulting the victims bill riles building\nWelcome to the subway ad for the new ... how would you like it can I get that ran with AI share thing\nHere is when I found out that new typically cheesecake such a cheese steak is available for a limited time only and participating restaurant it contains a concept called ... comes from ...\nState to partly southwest down from ... from I ...

enough to know I was working on your hands on it so large building was five sides\nIn two thousand one and I'm very\nShortly after the terrorist attacks by truck but I from hell on September eleventh two thousand one we had a couple of other crazy things going on in the United states and in particular around Washington DC we add John Allen Mohammad\nDone and I'm ...\nI'm with the DC Sniper the beltway sniper thing and that was very creepy and we also had the anthrax attacks on the anthrax attacks they stay in believe they found the guy or did he committed suicide ah but um they never really nailed them\nAnd and uh when they were looking for the anthrax terrorists who had mailed anthrax packets to NBC News ABC News on CBS News but did not mail one to CNN I was working at CNN at the time CNN did not receive\nA packet with anthrax but the other three television networks dead and other news organizations as well and other people and uh I remember it concluding at the time I I Believe correctly in retrospect\nThat if you're looking and I spoke to investigators at the time and I said you know you're looking for somebody that has a an old fashioned TV and kind of on the roof\nAnd I remember the uh whoever it was I was talking to looking at me kind of ... and I said listen hey sent to CBS News ABC News and to NBC News but not to CNN you know why didn't send to CNN because\nYou can't hate what you don't see but\nHayden ABC NBC and CBS surely he hated CNN a buddy he didn't have cable so you're looking for somebody that doesn't have cable TV so you're looking for somebody with a Tv antenna on their roof\nRight pretty simple it's like a you know the duck the reasoning sort of thing and I thought it was kind of helpful and it turns out on his house sure enough there was a TV in the old fashioned Tv antenna which some houses with cable still have any way but nevertheless\nI'm looking at this one and to me and it was again it was my friend Danny in a conversation with him yesterday he said look you know Bernie Sanders um was robbed by Debbie Wasserman Schultz Bernie Sanders has not received\nOne of these bombs one of these bombs that won't blow up so that the bomb that won't blow up or what is that it's like I'll come at the clock boy with is a little bring up the school thing it it wasn't going to blow up so the media it's like it's not a bomb scare even blow up\nBut listen to them now over these bombs that can't blow up [laughter] it honestly that caught boy they couldn't wait to the document the clock boy\nHe's he's a victim of racism and Islamophobia no he brought a thing that was designed to look just like a bomb to school so he can steer the snot out of people with is Bob looking thing that I come at the clock boy brought to school\nAnd his sister had done the same thing or a year earlier and and the same school and he thought it was funny and he got like scholarships there my key and trips to the middle east and the White House and and uh he was the hero of our nation for weeks because he was a victim\nNow he played everybody the whole time he was a little creepy and I'm sure he's drawing up a little now so he's a slightly larger ...\nAnd and the news media just couldn't write to say well that's not a bomb well why is it not about well that said there was no explosive material can't blow up\nWell okay well they have exposed material but they can't look better to have ... blasting caps don't have the electronic detonation don't have remote detonation don't have you know radio frequency ... nation or a cell phone detonation don't have any of the stuff none of it so they can't be blown up so they were never designed to blow up\nSo in reality they're kind of fake bombs it based on what the New York times is saying and what the New York post is saying you combine those two stories and you see that you've got bombs that won't blow up what's a bomb that won't blow up it's a paper weight\nRight and as many as historical but uh you know if I had brought this to school they be defending out front and say well there is no detonator oh sure there's some black powder but it's an honor to can't blow up so\nIt's just like the
