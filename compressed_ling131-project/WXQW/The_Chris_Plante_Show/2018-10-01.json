think he had the leakers are bad but in his op ed he reveals that he's just a frosty sort of Bernie Sanders anti Trump Democrats\nAnd all this BS about him being a Republican\nWas just that maybe it was at some point but as soon as Trump came along he did like a Joe Scarborough in rent for the hills ever hear these people the Washington Times which is your newspaper of record in Washington DC unlike that rag owned by Dr evil the richest men in the world\nWitnesses stick with stories come up bolstered case for Kavanaugh\nAnd Trump's slams Democrats mean and nasty approach\nThat says again

think from the Canadian journalism association didn't she get those are aware because she's a she's Israel put out\nThat the the New York times their slogan is we'll put out for scoops sex for scoops she went to LA what can she would stand on a street corner in front of the Capitol with a sign says we'll put out for scoops and that's how she got a lot of her scoop\nThe LA right out of the time she works hard for them in\nThe old fashioned way man all old fashioned way why all of the world the way al and you are\nTo Missouri were winning journalist so the New York times and a show and then they
