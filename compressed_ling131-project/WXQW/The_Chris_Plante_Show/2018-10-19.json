Jared Kushner who's Jewish shot and I think that walking Castro's clearly an anti\nSemite clear for making this outrageous going against a Jewish person that I Do I like to play by the Democrat rules you know by being tongue in cheek but but they never are you know what I mean and I think I have some evidence that Joaquin Castro father\nUh actually fired the kill shot on John F. Kennedy and the grass or you know daily plaza that day Nineteen sixty three in Dallas texas\nKorea proves that it's not true you're ... where was he showed me as calendars from Nineteen sixty three\nShow me drove the daily mail had a piece on April and the piece in April and the daily mail said claimed that Jared Kushner and by the way it was denied by Jared Kushner that Jared Kushner showed up in Saudi Arabia and shared intelligence with perhaps print so much fun\nAnd the Saudi Government\nNow we share intelligence with the Saudis all the time\nAnd when you share intelligence with

he was a longtime friend\nOf Osama bin Laden and uh and what the daily mail peace says is that I'm Jared Kushner came he shared intelligence U.S intelligence with the Saudis a and actually that would include intelligence about things that men is them\nBecause we're doing them a favor doing them a solid so that they in turn do salads for us do favors for us maintain the ... as they say against the uh the Iranians across their abs and Gulf or the Persian Gulf depending on which side of the Gulf that you're on the biggest threat to\nCivilization may in fact be a nuclear armed armed Iran which bronco bottom up Brock who said Obama\nActually helped facilitate with that bolt neck deal rather than keeping them from getting an arsenal of nuclear weapons it ensures that they'll get an arsenal of

knows comes on them and the ... to the Jews nose cones you go ahead and keep working on that we wouldn't want to restrict you in that\nRegard and anyway so you just continue with your your program so it's apparently a a Joaquin Castro has some little weasel sharp tooth whiz or working poor has left us cause that found the daily mail piece that suggested a kind of vaguely I might add in terms of the reporting\nThat Jared Kushner shared intelligence with the Saudis now\nWhy Jared Kushner we share intelligence with the Saudis all the time\nWe have military people person permanently stationed in Saudi Arabia Saudi Arabia has military people permanently stationed here they have an embassy had an ambassador who is a very high ranking ambassador in the Washington press corps by the way the Washington or excuse me diplomatic corps\nAre very high ranking very serious person and one of the great mansions in the region as you might imagine for the Saudi ambassador living it's really something on the Potomac River big gates guard towers you know it's a it's a crazy but in any event\nWe share intelligence with them now walking Castro addressed as we do with Israel just as we do with Jordan on occasion and with other allies around the world that's what we do [noise]\nAnd ah so there's this tabloid the story from April that says that Jared Kushner is there and shared intelligence and then because they want to sound like they're in the no the article says intelligence about their enemies\nAs opposed to dinner why would you share intelligence about dinner or deals
