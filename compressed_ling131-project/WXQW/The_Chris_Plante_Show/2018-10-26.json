eight eight eight six there just by the way where it eight eight eight six three zero nine six two five eight ... six three oh nine six two five\nAnd a and if you if you don't say\nThat that's Trump's fault and his rhetoric has clearly responsible\nAnd we don't have to know who does we obviously know this is a Trump supporter during this because he misspelled Florida and all Trump supporters misspell Florida and other and they don't notice when their computer tells them to check the spelling of Florida\nThat I've noticed that that's not somebody who is deliberately misspelling to make it look like a stupid person and the oversized American flag or ... and then uh stamps\nAnd then the er and CNN report in something\nThat contradicted itself this morning\nThey are all the packages went through U.S Postal service facilities to wear delivered bike courier and some don't have postage marks\nPostal marks whatever you call them um and how that makes sense and they wrote that out ahead of time and I sat down and say they all went through a postal facilities about some don't have post marks and some are delivered by courier now makes sense so that\nThat's that CNN their brains don't work as designed they're pretty pathetic a chunk junk cause on the television and he's got yesterday we were kind of joking about it\nThat it's either a righty who lives in a cabin and he's like a right wing Unabomber right with a long beard and and he's making these things but he's too dumb to spell Florida and to them to spell shorts and to them just doesn't smell Brennan\nAnd then he puts stamps on but they're delivered by career and that was enough to confuse CNN and um and he sent these things 'cause he watches Hannity and that's how a new to send one to Robert De Niro\nAnd that explains everything say that and that's not a conspiracy theory that's just good journalists say that's they're using the old knocking\nAnd and then if you say well wait a minute here\nAll of the return address is go to Debbie was a man Schmitz K.\nAnd nobody hates that he was a mansion it's like the Bernie Sanders supporters because\nShe stole the nomination from Bernie and gave it to Hillary because they're corrupt and she was basically run out of town fired from the DNC issues that are the DNC because of that and and the people that are really angry with Debbie was a mention it or not Republicans she's been irrelevant\nFor a year or more more than a year and she's been silent for months\nSo who is angry with her but what what writing your Unabomber's angry with so angry with Debbie ... ships that every envelope has her name on it\nBecause of the return address and I heard somebody suggests yesterday well they put the return address on their of someone they know so that they'll open the package\nWell that's fine but the package shown the packages don't detonate when you open them in fact they don't detonate when you do anything to them they don't detonate period so that doesn't really wash when you say well that's to convince them to open it because then they blow up but but they're not written to blow up when you open them\nSo that that really doesn't make a lot of sense and they've got these people are supposed to be smart people on television talking about these things but really they're they're morally corrupt they're ethically bankrupt and they\nAnd their dishonest and they're not as smart as they appear or their hair cut some ties not withstanding\nAh\nI don't know who did it it could be a righty\nUnabomber who is a big lefty environmentalist by the way the Unabomber Ted Kaczynski huge lefty never mind that\nAnd it could be some lefty it could be a writer you could be a lefty and then I said yesterday it could be the Russians\nAnd that's kind of tongue in cheek but on the other hand this is the kind of thing that they've done on line so this would be making a three dimensional and a more reality based except if those risky as we're doing and I think that actually blow people up\nSo as we are discussing yesterday this this ... there are clues bread crumbs but I Can't come to any conclusions not CNN and and the rest they can all come to conclusions they came to conclusions\nBefore the whole thing started that they knew that if say bombs were mailed that it would be Trump's fault in the future shrunk came up with this I I think he might have been listening\nBecause he he likes to and um\nAnd he said that it could be the Russians I\nHave this fear that it could be some Russian operation to clear designed to do what's happening now more of this you know equally and so in some ways we shouldn't allow ... strange moment that\nYeah it's a very strange moment she I think most women so strange for you was that blow\nHas some other uh fluff or I guess for the for the cars aren't they know they could be the Russians well that's always a possibility accept I honestly honestly I think the Russians were to blow them up now who would not blow them up\nWhat an angry righty Unabomber not blow them up what's the point of that\nBut if you're an angry lefty Bernie supporter who really has a special burning hatred for Debbie Wasserman Schultz things are really your allies the Cory bookers and James ... these are the spokesman for the Democratic party\nSo if you're a Democrat you wouldn't really want to blow them up but you'd want to start a campaign that would allow the news media and the lead up to the mid term to blame Trump for everything which they predictably\nWill do everyone knows that before the whole thing starts butts go to the silly silly Abby Philips\nAt CNN who is standing in front of the White House today and she was playing all grown up she was acting like she has a grown up and like she's a reporter I take her parents are probably proud of her the CNN gave her this job but she looks like a deer in headlights and and she's standing in front of her and she doesn't really know what she's talking about\nBut she's a highly paid CNN correspondent front of the White House\nAnd she is attacking President Trump and and CNN has been blaming President Trump for this since the get go as all of the news media have they don't need to know what's going on who did it why they did they know okay and I hear ... Philips she uh\nShe is she's upset because President Trump isn't sitting still and taking his beating from these twenty two year old corrupt more rounds on the news media\n... ties attacking the media for credit tidal wave solitaire what\nHe's criticizing the media he's attacking the media for criticizing him I'd say is criticizing the media for attacking him and for blaming him for these but she didn't call them bomb scares which is in fact what they are these are\nNot really bombs keep that in mind\nAbby Philip still talking about the press or the United states um and it's all because you know he's been critical of people they received days not exploding devices it's got to be his fault it's just a fallacious illegitimate anyone who's studied logic studied philosophy recognizes this as a fallacious ill adjust\nPresident Trump criticized Cory Booker Cory Booker had a non exploding device to him that we are going to call a terrorist bomb therefore it's President Trump's fault is a textbook definition of a fallacious ...

isn't some Trump loving righty or the news media will instantly liked that I just snapped my fingers like that they're going to change the narrative and I talked about it yesterday the narrative will immediately become oh well thank God it\nWas all a false alarm thank God\nThank gosh all my it was just a false alarm and there was never any real danger because there was somebody on our side who just wanted to he shouldn't have done it but thankfully no one was in danger now of now is that it's a it's worse than the Lincoln assassination it's I heard on I think on panhandlers yesterday

indirect patterns between the president's attacks on Twitter and and the stage and being echoed an amplified by Fox News and other folks in the country for Jesse materials that like the others right why Robert De Niro\nWell one of things I found was that October Fifteen Sean Hannity was doing a whole segment blasting deniro for things he said on the Alec Baldwin show of all things and what she said that Trump allies will regret it because they made a deal with the devil so that all of a sudden becomes Trump Robert De Niro is calling the president the devil and us devil worshippers in effect
