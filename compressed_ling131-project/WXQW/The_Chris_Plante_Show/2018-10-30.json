and in in in the invitation noted and pan and the bottom of the invitation was\nPants are mandatory for this event\nPets wear pants\nSo President Trump yesterday this is just a great example of of how filthy corrupt the news media has become President Trump tweeted yesterday ... do you ever heard he has a Twitter account of anything about this\nHe tweeted yesterday he said and I read this yesterday\nThere is great anger in our country cause in part by inaccurate and even fraudulent reporting of the news he wrote\nThe fake news media the true enemy of the people must stop the open and obvious hostility toward him and Republicans and his voters and so on report the news accurately unfairly that will do much to put out the flame\nNow here's the thing I agree with him I Do agree with him\nI wouldn't personally use the enemy of the people think and I've said this from the first time to use that that particular phrase I'm not a fan of that phrase I don't think kids that's helpful and I'm all for punching back and all that stuff but I that's just not a phrasing that I Would just\nIn any event he very specifically as he has repeatedly in the past although I did I Do believe that he wants referred to the news media and not the fake news media has the enemy of the people I think that's wrong I don't think that truck studying the news media is horrible and awful and corrupt and there should be called out all the time\nBut uh but I'd stop somewhere this side of of that phrasing that said moving on\nFake news media the true enemy of the people well then Jim Acosta he's got a Twitter account too and he says we are not the enemy of the people\nI guess that he is embracing the mantle of the fake news media because he quite explicitly referred to the fake news media comma the true and may have the people come up must stop the open an obvious\nHostility and report news accurately and fairly well CNN and Jim ... nothing to do with any of that reporting the news accurately unfairly is not their thing he's Syria sees bitter with President Trump very specifically and personally apparently\nThen again when I was working at CNN there is no way my bosses would have allowed Jim Acosta to stay at the White House and do what he's doing not a chance not a chance to my bosses and Turner no relation to Ted Turner who was the kind of the big boss at CNN in Atlanta\nNever would have allowed anything like this my boss bill headline his name was bill headline the bureau chief in Washington for very long time\nNever would have allowed anything like this to go on for a day much less two years so it's just not a news organization it's a fake news organization Jemma ... says not a real journalist teaser fake journalist so I guess it's appropriate\nThat he studied take on the fake news media\nMen told the yoke and carry it because it's his to carry so he twisted back in response in a bitter thin skinned sort of way we are not the enemy of the people that ... is the fake news he's the fact\nThat it ... I Am not your enemy no actually you are President Trump's enemy is made that abundantly clear on numerous occasions and to pretend otherwise it's just more fake news day now I Am not your enemy that's why\nThat's not true Jim Acosta is lying in a suite we are not the enemy of the people\nIf you are fake news then you are the enemy of the journalism let's say you know the enemy of civil discourse you're the enemy of the truth you're you're the enemy of honesty\nAnd a and you are Jenna costs is all of those things his anti honesty he's anti truth his aunts anti truth and reporting an honesty and reporting [noise]\nYou are not my enemy he says\nWell you should treat them like your enemy\nAnd I've got to say that all evidence to the country Jim this is we are not the enemy of the people there's something wrong with that sentence because he's laying claim to being the fake news media All right I guess he could do that that that's good for a laugh but he's not smart enough to realize that he's taking on the cause of the fake news am I right of course I Am\nHe says I Am not your enemy clearly you are you are not my enemy clearly he is just based on the empirical evidence that I've collected over the last two and a half to three years\nIt is wrong to kill call your fellow Americans the enemy\nOr it's also a wrong to call them ... deplorable ... ... it's wrong to call every one racist Islamophobia come further every slur or you can come up as if you've got to the menu of slur as available in the English language\nHillary Clinton referred to her fellow Americans as all of those slurs and then on top of that said that we are deplorable and ...\nNow here in ... a big word that has a lot of connotation\nAnd or this woman refers to us that way quite regularly and we learned after it became public after he started saying in public that this was a big hit a Democrat fundraisers that she had tried this out again and again and again among Friendly's in Manhattan and Beverly Hills\nWho hate everybody in between them and like the fly private when they go back and forth um because they see America that way I can I I I Believe\nThis is true on some level the famous New Yorker magazine cover that shows Manhattan on and on the St Louis arch and a cactus and then San Francisco in Japan the Pacific ocean on Japan that's starting point of the Trump revolution\n[noise] because the New York the coastal elites says they like to refer to themselves their bike coastal too and that's a double entendre\nIn in many many cases they see\nFlyover country as say a swath of land they want nothing to do with filled was deplorable irritating mobile racist bigoted stupid ignorant people ah that that they you know flush while they're flying over\nAnd that's their view of the American people that is on some level the starting point of of the age of Trump\nAnd it is wrong to call your fellow Americans the enemy shall I go down the list to Jim Acosta how about Dan Rather tweet over the weekend that all Trump supporters are guilt and it's again that's the rise of fascism and not ... Hitler\nAnd then this is the rhetoric we get on CNN on your network German you can't disown it it's your network\nHe says we're all in the same team you know what Jim you and I are not on the same team we're not on the same team we're not on the same team on any level I really don't think if there were a giant meteor coming toward the earth then we'd be on the same time\nUntil that happens I really don't think we're on the same time and it's ah I Know and I'm not the problem here because I'm actually quite reasonable and easy to get along with\n[laughter] we're all Americans he says well you know uh I guess half of us are deplorable irritating mobile racist blah blah blah\nSo President Trump is actually you know it says that won't do much to put out the flame says of anger but at the flame of anger and outrage and we will then be able to bring all sides together in peace and harmony fake news must end\nHonestly President Trump is really onto something here there needs to be a reformation in the journalism business\nThere needs to be a major and I don't I don't know what will prompt this uh I I mean again I with all the hatred that\nThat CNN and MSNBC put out I marvel at the fact that President Trump and I hate to even say this out loud that President Trump isn't shot at every day by some left it\nThere was one and we don't know how many death threats have been lodged against President Trump but I'm sure the numbers extra\nRemember how they tried to claim that Obama got more death threats because he's black spend an out of the secret service came out and said no that's not the case under oath on Capitol Hill and then it was made and the Democrats just kept repeating it anyway because they don't care\nThat that's sort of their bag baby [noise] no I'm guessing that President Trump to remember there was one English illegal\nAliens that tried to assassinate candidate Trump in Las Vegas Nevada\n[noise] uh and now that that reminds me of are okay you know President Trump on Saturday he went to a political rally and a Wisconsin Wisconsin and a and the news media is very upset because there had been this terrible event that day\nI meteorologist job no there are with the news I burst alert stormed under riles\nW.

standard practice for the news media when it comes to Republicans and President Trump in particular but but more generally as well it's a standard procedure for the left here it is to take what you said change it until it's not what you said\nAnd then attacked you for what you didn't say this is an everyday\nThing in Washington and then they phony corrupt news media rich Samuels set the hill typed up a piece today\nWhite House won't say which news outlets are quote enemy of the people that unquote\nThen writes White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders on Monday declined to name

again I don't I'm not a fan of the president using that phrase\nI that said\nThey just reaffirmed what President Trump said by taking what he said lumping off for a few words and that attacking him for what he didn't say he didn't say the news media is the enemy of not this time anyway they met the enemy of the American people he didn't say that now I think\nNot even defending his use of the
