double and triple check that they're really burning the American flag and spray painting swastikas on it\nAnd sure enough in Honduras that I don't think they're a part of the actual care man itself but\nPeople supporting the caravan\nAre burning the American flag in Honduras and spray painting swastikas on it and and things because they're looking to win friends and influence people in America\nFunny thing is that the Democrats love that they burned flags and spray paint swastikas on it too they carry flags of other nations who remember at the Democratic national convention where they nominated Hillary Clinton to be the loser\nLoser ah they forgot to bring in the American flags rather stay on the this is true I'm not making this up the day one of the Democratic national convention there wasn't that American flag in the hall\nNot one nowhere no button thing nothing for the pledge of allegiance because they don't do the pledge of allegiance they just condemn Israel and Jesus and the Bible and get on with their Planned Parenthood business on the Oregon harvest things like that\nBut they literally had no American flags and it was pointed out it might have been the Daily Caller that first pointed out it might have been Vince calling as a first pointed out that there were no flags\nBecause sometimes it's it's more difficult to notice the things that aren't there rather than the things that are there and so that's an old a detective thing\n[noise] but there were no American flags that the Democratic national convention until stories were written about it and then you know what they did they went over to where it was a Philadelphia right they went over to Philadelphia city hall\nAnd they took down all the ... from the building I Believe this is actually true and brought it over to the convention hall so they had the oh I Can't believe we forgot that we're supposed to pretend that we like this country for a couple of days\nSo they went and got a couple of 'em a American flag bunting strings from city hall and drag them over\nWhile somebody wrestled up an American flag front have probably had to fly it in because the [laughter] the Democrats but in the hall they did there were a full size giant flags you know six foot flags of Mexico\nAnd the Palestinian flag which is not really a country at all and uh but the Democrats had they had Palestinian and everything but the ISIS flag inside the conventional but no American flags so these guys at least have American flags sure they're burning them\nYou know after a spray painting swastikas on them but but that's what Democrats do that that movie the American president with a\nA Michael Douglas and Annette Benning one of the big themes that movie is that the Democrat liberal liberal Democrat president Michael Douglas\nHis girlfriend um wasn't in that building it was an ... um she was a famous lefty or advocate in Washington and pictures emerged are burning the American flag and the movie I think it's a Rob Reiner movie\nA turn to the burning of the American flag into a celebration of the burning of the American flag because you know they don't they never met anybody who served in the military they don't know anything about anything they're just sort of but these are the people that are coming and they're burning the American flag I think to put themselves in good with the Democrats\nJust in case the Democrats are wondering whether these are the people they weren't coming to our country they're burning the American flag and spray painting swastikas on it\nTo prove that they are the kind of people that the Democrats are looking for [laughter]\nThat was that the Democratic convention in Philadelphia where a Democrat man sort of wearing a dress\nCaught on fire while dancing on the American flag but they were burning at the Democratic convention where they forgot to bring American flags not a problem why would that be an issue [noise]\nA boy oh boy oh
