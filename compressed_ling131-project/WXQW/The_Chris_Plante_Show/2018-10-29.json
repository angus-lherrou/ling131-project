death\nSecretary general of the United nations was referring to there and by the way it last night in Los Angeles California Riverside California at least seven people in riverside California where shot during a Halloween party\nA night club early Monday morning it was late nights Sunday night police said the shooting happened just after midnight three am eastern time at\nSub via night club in ... it's it's not Seville with an e but they have an a on the un Sylvie a night club in riverside during the clubs\nAre first purge event based on the two thousand Eighteen film where crime is made legal for twelve hours another Hollywood contribution to our culture\nThe riverside police department said all seven people were hospitalized with non life threatening injuries\nGlasses are bracelet and other items were scattered on the ground outside the riverside nightclub\nAfter the shooting officers arrived and located to victims suffering from gunshot wounds the victims were transported to a local hospital received medical treatment an additional five victims later arrived at local hospitals to receive\nMedical treatment for gunshot injuries suffered during the shooting at a nightclub now they're all apparently going to live and that's good news seven people shouted a nightclub late night after midnight I'm not even a remarkable story at this point\nAnd and if their politics ... was there an hour Fifteen\nBecause then the Democrats would be interested in is there something that I wanted to ban because you know [noise]\nYou know they're ... so where whereas the audio were starting with the microwave ... number four team I'm On but we were going to do the other things silly pets All right okay if you say so\nI won't go back to mow Yarborough um oh I'm Sorry this is this okay I I Want to touch on the caravan than maybe on a couple of care of then things got some caravan\nUh looks like who got us a convoy and mow Yarborough I guess he used to claimed to be a Republican but boy when he let's go let's go he's like had like a total sex change operation when it comes to party\nA hand things locked off I think to become a Democrat Joe Scarborough this morning I'm Talking about the president the president has talked about the caravan and MSNBC wants nothing to do with any of that\nAs the news of this cooked up founding caravan store events promoted by Donald Trump and Fox News\nMay trumped up phony caravans story MSNBC is not covering it right and he's on MSNBC um [noise] so they attack the idea that the caravan is even a story President Trump tweeted this morning\nMany gang members and some very bad people are mixed into the caravan heading to our southern border please go back\nYou will not be admitted into the United states unless you go through the legal process this is an invasion of our country and our military is waiting for you know that's pretty blunt for stuff from the president\nAnd a and it's the news media is outrage that the president said that there any bad people because the news media knows from aerial photos that there are nothing but good people in the caravan and that\n... boot us with the highest homicide rate on the planet earth in our world\nAll of a murderer stayed at home I Know I saw it on MSNBC well I didn't really see it on him and so they just didn't talk about it so it didn't happen so it's not true and it's a fantasy world\nDo you want to do the ... so we got this ... thing too because now you get a lot of this any mention of George Soros is anti Semitism\nBecause George Soros is Jewish so if you mentioned that he's the number one funder of Democrat Party left wing causes man you're an anti Semite this is the new Democratic Party talking point and the news media but I repeat myself if you mentioned Soros and there was a\nTweet it was Kevin McCarthy the man who may become speaker Kevin McCarthy sent out a tweet and in the tweet Kevin McCarthy is a majority leader in the house\nUm he um step made mentioned before this weekend a George Soros Tom Sawyer and Michael Bloomberg funding left wing causes now left he said\nAha all three of these people are Jewish therefore this is another example of anti Semitism and Tom ... father is Jewish but his mother is not Jewish so technically it's not\nYou know legally and the Jewish faith Jewish 'cause his mother's not church furthermore he was raised as a Presbyterian not Jewish his father a I don't know if he's practicing a Jew or not but I think not in any case I'm Sorry I was raised as a a Protestant his mother is um\nA Protestant or you know as a non Jew and a gentile and uh and his father is Jewish but now he's claiming the\nJewish victims things so he can be a victim because the country is made up of two groups of people the victims and the villains\nAnd the Democrats in the news media gets to decide who are the victims and who are the villains they're they're all the victims every everybody on their side as a victim there for everybody else as a villain 'cause somebody's got to be victimizing here this is why whites\nIn terms of race has become a pejorative America because of the Democrats why white man is a double pejorative in America because of the Democrats talk about hate speech that tape\nThey're attempting to marginalize um you know white males a straight white males if you're gay you're okay but if you're a straight white male then you're a villain and everybody else says you're a victim because you know beep and beep beep beep beep beep\nYeah All right so ... this morning he's got this um and she said it's amazing and and the president or a tweeting that there's there's some people out there saying that Soros is funding the caravan\nNow I don't know whether George Soros funds they um ... blows frontier us I'm guessing it probably does 'cause he finds all this stuff but if he does is funding the organizers of the care of it I Can't personally speak to whether George shores send money to\n... blows seeing frontier us that's people Without Borders well countries that borders people generally don't have British But countries do you can respect ours\nAre or not but uh each decision comes with consequences ...\nMembers of Congress attaching that\nBy then George Soros and and making it sound like think again an anti Semitic pro that Julie ... would somehow responsible for buying these people and having them march ... day anti anti immigrant rhetoric or\nAnti refugee rhetoric that same sort of rhetoric used again by the mass murderer\nThe mass murder that's right because that Hitler or this weekend's mass murder because I I can play audio for they talk about the hate speech and so I play all day all day long if these people were calling the president Hitler and then all of that stuff\nRight now we have the Fox news saying let's let's go to and this is a a rift drift Jenkins who is interviewing over the weekend I think it was Saturday he is a there in the mix with the caravan coming north they uh the the ... and\nAnd he stopped to talk to a guy and he's speaking Spanish so there's a translator as you might imagine and it turns out that this guy used to live in the United states\nAnd uh then somehow he you know I think he left because he was wanted by the police for attempted murder\nAnd he fled but now he's walking back in the Caribbean and CNN support says efforts fully and there with him all the way they want the attempted murder to come back to the United states so that he can shower with your daughter I think is what they're looking for\nYou willing to break the law to get back to the United states and you'll get a ... he says he wants to plan for finding the tiny he can they can you ask him exactly what happened to the Iranian [noise] ...
