I Believe her he can't go to the court\nAnd that I think ought to shatter whatever credibility the senators might have had at some point early in their lives earlier in their careers when the world was young and cars were new\nAnd uh you know it's it's um it's appalling that people would ... senators who are supposed to be revered we're supposed to be respected we're supposed to be responsible adults in positions of responsibility senators would read the Washington Post never meet the woman never talk to her\nNever see a picture of her and people like Campbell I Harris say well I Believe her and she was a big\nSmile well and that's because you're an idiot I guess you're dishonest you you can't be trusted with the position with which you have been entrusted and uh and if you make decisions like that based on that then you're not a serious\nPerson and I have no respect for your whatsoever\nIf you'd be willing to destroy a man's life in carefully built a career as a lawyer and a judge over the course of many decades and\nAnd you'd be destroyed because senators like Campbell Harris come out and say I believe her because I read a couple of sentences and the Washington Post today but a disgrace she shouldn't be allowed to serve on jury duty much less the Senate Judiciary\nCommittee how embarrassing for all of us that we have senators with sexual reprehensible a low standards and then you have the the weeny wagging up a Ramirez woman from Yale University college when I was a freshman and I think I even printed out again today\nThe New York times when I was a freshman Brett Kavanaugh ... Sweeney in my face you know like Bill Clinton did with Paula Jones which Bill Clinton did with Paula Jones and uh and told her to kiss kiss it and they all love Bill Clinton they you know in a while just leave it at that\n\nThe New York times destroyed her credibility by investigating her claims\nAnd discovering when they called all of her friends they talked to said more than thirty six people trying to get to the bottom of ms Ramirez claims that Brett Kavanaugh what does winning at her and\nThey said that a bunch of her friends were contacted by her by Romero's in the week proceeding the New York times contact and\nAnd they and and that Ramirez told her friends I don't remember who it was\nThen a week later after talking to her lawyers she went to the New Yorker and Ronan Farrow and that other awful person and said yeah it was Brett Kavanaugh and they want when they published it\nBut if it didn't make the threat how special for the New York times which has remarkably low standards when it comes to reporting on Republicans on Donald Trump but I'm Brett Kavanaugh incredibly low standards very low you know they should have sent alley Watkins out there to sleep with a bunch of\nGuys and try to get some information because that's how the New York times gets a lot of groups you know handing out sexual favors in exchange for scoops alley Watkins is her name she's a reporter at the New York times she got a promotion moved her to New York when they found out she was sleeping around for scoops deal no problem\nThat journalism today she is\nShe going to lose sight block shaped like a\nShaped like a [laughter] Sally rockets and then we have the the third one come along good old what's her name\nWith the claims of gang rape yeah sweating Julie sweating it Julie sweating that comes out with the creepy porn lawyer and she has this ad for David for which she shouldn't be sentenced to decades in prison\nBecause she confessed to a series of felonies\nBeing of the age of majority as she was at a time when she was watching Fifteen year old's drug getting little girls and gang raping them and she doesn't do anything about it and those are felonies that she admitted to in that creepy porn lawyer thing and then when she was interviewed about it she said well what I can really say is that\nI saw Brett Kavanaugh handing out red solo cups at a party\nAnd then they were standing around talking to each other that's what it boils down to when she was on camera critic porn lawyer should be disbarred and maybe\nGo to jail and then he can run for president as a Democrat from prison he can share with Anthony wiener I'm sure they have a lot in common\n[noise] and this is what everybody's resting their coup fees on here their their ah this this is the this is the ... always a sexual predator and don't forget it through a cup of ice on somebody during a scuffle at a bar at Yale and\nConnecticut and sometime in the Nineteen eighties and they don't really have much on that and that's what they have that's what they did that's what the Democrats and then there's a kind of a minnow unstable woman from California\nWho is naturally a college professor what else what you do who who I don't know I'm afraid to fly except what I'm not all of the information that's come out from ex boyfriends and people that know these people that have\nUndermined their their stories or rather than bolstering their stores even people that day they refer to the news media to these people these people will corroborate my stories there for the government to these people these people were corroborate my stories and then they don't corroborate their stories and so if you're buying into this year too easily fooled here\nToo easily deceived and now comes the vote in fact in\nJust a short time they vote begins about Fifteen minutes Thirteen minutes may vote is supposed to be again on the floor of the United States Senate now this is not the confirmation vote\nThis is a procedural vote that will move the process forward\nAh has to do with the ending debates on the subject of confirming Brett Kavanaugh allowing for a certain number of hours and blah blah blah then it's over\nIt's an arcane procedural votes were expecting that to begin at ten thirty I can expect the Democrats will seek to disrupt that's to derail vats\nTo derail democracy in our democratic process sees the Democrats are going to be bought her when all of this is said and done their uh their faithful fanatics\nAre going to be this spirited their back we'll be broken their spirit will be crushed than when that happens President Trump should come out and uses he'll to grind them into the ground and to squirt lighter fluid all over them and set them on fire metaphorically of course we\nShould a witness was over and it's not over and I don't want to count my chickens to ah to gleefully before it's all over because the Democrats that got tricks up their slaves and they got a corrupt media working for him and\nThey're still what are they pulling out today was Dianne Feinstein pulling out today and the Washington Post that are just some fake uh they've got they've got new fake ones but there are grasping at straws\nYou know that he had an overdue book kept the library or something where you cannot have some on\nA library as a symbol of western civilization on ... and you have\nOver two books phase is not not someone way kind of low to serve on the Supreme Court a lifetime appointment\nThey'll keep saying and ah and yeah that said the calmed down it's an overdue book fine okay and yeah you through a cup of ice on somebody in Nineteen eighty four get over it that's okay [noise] uh I you know how many people I Know that are not qualified based on in this criteria we yeah we had somebody telling it earlier\nI asked uh what are the lessons learned here and somebody called in was hanging on the line I don't think he's on any more set of what I've learned is that I better not ever run for office [laughter] and that's a fact jak with so many of us\nNow it looks like an ... tea leaves at all this stuff but just says we we're getting off the air yesterday morning twenty some odd hours ago um we learned that senator Collins\nThe Republican a moderate middle of the road Republican from Maine a lot of pressure to vote against\nHad reviewed the FBI documents said she found the documents the FBI ... to be thorough I'm senator Collins\nAnd um and Fox News is now reporting that senator Collins is yes and and that is good news now is that on this procedural vote or on the uh\nThe final final I think it's on the final final and that's very important because you know the balance in the center is shifty one Republicans I'm forty nine Democrats\nOne of them as Bernie Sanders he's a communist he calls himself an independent he's really a Democrat what's the difference Susan Collins apparently now are yes according to Fox News and then we have Jeff Flake\nThe aptly named Jeff Flake who caused the ah the delay and um I gotta tell ya if Jeff Flake votes against if she ends up being the deciding vote bringing down the cabinet

from Maine\nHas decided she was a yes vote but she's not going to make an announcement of Fox News reporting that are saying that Susan Collins has not made it official announcement she\nWill according to Fox News make that official announcement up three pm eastern time and Fox is reporting based on sources that that day Susan Collins vote will be a yes vote Jeff Flake is reportedly calling around talking to people on the telephone\nTrying to uh uh I I don't know uh most out of his conscience or something of the source\nBut he was look just like for all that that it deserves a lot of the study gets but he was a yes vote all along he was a yes vote in committee he was he ... he was struck a I tell you right now let's take a a quick or you know what I Do wish we did\nIn reaction staying in the content the mandatory quorum call has been weighed the question is is it the sense of the Senate that debate on the nomination of Brett Kavanaugh Maryland to be an associate justice of the Supreme Court shall be brought to a close this is live the way the nays are mandatory under the rule the clerk will call the roll\nSaw there actually it's got to be a positive or a little voting now where we're going to keep our ear to the ground here we're watching the vote very closely and uh we're looking for any surprises\nI was in fact live for you the beginning of the vote calling they cook a Mitch McConnell had just finished up speaking he was on a chair once again\nI again I I've been calling them turtle boy for all these years we're going to have to change his

Feinstein from California Democrat liberal ... case I had a Chinese spy on her employer for Twenty years until about twenty minutes ago and\nApparently that's not very important to not even a news story Chinese find yourself for Twenty years from New York Times is fine CNN's good with that not a thing it's good to be a Democrat but she was out there today railing about a judge Kavanaugh\nOn guns they they like to say guns it's the second amendment to the bill of rights the constitution of the United states America it's vitally important to the preservation of a free peoples plural around the world\nHas like a real with the word people's yeah sounds like it's a fake word but she's out there and she's attacking them over\nWhat she calls guns what I call the second amendment\nAnd and that sort of latest reason for opposing Brett Kavanaugh because I guess I don't know she actually feel you believe that gang rape saying see nobody even asked these questions senator you believe that Brett Kavanaugh was gang raping teenage girls after slipping quaint loads and the punch\nLike a creepy porn lawyer said that's exactly how the question should be asked to take over the\nPast year

interesting for a couple of reasons the votes the balance of the Senate again is fifty\nOne Republican he's forty nine Democrats and the Senate of one hundred senators\nAnd the vote was in fact fifty one to forty nine\nBut it was not a straight party line vote it was not a strict party line vote to senators crossed over\nWhat happened you might want to know Susan Collins voted yes now this is a procedural vote that ends debates on the Brett Kavanaugh's nomination and starts the clock ticking thirty hours now must transpire before a vote can be taken\nAnd on the confirmation on the final confirmation so that brings us to tomorrow afternoon and a one senator is going to have to get back here from Montana from his daughter's wedding\nBut in the vote that just went by\nSusan Collins voted yes to move the process forward Jeff Flake voted yes\nTo move the process forward however Republican Senator Lisa Murkowski from Alaska voted no she voted against moving forward tie you have a\nDemocratic Senator Joe Manchin from West Virginia voted yes to move the process forward now it's not the final yes vote or no vote but it looks like gift\nRepublican Senator Lisa Murkowski was of no today that she would likely also be a no tomorrow it wouldn't make very much sense to vote no\nWhen you're asked whether we should move it forward and then vote yes when you have a final vote so I'm going to go ahead and\nPut on the board that Lisa Murkowski is I Know that brings the Republican vote\nDown to fifty because they only have fifty one votes that brings them down to fifty as long as Susan Collins votes yes and Jeff Flake votes yes then\nBrett Kavanaugh becomes a they associate justice of the Supreme Court because the vice president United States my parents can come in and break the tie and the United States Senate because as any school child can tell you the vice president United States is the president of the Senate kind of a strange thing but that's what they call up\nAnd uh so that would bring it across the finish line even without Lisa Murkowski\nThere as a bit of a wild card when it comes to Joe mansion he voted yes to move it forward as a Democrat but that doesn't mean he's going to be a U.S tomorrow afternoon\nBecause the Democrats are going to threaten em em fly again they're going to threaten the murder as family we're going to threatened to burn his house down you know threatened to ruin his political career Joe Manchin has a pretty tough guy the fact that might just or can't ... if you come in and threaten 'em like that\n[noise] so that's a a a
