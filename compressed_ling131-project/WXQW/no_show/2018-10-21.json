has so much focus and so much\nMeaning\nThat so I share two things with you one\nThis is partially recalls\nBeing forsaken\nBy parents is so park and\nPartially because\nSo many people have experienced this appointment from a parent to some degree\nThose of us who have had their mothers and fathers have reason to think positively and to respond joy for a living at the ... name of\nAnd

physical parent in the human experience who may for say fifth\nChild abuse the child neglect the trial\nGod doesn't abandon for say ...\nOr leave their child alone\nIn like manner that is the behavior\nOf sinful parents\nThat seemed to be another reason\nWhy we are\nNaturally and stronger they're drawn\nDiverse number ten and the song and that is because of the fall\nOf a rite of functioning parent\nIs a deal is suited\nTo ever saying they it tastes note of in this section that he is seeking from\nWhat new we see\nFrom a parrot after all we look to a parent\nTo receive to listen to God and to protect us\nThat's exactly what David is seeking from God\nAnd ... I was watching\nThe news the other night and a flash a woman\nWho came to a house the wrong house of course\nAnd all that for top law\nOn the porch on the doorbell and ran\n... ad picture to see the chow\nStanding out along\nLeft on the doorstep\nOf strangers and the mother's picture was taken taken having done this\nWe live in to much or worse times everything is and what it all to be some things are shaky flaky\nSome things are turned upside down some things are bad and some things are All right or wrong\nAnd you know the experience of life we don't engage\nAll good people there are some\nAnd the barrel of humanity barrel some sad sick messed up parents in that basket and so David\nReaches out to a seeking from God as a spiritual parent\nThat which we see\nAs children from a physical parent\nAnd these were should be inspiring and encouraging gripping and strengthening for many of you who are listening some of you who may have gone through some ... some difficulty\nPassion and stop having Halloween experience\nEvery day\nGod's will never leave ... view he'll never for ... sake you\nHe'll never desert you\nThe song is right um keep holding on\nI won't let go\nOf my faith\nThe lord\nIs blessing me right now\nRight now he keeps on\nThe Keystone loving me\nHe keeps on helping me he keeps on taking me he keeps on caring about me he keeps on showing me he keeps on directed me\n\nThe second saying that David mentioned is in the ...\nIn the section that I've read that we seek as human beings from my\nParents we seem to be heard\nSometimes children talk to us\nOnly been cause\nThey want to listen to\nIt may not necessarily be focused upon what our ex response\nMay be there's just want to be heard\nAnd unfortunately yeah\nMany parents are too busy to listen to\nYour life is preoccupied with your own self saying\nMaybe some TV program\nKid as a quiz right now so I'm looking at I'm looking at Greenleaf I'm looking at power I'm looking at the haves

cares about you and he cares about me God ... never\n\nTells us he's too busy to hear us say too I was not now\nSo why don't we talk to him often\n\nWell the reason is will now are too busy and not God\nMom used to say just a little to offer Jesus would make everybody saying All right and so maybe\nWe're living in such a topsy turvy troublesome\nShake it mean life is because we're not having those little talk with Jesus\nMaybe that's why you are so worried and convert my life experiences maybe that's why you're so full of anxiety and depression that maybe that's why you regret now to give up any given down maybe that's why you become isolated and insulated in your fears and concerns\nBecause you've not having that little talk with Jesus that does in\nFact make ever saying All right if you would have that little talk\nWith him but we're too busy\nNow we've got around saying we've got our social clubs are social organizations guy out for each would I have friends who got a\nJob or we we got our\nOpportunity to travel and do things and now we've shed God\nOr maybe the reason we're not talking is because we are\nToo deep end the practice of\nSan Anton belief\nThat has just send us from God and this allowed us\nThe opportunity to talk with him to the community ham and to fellowship with him or maybe perhaps for you to visit him and you do not really believe that the odds are

January first Eighteen sixty three specifically they said that all slaves that were here by the rebellious states are the ones who should be free\nThose except those who are incarcerated\nSo if you were in prison a about it a crime then you should not be let go\nNow is you need an absentee ballot all you got to do is call\nTo five one\nFive seven four sixty four hundred five seven and four ... four ... five seven for say ... to\nCall and get them to send you an absentee ballot and you you can't get nobody to help the uh call you're free to come over to do something and ah you know ... or ... or ... for\nService but the the ... or to the call if you have a problem\nWe're getting an absentee ballot you need a car over and and uh to the absentee ballot offers which has ties to ever for six to ... how to get on your address and they will send you an absentee ballot\nSo the absentee ballot at the time for those individuals who are light to vote for some reason won't be able to participate because of illnesses or they will be out of town or some other problem so if you need to call today or tomorrow or rather\nDemoralized her last day that you could resident though\nTo bar is October ...\nAnd that five year you can ... vote in a more for the midterm election but if you are here to see and you have a family member who's incapacitated or something called five seven four sixty four hundred and if you forget the name of you call your devotee okay they got this um\n[noise] we've also invited us and we can't see it as afternoon and there are driven David has a rabbit or doesn't reverse wherever we want you to start off this afternoon we'll talk about\nWhy is it important that we vote stress and not on in the mid term election but every time voting comes up\nBut I thank you Robert it's such a pleasure to be able to communicate with the people at specially in your audience is\nThank you for the opportunity to address this this very very very important issue that not only playing soccer community but it it it plays on time being especially here in the United states of America you see the voting rights act was in and enacted a Nineteen sixty five gave\nBlacks are right to vote as you said because that was never a right to vote once you had the opportunity to vote or ... or ... absolutely and so the fact of the matter is because it's a privilege many of us have taken it for granted\nAnd and the local local elections are just as important as the national elections\nYou say because that's going to determine your schooling for your children who's going to be making those decisions what's ... what's what's allowed in the schools was not allowed the city council your garbage pick up your trash\nHold sector of what you do and your tax dollars\nGo to war is knows that you put an office to be in charge now so it's very very important that our community has a whole expressly the young people to understand that you have this opportunity to do something that you're not always\nSo what do you say about the young person or in person or the you know who say oh man today and gone ... they don't make no difference\nWhen there's two things I Would say to you is first of all\nIf you don't make a difference then that leaves you allow what other people do to dictate to you they speak for you asked me for her and secondly when you don't vote you give the other voice two votes because they have their ears and apps and yours means that they have to\nSo that means they're double time on you\nAnd you don't want that because first of all if you got an opinion now if you have an idea law way that you would like to live the most important thing for you to do is let somebody know you you quick to let your mama now as you mentioned that and know what they what you're not going to do so why not use your wants this is the way you use your voice\nSee there's different ways to accomplish what your what you want in life and this is one way that you accomplish it and the quality of life that you laugh\nYou know ... or ... most people kind of categorize pie but not only are based on race or gender but they categorize ... because of the conditions fluids there have been down there and live\nOur lives I as we go over and all the numbers I started I continue to see the devastation\nOr they're closing down apartments or whatever and people need to uh ...\nWhat would you say to those people who who live over in those areas\nThat are devastated who have high crime and they just to you that they have no ... well\nSee that's the other thing too and to Rob the fact of the matter is if you don't promote change change not going to complicate that means that you have to do something because doing nothing means that you agree with it\nAnd when you do nothing you say hey I'm going to accept that but what you have to do is make sure that you make you see no one else can speak for you as right\nTruly not the way you want it but what you do as you allow other people to speak for you and when they speak for your way out in the perfect example of that when we had the leader of this free country\nSpeak for another leader of another country\nAnd summarize what that leaders say it so that you wouldn't be able to understand that the way he wanted you to understand in which is told in ludicrous how somebody going to tell you that you won't\nYou won't catch up on your hot now when you say it all you want as much stricter but if you take the hot dog eating went to catch up on it that means you don't take anything I gave you\nSo first of all those people that's in that area that area well first of all I wasn't built for you to stay there for a while it was just a stepping stone to get you to weigh you had to go secondly if you've gotten there yet then what you gotta do is make sure that it maintains the military so that you'll be able to get what you got to go\nSo many times what she wants to do is you got to say something if you don't say nothing then you you get just what you say it absolutely nothing\nTo you know there is a ... over the hill to kill the drugs has is on the hero of as a as an advertiser will have [laughter] no you have a satellite does\nYou don't have anything to measure mhm who guardians and what he will do and can do for you in your life you don't you don't have anything to measure that up again so if you don't have that because I as your parent and not teaching you at home\nIf you don't have that because I Am as your parent and not him not living the proper lifestyle to show you didn't die he makes a difference for this and if I don't teach you as a man to pray\nYou don't let your mama and your sister and your wife prayed you as my son's needs to see and hear me pray for you as my son and need to need to see how I treat your mother\nHow I Love her and how I respect her however the her your sister nice to see\nHow I treat her her mother so that her\nShe won't rural expecting some dog off the streets in like a lady because the dog doesn't know how to do it you won't just don't want to get a dog a female dog to be your partner because you know better than that you will not don't settle for less than what has messed in your life and that comes from\nWaiting on a ... you can buy\nA relationship now and you can battle association is or what you cannot live\nIn a relationship so then when things are not doing well in your life who you're going to count on you can call on anyone but you can't count on God unless you know him and you've tried him tested him and he's shown you\nWhat he can do in your life so it's up to us to put them in the right place and then it's up to our kids to stand before God\nWhen all the people around me and my telling them not is not there it's the sad part\nAbout what you're saying is is that was a survey and I'm a little back to what you see it\nWhere I Believe there was a\nFifty percent of the people young people um\nAccepted Jesus Christ\nYeah I think that's right fifty percent accepted him eighty percent of them don't believe in order to certain ... certain I Know my ... my math sounds all does her but what I'm trying to get us to understand is\nIs\nIf you have not had him as a as a real of a reference point in your life you can't know\nIf you can look back to your life is pinpoint the day when the God when when you can say God took care of you it was a look\nYou have no political restaurant if your mama and your daddy cannot show you the importance of prayer\nThe knees for relevance and respect for God for men and women your parents ages your grandparents ages respecting them a ... and that's our fault\nAlthough now they're in the early ... here here's what's going on I'll listen\nOff we love to saying why oh relevance hands in a church or a charge to keep I have well what happened with my grandmother\nIn the early Nineteen hundreds Mm it's still good but the way it was done with her is not relevant to that's right [noise]\nWhat happened with my mom and my daddy in the Nineteen twenties it's still good but it's not relevant to what happened with my generation is feel good my children's generation\nThat was a strain in there and him there say service present age my calling to fulfill we have to change our approach\nTo reach our young people we teach we preach the same Jesus Christ who came suffered bland and died on the cross but on the third day was born for the partner of you know what I'm saying is he still Jesus he's alive\nWhen I got to show 'em to you in a different way to make it real and you're\nLike there was this phrase or some of those ways that we could show you know people who are out of the how uh the scripture and ... still make a significant no pay special an African American man to\nAbsolutely and and I agree with a ... a whole heart like I have\nA lot of young people in my church while say young I'm not talking about Eighteen Nineteen twenty I got small ones and what I'm finding is is they're not getting it out how\nSimple as that solve the way I was taught is is good and I can still teach them what I Know but I got to give it to him in a different vernacular\nTo present sea presentation is everything I can give you\nYou may not any possum but if I fixed that possum\nAnd other in a trade that start being different than you ever seen in the way I presented to you want you to blossom Bob yeah for some ... and ... that's what I'm saying hey I saw what Brazilians will be ... [laughter]\nNow on mental pot round forget that [laughter]\nIf you present at rice you can grab them and that's what they're gonna have to learn and let me tell you something first of all we what we're so quick to get the children that folks to join church let me tell you what the word Sasha said he first came to\nSee once you become king don't mind that you have no problem operating in the church and you got to realize something when you get acclimated to the kingdom you become the kings scared\nAnd once you make a McCain scared then you understand that you have a right to vote you have a right to have\nYour you retreated like everyone else you have a right to be treated with Raul to as a matter of fact let me rephrase that now like everybody else but your right to do and have life the way that you're supposed to have the dreams that you have\nThe aspirations and goals that you had from the time you as a child was those things that will steal from God so first of all absolutely we've got to begin to understand that the PRI brothers and sisters have got to get a revelation\nBecause they think that they're going to go down the street in the hearts and muggy and that's not going what you got you got to take Jesus off the cows and show them Jesus everyday life\nSo my point is this one those young children when when when they get out and and and I feel like I'm I'm teaching and they can understand that\nI got to depend on something to give me the right way to give it to him and that's what we must begin to new in our communities and our church has been cast as most people in church on Sunday around the world than at any gathering in the world and that's the way to reach the people okay revenue or\nNobody's gonna say something and some of them were\nPastor saying I'm Seventy one years old I don't know that\nLanguage that the kids do and I have to be on them now for an opening to admit that right now there's a disconnect\nI'm just pushing it teaching Jesus\nBut got when I can do is ask God to help him win God gives me the help to make Jesus relatives who can speak the language that they understand that you know after I I've got to grab one metric prepare them and put them out there\nTo talk to them and tell them to go out there and tell these kids about Jesus is not about ... losing influence is about me being\nA donor nothing spiritual enough to recognize that I Need help to save my children so we got to change to serve this present things I may have to let something go unless someone else to do it to be influential with Mackey is but if that's how God is leading me I've got to accept that\nRumor courses or your service out for the districts to say we fair because of a lack of knowledge or ... there were key for commercial tainted than they guard his promise for ...\n... and you know a stone street Baptist church\nThat vision scripture statement for us is raise a standard for the people as they seem to\nMake this personal with a child or within unsafe person the scriptures say is going to go through the games you gonna have to take the take defenses down and repair them here's the thing\nWhat needs to be repaired and replaced\nSpirit in your mind what's going on inside of the woman at the wells and John for didn't know\nJesus Christ person she knew about it but it wasn't until she had an encounter with him that changed your life\nChildren don't know any more about Jesus than what they are exposed to find their parents or other people [noise] so we've got to surround them with people who can give them good think testimonies\nAnd give them sound instruction to show them that Jesus can make a difference in their lives so what are you talking about\nLet me teach you how to pray pray on going to do for me as a child it'll show you\nThat if you ask God to something and believe that he won't have the and believe that he will do will show you that he can make a half and children already know that they already know what they need something that they can put their hands on to see I called I asked how brave\nAnd ask God to help me out with this and God help me and now I Believe him also wonder if they do with that child\nIt give that child cast a moment so now Robert has a testimony to give to males to well he can say you know what me and my mom I didn't tell me if I frame myself mama told me to pray\nLocally countywide state nationally who don't deserve\nIt another chance or you've had your chance now it's time to get him out I Wish there were two hundred twenty 'cause that would give you a sign that the lord is put on my heart you know when we were back in the day right but don't you remember when we play points to play\nIt so that was the thing on the truck load trunk and think about that new at it but\nA ... or anything that would do the time it was almost a what I Want to do for both for your call you're taking your time today to occur alive for you to give your farm comments and then I'll never ever forgive it's concluded logs and we'll conclude our program\nWhile let's not per se the opportunity and wants to get around I Can't tell you how much I appreciate and ... not
