the ... at the life of Joe his own personal sorrow and destruction of all he was and had\nGod is always looking for someone who's taught is tuned in and turn towards him a man yeah yeah\nNo I was not perfect in the sense of his divinity he was towards God\nIt was just perfect knowledge of who God was good that's good it was who God it was who knew or knew God to be yeah any love God and as a result he obeyed guard\nThe worse says he walked with God and as a result he found favor with God yeah and it was because of this relationship with God it's fair the entire generation we ourselves today things are now a Potter yeah stop right there\nIf no one's relationship which was his walk with God if north relationship with God can cause him to spare mankind and start all over what does that say about how I Walk with God should be where you're not just in public but more so in private yeah\nWe focus a lot of what we do outwardly Batman may see but who are we when there's no one around yeah when no one can see us but go\nYeah now might our lives to be and the effect we can have on this world as paypal disciples for Christ Jesus if we truly seek after and persevere and I'll walk with God\nGod is able to steal exceedingly and abundantly do all that we could ever ask uh think of him and so we see his face turn for my wicked ways and allow him to heal our land as believers who know and walk with God that is still true today saints\nNor was blameless yeah but not because he was divine and his actions but because the life he lived he lived for God any stride each day to live according to the precepts of God's will\nThe strange thing is back in genesis is that all of the folks that were alive at that time steal God could only find Noah and his skin as an example of his goodness during a time when there was corruption yeah paganism evil seriousness that ran rampant unchecked\nGod was fed up yeah his heart eight as he washes loving creation yeah turn their backs on him after all he had done out of pure love for his own yeah sounds familiar desert science yeah yeah I bet it does\nYou see we see it in every day and I walk with God God is infinite love and divine grace\nHe seeks to allow us even in our imperfections\nTo get closer to who he is even when we fail you have you seen the one thing about no was that he may not have been perfect but he had a perfect view of who God really is yeah and that was enough for God to see another faith and there's one man yeah to see that this generation was worth saving yeah\nGod Knows better than we know ourselves yeah yeah he knows that despite our best efforts we are prone to seeing and Greivis spirit for God's sakes from us today it's the same thing that he saw in or our opinion heart yeah returns\nTo guard over and over again despite our failings yeah and the flash and despite the attacks of same disappear or solve cost from God's Altamont purpose for our lives\nGod is searching for heart that loves them so much yeah and even when we fall short of the glory of God we can run to him yeah all of his feet and obtain forgiveness and grace and our time of need that's what I Walk with God looks like now\nBut when he's fall we have to get back up yeah God is expanding our walk to get stronger better and more rights just with each failure if not worse\nYeah with each passing day we should be getting better and who we are the worst than who used to be a man yeah Roman six in fourteen clearly tells us seeing shall not have the main you know a yes or\nWhat a promise and the word that you know why because through the example of Noah yeah we can trust that God will always make a way for us to overcome badly which so easily Bissett stuff yeah and it's not for the grace of God I Walk with God will be ragged fatigue and band yeah so we need righteousness and I'll\nWalk and talk and in our daily living righteousness is an ongoing everyday process do saying yeah there are no quick fixes to living a life on his God\nI Wish there were ... ... but here in lies the beauty today's lesson\nWithout righteous living we become a fake plus people yeah and a faceless people cannot

been tested\nIt produces perseverance does it not yeah and perseverance producers character yeah being character produces a fine hope or\nFear Romans said that very clearly and hope does not disappoint now because God love has been poured into our hearts by the ... thank you ... you know the Holy Spirit which has been given to us yeah you wonder what really moved God to spare generation\nIt was fate yeah face not only moves mouths it also moves the heart of God I mean yeah you see no space came from I Hope that did not disappoint a dilemma thank you Jesus despite\nA hopeless generation living and seeing all around Moses and his can [noise]\nGod love poured out into the heart of new or just saying I Love that move the heart of God yeah\nGod devised a backup plan to salvage his love for his chosen generation that saw things that's why we're still here today yeah God is love things how hard is it for us to give up on something that you love so much that the thought of life without it is no life at all\nThe love of God to us it's so amazing yeah God face that same dilemma when he went looking for the next door when he went looking for the heart of someone who was turned toward him he found nor and that was enough for God to know that I can start all over yes my heart is broken\nYes they have pain my spirit yes they are for ... sake and everything that I have given them but my grand plan will not be upset my purpose shall not be destroyed I Will\nLook to into through and through and throw into and pro and I will find someone who's taught his turn towards me\nSo that I can assure my fulfill purpose which is to create a generation of people who will love worship Allah and served me yeah and he looked down and he found or\nEven now today God searches through and through to find a reason to keep his miraculous creation of mankind and motion yeah and our lesson you get the sense that if God couldn't have found no and found redemption and

everything that we go through that reminds us that we're still human and locked in his God can flash it is the trust of living God that gets us through yeah yeah it is that trust that touches God's heart\nAnd he looks at us with pity and he looks at us with passion and he's reminded that we are here isn't champ I ever be a man I asked what he saw\nAnd he's trying to see the same thing and us today things\nIf we allow it yeah no it showed us that regardless of the condition of this dark world that we are living in right now\nWe can rest assured that our rights just faith is the key to please God let me say that again we can rest assured that he writes his faith is the key to believe in God yeah say what works is dead even to this day but I'll walk with God\nEven in our failures

him up\nIn was the fear in the voices of business side pull that woke him up yeah it was the fear of the bars in these sailors experience fail oh yeah that all came up\nIn is our fears he has that Jesus half the speed to as he spoke to that fear is why you're Fred Jesus do your care\nOur law won't have said to be contemporaneous president reality in large said living savior yeah\nSo that's all

Smith you go through that if you want to but uh if it was me but when you add that principle of the word manifest in EU you stay in and and know that he's going to change things and you know a\nAnother word for favors conviction right I had a\nA great great off and uh\nI was one of those kids I was um I guess you'd say afraid the actual things I didn't like piano [noise]\nSo I went to my other siblings or maybe my cousins go as auntie\nUh can I ... in this particular instance it was but now that she hurt me\nBut she still responding to my cousin and she said to him from actual yourself that's right and when I made it to I was scared\nThat she told me she said I don't believe in it and you know that was saying I don't believe in it that's not my conviction if you want something you asked for right and so we have to learn that we are to have conviction you said integrity and when you have an interpreter you're going to have convictions you write\nI stand on this this is what I Believe on you can't shake me you can make me change my mind my resolvers intact and this is what the word of God says about this\nBecause you know what what we believe in far what we believe in far\nI'm seeing in the spirit world in through our mind us and our ... as long as you could hold fast to that knowing that\nBecause if you if you spent the first of all and you can begin to see things you are seeing the world that God has already to prepare for you and so you have to stand firm and say I'm a I'm gonna get one quick example\nUh when I was thinking the uh from my house\nI Can't pattern dream for months about the airport meeting at the airport\nWhere am I going I thought I was going to take a trip or move [laughter] have thought I was going to take a trip but I kept seeing this in dreams and visions and when I did move and where I Do live is near the airport and now after I got there I wasn't having the dreams anymore\nBut just a reminder that guy was trying to direct me all the time so therefore we do have to have faith and confidence\nThat is why you have to have that relationship with him if I didn't know you when I call it has more to say are you on the way I knew your voice and I have\nYour number so I have that relationship with you when you tell them told me I'm On the way I'm In this space that place I\nHad confidence to know just a few minutes I'm going to meet him at the door so that's the thing that we have to do that relationship develops that conviction that confidence that faith in God\nThat when you ask him for something and then you know what to ask for tax what to ask mark coined to his way because he he gave us that I'm African ability over in the gospel\nSo if he already asked you share a sea knock the door should be open seat the ship by All right well he put that ability in you grab hold to that\nConfidence that when I go to him I ask him for something\nAnd I'm asking according to his wheel is already masks\nAnd you know I've always thought the um\nThe parents as a scripture was very precious because he was preparing them for his departure yes and he said not up into this time you have an ax anything in my main thing you said but I Want you to access your joy may be fool and so you know for a long time science went around with the mouth\nAnd look and saying they've been having a job where I was ... months because in their hearts or maybe in the understanding they didn't believe they have the right to ...\nYou know and we just need to understand the guard is willing to give us the desires of our heart and I was thinking while you were speaking earlier even around Christmas all your birthday\nYou didn't know what you were going to get what you knew you were getting something mhm and if you had enough of\nI guess you'll say enough confidence in yourself you would acts for certain things\nAnd whatever you asked for around Christmas you new mom and dad and love me they're going to get me this for Christmas and so even though I Can't see it as an anticipation and building up on the inside or just normal you I Can't sleep now rise two days before Christmas It's MORNING at his house or maybe she took her to grow more miles but I Know\nIts own way and that's how we have to be when we make our petition known to golf\nA newer somewhere around the corner it may not be February but maybe it's coming in April I Know he's going to do it because he's trustworthy\nAnd that's what I'm saying that we have to understand we're not just put out for you for someone who doesn't have a track record that's perfect S. right he's trustworthy he's dependable and the Bible says even when we don't believe he remains free for bagels he cannot deny himself that's just his character that's who he is he's fateful\nYou know the Holy Spirit has been I'm dealing with me or in the past few days about we\nAh must put our safety in him and look at his faith but net ... he's like you said faithful or you can remove that from him he is safer\nAnd it's not because you've been so good I mean it's so good or David so good is because he's faithful and he cannot change his word or whatever he's already to promise to his all ready to settle and um that is some of the\nThings I was a ... do some meditation when I was studying for last Sunday\nThat some of the main thing that I think that people need to know about the taping his of God the love of God that he has caused us and his promises and and and you know when you start knowing does things other things about us will begin to line up\nBecause if you live in his state for this knowing that he's faithful to them\nThat believe in him those that call on him you read earlier you call me in a day or trouble I Will answer that is his faithfulness he's not going to deny you he's not going to turn his back\nOn you sometimes you might be in a situation where you need something right click in a hurry and you go to someone say or can you just loaned me this just done a lot of and they might tell you I Can't do it and it's sad but see God you can go to ... every time you can go to him today and ask them for something you go back to the same for something\nLong as you know that you are asking according to his way of the Bible let us know to have space for I wanted to read this right quick I Know you got a good one on the way [laughter] [noise] uh uh say job Fifteen\nAnd seven I I I Want to read all the scriptures uh well above that you can go back and check it yourself say if the uh bought in me and my words dare to go on your face or by in ... in you use yeah ask\nWhat you will and they shall be done\nOn to you so if you already have that relationship with him and uh the conviction not condemnation rather they come ... brought him giants let us know we won't ask them is so a lot of times when we are asking here we are trying to do the natural world hope I hope you\nDo this for me because you know you don't know his way on sort of New York you don't know for sure that he will do it because what you had ... that with him to find out what I Can't come before him an ass and and then a Hebrew tell us come bully before the throne you can come in confidence knowing\nA common ask him I I I I Do takes on the side I'm just making this happens I Do take on the side so whenever I get ready to do this and prepare our ...\nOur souls preferably\nThat when I Do this that the business is gonna be successful what I'm doing has gone to sail blah blah blah I speak my words concerning what I what I Want\nTo be done doing this case they are I guess what it always works for me because I'm now putting God ahead of this I'm putting him first\nI Am a knowledge in him I Know this is\nNo or different water go down through generations yeah we get to all of us didn't Jesus come and do the I'm not I see they they could all to do that natural here but they couldn't do the bureau of transformation so here Jesus calm and when he on camera say it is finish\nI remember my preach I'm back close Easter time one year or the ... the battle started in inhabit with Satan trying to trying to overthrow God I Love throw garbage man come on give it up now [laughter] so what happened was that\nWouldn't Jesus came and he said all across his finish his company now Everett Dane thank God started he can finish in through you in are frail\nSo he drew Abraham the promises that were put in Abraham ... T. O. R. to Jesus K winter caffrey made a transformation now does that come along to receive the knowledge mhm\nOf all the Lord Jesus Christ then now for you and you see the holy go see something leave my spirit in order for him I'm going back\nBut I Believe the holy ghost and they'll all minutes that receive me have you received this day you're going to receive everything that was already given in the guard\nEverything to God intended for us to have\nHere it is so so I heard someone say a few days ago we've been living in this natural mindset right so last so long so that's why it seems like it's a struggle trying to get back to what God has given to us but you have to understand it's already given\nYou have to keep telling your mind that every day\nIs already given so therefore up Peter said that he has given us everything pertaining gala death and life so spirit your natural has been taken care of us so because faith has to operate in the now\nAnd have had to operate in the spirit re I'm and fought in order for us to receive the promises that is why it's such a struggle\nAnd I look at people sometime when the word is gone forth\nTheir sleep laying on the game and doing this and that\nUm died this past week saying sometimes she's sitting like that because I'm attended\nTo what you're saying because every time you say something that should give me another piece of what I Need because in this hour and this time if you do not get the promises of God or live in you\nFile for what the intimate say and you're going to be the one who's going to miss out on the president's I've got a lot of people waiting to get to happen to be here they are waiting to this and that but she these promises that God gave us it's but now\nIt's for the no faith is for us to be here in Mr mention it just simply no way that Jesus could do all of this and nobody get healed and and also and I'm gonna let you have a bag also\nThis tape is not just we don't come to bring you face for our car houses is that right [noise] so your troubles snipers also first walk in la ... because if if I don't have the faith to believe so I mean you have fallen at\nOkay then because the the just shove Leo by faith we live by different principle we live by the river and conviction I'm a hold on to that word is more a different convictions and if you don't come and hear the word of God to teach me a ... all of us a teacher how\nTo walk by faith and believe God that even though we have a disagreement to know that was Satan mhm that wasn't of God that was Satan\nSo therefore I got to begin to develop my confidence that we're not come back ... speak to you if you look crazy I mean that's going to have to be okay because I stand in a conviction that the Bible say walking the walk in the Bible says pursue piece elder Smith I\nPromise you for Janice more\nI had to learn how to live and safe for that because they didn't just automatically and it does not automatically just habit for her because\nThe interest so many challenges in relationships down some marriages I guarantee you today if they would have had the right information the proper information that's the word I like to use\nThat was the other because you got to know how to um [noise] like my dad he's the ... reason together yes you've got a brother and how booze hideous my days ... good for brother into regional conflict gather\nAnd understand but it does take faith we see we think we shouldn't have to use for that but you do need faith in God combination I'm Sorry\nYou know the Bible does say the free for too but I Love I Love\nSo it is it's not just the whole puzzle is a piece of the ... and so when we get the whole puzzle men we understand that we began to walk into a mature in life right and so when it comes to relationships when it comes to handling one another [noise] we're not just sold to the point to where we are so distant\nBecause we're working on this great saying that I got from God can you can get from going to lose you are right what's your fellow man or as I Will say that if you don't forgive I'm\nThe father came out give to you through the people that you see on an everyday basis you have to be in harmony with them because it reflects our your we\nGo now tell me that the ... I don't think I Need to stay close to the Mike I don't understand um before we went to church I grew up in the ... came out of church ... more adults giants and the law\nThey always taught us the scripture in Matthew say if you have an art ... but if your brother used to leave it at all really put that give down and you know put that give now\nAnd go to that brother or their sister and you make it right then you come back\nYou know and and I've I've learned that that is a good a principal to saying oh a good conviction to have [noise] so when you get up and preach you are preached at mhm\nYou a priest a word the word of God but that that that that uh Hammond\nIs won't be on you about that\nSo you know that you know how the flow in the holy ghost because when you it's time to minister you may you need to make a pack on someone that they would change the hearts and they would change their minds because at the end of the day it's about getting someone back the crisis\nAnd we've become so uh I used to have a I'm a grandma so heavily mind there were no good and middle song among American a song if it's your favorite song\nBut there was a song and say long luggage can lose out on the nobody else that's true but it it really told us to isolate and treat everybody else like very much because I'm focused on him I mean you\nAnd that's what I Love about progression as bad as we grow we come to know and so many times in that\nArrows they were that's what the thoughts were and you can take it back it was thought not all that time thought on that tablet each run mentioned that we walked in he reveals himself even the more and those who are willing to sell are willing to learn of him who who so ever ... face in about five\nScripted who still have a willing to come to him\nTo be led by him you will learn that I I learnt she's aware in Ninety six and now today if I go back and read it again with some different comes and my grandmother used to tell me that all the time she's a baby you could read the script everyday as something on he gonna show you something different\nAnd here I Am sixty something years later or whatever so many years later from her telling about fifty years later from her telling me that 'cause I was a teenager there\nI'm getting to know what she meant just but when she told me that was you know you could not understand it and I think some too sometimes people are fearful\nBecause they don't understand what the word is sad so please nearby fear 'cause I Know what I Will share with a day was saying you know some things that I said now and and the more you walk with God the more the grace of God is on you you could hear better\nAnd they were saying some things and I said in that atmosphere you're trying to have faith but that's here and I I Love it when people have and we are all able to receive from each other\nAnd because I heard it and I knew it because I'm sitting there you pray a bright side you brace I Believe God but the left side so I don't know ... that fear and so then you have to get both sides of your brain work has said listen I hear what you're saying but I Know what I Know\nThat God is able to do all things but failed in my life that's what I Love me features three it's we're now to him who's able to do a ... a bundle above all that we add\nUp think according to the power work is enough and I learned that that power is the word of God as long as you have that sprint then you you're going to be able to overcome every obstacles in your life and\nYou know you sort of something I Believe everyone who's listening can identify with your praying but man on the other side you're saying you know I don't think there's going to happen mhm that's all about oh we're speaking earlier about Joe and jokes are\nAfter all of the disasters happening we finally understand what was the gateway is principal and couldn't have happened unless there was an open door right\nAnd so Joe says the same thing that I feel the most mouth says come upon me than that which I greatly feared has come on to me and so we have to understand the fear and save\nTo years ago the blessing showed up right I wouldn't categorize I'll be they're not in the blessing so so many times I Will save\nHas a really really really be worked we had to really stand strong conviction I'm gonna keep that in that come fiction\nThat I Believe the last I heard you know had I had just lost not smoke to me and many times and told me something that came out just right I Would have moved but I understand that God has a plan for my life\nWe can't see it physically mentally some days but he give us a flashy every once in a while say if you just believe you stay serving this person you they serve and that person things are going to work out so many we just move out a season we move out a season there and when a blessing con you sitting there like man if\nI Would have just [noise] but I had confidence that he was talking to me was the spirit of the lord and here I Am two years later flipping because I Do it right through it all no matter what was coming my way\nI Do it and now go has increased my life God is great\nYou know this for a walk or think about um the scriptures and how they declared a brown will be the all the safe and so when you look at the time where he was in and the people that were around him as long as ... as they could pull out a little search or you know\nHe's right here on my ... and Abraham saying I'm following the voice ... all one word of mouth and you know\nAnd that's what the Bible says a song for one Fifteen whereas force show that he even said\nWhere's your gun show me your ... were arguing show you my face on your show you the results of following my voice on their side as you write us four or five years as having been a sure is that he's speaking\nAnd that he does speak can in the Bible so that when you come to guard you must believe that he is as a comma there so let's pause there it is you must believe that he exists that's right that's the basis of it that right I Know he's there there are no he hears me I Know he's dogs\nAnd so we just call him today because he has to be activated it has to be good and somebody is listening you you allow the enemy to just have a heyday [laughter] you know but you have the ability I Believe you spoke and you say that in and job and spoke about declaring a fast right\nArt in Shelby establish you wake up\nAnd he's got to get up and then you got to speak up because ... that's\nRight well you know this been a

realize that you know for only use ah been we've been you know three inch in all the years that we've been brewery in and saying in in and doing all this type of stuff and and the condition\nIs getting worse instead of better so that means that someone should be willing to take a stand and say well this is not working we need to make a change here you know we need to try something different now we need to start trying to uh\nPut into how people would it really means to serve God you know we are not really getting what it means a God\nAnd I'm not trying to point fingers at no body but I have so\nMuch love for our people I just hate to see things going on the way that they're going on\nAnd they're not getting anything out of it you know you know and and we got to\nAlways try to show love\nAnd compassion and forgiveness\nIs a lot of you know I don't understand why you served guy you serve God by serving must serve in each other as that you know and we and he said yeah he serves God by making a life and uh the uh the the\nPrivilege of that person next to you better that's right that's right and that's right and you know he sees guys got everything that he wants and we have to stop being selfish you know and that's what's\nCalled them a lot of our problem because we are concerned about us as individuals we're not concerned about that other person you know and you know and people you know have love you know they said well oh I Love you to death but\nThey love view as long as you can do so before I just see they don't see what we have to do really loving people now for what\nThey can do for us so we got to reverse that\nWe got to love a person to what we can do for them that\nWay right and one piece of that can't help themselves they loved them you know love them and try to help you out at all you still love this try that will be for me that smart yeah his hand and and show\nThat low of don't just talking I don't just say you love somebody and then you don't care whether they eat a lot of women they sleep allowed you know\nI tell you know I I mean I don't like to be you know talking about things that I Do but sometime is good to try to you know enlightened people and just won't be able to be of follow but you know do you not trying to boast about than you do you know I\nHad um a young man who just got out of prison\nThis young man that out of prison and walk from the bus station or too cold and browse gets his\nAnd he he was put out there with no shoes and the cold and no food nothing you know but now and I think every\nEvery professor childhood God should be concerned about these kind of I mean it's kind of ... you know how can I\nJust allow this to go and just say well All right brother God's going to get you don't worry about it but then I turn my back and walk off a he walks off I'm going home to lie down and be comfortable\nAnd the brunt out there one around and they will miss you know\nBut I tell you\nWhen you said last year and you are you an example in the community ... and ... to practice what you preach thank you and you you know here's the size of the cars they will have love for each other as right and anytime someone can shoot down\nIn Utah for gambling you did try as my own neighborhood of ...\nAnd that's what we're supposed to do you know I mean if we're going to be Christ like we got to be like crimes\nYou know all the way all the polls cry as well as one is the way you did the same thing to me I don't care and then my eye on forgive and forget what happened to you know forgive and and and and we just have to look right and that that this is what it's all about\nI mean how can you prove that he was a Christian and\nIf you don't want to have love compassion and forgive this you know and you know back to this young man he came over\nAnd I um [noise] you know I came home with me that same night than some other civil war man you'd be taking it as the one little miserable and I want you to understand number one is a few things that you can get out of this just says are\nYou going to ... which is to locate so now if I'm not so bad that day I don't have to get a free and I don't have to be fearful of nobody doing that ... and I don't feel like God is going to send nobody to do me home\nWhen he knows that I'm trying to help them out of love and compassion and\nWe had to learn to stop and look at people and saying well I I don't trust him less trust God in God is in control that's the one that's in control so now and we got to trust God forget about the people forget it by that individual list trust\nGod must have brown you say is a man that I really wasn't intending to say but you gave me some do have a lot\nOf put on hold on my God but we do it in the church here on the outside as you scared to go out there and it's free sway you was the live from\nMass right you are not trusted that God that you've been enough so that you know a God never lost a battle nails or if you want to go on a street corner of the reason that a lot of churches is not on the street they scan other screen tone [laughter]\nThey scared about going to get to shoot enough to get the acting a fool but when we was in love with his ... when they went to shown in the glove is we're up in and we ran and hide and we still we got\nAnd look around and say they put them out and then we go back to Dan in the game and but at the same way it is on the screen you have you out there and you want to do something you can be able to get Joe might get your Bible\nAnd go out to stand in front of one of these stores and the guy come out smoking or drinking is the word that going to do to work out of work is not you it's got word that going to live with somebody from number drugs and alcohol that they're a little bit\nThank God the limit you it's the same God they're going to live with them but it's going to be done\nAnd the word and and and I and in the meantime\nYou know try to show and and in your witnesses to people in all try to shore and loving God is that why you know and love and kindness have drawn me and I'll tell you you cannot be bad you know when you show a personal love and kindness I don't care who they are\nWhat income from best dry\nYou go make a difference in their life or your you show 'em some love and kindness you know a that mom and my that's right comeback income that's right and and and we got to realize that you know people are so quick to\nTo try to do as a person you know a corn and ... now\nWhat you did Twenty years ago he says and you got people to go there talking about something that you did during the years ago and they will make it look and sound like it happened years later that yeah\nAnd that's that's what your goal what they call their young folks that have made in your life and you and you know and and it's so sad that you know you can laugh and talk with a president shake their hand every day and and and and it ends up\nYou'll find out somewhere down the line at this person is really didn't have no when you [noise] you know you haven't been nothing to harm you try to do all you can do to keep the peace and then you laugh and talk and and people don't I I don't understand it\nAnd you're thinking that we are okay so you know we gotta be careful when you treat people and how you associate just there for people because you can have a person I mean more than a kid you just because somebody else says something about you\nAnd just because somebody else there's some good must have\nBrown used saying you you didn't want to be a known as against the church I I'm not going to be known as against the church either but I'm going to speak this have you out there and you are part of the church and you're not out of your community\nAnd you're not trying to do now for your community is ... if you'd ahead of the church is\nJoel response a bill to take that for me by my father's been left right I'm going I'm going to say that again be by my father's been burning house once you deliver the word it's time to go to work yeah once you for pat a food it's time to eat out with you and so once you do that\nIt is a lot of work a lot of work in the ... you know I don't want my living there being by any people in in here with me today they don't they live and to be an bangers right so if you are down\nAnd you find them on a man of deep fried shower\nAnd he you you take it up thousands of dollars that you can't take up with somebody got burned\nOut late June when say say that you have you ... people that you know it it is the wrong road invented something wrong with the system is better to give you feel this way by moderate stand on a five hundred thousand dollar mansion home\nYou know we we just as each individual I mean as as easy as own\nBut me I don't I don't eat anything that's cooked in the microwave you know\nAnd and if I knew it\nBut one of the thing that we have to do\nAnd um but I'm so glad that you you know what to happen is your faith has got stronger you know what the fate is now see we we win why don't we go alone we go we go along for all these years and we go sit in the church and
