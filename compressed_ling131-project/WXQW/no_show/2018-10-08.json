and says I have a credit phrase\nSo I had a phrase my credit now all of a say expose I'm Wondering what I can do a credit karma or something like that\nYeah I Am a credit card on credit sesame both while you're credits thought it would be great to register both of those\nAnd for example with credit karma you have free credit monitoring\nAnd they'll be able to work you if there's any new account activity taking place under your identity completely free\nCredit sesame and credit karma both give you the ability to monitor how you're doing with your credit as you go about the process of trying to get financing for your business you're able to say hey I'm math scores blah blah blah I'm In good shape\nTo borrow that money\nWhat are your assigning needs to be your business is a short term or is that long term do you need a huge amount of money a moderate amount of money\nAnd there's a lot or a lot of money and it's short term but ah I don't have it as us credit history um they have to call it personal credit\nWhen Jim I tell you I Do that anyway you could be in your own business for Fifteen Years and they'll still pull your personal credit and they will also pierce what's known as the corporate veil and almost always require you to sign a personal guarantee\nSo what I Would recommend to you is don't borrow money as a business borrow money is an individual that you use for the business purposes he'll still be able to deduct the interest as a business expense where you could not personally\nBut it's money that you're using for operating capital for your business and the terms and conditions you're under let's say as an example you use a personal credit card\nTo buy things for your business\nAnd he was paying a bill through the business and you recognize the expense and the interest if you pay any interest on the cars as business expenses and that is a perfectly acceptable legitimate business purpose for you to do\nThat that's good advice what what about an hour that they can generate as a credit history\nWell okay so when you refer to business credit history people usually referring to a DMV report done and Brad street and that's based on trade lines how you\nPay the bills you have if somebody or you buy a product or service and they send you a bill ... tenor net thirty over time you may end up with a DMV\nAnd so that is the business equivalent of something like a credit score for a business and so that's how people might decide to let's say you're buying from a supplier\nAnd they're trying to decide if they should be a willing to extend your net ten Fifteen that thirty whatever and they may in fact go look\nAt a DMV report does have become much less important generally than they used to be because until you get real size of your business people are generally expecting you to pay on delivery or pay a ton of water\nSo I'm looking at those services as well you have any recommendations for the peace or those\nYeah I'm packet eight is one that business owners are very happy with eight eggs a dot com\nIn addition to that that's that's strictly a business phone system that allows such flexibility it's mind blowing there's also whom for business\nWhich is a very popular business phone service now oh well we may have to go to a low in may dot com and then you go to their business service\nAnd I think those two are the ones that are best known as far as having a V. O. L. I. P. type business phone service\nGreat I appreciate your help okay and best of luck to you with your business Sandra is with us on the Clark Howard\nShow hello Sandra hello Clark how're you doing I'm great you\nHave a travel question [laughter] bit is one of the ones I loved that you're asking me before you try to do it\nYes [laughter] ah my question is I Would like to fly to Europe and the origin of the flight is much cheaper from another town and they have a stopover in my town so can I get on at the stopover\nYou cannot you can do hassle oh I'll tell you how to do half a loaf OK okay you have to do a carry on and what you can do is you can split the fair difference if you buy the more expensive fair from your home town to Europe\nAnd then on the return you do what's known as an open jaw you buy the return that comes through your home city going back to where the fair is a lot cheaper\nWhen you get off the plane in your home city and go through immigration and customs you have to actually you know you have to do a carry on because you you have to claim your bags go through immigration and customs and then re check your bag for the domestic flight you keep going and go home\nSo let me explain how that works let's say the fair from your home city to Europe just argument's sake is seven hundred round trip and the special fair you see is four hundred round trip\nIf you do it the way I'm Talking about is an open jaw you would pay five fifty for your fair you wouldn't get the four hundred but you pay five Fifteen you wouldn't have to go through the inconvenience of going to the city and buying a ticket to the city where the cheapest fare actually starts from\nRight okay and what about the other way around like if you want to go in the direction of the cheaper city it can go\nThis how cheap as this cheap fair to Europe\nOr it's half\nOh it is right so in the range or like three fifty round trip was say\nWell maybe five fifty\nFive fifty All right so you buy the five fifty\nBut then you have to buy one way ticket\nFrom your home town to go to wear that five fifty starts from in domestic fares are so cheap the ... same a substantial amount of money you get there you take the flight back right to where you started from connect to the flight to Europe\nWhen you come back you only needed a one way to go the starting point because you can do it I said coming back you get to the city where you land back in the United states go through customs and instead of taking the connecting flight you go home\nRight okay\nSo you're not going to save the full five fifty but you'll say most of it because you might pay a hundred to get to the starting point right\nRight and so how do I do that like on line or do you call them how do you\nKnow do you do all this on line so you buy one way ticket to be on anybody but you buy one way ticket best on the airline you are going to go international on right to where the cheap flights start as this one of the deals is popping up out of Miami Fort Lauderdale are wary if Miami\nAll right so there's so many cheap fares to Miami from all around the country and to Fort Lauderdale to just buy the one way down there then you start your international trip from Miami\nComeback or doesn't even have to be going over through your home city just make sure the return is one that connects through your home city and you just get off the plane there and that's why you don't need a flight from Miami back to your home market\nRight okay that's a fact that all makes sense yeah I think it's so much\nSure have a great day you're

say Lawrence family last and don't let anyone ever rip you off the wall Street Journal is doing a continuing series\nAbout how business is being disrupted by climate change regardless of where you are in the political spectrum wherever you however you think climate change is caused the reality is\nPeople and business in corporate America now calculate based on an increase in the possibility of floods storms natural disasters shortages of water and all the rest\nWere cause of climate change and this whether you believe that it's caused by us as humans or do you believe it's a natural cycle of the planet\nWhatever it is that you're comfortable believing about that the reality is it's happening\nAnd there are things you and I have to be prepared for in order to protect our wallets\nAnd one of the things that I Want you to consider and it's been so clear\nWith natural disasters leading to flooding is that so many homes that have flooded and businesses that are flooded in recent years are places that historically had not seen flooding\nOr seen flooding to the degree that we have now we have to think wider\nAbout decisions we make specifically with insurance one of the things the wall Street Journal's men writing about is that insurers light to be able to calculate risk and right now they're models\nAren't working and they're having a really hard time figuring out what is a reasonable calculation of risk and ultimately there's going to sound weird but his interest rates rise\nInsurers are going to find that more and more of the cost of this uncertainty are gonna be baked into the premiums you and I pay\nSo when you're looking for a place to live or a place to locate your business higher ground is an automatic better way to protect your wallet\nAnd is came up so recently and the tragedy that hit the Carolinas from the never ending rain from the hurricanes and tropical storm\nIs that only somewhere around two percent\nOf dwellings had flood insurance if you are in a lower lying area even one that has not historically seen flooding\nYou should take this is an important lesson to protect your wallet\nBy having a flood insurance policy\nIf you were a small business owner because of the unpredictability\nOf weather patterns if you don't have business interruption insurance\nIt's something you should consider so many businesses and areas stricken by disaster clothes and never reopened because they're broken financially so think about\nLike any good business person would do think about how you prepare\nFor the unexpected and the decisions you make where you live where you locate your business and then based on where you live or where you locate your business ensuring against disaster is the kind of thing you need to do to protect yourself going forward\nDo you know in Texas where people were so hard hit by Harvey ... last year is hardly the name of the storm yeah Harvey\nSo many people were under insured are uninsured for the flooding that

S. N. B. C.\nAnd we have a gentleman on the missus or a new or rough but now I don't watch B. S. N. B. C. so I don't know who any of these people are to be quite honest with you\nBut nor Ross one apparently\nIs the associate editor of commentary in a BS NBC contributor and he's supposed to be a conservative I guess if they have anything on there or as close as they get to a conservative on B. S. N. B. C. so he was trying to explain to them the panelists\nWhich are now I don't know the ... and I'm not I don't mean to be ugly but the person we're on the right I don't know whether that's a man or woman I Know I have no idea\nI'm going to guess it's a woman with a really short hair cut but I don't know it could be a man so I Would assume if it's BS NBC that's got to be it's gotta be a woman 'cause they wouldn't have three men to women\nAnyway so here we oh this guy is trying to explain to them what this cabin all thing was all about\n... you know I think that frankly that what he's addressing the tone and the tenor of this panel is indicative of what we're talking about here and Susan Collins should be read by everybody very carefully because her speech was about the judge's philosophy what's the dental off\nOver the course of the last what shall we say emphasize the extent to which this guy splits the baby he doesn't rule against ca ca\nThat interested I currently I was there when we're interested in overturning roe the allies will make it over here as he has a philosophy and conservatives wherever I Am and I and I had all the services that have\nHad it right away and saying you know it sounds like a place and then\nWhen it happening with reproductive healthcare or any of that but that's what\nAn idiot so he says he says I'm trying to explain you to the conservative philosophy and she said she puts her in and says don't do that you're headed right towards man's blaming\nDon't say I'm trying to explain something to a woman when it has to do with reproductive health care well obviously has explained it to you because you're too dense to get it\nAnd it's not because you're a woman is 'cause you're a liberal you won't shut the hell up that's the problem I'm Sorry\nThat's just an easy I mean they might be able to talk over everybody else and you won't that's how you that's how you remain ignorant\nAnd liberal is the sit there and just a\nFilibuster garbage over somebody else who's trying to explain to you what this guy is all about [noise] that's man's planning if you explain anything to him and you're talking down to him no I explain stuff for you folks all the time men and women that's not talking down to you is just imparting\nWhat I Know that you may not know\nAnd then you can call and explain things to me the way you see a myth and [noise] but see now that's you're a victim would go back to the study everybody wants to be a victim of a bigger victim of new ally suffered more than the Holocaust survivors [noise]

from the Trump swamp where the cabinet will that will become [laughter] lord himself in the salon many\n... uh what else we get boy Oh yes the left is out there clawing literally at the Supreme Court door when Brett Kavanaugh was being sworn in as from the daily wire left has had a rough day Saturday\nAs the Senate voted to confirm Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh to the nation's highest court for the most part they didn't Hi there this year\nWhere The Handmaid's on Capitol Hill and protestors on the national mall left is turn downtown Washington DC into a massive ongoing temper tantrum but\nPerhaps no instead of better expressed the protesters tenuous hold on Saturday\nThe demonstration at the Supreme Court where protesters mostly women broke through a police line and barge to the courts chamber where they proceeded to whale mashed teens and pounded the doors log cabin all was being sworn in [laughter]\nOh\nOh I found the um I found the quintessential the quintessential\nA\nLeftist crying picture and ah I posted on Twitter today this is the chicken the red white and blue campaign had with the glasses on with a real short hair who's just crying engage seriously in\n... out a\nI Love the picture I mean that is so emblematic of the whole lip doesn't do any time the laugh against their Fannie handed to him\nI'm going to be tweeting that thing that's my goal to left this crying picture [laughter]\nI Know it can't be true [laughter] [noise]\nWhat a bunch of babies I've never seen anything quite like it I mean you [noise] but I told you it was going to get worse than they're\nAlways going to get worse than this you're thinking that we've reached the ... the new high and low no we we haven't even come blows drugs will feel what is it looked like when we reach the apex of insanity with these people let me tell you what it looks like\nIt looks like these people all out in the streets I mean complete rioting burning\nShooting looting smashing anybody who they think's a concern about what it looks like that's what it is that's where it ends\nIf we allow it to go this far what they should have done is they should have hauled they should have closed the gallery\nDuring the Senate voting they should have just said I'm Sorry you know we a lot of people want to watch this but you're all going to have to get out because it's ridiculous I mean every time somebody voted especially Joe man do\nThat and it's not always the same person did you notice that have them because they all sound like it's just hysterical screaming and hollering like you're crazy it tends to sound the same\nAnd so they're they're voting on Saturday\nAnd these people are losing their minds the gallery and their parents were Saudi arms please restore\nI said well the sergeant arms please clear the gallery so we can move on with some sort of form of civilization here for these people trying to screw it up just get them out\nBut what they should do is when you disrupt something like this see the problem is I don't even know I'm sure it's a misdemeanor and you'd probably get ticketed for it if you made it five years mandatory in jail to pull something\nLike this and nobody would do it what they do it because they can get away with it because the punishment is worth the risk\nSo if you make it so the punishment is worth the risk that if you go in there and start screaming at somebody and a congressional hearing a Senate hearing or during a vote that you're going to go to ... I'm about five years is a little much I Would say\nI don't know six weeks in jail minimum six weeks in jail you're gonna have to be in jail for six weeks sets the minimum ... hall you off you're not coming out for six weeks\nYou understand part everybody want to yell now okay everybody just sit here and be civil if you can't if you can't it's six months in jail six weeks into whatever [noise] they didn't know that some of these people continue to disrupt and that's how they destroy\nAnd and you and plus as it came out her lawyers have paid for the polygraph test so they're going to do it and how will this guy's a contractor so what do you want me to do we want you to do this and so the wing say she passed a polygraph this [noise]\nBut basically what he was saying is we don't band you're somebody who's the victim well who's to say she was a victim who's to say she wasn't making the whole thing up I mean when you've got these witnesses that came corroborated see that's why if this were a legitimate polygraph\nTest then they wouldn't have been just two questions it would've been cross examination\nBut there really wasn't any of that there really wasn't a well there was some of that from the Mitchell lady for Maricopa County but it was done very gingerly with kid gloves and all the rest of it\nI Know we've got some information but it ... this was not a complete ... somebody who has brought\nSerious accusations against the guy who was nominated for the Supreme Court it should've been herb burden of proof and she should have been put under the third degree until we found out what the truth was\nAs it is now we'll never know\nFor sure but we can say this from a legal standpoint there was no evidence that Brett Kavanaugh did anything will never know I mean we always say you and then but we don't know well we know as far as we can know\nAnd if you want to err on the side of knowing you gotta saying nothing happened you can say oh I think something happened\nWhere you can think oh you want to or I bet something happened you have no evidence of anything [noise] but that family will be a foot notes to his entire Supreme Court tenure QuickTime out one eight out you know it's interesting I Wonder if the right\nIs ever going to learn a lesson from this I Hope they don't learn the lesson that all you got to do now is come out and accuse somebody

a price this is from the Washington Examiner secrets\nSays\nThe nation's top Democrat is urging supporters to make Republicans pay a price for putting Brett Kavanaugh on the Supreme Court this is a fund raising email and that was sent out by the DNC chairman Tom\n... is Tom ... make Republicans pay a price for Brett Kavanaugh\nIs the one thing we learn from the Brett Kavanaugh fight we can never ever trust congressional Republicans to stand up to Donald Trump and just thirty days we have a chance to elect democratic majorities in Congress and for the sake of our democracy we must were not an democracy by the way um\nIf you're able to make up three dollar donation right now to make Republicans pay the price so in other words if the Republicans have to pay the price you gotta pay the price for [laughter]\nIt's gonna cost you three dollars to make the Republicans pay the price so pay the price will make them pay the price will try to get your money back [laughter] it's not enough to get man to Clinton\nI guess as to say to somebody named Clinton okay\nWe have to beat the Republicans who ran this nomination through time and time again Republicans have shown that they can't be trusted to stand up to the Trump Administration on a single thing\nSo it really is the simple if we don't want people like Brett Kavanaugh will be appointed a lifetime positions on our federal judiciary we need to elect democratic majorities this November where whether you smoke when he was put on the appeals court by the way I'd like\nTo know\nI Would like to know but we're nowhere nowhere\nDemocrats only need to flip to Senate seats that delivered to win control of the Senate and make sure Trump can't rammed through any more judges like Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court's\nDonate three dollars right now and throw out the GOP this November thank you Tom Burrell as so they go folks are you paying them three bucks in the end they'll make the Republicans say you're going to have to pay but they'll make the Republicans say I wonder if the Republicans grab to pay more than three dollars\nYou know it costs to three bucks but we're going to make the Republicans pay for that so we're going

women need to be believed well how about all those women who accused Bill Clinton how about wanting that Broderick how about all I Apologize having all these folks that I Know they've been bows who need to be destroyed the\nAnd that's what James Carville came it wasn't it was the right wing that came up with this James Carville is the one who's calling the member ruptured ... member rough to not that\nWell why isn't Carville being called on the car carpet by calling a victim but we're supposed to believe a bamboo pole and also said they were living I Can't hear you I Can't hear myself that I have also said to they were living in trailer parks there your trailer park he drank five dollar bill so excited about this would come up with\nSome of the people who choose Clinton were memos and trailer trash that you can just drag five dollars to a trailer part in this which come up with I thought we were supposed to believe the survivors now they're all survivors well here's the thing\nYou're supposed to believe what you want to believe but you need to have some incredible information there is no pattern of behavior to Brett Kavanaugh I'm not going to rehash do Brett Kavanaugh thing but there is a pattern of behavior for Bill Clinton\nAnd it was before he became what was before even the politics for crying out loud but it was certainly before he even came to Washington DC and continued afterwards and everybody knew it including all of those folks around them\nThey just knew that in order for him to survive politically you would have to destroy the survivors\nThat's for the call them no survivors the survivors of Bill Clinton need to be destroyed and you had George ... who was in the thick of all that with James Carville and Hillary Clinton ...\nSays now supposedly ... journalist sitting they see it on good morning America and on this week without being with Brinkley and the rest of this stuff Hillary making the rounds as some sort of on the Yoda of the Democratic party\n\nAnd she ... she's supposed to be an expert on everything and then they do these women need to be believed and not one person interviewing her says\nWell should we believe the people that have lined up to accuse your husband are we supposed to believe them too well here's what I Know the liberals let me say this to take away the take away from this is this if you're a conservative you're guilty if you're a liberal you're not unless you happen to be Harvey Weinstein team\nAnd they just had to sacrifice him\nBecause army wine thing was at the tip of the spear for me too movement\nBut the rest of it all depends on who we're going to believe but most of the accusations and you can look this up for the meat to thing had been liberals\nIt's been the liberals who have been accused of most things and certainly the ones that are provable certainly the ones that are provable but that doesn't seem to matter\nA it's the Republicans were just ungodly

were supposed to be lifting women up\nPutting women in positions of power oh that's right if they are Republicans no\nNo no no no we need to to ride them we need to ridiculed then we need to drive

the global warming stuff check this out and this is almost drop dead Hal areas we now have [laughter]\nAs you and me we now have ladies and gentleman uh some proof out there that and windmills yes is this study from Harvard wind power raises the temperature\n[laughter] study\nFound a large scale wind farms have a more immediate and localized effect on the surface temperature\nTurbines slow wind which can affect quote heat moisture and momentum between the atmosphere and the surface of study found when energy proponents have criticized the study and pointed out that any localized temperature changes do have the same effect as the missions induced global warming\n\nThe large scale implementation of wind turbines would raise local temperatures in the immediate future should the country dramatically transition it's generation industry toward a large scale wind farms they average surface temperature of the continental us would rise\nZero point to four degrees Celsius according to the study published\nA by two hobbit authors is such a temperature increase would exceed expected reduction of warming up zero point ... degrees Celsius if the U.S worked at ... electricity industry so if you were to get rid of the electricity industry altogether right\nSame get rid of any carbon\nWhich is carbon dioxide\nI'm going to tell you this I take advantage of tax credits anytime that come down I put geothermal in it was right towards the end they they were cutting out the tax credit fill you you're you're a hypocrite no I'm not that's my money\nAnytime I get a chance for the government to let me keep more of my money in other words they didn't cut me a check from the treasury\nThey just didn't tax me as much and boy do I pay a lot in taxes so have I got a chance to pay less in taxes I'm going to take it and then they face that thing out for a year or two and now it's back\nAnd quite frankly I think they all should be gone we shouldn't be paid playing favorites with the free market like as we shouldn't say well this type of energy is better than that type of energy or this type of cars better than that type of car it's the same thing when you go\nTo these places we got him in our town is conservatives are town is and they pay for these charging stations so you've got somebody who has paid a hundred and twenty thousand dollars for a car and boy we need to help them out on power and that thing going on yeah [noise]\nYeah we we need to essentially fill up their tank every time they pull up so you go to these places all around town and the folks who have shelled out a hundred and twenty thousand dollars for electric car getting charged for free\n\nYou know here's somebody else can I say this and this is for you folks in in this area I'm just going to say I've said this before but said again if you live in the Britain what area do not buy gasoline from these Huck stirs it run gas stations in the brain what area\nBecause they think you've got money and you do what they're going to charge you a lot more for gas and most of these cars and the people are driving in Britain would\nTake the high test if you drive two miles down the road and get out of breath would it's thirty to fifty cents a gallon less and I'm just quite frankly sick of being taken advantage of I stop buying\nGas in Britain would many years ago I Lived there but I don't ... well I did the other day and it's the thing I came out and I had to go somewhere and I had to be there and I got out of gas I'm going what am I going to do\nBut like I had to buy and by the by the expense of junk from what I mean it was like\nThree Ninety a gallon free Ninety a gallon\n[noise] so I went to fill up the other day and I drove a mile down literally a mile down the road down towards Nolan's railroad and instead of being free Ninety it was three fifty three\n\nNow I'm just telling you you can get and maybe you don't care but I Do and it's not that I can you afford it it's not as I mean the point is getting taken advantage of\nAnyway that's my little lecture today as another by the way ah\nIf I bought a a\nReally really nice car will the city of ... would pay me to fill it up like

actually down I Believe in that the district to the to the Democratic challenger\nNow that said ties so he may be coming back he may actually survive\nLet me sing yeah ... this is from back in July has a Democrat up my two and now we're Walker has come back the tide and the latest but who knows what's going to miss California you can never tell [noise]\nUh and some of these other anyway my point is when you look at the polling them out there you can't always believe with a but you certainly don't do an average of polls over the last three months good grief whatever happened in July is ancient and may as well never happened whatever the poll that was taken in July is totally irrelevant now\nThat would tell you that any poll taken in August or September is totally irrelevant now the only thing that matters now is the latest polling and you can't always be sure that that's accurate\nJust saying now for those of you who've been paying attention Brett Kavanaugh is on the Supreme Court\nAnd I know [laughter]\n\n\nOh my gosh these people or something so we have a school teacher and this is why we need to be telling these people a little bit more closely this is a school teacher from Minnesota\nAnd a nice one tweet where she's made a yarn butterfly today that was September thirteenth only as she got a little yarn butterfly that she's made and in a she posted this when was this was this yesterday\n\nYeah yesterday what is today it was yesterday she posted she went from yarn butterflies ah to this she says senior and I want to make sure you\nOr\nWho's going to take one for the team and killed Kevin Oh man that's nice that's nice\nSo who's going to take one for the team and kill Kavanaugh the reason I ask who's is W. H. O. as\nA well that's a possessive who's black who's gonna is this or who's ... who's a who's a\nYarn butterflies in but who\nIs going to lose as a contract or who is going to take it should have been a W. H. O. possibly so I Hope she's not teaching English but I Hope she's not teaching an\nOld and I hope that maybe some money from the government has paid her a little visit\nHer name is Samantha ness they won't let us\nWow this is overrode on overheard on duty and it was the Shiite I hear on duty is actually the real news somebody throw the word that's OK on Twitter by the way [noise] [noise]\nBut God Forbid you put something offensive anyway they said well apparently this is an elementary school teacher time to make sure she finds a new profession\nAnd then they say well Samantha ... the leader to Facebook and Twitter account and scenes a hard lesson and not being in a whole I suppose and then somebody posted her teaching license number\nHer name was posted and one of her picks and it's lined up with a resume she posted on weekly with pie I won't see and hear the same pictures of her or on the site which also show she graduated from the University of Minnesota\nAnd then they also [laughter] somebody you talking about going whole hog some money has actually um\nPosted in her report card from two thousand and four and her swim lesson plans [laughter] I don't know how they got all of that but [laughter] maybe see posted on the way back when but at the Samantha ness\nInstructor was Kim and this was from a as is from February fifth two thousand four and then they get all the comments and everything else on the air\nAnd it says Hi Samantha ness usually not good to threaten violence on government officials and they're posting report cards now so nothing sacred anymore it's it's [laughter] so she's she's threatens well yeah yeah I guess you could say there is a threat\nBut what it basically is is a solicitation to kill Brett Kavanaugh that's much better isn't it by the way Cabot on his first day hires as many black clerks is Ruth Bader Ginsburg has been in their entire tenure one a couple of black I guess a woman he's got like for a female clerks\nAnd I'm I'm telling you the left are saying what he's doing that so he can arrest them or maybe raped them or whatever\nAre the names forward he'll drug them feel drugged him and they don't take advantage of the

House\nReporter for CNN [noise] well some nasty tweets that she had written a\nWas condescending views towards members of the L G BP community as well as an arrogant attitude toward those Collins viewed as the lower than herself the log cabin Republicans ironically we're the ones who called her out on this and they discovered these quote unquote gains slurs\nAnd they posted the is let me say when these were actually this from twenty seven\nYeah twenty eleven ladies and gentlemen what Seventy years ago she posted this prologue to Kennan buried tales you fag yeah so you're going to get fired for that because a lot of people get fired for a lot less oh\nThere was somebody who owns the the other one is and I didn't quite understand this one LB okay if I Want to room with a lesbian\nI don't know the context so but apparently\nShe's making fun of somebody being a lesbian would you just can't do if you're on CNN now now can you\nPaint CNN I don't think it's going to fire and I think

road projects but um have you noticed any McChrystal's for them and I want to do was\nThat was in the ... going to be there how he used to say there's been a nice place to put a restaurant it was the slowest ... you know I used to love Christmas for not getting that stuff I don't think that stuff any more than anything wrong with them but um [noise] I mean it was the fried chicken little sandwiches which I don't even\nMore and I used to go there it was almost a daily routine for me to go through the two chicks with cheese and a small sweet tea you remember they used to come in with all that other haven't eaten that in a couple of years at least and\nUm I don't know [laughter] so I I'll tell you I found this I was in the salad Wendy's I go and get the southwest avocado salad they

them\nTo make your two chicks with chains and then she would get ... and then she'll put them in a bag and put his neck and in the end she handed it to you and then she'd step back at the cash version
