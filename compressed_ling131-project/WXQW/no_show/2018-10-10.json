Ali you some good news or clean I I I was not a Trump fan okay I was\nPretty hardcore and forget crews for president and I have to admit I was dismayed by what happened and you know not that I just I wasn't a fan of Trump because I wasn't sure that he was going to be conservative you know and I was sure that it was so\nThat's why I I thought when Trump got elected he would run toward the center and kind of be a New York Republican and I supported Ted Cruz in the beginning because I thought he was a real Bible believing conservative from Texas who was bright and smart and knew what he was going to do but\nDonald J Trump has done governance what Ted Cruz would've done\nAnd you have the star factory is going to be in Cincinnati on friday and I'm going to be with them a little bit on

am done but Cruz does an magnetism doesn't have the charisma\nDoesn't have the charm or whatever you want to call it but Trump is a rock star and if you have a shot Chris getting his presence go to one of his rallies and all that the Beatles circa Nineteen sixty five or Michael Jackson circuit twenty four hour Whitney Houston circuit Tony oh three this guy's a rock star\nAnd when he shows up in your town\nIt's a wonderful thing to watch and when you got that magic in a bottle that you catch what Trump you got to ride a baby for all it's worth and this guy makes Ronald Reagan look like a liberal\n[laughter] well you know if if it would've been up to me I still would have had cruise in there but my eyes were opened and here's what miles are open to that God is in control not me and he knows what he's doing and I think\nNow that I've seen it happen let my faith is behind Trump as a president\nOr not because he is the most godly man but because I Believe that this is the Korean

the church of Jesus Christ of latter day saints for LDS for some folks\nIs joining with lawmakers and the governor of the state of Utah to support the deal to legalize medical marijuana even if a legislative initiatives on the ballot this November ends up failing this is an odd situation here because they they're putting it before the voters and regardless of what the voters do the governor and\nSome legislators and the church which carries a lot of sway in Utah are coming up with their own deal\nTo allow the use of medical marijuana and this is the first time as far as any of us here can remember that the Mormon church has made\nStatements supporting medical marijuana is prescribed by a doctor and spent by our pharmacy correspond a gym route tells us how this came about\nMichael the Mormon church is bad\nCompromise bill that could wind up with legal medical marijuana\nIn the state of Utah just one voice in the church representative elder Jack Gerard says however it wants to be a constructive voice sadly we had a church of Jesus\nChrist of latter day saints has not changed its mind about marijuana\nThere's still opposes is used as a does caffeine tobacco alcohol and illegal drugs as part of its health code known as the words of wisdom and it's gotten some heavy criticism for being part of a closed door meetings with lawmakers on crafting a bill that would get ahead of a ballot initiative in November but the LDS leaders believe would be much worse\nPolls indicate the ballot initiative proposition to would pass even members of the church plan to vote yes it also signaled that it could be the first time in history the church would lose a political campaign as it opposes prop to\nThe compromise bill sets a strict limits such as who will be allowed to grow it specially trained doctors will be allowed to prescribe it and pharmacies would dispense it the proposition however will allow patients to grow it doctors just suggested and dispensaries dispensing it\nThe church believes there needs to be better safeguard so as not to make it easy for just anyone to get a medical marijuana card and it is feared that voter approved initiative on medical marijuana could eventually lead to recreational use democratic representative Angela Romero calls the bill nothing less than voter suppression\nThat NATO air power that\nGerard does say with this new bill the church quotes is thrilled to be part of the effort to alleviate human pain and suffering and poked Michael\n... thanks Jim ... reporting for first light Twenty one minutes before the hour now on first like call us at eight hundred seven three six three six six six tell us what you think about this the way this would work as the governor in Utah will call lawmakers into a special session after the midterm election and they'll\nPass this compromise deal worked out with the church regardless of how the initiative fares now if the medical marijuana bill passes the voters in November it'll be revised under terms of this deal and is that a ballot initiative failed the legislature would simply consider a law as a as a brand new thing now\nThis or that the fact that this is are being worked out in such a conservative state just shows that the nation is changing his attitude on marijuana and medical use is now legal in I think thirty one states ... November ballot in four states Missouri and Michigan North Dakota and Utah\nAnd ah you know it's things have really been changing hair so what do you think about this what do you think about the role of the church playing such an important role making a deal with legislators\nTo get this passed because they probably couldn't get this passed through the legislature without the support of the Mormon church is that right don't we have a separation of church and stay here or do you think that the church is playing a positive role and getting this done so that you could have medical use of marijuana in\nA in Utah has gyms reports said uh they they oppose the ballot measure\nAnd they also are opposing recreational use of the um the way in which means you can't smoke it because when you smoke it you can get high off it I guess when you take the medical marijuana in various forms and pills so that sort of thing you don't get the high you just get the medical benefits\nOf the drug and um so they don't they don't want you to be able to have a good time with it because they don't want your taking drugs like coffee and alcohol and of course illegal drugs so where are we live at\nOften but

six tell us what you think about this the way this would work as the governor in Utah will call lawmakers into a special session after the midterm election and they'll\nPass this compromise deal worked out with the church regardless of how the initiative fares now if the medical marijuana bill passes with the voters in November it'll be revised under terms of this deal and if at a ballot initiative fails the legislature which simply consider a law as a as a brand new thing now\nThis but the fact that this is being worked out in such a conservative state just shows that the nation is changing his attitude on marijuana and medical use is now legal in I think thirty one states ... November ballot in four states Missouri and Michigan North Dakota and Utah\nAnd uh you know if things have really been changing here so what do you think about what do you think about the role of the church playing such an important role making a deal with legislators\nTo get this passed because they probably couldn't get this passed through the legislature without the support of the Mormon church is that right don't we have a separation of church and stay here or do you think that the church is playing a positive role in getting this done so that you're going to have medical use of marijuana in\nA in Utah has gyms reports said uh they they oppose the ballot measure\nAnd they also are opposing recreational use of the um the we'd which means you can't smoke it because when you smoke it you can get high off it I guess when you take a medical marijuana in various forms in in pills so that sort of thing you don't get the high you just get the medical benefits of the drug [noise]\nI enjoy the show I'm not angry at anybody than when I got drafted in Lincoln Vietnam I didn't even have the right to vote no God bless you keep up the good work\nAnd I'm Glad you're that young I'm Glad you're feeling well this morning thank you so much for the call or we are at ten before they are Steve in Gardiner Massachusetts Good morning ...\nGood morning here in the state of Massachusetts the rule you know medical marijuana now\nBut a lot of the medical marijuana distributor or certain now applying for ... marijuana marijuana can afford medical purposes could be used a pill form with us you had mentioned just a chemical that will\nHelp but it's really a big scam because it's based the ins and billions of dollars [laughter]\nWell it says ... marijuana going on right now\nThe state to get some of that though because those people are going to spend their money anyway I like for instance here in in the in the Michigan ballot initiative they're going to have a ten percent tax on marijuana assessed on the retailers and that's on top of the regular six percent\nSales tax and they're going to split that revenue between K. through twelve schools in road projects so I mean at least at least you're getting some money from that is that helpful\n[laughter] that is held full blooded exactly what you're saying ... percent taxes on marijuana what's happened and why should a kid spend an additional ... percent\n[laughter] you go to the gang members here in Massachusetts or gang wars going on now to get the marijuana sales\nSo why pay twenty percent more get it from a gang member so it's on the black market it's crazy that that's happening here why go to a recreational store get it from the uh local gang member\nWell I don't I don't have a lot that the one of the benefits of legalizing it is that the price would actually be lower which would drive and the drug dealers out of business so they would have less than scientists\nDo didn't correct that's why there's gang war is now it get marijuana twenty percent lower\nThan just going to happen on law and all kinds of consequences for a flight market and\nBy the white Ninety nine percent of heroin opioid addicts started off with marijuana are not good and for the world it's worse than cigarette smoking ...\nGoing to pay for all along and stuff that's going on\nNow is that there's ... forgot comparison because I don't know how much people are smoking marijuana these days but I mean\nIn high school or high school here in Gardiner fifty percent of the kids are smoking\nNow but you're not smoking twenty or thirty joined some day like it wouldn't be doing with cigarettes I was a point I was making I don't want to hear that comparison I'm always wondering how they make that comparison because you don't smoke twenty or thirty joints a day\nOr ... or however you ingested you might do it once maybe twice if you're a real pot head but I don't I don't know that that would have the same effect as a Carson costs engine carcinogens\nDoes over long term it does okay there's more carcinogenic type stuff and getting the marijuana joint\nCannot be taken out by the way ... sorry\n... do you know if that can be taken out because it seems like the problem with cancer and cigarettes there's a lot of the stuff that they put in it not necessarily\nThe sure I'm sure it could be taken out but it's not ... it would cost too much to take the stuff out\nTo to actually you know put the chemicals or whatever to take that stuff up see\nAnyway it's a big problem we're getting the kids that are buying from gang members now and that's why the gangs all across the country look into it are starting to have battles for their turf\nWorld but you know that's something again I guess we uh you know we need to hear that because otherwise we would not know especially in places and what's the status of Massachusetts right now I'm legally\nLegally the recreational marijuana they hug identified to testing labs therefore it'll be rolled out the next month than recreational marijuana after that\nYou know it's still startling I was telling a producer David it was the only other day that uh uh you know in in the district of Columbia recreational marijuana is legal and I was walking down Wisconsin Avenue here of around the corner from our studios and somebody walk\nSmoking marijuana and I'm old enough for that still shocked me because I'm thinking oh I Hope it doesn't help to know police are on this guy's going to get busted and then I remember what your legal now it just seems very strange smell pot smoke in the

who've taken precautions you need to protect yourself and Albert is with us on the\nClark Howard show oh Albert how you doing Hi Clark pleasure to talk to I've been saying for many years well great to have you here\nBut thank you [laughter] um I've got a a high end luxury automobile that I've had for twenty four years and ah I watched you to push it down to about\nEighteen thousand five hundred dollars but there's been a real collector craze for this car even though it's a ... ... is that right at forty thousand dollars and I literally\nWait wait what did that luxury vehicle costs to buy new in Nineteen eighty eight\nAnd Nineteen eighty eight I bought it for that I'm Sorry in Ninety three I bought it for thirty five I understand in eighty eight fifty thousand\n[noise] so now you fast forward the clock and now it's getting back to what it originally cost all those decades ago\nIt actually it it hit a low of Eighteen five ... about three or four years ago\nThe crazy and people started collecting them like let some of them I say it's actually\nWorks like forty six but I'm just going to sell it for forty but I'm looking at offers from a New York and North Carolina and a ... but I don't know how what is a safe way to get payments some of these people\nWire transfer just to our transfer\nCashier's check means nothing\nOkay and so we have two sides of this let's say you were calling me as the buyer and New York and you're trying to ah [noise] you're trying to buy the vehicle and I'd say well\nYou got to be really careful buying cars how do you know it's really and the condition the sellers telling you how do you know Albert's not playing games with you I you know you really human owns one and all that so this is an area where when people buy [noise] I'm old collectors cars\nFrom across the country it's a very difficult process to protect yourself why do people do it by going through the ... motors platform [noise] and I I actually sold a vehicle that was in high demand for several years ago ... motors and\nThis guy bought it from me from Fifteen hundred miles away sight unseen [noise] pay me through a the ... motors platform which ultimately was pay pal\nGot my money [laughter] they showed up with a um with the car transfer service and my vehicle went on its way\nAnd so it is it is one of those things where there's a level of trust that needs to be involved but anybody who says cashier's check\nWhere cashier checks used to be the gold standard now they're full scope [noise]\nMy wife was concerned that if I gave a papal routing numbers in my account numbers and steps that there might be some way to reach back into their ... hurt us later I guess that's an issue\nThat is possible that is called at all but with a wire ... that's when you do a C H [laughter] okay [laughter] if you do a wire transfer\nThe wire transfers operate that would be much more difficult thing for somebody to move on and try to get the money but it is true with a C H\nI say I didn't know there was a defense\nSo with a\nAutomated clearing house and all the AC eight system is one that has risk [noise] all the way around and those risks are greatly reduced when the wire transfer\nOkay if it's local people some of them were talking about but we had the same bank and we can go into the back together and do that is that a lot of good idea\nThough that actually can be just fine so if you were to to ah meet someone at their bank branch she sat down with one of those people those overpriced S. [noise] and a brand and as a witness in doing the bills sail ship to copy says bills sail\nThan they issue you pay cashier's check hindsight at the bank and it's one of the bank officers doing it [noise] that's money you can trust [laughter]\nOkay so that's a that's a good point I I Can't just signed a title and handed it to make up a bill of ... bills a sale\nSo when the bill a sale they they don't have to be anything\nAh of ultra formal but what you do a bill a sale is that what is your name as seller name and address and the name and address the buyer\nThe number of this luxury vehicle and a description you know miles that kinda thing [noise] purchase price and then you eat sign both copies of knew each keep one copy at some point in for you it wouldn't be with the type of vehicle you're selling\nBut often with a run of the meals used vehicle if it's later used in a crime or the person who buys it never registers it in their own name bin and everybody's coming to you saying hey wait wait\nYou're the one responsible for this this vehicle still shows registered to you right and that's where the bill a sale is an important piece of evidence is not approved protection in a situation like that but it is a layer of protection [laughter]\nOkay well let's let's ... appreciate you taking the time to stimulate direction\nPan Am so impressed that you held on long enough that

give her the flexibility of being at home with your young son can bring in a world away income\nSo we we actually talk to them about that and are just she's um she's in finance um and painting and and it just wasn't any opportunities like that um they invited her to come back on sale she wants to re enter the workforce but they just don't have any cars are shows like that available right now\nAll right you said you said some and key there her expertise is in finance and banking is that right\n[noise] yeah correct um\nI Wonder if there's anything go ahead and\nOpening new lines of credit

you off and followers to Facebook dot com slash Clark Howard [noise]\nSo the rumors were through the nation's biggest bad bad seller has now filed for bankruptcy mattress from and they're going to close hundreds of stores possibly before they're done in the thousands of stores\nAs the way people by a mattress is going through such a massive change one of our staffers bought a car\nBecause I notice is the I Am us mattress bed or heavy sellers on Walmart dot com and Amazon dot com\nAnd he said it's just the greatest that the mattress is fantastic queen size on Amazon today it's two hundred twenty eight dollars\nBond Walmart one hundred Ninety nine dollars yeah\nAnd I'm so these things move around in price a lot of time but the point is what Casper started\nThe idea of ... pressing a mattress so could fitness smaller box that you could have delivered right to your door by\nA traditional delivery service like fed ex or UPS instead of waiting for some mattress company to come with the big truck and deliver your mattress the ability for you to go into Costco wholesaler Sam's Club\nAnd buy a mattress in a box that you could just put in the back they're all designed this is so funny they're all designed to be able to get on the back seat of a Honda Civic\nBut that's like the classic example of the size they have to be in order for you to be able to\nAnd these things home they're special instructions with all these competitors about how you open the box and how you release the mattress and then it takes shape and it kind of blows up right before your eyes\nAnd the all these mattresses although the exact policy may vary company to company but typical policy whether you buy from a direct seller you buy from one of the big boxes you buy from ah any third party you generally you have\nUsually a three month period to reject the mattress for any reason and get a full refund\nAnd the mattress business is one that had really been stuck\nIn a very uh sleazy era for a long time the mattress business often referred to as a step worse than buying a used car\nAnd the reason is is it there was very high pressure you could never figure out the models you could never figure out the quality the pricing a it was a terribly difficult thing to buy one then you'd spend\nA huge amount of money on something and if he hated it you are stuck with it so then this business model of buying one sight unseen but with the unconditional white for a period of time to return it is taking more and more market share by the week\nAnd the traditional way of buying mattresses will not become irrelevant but it will become only one possibility out of many ironically enough Casper\nIs now opening actual physical stores\nSo that people who want to go see one in person before they buy it can do that just a small number of them very much like ... Parker is done with eye glasses but ... Parker first was only on line and now has physical stores\nAre but not a lot of those either but for people who want to go see frames and get a sense in person they can go do that\nAnd so this idea just like Harry's the razors originally only on line now you'll see displays and I think target stores of Harry's\nAnd it doesn't take a lot of market share to disrupt the way in industry works with the Gillette has been absolutely beaten into a pope\nAnd the market place by the online sellers particularly dollar shave club who has affected them so much even though the online sellers now account for only a little more than ten percent\nOf the razor market the mattress market somewhere ten to Fifteen Percent\nAnd sector after sector people who come up with the simple fact way to sell\nStart sure surge policy genius dot com\nAnd just two minutes you can compare quotes and make an informed decision for you and your loved ones policy genius the easiest way to compare and by life insurance\nDid you ever look at the scenes in your coffee cup and then realized that's exactly what happens to your teeth power swamps is the five minutes\nSolution to get your teeth white without visiting the dentist this is John Green the c._e._o. of Paris swabs in a few teeth or Spain for coffee tea or smoking all it takes five minutes with power swabs in five minutes you'll see an average of two shades wider teeth and in Seventy six shapes its clinically proven to white natural\nTeeth as well as caps engineers the secret is it to the church and that was developed by Dr Martin ... that live stains off of your teeth best of all there is no matter the strip search trees that you have to leave in your mouth burn our just rub your teeth for five minutes and you're done to try and parents rubs risk free call one eight hundred six seven\nEight nine ... nine six nine that's one eight hundred six seven nine nine six nine I guarantee you're black or white smile will have your friends talking about how great you look try which free today one eight hundred six seven eight nine ... nine six nine one eight hundred six seven eight nine ... nine six nine\n\nI'm Joe ... number twenty to discount tire Ford Mustang under inflated tires put your car out of it properly\nInflated and maintain tires here tired can be in sync and ready to try and keep your car humming along smoothly by checking tire pressure each month before every long journey you enjoy it better I better gas mileage and get the most out of your tires\nFor more information visit the tires march or a message from the rubber Manufacturers Association [noise] everybody we our lady in a balance before every show we practice has got to be prepared\nExactly and the American Red Cross point that can be prepared came prepared for that to\nMe just say three says to the red cross ready create a disaster\nSupplies kid with water food and a person to make a family communication plan I listen to a local radio senior forced to stay informed [noise] is\nThat simple to learn more visit Red Cross dot org or contact your local Red Cross chapter today thank you so much\nLike an American when your family have enough water ... react farming for cash on the farm\nWe usually ...

thank you Michelle you want to talk about the day when you don't have to go to work\nWell yeah hopefully [laughter] I'm trying to get on my ... and I'm just kind of falls much research on the local land up even more confused on your target\nAnytime you look good information on investing in saving for retirement they can get overwhelming pretty quickly and very very wise people can give very reason to advice that can be directly in conflict with each other\nFor ... that's what you found isn't it [laughter] yeah exactly correct\n[noise] well let's see if I can unwind that confusion and give you some clear direction\nOkay it sounds like a plan I'm Sorry I'm not married no kids um my husband and I have to separate towns such as what works for us um [noise]\nWe have sold our house and right now currently living in an apartment in ... is on on that I have an attack a little town\nI'm not doing anything on together we have on the market account again it just it ... at the end of next year and you're probably not money put aside for ... during a new thing for my parents are no savings upwards of let's say a twelve thousand dollars to settle on a checking account\nI Know that I come on come on get fined fined just sat there so\nI just don't know what the fact that a potential eyeing house within the next year a cable and potentially than building on I don't want to put too much and the fat and it's on ... will have access to it for the palm trunk mount ... [noise]\nAll right let's that some priorities conflicting there because you have the need to putting money into a new house at some point\nMaybe even relatively soon and then you've got the far far later they you're sitting there saying clock ticks I have no money saved for that but it's pretty much yeah right\nYeah and in fact he acts and you know it's not something that as this money and ship it ... certainly at that stage okay um I don't know the way he laughed at for the country a little down payment to start to find a different investment avenue on top of the ... my company\nOh you didn't say that how much have you been able to say than the four o one K\nI only started that two hundred dollars a month and they will put down a notch manned twenty percent of the age of ... about say Fifteen dollars right now\nOkay and how much more can you put an end that they'll still match with the twenty percent\nThat's going to be more apt to sit down and actually chat with the company about that on a contract with advocates that I Am a Lakers so that's where I felt comfortable having fifty hours a week getting taken out and the guarantee I cover that\nThat's wonderful that's great that you're doing that so the area if there's more match money available the area that you'd want to step it up just a little bit even is putting them more money into that four one K. where you work\nBecause the advantage to that the other things you might have read about you probably read about something called the raw\nThe Roth IRA mhm yeah that's generally just about the best place to put money aside for the long term but when you have an employer match that the higher priority\nBecause that's free money they're throwing in on the money that you sacrifice and you put in a you know if you can pick up more free money you talked about your savings that er during like nothing and all those years think about if you were to\nEnsure check a little bit more even if it meant you had to pull some money out of savings and every dollar you put in the four o one K through work you're getting a dollar twenty because of the employer match\nSets a twenty percent instant return on the money that you put in their first is the money you have idled discerning basically zero point zero\nRight\nIn your situation go talk to human resources or whoever personnel or whoever it is you talked to in that amount of gold but target should be to as you can afford to overtime\nTo increase the savings and that four one K. up to where you grab all the match money they'll throw your way\nOkay so I started there than if you find out you've already ceiling don't match that you've gotten all the money that you could\nThen that would be where you start looking at with some of the savings you have

to them what the need for insurance\nWill even more keeping insurers up at night is the idea that cars in the future going to be something we only use per use and we will not owned them\nAnd there's a lot of belief by people who follow the automobile industry and the insurance industry\nThat the insurance industry for autos is going to go into a steady decline and that it's not going to happen all on a day but that there will be a gradual reduction and the role of auto insurance than any of our lives so you take a combination\nOf cars but as we hit a tipping point where the majority of cars will be self driving which is probably about eight to twelve years away based on vehicle replacement cycles\nIs the majority of cars are not going to get an accidents anymore unless there's a computer malfunction\nThan the claims last from accidents is going to go way down and the whole role in place of insurance in our lives will be reduced as well\nAnd this is not some kind of pipe dream this is gonna happen\nPlease don't tell me you sell auto insurance have just ruins your day\nOh no no no I I took another myself a little bit your future and I like to answer ... that will be anything you know\nAnd the idea of having a vehicle it's yours sitting in your driveway or garage or whatever\nThat is so going to fade and the twenties you know not this decade but next decade because do you know how long the average car suicidal\nBe out of east twenty four hours\nOh I Can't imagine most of it I'm sure\nSo the numbers vary depending on whose stating at but generally it's somewhere between

says non if they started following you around a restaurant and running you out of places but that doesn't mean that people don't get to object lemon interrupted well that's your right as an American

can do it in a restaurant but you can't do it on a football field it doesn't tell you that you can't do it on a cable news you can do it wherever you want to call people mobs because they're exercising their constitutional rights is just beyond the pale well they are mobs\nLook here's the thing you don't have a ...\nHow many times we've got to go through this you don't have a right to go in a restaurant in protest you'd do not have a right to go and disturb everybody else's dinner\nYou can be thrown out of a restaurant you want to go out on the street in protest that's fine but you don't have a right to go into a man or a woman's business and disrupt their business you just don't have a right to do that nor do you have a right to protest that work\nWhich is what I've said about these idiots that are kneeling for the national anthem\nYou think well I have the right no you don't are you at work\nOkay well you don't have a right to protest at work\nYou have a right not to go to
