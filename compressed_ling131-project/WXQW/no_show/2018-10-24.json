that going at their to\nProbably didn't make I'm very happy ended up being a little bit irascible after that possibly and a bunch of his friends were gas you know with mustard gas and so as friends dying of I think he suffered from PBS deep you know and as Michael just said a little while ago one thing you gotta give Hitler credit for um Hitler killed Hitler\nSo that's pretty good somebody had to do it and this guy continues\nHitler served honorably in the military Trump didn't Hitler was faithful to his wife Trump cheated on all his wives now\nTechnically I think it's true that Hitler was faithful to his wife but there is a little bit of a loophole there is that there's an asterisk you see he married her in a bunker in Nineteen forty five about forty hours before they both murdered each other or committed suicide murdered themselves so\nIt's kind of you know if Trump it only been married for forty hours I think they probably would have been before committing suicide Witt says loving wife ...\nPerhaps that would have been as your study says Hitler wrote a book Trump's world ghost written\nYeah he wrote yeah he wrote a book yeah mine ... mine struggle I I don't I don't think I Would go there with that yeah yeah\nAnd then he wrote on his Twitter this a regular fake Republican on CNN and MSNBC immigrants are Trump's Jews give him time we're only up to Nineteen thirty

complicated [noise] so how much money are you thinking of for each child\nWho was like ... like I don't know\nVery open my own life for like almost twenty five ... ...\nSo you got a Thirteen year old you would want to have that money or white page\n... years by hand\nTen years from now [noise] okay so I'm going to give you some crazy suggestions\nOkay Oklahoma\nYou're ready for crazy I'm Ronnie\nBecause I'm always nervous about putting money in a kid's name because as precious as our kids are when they're young we don't know exactly how mature they're going to be and responsible once legally they have access to money\nSo now live in a Thirteen year old Seventy year old and one is going to be one soon you are in a position now with the custodial accounts you get to make all decisions\nBut once said she was considered to be adulthood which is actually often before kids mature enough to make good decisions with money to pay and find out the money's there they have the ability to take control of it and spend it on things that you've worked hard to save you might not be able to control\nSo you're ready for my weird suggestion I recommend long you've heard me talk about Ross IRAs\nAnd found\nIs that something that you and your husband do\nWay down right now on hold out we didn't have any any only that but more ... more than ... came back around and like you have a point where on the identical that for a house of clay and ...\nAll right so let me tell you the beauty of using the Ross is a way that's safe for your kids\nYou control what now and in the future and everything they accounts earn they earned tax free so your intention is to give a decent amount of money to each of your children ah it sounds like and maybe mid twenties\n... long red ball on\nWell I feel like they're ready for it\nRight so you maintain a hundred percent control if you and your husband each fun Ross\nUp to age fifty or each allowed to put in up to fifty five hundred dollars a year into these after age fifty sixty five hundred each anyway you can size soccer away enough money over these years moving forward that you can fully put money aside\nThey will meet what your goal our goals are for these three kids but see here's the beauty you can only give them what you've contributed to the earnings stay behind with you\nAnd say they're all grown out till you would need the money and retirement\nSo it becomes like a partial retirement account for you with completely tax free growth you maintain complete control all the money\nAnd when you're ready for them to have the money you've contributed on their behalf you can give it to your Thirteen year old ten or so years from now and have it be a completely tax free event\nIf you don't think you're a Thirteen year olds mature enough at that point you want to wait a couple more years you wait a couple more years but you completely are in charge because it's your account your money\nSort of the loop hole with a raw is the money that is earning a Ross has three left aside 'til age you're fifty nine and a half or older but the money you contribute to the raw here for you to use for any purpose at any time\nBomb bomb bomb bomb out on ...\nOn if you walk on Clark dot com I have a very simple guide for you to set up a rough and you'll know exactly what to do math is with us on the Clark Howard show Hi Matthew hey how are you All right thank you you got a question for me about the stock market\nA year or so I'm a college student and I had taken out some money from much alone that subsidized loan and places like Mark it into a some well known stocks\nAnd um was wanting to use that money to um I guess have\nAccess to the dividends to those games and so I Want to know what your thoughts on uh is is too risky I'm a college student and I would I Would there be a better place or for that money for that to loan money\nSo you have the ability to borrow a under the federally subsidized loan program where there is no interest paid until six months after you graduate interest starts right\nSo this is free money\nBut the question I Would ask you if we had a a tough spot in the stock market you've put this money and the stocks that you borrowed\nAre you prepared to deal with the consequences if that money is not there when you're out of school and you've got to pay back\n[noise] uh yeah yeah it's it's not it's not too much to where I couldn't handle fan of that I'm close to my education right now I'm I'm expected of an school for another uh two years\nIf you are comfortable with the risk and you wouldn't lose any sleep if you lost the money then this is essentially borrowing money at no cost okay but\nI had this question I should tell you over the years I've had this question at least half a dozen times from people who have borrowing authority that they don't need to use under the federal student loan program\nYou got to really do check with yourself that you're gonna be okay if let's say you put a few thousand you do in a few thousand each year and the stock market\n[noise] right right like uh I've just started that\nUm [noise] and I've ... I've got a bar lovely four thousand dollars and have invested those and to um like I said well known stops\nAll right let's say let's just say we have a real serious decline in the market and four thousand two years from now is worth only two\nAnd you're going to owe the four thousand are you going to hate yourself or you say oh well it's okay I knew what I was risking and I'm willing to cough up\nThe two thousand as I'm going to have to\n[noise] um I'm thinking that as a whole year's progress that they will be a good idea for me to kind of started\nSaving for a case something does happen by the end of that I'm Around\nSo let me tell you the way I always look at this and that's what's the worst case scenario would have been worse that can happen is am I prepared for that if you psychologically um and practically\nHave a strategy that if the market does not do well\nThere you can handle the borrowing you're doing because in the scheme of life it's not an enormous amount of money you're talking about borrowing for stocks even though borrowing to buy stocks always makes me nervous if you've really thought through that and how much riskier willing to take\nGo for it you learn more about stock investing by doing it but I Would not treated as a lifelong practice\nOr when money to buy stocks known as margin I find that to be a very risky thing you're listening to the Clark Howard show\nI meteorologist John load are with the news by first alerts dorm to\nProtect the u._k. are genius five I'm Devin Walsh and early morning hit and run leaving their dad I'm left town I can the man's been identified as forty six year old Jody ...

Clark Howard show we're learning ways to keep more of what you make a big push coming out of Washington and require drug manufacturers in these crazy came here and say you do for drugs\nTo disclose him the ads what prescription actually cost for the drugs and the pharmaceutical companies are going\nCrazy like what in the world are you thinking why would we ever want to tell anybody that those beautiful models running through a beautiful setting where the backdrop of magnificent mountains are lakes or oceans or whatever they're smiling year to year well their commentator says\nMay cause your right arm to fall off her may cause you to have a really sad suicidal thoughts or whatever\nDavid Lazarus or the Los Angeles times\nHas written recently about\nThe proposal from Washington that the pharmaceutical companies post prices and what's your perspective on this about having to disclose that those smiling people for taking a drug that would cost you two thousand dollars a month or whatever\nWell first let's get a little credit for at least lighting hydro as something that he's concerned about and in the campaign has repeatedly return to this and even the drug companies are getting away with murder when it comes to pricing but that\nSaid he has offered no significant maneuver\nWhatsoever to lean in drug pricing and what we got out of these ministry last week was simply a proposal that along with all those crazy side effects that get listed what we see ads for prescription myth on TV [laughter] drug company also has to include the list price of the drug and the intent\nHere now the ministry says is to shame and the companies\nTo bring these prices down because so many of these prices are in fact\nIndefensible oh there's a bunch of problems to this first of all what price would they put in the list price which nobody pays the actual price of the wholesale price that's clear a bigger problem is the drug industry to look at that and said\nWe don't think so and then they turned out the first amendment and said you can't compel us to say things we do ... and I put out so called to some constitutional lawyers to say is that true I mean they've got a list all the side effects can't they also be forced to list the price and the lawyer saying now it looks like\nYou can make a case from the government's point of view to coerce speech if there was a public interest or public health or safety involved and that's why you do get the requirement for all the side effects but it would be very difficult\nFor the government to argue that there is a public interest in simply shaming these guys with the scarlet letter of having to publicize their prices\nAnd so the lawyers are saying you know what the drug industry is going to take this all the way to the Supreme Court\nWhere they will probably win citizens\nUnited environment where to draw the oil business has never had more rights and more power and the upshot of is his first of all this is a fight there for the government isn't the way to win and second of all if the drug industry has forced to litigate yes what they'll just pass those costs us\nSo much go to the core or something and this is something I've heard from several doctors but this is very frustrating to them with the with the ads for these pharmaceuticals on TV because they all have patients come in\nAnd they're already pre sold dog\nI Want you to write me a script for blah blah blah because I saw it it's going to do all these miraculous things suddenly I'm going to look like those people on the TV and addition to curing white males me\nAnd so the perspective I've gotten from physicians is that we're the problem more than anything else we're allowing ourselves to be too influenced by these ads running on TV\nYou know I've heard the same but it's also it's important to remember that at this point\nIn the U.S health care system it's all about turnover or Catholic patient in healthcare terms which means they got to get you into the office and out of the office as fast as possible so if a patient is digging in his or her heels and said I Want the drug X Y Z and I'm not gonna take no for an answer

here without down at the Olympic hindrance along the things I mean I'm thirty six I'm not really like had a four one K. until now so I Want to do what I can\nTell you I've got a lot of new responsibilities on you all at once\nRight yes I mean with the new job things are going well I'm not really in a bind at all I'm making more money because of the new job I mean I'm not saying you know late by any means but I was just on the one that I should do\nWell if you're just if you if this is your starting point of saving for retirement you want to do as as much as you possibly can stomach financially so in the ... did they offer a match for you've gone to work\nThey start off at six percent and then they build from\nThere and I think it I Can't remember right now with the cop out is but I Know they start off at six books or whatever you got it\nRight so you want to put in as much money as you can to pick up all the free money they're going to give you write and do you know are you offered the option of doing what's known as a raw four one K. or as anybody mentioned that do you are you're only allowed to do traditional four one K.\nThey give me all kinds of options that traditional are are either off our or a nurse and I think\nThey were actually trying to show a rough four O. one K. right right right yeah so I I Am thirty six I Would go a raw four one K.\nMoney the employers matching will be a put down the traditional side but money you contribute goes on the wrong side and if they keep raising what tell match based on how much you put in\nI Want you to go as far and as you can putting money into that raw four one K. C. pick up every single dollar\nThe employer will throw at you and if overtime they'll throw more money at you you increase what you contribute and end the plan there will be if I'm gathering investing is new for you is that right\nYeah I had just basically started with the ... program before I transferred into my new job so I've only ... you know I'm only dabbled with just a little bit ... you know the employer now they seem like they're offered them pretty here do if I wanted\nTo see him around and around every bit of it that they're giving you free money and then as far as an investment choice at least at first keep it as simple as possible and one of the choices you'll likely have as well as soon as a target retirement fund\nAnd based on your age it thirty six you would want to look at uh twenty fifty five so that would be the year they would be your target for retired ...\nAnd and so you just put all the money you're going to contribute ended at twenty fifty and they'll handle how it's invested for you in a variety of things that would be appropriate for you being at this stage of saving for retirement\nSo congratulations to you again on Nora and best to you in this new job and stashing that cash for your\nLong term future and you're listening to the Clark Howard show [noise]\nWritten outcry when did it become OK for men to be lazier softer fatter\nWe need to bring them into this country back to greatness with aids list male Macs a patent pending formula with an ingredient that helps boost your total testosterone promoting greater increases in muscle size and twice\nThe reduction of body fat percentage that exercise alone plus and amazing sixty four percent increase in nitric oxide which can be handy in the gym and in the bedroom\nTake your manhood to the max by try your first dirty diaper bottle free not ten days not Fifteen days ... full thirty days supply free when you text the word quick\nTo Seventy nine Seventy nine Seventy not\nJust pay shipping and handling filing a formula that boost total testosterone if you'll results with ageless male ... to a test please decreased use for your free bottle text quick\nTo Seventy nine Seventy nine Seventy not taxed Q.

older car about fourteen years that I've driven pretty much in the ground [laughter]\nYou our solar clan that has taken brilliant you that [laughter] 'cause you know are there was a guy who used to do personal finance job\nWho ran the numbers and figured out that if you will keep the cars that you drive the vehicles you drive on average if you buy a new one keep it ten years or ...\nFor changing nothing else in your life that that one thing of of keeping vehicles along time allows you to retire five years sooner\n[noise] well I hadn't heard that that I Am I I'm\nNot even close to\nThat point I really try savings and all that so [laughter]\nBut think about the whole you would have buried yourself if you got new vehicles like so many people do every three or four or five years\nRight right and and either fighting loyal to lie and now they're now [laughter]\nAnd you said this one is Thirteen or fourteen years old right wow\nWell you have you have earned the right and this one's breaking down to jump\nIn and get something else [noise] you know I feel about that ...\nWho you're hoping to have it for my daughter but ... transmit shouldn't have gone and when you replace it with an older and a couple of years ago [noise] so I'm Wondering how we can still get any money out of it\nWithout putting another transmission on their chest care salad\nSo what would it cost to replace the transmission\nOh who are fingering even for an old years trying it would probably end up around they can get to your town\nAnd do you know if you looked up to see approximately what the vehicles worth your ... on that one show\nI had thought about it but I haven't done it yet I thought maybe it might have been might have great I'm poking around three thousand\nSo this is gonna sound weird to you but if you can fix the transmission for somewhere a little less around two thousand dollars and it truly would be worth three thousand\nI Know this is nuts but the math says it would be worth fixing it and then having your daughter Dr\nOkay maybe\nDownloading and getting on right on\nYeah I wouldn't do that and you got so little for it because the reason is is that and this is this is something I'll tell you my for me I'll tell you what Consumer Reports says my formulas been when the value of a vehicle\nIs such that the cost of a repair exceeds fifty percent of its remaining value and the example you gave\nIf it really is worth three thousand dollars and it costs you more than Fifteen hundred to put in a new transition transmission I'd say dump it but Consumer Reports ran the numbers and they said that's ridiculous but if you can repair a vehicle\nAnd even and again the cost of the repair its last remaining value say anything less than three thousand\nYou're better off repairing it and driving it you know even if you get just several months out of it you are still ahead of the game\nOkay\nNow as far as the way you would do for yourself whether you choose to repair it or not and there are two things you've got to find out before you do at first what would it really costs to replace that transmission\nAnd then second what's it really worth it he may decide even if those numbers still look like you to repair it you're just on whether that for fourteen years that's fine\n... many times there will be a shop that will buy it from you because they're getting a vehicle for a deal and then they put in a transmission that their cost and then they've got instant transportation or good price\nWell rather question why is she now why would there be a chance for a long time telling it and then courting\nYes certainly there are all somebody in the business because they wouldn't make sense for anybody other than somebody who knew how to do that kind of work and could do everything on the cheap\nYeah\nHow do they have you were to sell it find repaired they may be your best potential customer there would be worth much more than donating\nOkay\nBut as far as ... sang it what are you thinking would you go brand new or would you buy a middle age he used vehicle or what what do you think would be as you said you're actually\nLooking at a at a ten year old ... upper level car that haven't that life expectancy throw\nYou in my producer Joe or probably related and don't realize that\n[laughter] 'cause that's how he buys vehicles\nWell it kind of that Saturday work is not in a position came much else\nBut what's great if you buy a vehicle that it's ten years old may have very little market value left but potentially have a great deal of mileage still to run\nFor her\nAnd so uh if you don't have mechanical knowledge yourself even though you have to lay out money to do it if you're looking at a vehicle ten years old try to keep it one that's got a hundred and twenty five thousand miles on it somewhere in that range\n... eighty five\nEighty five thousand miles that's wonderful as long as it checked out by a mechanic if we're choosing that sounds like a very smart use of your money\nOkay\nAnd I hope that it gives you many years of reliable transportation moving forward Peter is with us on the Clark Howard show high paid\nCall Eli I'm great thanks I Hope everything's wonderful in your life\nBecause a lot cause ... tablet cause ... for a while\nBut like a sort of like credit meaning as the logo on it and your base are so ... ... ...\nYeah calling the trash fake visa\n[laughter] yeah pets are sworn in for one thing I can also at school and it was ... and asked me about it well and\nThere is no such thing because the protections you are afforded with a piece of trash bag fees are fake MasterCard which is a these are mass card debit card that attacks here checking account or the credit union your equivalent to share draft account the problem is is that federal law\nDoes not give you the same protections so as an example of the one place you never want to use a debit card is buying anything on line or anything you're gonna get later because if they don't deliver it\nYour bank or in your case your credit he says that's just too bad feet because you know that was like a check you wrote and it doesn't matter they didn't deliver your out your money where the credit card you're protected for failure to deliver goods or services\nIn the event that somebody compromises your number or your card\nWith a credit card generally your liability is zero but in any circumstance is max that fifty dollars with a debit card your liability under federal law is generally five hundred dollars minimum up to a maximum of every penny that send your account\nNow a number of visa and MasterCard issuers have said they are are following an administrative rule where your liability is kept it either zero or fifty dollars for a debit card but they don't have to do that\nOh look at all is not there to protect you you're depending on the kindness of the financial institution to do that\nAnd then the other thing is if somebody steals your account number you're in possession your card even if they see on your card whatever where they credit card no money leaves your hands you know it's just a charges posted you tell them that's not your charge and that's it\nAfter you do the paperwork but with with a debit card money disappears who your checking account and then you have to fight with your credit union or your bank to get the money back\nOther than that they're great which I didn't leave anything else for them to be great you're listening to the Clark Howard show\nSeville weekdays to ban but six six things that\nTo seven nine

guy all over the place I'm sure you track this guy down saying who gave you the mom you know ... or maybe he was the one who uh built the bomb who knows\nBut if it is a Trump supporter water a flipping idiot what us a flip and maybe it either way\nI mean no doubt this is just beyond the pale whoever's doing this kind of stuff see this is exactly what we're trying to avoid in this country is is the rancor and hatred elevated at this level\nOn both sides on\nBesides now what if Trump comes out and says we wanna we wanna tamped down the anger on both sides how dare you this is definitely one of your people they heard your speech the other night when you when you were talking about being a nationalist\nThat's what it was you know somebody what was it was something that Trump said I Believe yesterday\nThat somebody a blamed that well that's what they did that that triggered him yesterday they said you got to have been doing this for weeks if not months planning this thing figuring out where these people are how to get the bombs to them and the rest of them and it's not like oh Trump said something yesterday morning at a rally I think I'll go make some bombs today and send them out\nI don't think it happens that way folks and this is a concerted effort on somebody's part to do something it could be somebody trying to do what I don't know whether you know to me they didn't go off which is really odd or if they were trying to kill these folks they're a very lousy terrorists\nIt seems to me that either somebody well somebody's trying to influence the election and

if he did and I haven't said anything to incite people to violence I've been just the opposite I'm trying to get the violence out of all this stuff [noise]\nAnd see anything else you need to know well there'll be a more developments obviously\nI Hope they can figure out who this is a pretty quickly Trump condemning the act president\nBriefed on this suspicious packages sent to Hillary and Obama

gentlemen and we'll put a link to this to the second coming of thriller and the shroud series and he's on the line to check whether it's about this\nJohn how are you I'm great how are you I'm doing very well now I've I've often said\nThat um you know we were you know we had a good Charles crowd him or when he was alive he referred to Trump as a voter Gary and which I thought it was quite describe\nA quite descriptive of of the president but he is a lot like Ronald Reagan in many ways as far as cutting taxes things the one he's just more like a bull in China shop visiting on\nYeah it's a pretty well put Philly yeah you know you couldn't find two\nMen Reagan and Trump more different in terms of their style the way they go about the world but um but it it's a it's absolutely a fact I mean Reagan nights of become Trump bites a Trump just takes one page after another out of the Reagan play book from a policy perspective and a lot of people like that including myself\nYeah okay well then let's talk about some of the ways they are like when you say that he's taken the things that Reagan's playbook by being his own spokesperson addressing the American people directly do you think that Ronald Reagan would've been utilizing Twitter I mean not like Trump's utilizing it you know with or space and the rest of the stuff\nBut do you think Reagan may have used them as a device to go directly to the people\nAbsolutely you know Reagan grew up in the world of communication is he went from radio to TV to film and he was always ahead of the game on\nHow best to get his message out to a so if somebody could put a device in his hand and he ... with a couple of problems reach a hundred million people direct unfiltered with his own message you Betty would now he he wouldn't have done a like Trump Reagan would've\nSent messages to the American people probably as speechwriters would have written a hundred and forty characters and Reagan would have perfected them and he wouldn't step

President Trump's hero\n'cause I got the information for you man laying on me there are documents\nFrom Congress um that specifically state it's it's the USA's obligation to protect New Mexico and ... and the Arizona from invasion this goes back there called Compaq back in the day they called them compact pickup truck\nWhen a Arizona Territory and New Mexico territory apply for statehood\nThey didn't get it the first time I had to keep re applying until they got all their ducks in a row with their\nConstitution and everything and then finally what happens when Congress says okay you're accepted into statehood they don't just spit in their arms and shake hands there's a document that says you are accepted\nAs a state and as a state you are going to recognize the federal government pledge allegiance to the United states all that good stuff\nIn return you receive all the benefits and goodies and blah blah blah and in return we will also protect you from invasion it's like one paragraph if in writing there called the cops packs\nAnd that's what that's what you got a back in the day when they accepted these two territories as a a state\nDoes in mind I don't I mean these things should be protected by the United states from an invasion and that's exactly what we're looking at\nWhat it said it early and you can't go over like Google blocked it now I've seen them but you can Google it if you go compact oh you'll get is the compact\nUm from Arizona concerning the Colorado River and how that water is going to be distributed show these documents exist in the library of Congress I don't have the um [noise] uh I don't have the ability to research that and get it but I'm telling you they exist\nAnd so when you start thinking about uh like in the border like here in New Mexico they're going to the federal government wants to take land put up the way or the parents or whatever um well guess what these documents will also help them with eminent domain to fulfill the obligation to\nProtect our borders it in writing I Can't I couldn't hear the first one was able to get a hold of to get this out if you could if you have the resources of the staff\nOr somebody that can take that up\nFor the president would love to have back because it's in writing\nNow talking notice Keller tone you have the same come back because they do will just send all these illegal to

California and I can't speak to Texas but I can tell you that Arizona and New Mexico territory the compact is almost exactly the same and\nYou're talking circa Nineteen eleven eleven Nineteen Thirteen somewhere in there when they became states\nInteresting well that should be easy to dig up shouldn't it\nIt should be and lots of time you can Google it but Google has a book that you can't you can't get it now so somebody has to actually go caught up in the library of Congress but they do exist I've seen them\nWhen we will and will check that out appreciate the tip\nOh man I'll tell you what a Mr Trump would love to have that in his hand\nWouldn't you know if they were on or even come back we're protecting these states as we said we would\nOh I Can't it's his obligation to do so [laughter] ... John ... the tip of my friend back your facts facts were less than I think you are by the way in California became a state on my birthday September ninth Eighteen fifty ...\nRight after they discover
