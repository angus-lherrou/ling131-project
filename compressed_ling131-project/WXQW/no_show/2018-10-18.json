woman who's trying to do good things millennia cannot catch a break from anybody at any point in time right in the media traits are completely unfairly\nAnd so the last day or two after the president one is a federal court case against Michael ... and a Stormy Daniels president use the term horse face that describes derby day and then when he did that\nThe media especially Brian seltzer and tapper and others is CNN went crazy melt down over the horse face common awful it was and this wasn't about a woman there so it was about women in general say what CNN artfully does is take the comments about one person\nAnd generically apply to everyone in the group because they believe in group rights group identity so\nIn this case horse face ... describes Stormy Daniels according to the president and the media had a virtual meltdown for a day day and a half on er\nAnd the president using the term horse race so described Stormy Daniels that came out a couple of days ago that TI the rapper is

you think about what is happening up in Canada\nCanada yesterday became the first major world economy to legalize recreational marijuana they're beginning what they're calling a national experiment and I love the word experiment everybody in Canada's going to be walking around wearing white lab coats with little flash lights on their heads\nAnd test tubes in their pockets this experiment that will alter the country's social cultural and economic fabric as the New York times wrote\nAn presents other nation with some challenges and some opportunities all across the country yesterday that as these government sponsored pot retailers are opening from one coast to the other Canadians we're waiting an hours in line to buy the first state approved joints and for many they said it was just like the ending of prohibition in the United states in the Nineteen thirties [noise]\nAlthough because this happened rather quickly in some parts of the country\nAre a lot of the stores a lot of the shopping had to be done online because there were no stores open yet\nAnd consumers flock to these Web sites which are run by the provincial governments and they were license to uh to buy legally despite the fact that it's going to take a few days for delivery uh to start making its way all around the country so\nThere's all kinds of interesting ramifications from this you know and some things that you might not have thought of other countries now have to decide what they're going to do\nEspecially in some of the areas where it may be illegal but you know for for a long long time poor farmers in places like Jamaica or Morocco or even in central and South America\nFarmers have been a breaking the law and dealing with gangsters to grow cannabis but it's a cash crop is one of the few things that keep some of those communities alive\nBut now the Canada becomes the the first big industrial country to legalize marijuana those countries where the crop as a traditionally been grown may start losing out because there'll be new legal markets available and so they are going to have to do something to deal with the those drug cartels and all those bandits\nAnd people who were holding people hostage almost in some of those hills mountains in those areas and now how are they going to compete with the western corporations so you know that's something to consider this is interesting in Canada I mean excuse me in Colorado\nWhere recreational marijuana is legal they are concerned about getting a brain drain and I'm not talking about the effect of marijuana I'm Talking about people who are in the business in Colorado which may be a little over saturated right now starting to send their workforce to the great white north\nUh because uh you don't have enough experience to shop owners and business people up there doing it so you know all kinds of interesting ramifications of course\nUh they're the ones that we more traditionally think of and of course that has been getting some attention also as this happened and uh so Jim rupe tells us that does some are concerned that the policy up in Canada could do more harm than good\nMichael historic day across the great white

outgoing\nGal guard\n[noise]\n\n[noise]\nRemember when the four minutes before the hour um for a slight Michael Toscano hair where you are very happy that you have joined us this morning give us a call at eight hundred seven three six three six six six because we'd like to know what you think about what is happening up in Canada\nCanada yesterday became the first major world economy to legalize recreational marijuana they're beginning of what they're calling a national experiment and I love the word experiment everybody in Canada's going to be walking around wearing white lab coats with little flash lights on their heads\nAnd test tubes in their pockets this experiment that will alter the country's social cultural and economic fabricated the New York times wrote\nAn presents other nation which some challenges and some opportunities all across the country yesterday that these are government sponsored pot retailers are opening from one coast to the other Canadians were waiting in hours in line to buy the first state approved joints and for many they said it was just like the ending of prohibition in the United states in the Nineteen thirties\nAlthough because this happened rather quickly in some parts of the country\nAre a lot of the stores a lot of the shopping had to be done online because there were no stores opened yet and consumers flock to these Web sites which are run by the provincial governments and they were licensed ... to uh to buy legally despite the fact that it's going to take a few days for delivery\nTo start making its way all around the country so there's all kinds of interesting ramifications from this you know and some things that you might not have thought of other countries now have to decide what they're going to do\nEspecially in some of the areas where it may be illegal but you know for for a long long time poor farmers in places like Jamaica or Morocco or even in central and South America\nFarmers have been a breaking the law and dealing with gangsters to grow cannabis but it's a cash crop is one of the few things that keep some of those communities alive\nBut now the Canada becomes the the first big industrial country to legalize marijuana those countries where the crop as a traditionally been grown may start losing out because there'll be new legal markets available and so they are going to have to do something to deal with the those drug cartels and all those bandits\nAnd people who were holding people hostage almost in some of those hills mountains in those areas and now how are they going to compete with western corporations so you know that's something to consider this is interesting in Canada I mean to me in Colorado\nWhere recreational marijuana is legal they're concerned about getting a brain drain and I'm not talking about the effect of marijuana I'm Talking about people who are in the business in Colorado which may be a little over saturated right now starting to send their workforce to the great white north\nUh because uh you don't have enough experience to shop owners and business people up there doing it so you know all kinds of interesting ramifications of course\nThere are the ones that we more traditionally think of and of course that has been getting some attention also as this happened and uh so Jim rupe tells us that some are concerned that the policy up in Canada could do more harm than good\nMichael ... was a historic day across the great flight north how's it going at it is the first major country second to much smaller or way to adopt a national ... policy the new law permits adults Eighteen and older to grow by possess end or use marijuana\nI just think this is a really bad idea\nThat age Eighteen says Dr Kevin ... with the group smart approaches to marijuana is the first major concern doctors\nSaid okay if you're going to do this we don't think you should but if you are at least make the age twenty five and older so it is crystal clear that as your brain is developing that should be avoided the government to listen to the doctors today marijuana is you know twenty to thirty times stronger than the Woodstock stuff it's so much more potent than it used to be it's been in\nEffect shirt to increase the strength and it affects the developing brain in many profound ways mental illness psychosis suicide motivation\nCanadians Eighteen and older convince us up to thirty grams and cultivate before plants at home right now is Dr candidates and oils available consumable will be available in legal next year smoking pot is legal in Canada anywhere tobacco can be used\nAh they were they don't want people smoking marijuana in certain buildings they are outlawing smoking entirely so now it's going to be harder to light up tobacco and a lot of public places inside the buildings in a in Canada because they don't want to go there are places where you shouldn't be having marijuana and so because of that all smoking is going to be prohibited so\nEarly in life that ... helps out jeep up dang good show anything like that so\nThat you know do what I can tell somebody\nYes that's absolutely certain All right thank you so much for the call nine minutes before they our Martin is in Kansas City this morning good morning\nBay good morning I'm law take on it is um I I don't think it's going to be a bad thing you know to legalize it everywhere and this is coming from someone who don't smoke I'm not a smoker at all the smoke or anything so\nI I think it's I think it's a ... one of the clean his drugs out there now sometimes it can it can seem pretty bad and it can you ... snake trail but um I think there's a lot of the cleaner drugs out there I think that the only reason it has been\nPlayed down in as a nasty thing and as a bad thing is because the government could make any money off of it and that's just my opinion you know\nSo it can now because now they can you know they're taxing it there the states where it's been legalized to the states are raking in millions and millions of dollars because they're taxing it\nWhy they can now but I'm saying over the years they gave it a bad name are bad looking made people turn a nose up to it because they couldn't make you know they manipulated the brain to make it a bad\nOne of the things that was a big mistake was classified it with a really dangerous drugs I mean you you start getting into\nA things like cocaine and unfettered means or heroin and the opiates those things those things are dangerous they will kill you and so when the government lumped marijuana in with those then people would actually see it in real life and realize well these drugs are nowhere near a like each other\nAnd so they figure welfare lying about marijuana they maybe they're lying about cocaine let me try that and the next thing you know\nUh you know you're lying in an alley somewhere\nYeah I mean that's true but you know it's I Would I Would blame them for you know putting that stamp on marijuana when really marijuana is like I say this is a fairly clean drug did you know and and and\nI mean physically clean because I mean you could see it I guess if something's been attitude although as I remember they sprayed this insecticide on during the Vietnam War\nOr or whatever spraying everything with this parrot clock to kill the vegetation and they got on a lot of marijuana which are soldiers smoked and then a cause severe severe health problems when they came back so I guess they couldn't see that so when you say clean what do you mean by clean\nWhat what I mean by clean is um\nDon't cause all the effects it sells you to you know you you know things started you know alcohol kills from the time it goes in your mouth\nTo the time he goes out it's killing sales now I'm not I'm not sure about I'm not sure about ... you know what all marijuana does but I Know alcohol is much worse cocaine much worse crack you know it's much\nThese things are much much worse than mirror marijuana or know now what I Will say to the listeners is\nWatch what you smoke it out of you know 'cause well enjoying the bloods what does that paper and everything made out out of by\nHand the owners are dangerous you\nGotta gotta walk towards her smoking it out of now because you're well lit up blood you know possibly you know what's your role in it up which can steal the lady called some type of lung cancer\nAnd for those who don't know those are cigars I Believe or ... or some kind of a tobacco products tells you that you're used to do that at the skies I guess the the marijuana anyway Martin thanks so much for the call we're going to move over to ...

though I've I've learned about a a thing called the financial independence which\nI think a subset of people who listen to you by would fit into that that mold and um recently or a different kind of financial spokes person I'm really came down hard on people who\nBelieve in that or I guess not really believe that choose\nTo ... ah yeah yeah he was and so I thought you know what I'm just going to reach out the clock\nAnd get a feel for what he thinks I'm about the concepts and principles behind it\nWell I've called and it's not just a term that originated with me or before the concept of the FIRE movement came along I called it max savers and the Mets fan again that term didn't originate with me the idea that if you can live on half of what you make\nAnd coming right out of school if you weren't aware of on every other check\nIt changes the entire trajectory of your life\nAnd generally by your early forties if you live on half of what you make you will have saved enough money and lived a lifestyle that will make it possible for you at that point to be completely independent financially\nAnd if you don't want to work again you likely won't have to but really it's more about you being totally in charge of the choices you make in your life you know somebody who works hard enough\nAnd sacrifices hard enough\nTo be able to um live on half of what they make\nIsn't doing it so that they never have to work again is usually so that they have the choice to do what they want to do the rest of their lives\nTo ban have you been living on a fraction of what you make since you

get into a tit for tat with Suzie Ormond but the ... but she's not the only one who really has has been um\nNot supportive of what's the al ... the FIRE movement which is financial independence retire early\nAnd it's and it's a cute phrase a cute idea\nA but it's a real idea with real stuff behind it whatever you call it whether you call it ... savor whether you call it fire or whether you just talk about the financial independence side of fire but the idea is that instead of feeling a prisoner\nTo your bills and wherever you work you're in charge and you make the choices you choose to make and so you by saving now sixty Seventy percent of what you may\nYou are in a position to be able to make the choice is you're going to make in your life and is he pile up more and more money it gives you increasing amounts of freedom to make the decisions that you want to make\nSo I'm totally supportive of you are you doing anything though that others would look at and say man bans having no fun in life because he won't even fill in the blanks\nOr know honestly I feel like I was a great life as it is over the years ... plus my wife says no I probably four or five times [laughter] um and then

to hit so badly by the hurricane recently that\nThere were there were there was like nothing left at all at this beach community in Mexico Beach Florida in one house was sitting there almost completely intact\nAnd it's so stark well I Want to tell you\nThat we have the ability to build tougher homes and the shocking thing isn't beach\nAreas the real cost is not in the structure put on a property is the land to property sits on that the structure sits on\nAnd the cost of construction doesn't have to be a huge amount higher I'm going to go way back in history to Nineteen Ninety\nI guess it was when South Florida got hit very hard by Hurricane Andrew I'm testing my memory from way back but\nWhat I Want to talk about is something that shows how important are thought process about how we build the is\nTo how ah how survives a storm of ...\nSerious types whether it's a tornado a hurricane or earthquake Sanders there are so many different situations where how you choose to build makes all the difference in doesn't necessarily have to cost a lot more because in Andrew\nThere was an area where the entire neighborhood was flat and just like the pictures\nThat you may have seen from Mexico beach and there were some homes there were sitting there looking absolutely fine and those homes happened to be habitat homes that were built\nWith volunteer labor built way beyond what was the building code at the time and employed technologies that costs virtually nothing like a little thing assignments technology so little thing called the hurricane clip\nThat a lot of habitat affiliates around the country in areas subject to tornadoes or build with hurricane clips which helps support and reinforce the structure of our home and add to the cost of a home somewhere around a hundred and twenty dollars\nAnd make a home much more robust\nAnd the case in Florida we were you a part time and a beach community in Florida and our next door neighbor as well as about oh about a dozen homes in our area\nAre built using a new construction method where the homes are built\nLike and I think this is the one in Mexico beach was the same kind of idea built with concrete and know sheet rock at\nAnd the homes are built to withstand a cat five hurricane plus\nAnd the windows may not survive they may blow out the home itself is a hundred percent structurally sound\nAnd all that has to be done is that supposed out there is no issue with mold and so the reason I bring this up is when America face an increasing problem with flooding\nFrom population growth um increase rainfall he's for in a cycle of that\nAnd much of the United states and there are so many techniques that can be used that will make homes and people in them safer make the structures more solid I went and toured\nA neighborhood and Holland is an area subject to flooding and a lot of Holland is below sea level and they now have these homes for a flood zone error prone areas that I went to see that the

people do it\nAnd I was able to explain to a point that she was comfortable that she shouldn't do the money withdraw from the four oh one K. to pay off the credit card debt and you know the most

you\nGreat thank you you want to talk about hitting the bulls eye on the retirement target\n[noise] I did tell me popper used or misused retirement and mind and I mean how strongly for that you have one drink per phone here and ethnic retirement plan time at home\nYeah yeah\nWell I wouldn't say a hundred percent or not and but the idea is that if you say you're\nBuilding a portfolio and a four one K. or you're building one and a Roth IRA or traditional i._r._a. the idea is that if you are for people aren't aware of what we're talking about a target retirement fund is where you pick a year\nKind of in the ballpark of when you expect to retire and they tend to be and five year increments like you're twenty thirty twenty forty five whatever every five years\nThat you're messing up the whole purpose of the target retirement fund if you put money into it and then still put money into other things in your retirement plan a retirement account\n[noise]\nIt's not like it's something you shouldn't do is just suggested that if the whole idea is to try to get the right mix of stuff that you're invested in that it really is only effective if you go all in on the target retirement fund\nWhere are you in your head with this and how does it affect you\nWell I have that choice in my legs but I have to take off and ... and I just had that as part of it [noise] or I'm hearing that ... or a return\nThat I Would expect they are they on average about paper last cat if I work at all and that target retirement I\nYou know I I Can't speak to whether you would have an overall lower return over the years by diversifying out from it the idea that target retirement fund is really for a different purpose is to put you in a position where you have the proper level of risk\nAt different stages of your work life and then as you get closer to retirement\nSo there's nothing that says the you taking some of your money in your four one K. and putting it in other choices there's going to get you a lower return it's even possible that could get you a higher returns but it also might fall over the years potentially more risk to you\nIn law says you could suffer at various points of your work life\nShore okay if anybody says oh putting forty percent and the target retirement fund and putting the other sixty percent and other things is going to get you a lower return that's not an accurate statement\nOkay I can answer me okay I have a great day and can't entail\nWhat's amazing with the target retirement funds is that any of a number of providers of those in a higher re Ross IRA or four one K. were offering extremely low costs on them and others offering very high costs\nOn the target retirement fund portfolio vanguard which is generally considered to be the gold standard charges typically like ... point one five of one percent\nTo point to oh of one percent\nWhere other providers may charges much is more than one percent\nFor having money in a target retirement fund that different decimate eventually how much money you'll have to live on in retirement those expenses really matter overtime\nFred is with us on the Clark Howard show hello Fred\n... thanks for all you do for us we get a lot of information from you sure do Clark or I mean contacted by Fran regarding a multi level marketing company that are promoting a digital coin and I'm not really familiar with what it'll coins are\nAnd they're talking about going public and they're not ready to show their face a and it looks like a ... game to me but I was wondering if you had any information regarding digital coin\nSo when people refer to digital coin that's generally a generic term for that one brand name that did establish itself in the marketplace called bitcoin\nAnd bitcoin is an alternative way for people to pay for things around the world\nAnd it is what's generally referred to as a crypto currency is not a government backed money is one is that is accepted based on a daily value\nThe people who are willing to buy and sell bitcoins are willing to take that value what you're calling about is not bitcoin somebody who's trying to\nTrade on that basically what is it that you would do if you were to get involved in this point in business\nI supposedly going to have to do anything you buy it and after a certain amount of money anywhere from a hundred and fifty to I don't know four five thousand dollars\nAnd then the coin is like is work like two or three cents now and it keeps the posing to rise supposedly going to rise and they're going to start a company where he can use your coin\nOkay so I Would not go anywhere close to that because first of all when somebody any of us could say today we're\nGoing to have Fred money are we going to have Clark money and I want to buy Fred money 'cause it's going to go through the roof and I'm In a safe red money is worth so much money today but I can tell you in the future you're going to make a fortune on Fred money\nYeah four o'clock money\nSo I Would tell you that having alternative payment forms is going to be part of the future but they're not designed to be an investment they're designed to be a payment platform just another way to buy and sell things in somebody's promising you're getting in on the ground\nFloor of a get rich quick thing I Would not get involved with anything like that because they're your initial you're eligible for if you do this and get other people to buy them or anything like that\nYeah you can get a commission if she can bring out other people and that's what ...\nUh and how much commission that like if you get me to buy you said a hundred and fifty dollars worth of you get me to buy a hundred and fifty dollars worth\nOf this this electronic Coyne how much do you get a commission\nAgain at ten percent\nSo you get Fifteen dollars and then whoever is putting this together gets a hundred and thirty five\n... uh evidently\nAnd the whole product is this supposed that money that you're supposed to trust and that doesn't actually exist yet to be used to buy and sell things\n\nThat's that's the story\nOK I Would tell you don't even think about getting involved in that because that is there is no true product\nOr service this being sold if it's just speculation that at some point people will be able to use these electronic coins and that sounds to me like that could very dangerously ended up being an illegal pyramid\n\nThe only game of chance so unless you are somebody who really love is the whole\nThe gambling do you live to

go on what's going on in the [laughter]\nWe got some lunatic up there on the stage and he's just going off about\nMoney are paying the whole story if you haven't heard that well by the way if I Would assume that the ... tax revolt as is available on a on can do I don't know I mean I haven't\nI haven't circle back around without a long time but I Would assume that's its own Kendall it's probably pretty cheap\nBut the hardcover is out there to say is no audio book we should do that but anyway\nIf you use the new folks in Tennessee who probably lived this you folks outside of the tendency didn't live this but it's an amazing story or really boils down to have the most about five thousand folks who would show up in protest over an income tax and we did the horn honking and people would circle the [noise]\nThe capital capital bow their horns and it was me and several other talk show host they got up and sort of banded together you know let the rivalries fall by the way for the moment so that we could do what we needed to do it is among Kendall OK\nSo a tax revolt if you ever want to read this it centers on what we've been in Tennessee but it also brings in\nThe you know tax revolt throughout history and sort of ties them altogether only two Ninety nine only two Ninety nine good grief by the book by the bullet Guinness tax revolt is the name of it while you're on ... I think you'll be inspired by it because what I told him I said look\nMost people have this going on oh I Can't make a difference oh it doesn't matter that is when it comes to ... time to vote audio and it does I'm telling you we had no more than five thousand people I think that was the top ... we had at any of these protests and most times it was several hundred and folks that were there and\nThat Changed History for the state so I talk about you know another famous tax revolt you're of the Boston Tea party so how many of those guys were there\nTwelve maybe\nWhat kind of impact that have on the United states twelve people or whatever you know feel like there was plenty to whatever you know what I'm saying a handful of folks who had the gumption to go up there and throw a bunch of team the harbor because they were upset about the\nTaxing and the and the rest of it you you see what happens when a bunch of folks band together to do the right thing\nAnd so I was the lead that into this time they were living and I said look because they told me before you know we got some Democrats are they so you know try not to upset them to I said look this is not\nThis is not a partisan issue\nWhether you want him to tax cuts that we got from Trump or not we got him and this is what we've got we've got a roaring robust economy and instead of sitting around and denying it or not\nWanting to be successful you need to be taking advantage of it because this is a unique time in American history we may never see this again this is unprecedented\nNuts and I'm not saying that we haven't had great times before and I'm not saying that times\nHave been better at some point you know we we see unemployment at like a fifty year low that tells you that unemployment was lower you know some time prior to that I don't know but I Will tell you this back in Nineteen sixty nine when the unemployment with Islam that we have Twitter Facebook the Internet uh apps\nSilicon Valley and we have any of this we had none of this you folks who are in the record business you know this I mean we didn't you know we had I tune you can go straight to the public talking about books you can publish your own book you can put it on Amazon and you can sell it\nIf you want to\nIf you have if you have the drive to do it\nMy point on all this is forget about who's taking credit for it we know who's taking credit for Donald Trump and engage justifiably so but don't let that keep you from taking advantage of one of the most unique times in history to be an entrepreneur\nEven you liberals that they should understand this this is a unique time those same was true but in the end or forget about all that just get out there and do it if you've got an idea and make it work again I caution you don't take your life savings and throw it into some ...\nI mean you've got and then come back and blame me when it doesn't get off the ground I'm just saying\nThis is the time for ideas\nBecause people have now more disposable income and they've had a long time the economy is growing like crazy the optimism we keep seeing these stands\nTo optimism at an all time high optimism in the ... when another story yesterday I mean it's a daily they lose obese types of surveys of how people are just so excited about what's going on I'm telling you it ain't going to last forever\nIs not going to be Trump's fault probably is just the cyclical thing that happens in the economy\nWe don't stay in this boom mode forever at some point we must now I Would suggest to you that some of that has to do with the fed but that's a whole different discussion the fact of the matter is we're not changing that dynamic right now and you've got to understand you've had a window to operate in\nSo if you've ever

know because Trump was leaving your preparing to go to a Montana so he may have been upstairs and the residents back or something who knows [noise]\nBut ah whatever the deal is they apparently calmed down but it doesn't change the situation the situation is as it is we've got a caravan of these people coming across record number of illegal families crossing the border now\nAnd this is from ah ... L. M. T. on line a record number of families crossing U. S. borders Trump Britain's new correct about he's talking about sending to the military to the border\nNow when other presidents have done that based in the military down there and they're sort of like spotters or they don't really do anything or they're handing out meals or whatever the water it's ridiculous I think when Trump talks about sending the military aides to crack down\nOn the people coming across in other words set up a perimeter on the border and don't let these people across\nAnd that's exactly what to examine shorter boil it man see blows you don't want to wall then we'll just put the military down there on the border let them conduct their exercises nobody gets in it's an invasion of your crossing the border we look at it as an invasion and and and and you will be treated accordingly\nAs an invader we assume you're going to do us harm\n[noise]\nWhat else they're saying this thing the U.S border patrol agents arrested sixteen thousand six hundred and fifty eight family members in September the highest one month total on record and an eighty percent increase from July according to unpublished homeland security statistic something by the Washington Post\nLarge groups of a hundred or more Central American parents and children have been crossing the Rio Grande the deserts of Arizona the turn themselves in and by signing a fear of return the families are typically assigned a court date and released from custody\nIn the United states\nSays one border patrol agent in South Texas who spoke on the condition of anonymity because there was not authorized to speak to the news media says we're getting we're getting hammered mainly\nHaving camping them a promise to stop illegal immigration and build a border wall Trump now faces a spiraling enforcement challenge\nWith no ready solutions the soaring arrests numbers and a new caravan of Central American migrants heading north have left them in a period state White House aides say he's been receiving regular updates on the border numbers telling senior policy adviser Stephen Miller and chief of staff\nJohn machine gun Kelly that something has to change\nThings including Miller and Sarah Sanders have continually told the president that many of the children coming across the border of being smuggled illegally\nAnd that the United states is being taken advantage of the president's willing anger\nHas left him pushing wants more for reinstatement of a family separation policy in some form which he believes that the only thing but his work despite the controversy it triggered one senior official conceded that the separations were halted to stamps the political theory but ended up sending a clear signal\nThat people could cross adding now we're actually getting crushed say here's the thing this is now a political calculation here we are less than three weeks before the midterms if Trump\nThen start separating families again he gives them this issue and then they say the same with him cruel main person do we got to have somebody to stop this we gotta have the Congress in ... in charge of the Democrats to stop all this stuff they can do it Trump won't\nDo it I wouldn't give him an issue but on November seventh I'd start separating the families again and I put up a perimeter on the on the border heck has been going on now since July you may as well wait three more weeks and not let the Democrats that you're over the head with it I'm just saying there's a lot at stake folks\nOr not we shouldn't do something about it and I would say you know sending the military down there right now and trying to control the board I may not be a bad idea but you have to be careful that they cause the news media folks are going to spend is their way no matter what you knew that going to make you look like ... demeanor old\nConservative you know Republican president who's just trying to tear families in part you can't win with this you know what we've got um\nWe got seven million open jobs right now they say that unemployment of the fifth year low what if Trump were to do this what are they able to set up job fairs on the border and these people come in and say hey how many you folks want to work\nI Know what you're saying well isn't as amnesty no it's what I'm saying is this is for show set up a big job is fair to aunt\nAnd have these folks go through I mean it would be hilarious wouldn't look at what Trump's doing he's finding these people [laughter] on the left hand\nWould explode\nAs I can tell you we have seven million positions in this country we need failed and these people want to work when he finds the folks who want to work everybody wants to work okay\nAnd you set up a big job training and you have it on top of the uh Trump's jobs fair ... emblazoned on the top of the tent so you can see it when the helicopter is doing an aerial shots and have Mitch McConnell will be the spokesperson\nFor whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa work\nOur work work work\nYou're talking about a PR move oh my gosh Trump says we're going to take care of these folks now you know that's just going to be a magnet for the long run obviously you've got to have an orderly way for these people to come across that's the thing about it\nYou know I told you there's one of my kids [noise] they have these having conversations every once in a while with his friends and they were sitting there and they were talking about the illegal immigration problem and all these people coming across\nAnd they've been going around and around these illegals are streaming across with her and so one guy says okay All right I got an idea I got an idea how about we do this\nHow about when they come to the border\nWe process these folks Ryan\nAnd then we do a background check and we find out you know if they've got like terrorists ties like you're talking about or maybe MS Thirteen ties and then we we those folks out and then we just let the people who have legitimate skills and want to work in the United states we let them in and my son said that's called the legal immigration\nAnd the guy when oh\nThat's what we're talking about doing\nCitizen assumption out that well it's not even an assumption it's become an assumption with a lot of folks who don't know it's become a talking point where the people who are trying to make it a talking point\nThat people who are conservative and won a strong border don't want to let any of these people in and that is not the truth at all I'm not run into anybody who says pose the border down completely only by across\nA reminds you two thirds of the people who come across that border come legally and is nuts and it is not in my I Know uh my side of this complaining about that all we're saying is get in line with the other two third and come through legally like they do just don't come across illegally because we don't know we are\nAll we're trying to do is wait out\nThe disease ridden the drug dealers mules the terrorists the MS Thirteen members the undesirable Z and let the folks with a legitimate business in this country come in like the two thirds who are already come\nAnd I don't think that's a point that's being shouted enough from our side I'd do it on a regular basis\nBut I mean Trump should be saying this two thirds of a sudden you see him with his index finger and his thumb to get two thirds two thirds of the people come across the border completely what's wrong with the rest of these folks why are they going to come across the border illegally how\nHave they come across legally we give them a job as I can tell you\nAnd so if you have a this is the whole point folks if you have a border wall then they are naturally funneled through the door is they can't come any other way but legally they come through the door and they say hey I Want to come to America and work and we go oh\nAren't you the guy Hector so and so who's got me a tattered up with him as Thirteen none of\nYou my friend are going to stay on the other side of the world would you won Rodrigues\nYou've got the skills we need people like you in this country want you want to be an American you want to come over here start on the path of here you come on in that the way you do it it's a matter of of weeding out the undesirable but some of these people in the lab they want these people just stream across the border\nWith no thought of what they might do once they get here and then you end up as the family of Kate Stanley\nAnd thousands of other people in that same boat we're undesirable criminal illegal aliens come across and kill people\nAnd then you say well that's just the price it's not the price you can have both you can have great people who are coming from Honduras who are coming from Guatemala who come in from Mexico who are coming from El Salvador\nWithout having the undesirable it's called the legal immigration it is very simple thing to do it as a matter of going through the process and getting yourself checked now background check and make sure that you're that you're worthy of coming in\nOh no no we're talking about people who were the I mean you know if you're a criminal if you're a terrorist of urine MS

I was living in the United states for the past year and writing for the Washington Post by the way has been reported that he was a U.S citizen and I don't think it was a U.S this guy was a U.S citizen here's the deal with all this and I know we've been over some of this before so bear with me there is strong\nEvidence that this guy is a was was if he's dead now what does this guy pops up alive somewhere where we are going to go\nOh my gosh man you gotta go hide there's evidence that this guy was a spy for the Muslim Brotherhood the Muslim Brotherhood has been at odds with the Saudi crown prince beyond the Saudi royal family\nBecause they want to take over and turn it into a theocracy right now it's a monarchy I don't know which one's worse I Would say the monarchy is the lesser of two evils to be quite honest with you\nOr I Know that's a fact I mean you get a theocracy the sort of a Muslim extremists they actually like Iran would the ayatollah stuff that's bad news now a monarchy is not the best thing in the world but they've been pretty well\nWe don't know they're in their involvement in nine eleven and other things that are going on either who knows what's going on what I'm trying to tell you is\nThis the mainstream media folks are focused on this 'cause this guy wrote opinion pieces for the Washington Post otherwise they wouldn't give two hoots about the guy if it was just a run of the\nMill garden variety Muslim Brotherhood do they wouldn't\nCare but they don't want to point\nOut but he's part of the Muslim Brotherhood or was\nBecause that would ruin the whole narrative because right now they got the black hats in the white hats and they know gray hats and so they want this to be cut and dry this guy was a wonderful person and the salaries are horrible people and they killed him\nThat is not to excuse the Saudis for killing them if they did it and I have and how they\nDid it although I don't know how you know from an audio tape house somebody's\nKilled that's rather odd to me okay now I'm going to cut off of them and now I'm going to get over it I mean there are they giving the blow by blow on this any way they'll store and all that out I don't know how they know\nBut what I'm trying to tell you is the Saudi Government has done and they do all sorts of horrendous things all the time we have historically turned a blind eye to them cause we named Earl\nAnd I'm really getting sick and tired of us\nCompromising our morality for things like oil and money and trade and the rest of it and\nAnd I and I speak specifically to shine the best thing that could possibly come out of all these tariffs with China is that we never deal with them again the best thing that could come of it is if people find other places in the world the source their stuff\nTo have a built in Taiwan or South Korea or anywhere else Thailand or anywhere else\nBut some brutal communist regime that has killed hundreds of millions of people of the of their own kind or not to mention a imprisoning people inflaming people and the rest I don't think you know I've never been a fan of dealing with China as you well know\nAnd here we are we have a golden opportunity now to use the tariffs to look elsewhere for sourcing stuff\nHey here's an idea how 'bout source stuff in the United states hey well that means that my iPhone would cost you know thirty dollars more\nBig look\nLet me ask you this folks and I am dead serious about this but I Know the answer because most people don't care that's the problem\nIf you were told that everything you buy at Walmart is going to cost you thirty percent more but that would all be made in America would you still\nGo to Walmart I flunked or Walmart\nI wouldn't mind paying the thirty percent more knowing that it's not being made in a communist country but now well over Seventy percent of the stuff you're buying a Walmart is made in China nuts Seventy percent may somewhere other than the United states over Seventy percent is made in China\nShame a brutal\nCommunist regime I've often said this and this is a great visual for you if you want to think about it if you want to have a mall\nAnd you were able to walk into a store in the mall and there was a glass wall behind the counter where you're buying this stuff and you could see who was actually making it and the conditions they were making it in you wouldn't buy one thing from China\nBut the sad part is that wall is not transparent\nYou don't get to see what's going on behind the wall and they do this on purpose if you did if you had any kind of conscience she would buy stuff at all costs from somewhere else yeah I'm One of those people that looks at labels I don't always get a chance to buy I mean sometimes you can avoid it\nBut if I if I have a choice of buying something that's made in China or something that's made somewhere else I Do my level best to buy it from somewhere else 'cause I don't want to see this communist writing you lose your him in the ... book the conservatives handbook blazing German term with me in near\nHim knows by the book but [laughter]\nBut\nIs it all goes to the alphabet you know if you've not read this
