Alabama welcome to sunrise Sunday another door is really blessed Sunday Morning\n\nTo share one with the other we're so glad that you've chosen to tune into the be a part of this broadcast as we share with you God's word as we know what and as we understand that\nThat may began by a thanking everyone who showed up and participate in our men and women accomplished empowerment conference a\nBreaking barriers we are blessed time a great speakers and people just share it with a brother that bond Franklin I'm from Los Angeles did an excellent job and his presentation and which shows prank vote\nFor the men and women we sacrifice to make that possible\nAt the new Shiloh church of you didn't come you missed a treat but we enjoyed having those who did come to be a part of that experience\nNot brothers and sisters when any of us think of God\nTrying to visualize him and his show him for who he is the best we can do is perhaps to think of light\nRemembering pause teaching that God loves in on approachable\nFirst Timothy chapter six verse number six team for this reason it is a myth\nOf a surprise to learn that although God is also associated with life in the Bible this ... is the only direct application of the name light\nTo God in the Old Testament job speaks of heaven as the bowl of light\nJoke thirty eight versus Nineteen so I'm Wondering for say that God wraps himself in life as with the garment verse to\nSever versus a firm that the law turns my\nDarkness and light second Sam you tempted to verse twenty nine and ... some Eighteen\nAnd first forty some starting the six verse line declares in your life\nWe see light however some towards the seven\nOne is the only Old Testament text in which God\nIs actually called the\nLight we have to go to the New Testament to find a good parallel and when we do we find that their life is a name\nFor Jesus Christ the life size and the darkness but the darkness has not understood at the true life that gives alive to every man was coming into the world John one\nAnd five and various not\nJohn who makes this identification also says God\nIs light\nIn here I'm there is no dark in this\nAt all\nFirst John ...\nWhat is this image supposed to me in the godfather of John\nHas to do with understanding which is why it has applied\nTo Jesus it is in him that we see I understand what God the father\nIs like in the first letter of John life has to do with guys purity or send us an S. but it is opposed to the darkness sinful\nBehavior for seven what about some one is seven here the term is not specifically explain it could suggest illumination peer a tip jar\nLife and hope among so many other things that we can think of but says David is thinking about his enemies and is seeking deliver us from the clutches crane shit is\nProbably a bit right when he says the song is affirming that even in the dog in this public terrible threat of\nHe has no fear for gardening is the life that can dispel that can eliminate evaporate\nSuch fearful darkness praise the lord but then he also says\nThe lord has been my salvation the Hebrew word for salvation\nMeans deliver us God is a\nDeliver on he delivered us from\nSan and the death that was hours to die\nBecause of sand [noise]\nSo the Hebrew word then for salvation me deliver us explicitly and again this probably had to do with deliverance from the kings immediate\n...\n... ... some expresses the same idea when it says the lord is the strength\nOf his people\nOf fortress of salvation for here so knowing it won\nSome ... some point in a rather\nVerse number eight\nBut then he said the law is so strong over my life another translates just say the law is the strength\nOf my life\nThe military images and the concerns they represent continue in the third of these great images for God\nName there he is a refuge\nFor stronghold\nYou need to know that if you're struggling and hurting fearful discontent being bombarded by\nOne issue after another you have nowhere around and nowhere to\nGod is\nA strong whoa what's wrong tower\nTwo years you refuse he here's your protect our he is everything that you need for the circumstances that you're facing and the\nTrouble that you are having clearly they needed a refuge from his falls\nHe had had it in the past\nBath for he will not fear in the future dangers\nSays God had shown himself dependable or\nIn the life of David before\nSince Scott has shown himself strong says Scott has shown himself or the Libera says God has shown himself away out says ... showing himself a friend\nWhen they emit face additional difficulties when he face additional problems and challenges and issues\nHe remembered the goodness of God before he remembered what God has done and so now in similar circumstances or conditions he says in spite of what\nThey might be in spite of the house challenging each day may be how ... you know scary they may be how awesome they may be I Will not fear in the future dangers because God who helped me in the past\nThe God he was helping me and the president is this same God that can help me in the future was a power for observation to me in your relationship\nWith God about\nThe doing of God in one's life as God you\nHave a relationship with God also know that he's good he's good all the time\nThat he's faithful and he's always faithful they always keep his word he never breaks it he has never fail and he's shown on sale he is dependable he as reliable you can count on him\nHey man shows is God as protecting you before so you need not shaker rather low road you need not fall apart you do not give and you need not quit you need not back up you need not give in to the presidents of life\nThe same God not deliver you from whatever was\nAnd you pay for he's still able\nHe can still deliver you he can still take care of view he can still protect cute\nHe can still help you he can still bring you out of your dangers he can still open doors he can still make a way I don't know where he can do what he's done\nMitt for praise 'cause\nAll their name David says even if his phone sugar tax\nAnd army should receive him or war\nAgainst a nation David will not fear\nWe can't stand the pain\nThere is no prescribed medication available from the locus local farmer said that we can take or the physician can write for us to take\nThat will ease the pain that is so in some of them oh so this pain drives us to our true pain killer and that is the lord himself he takes us and and protest us from the pain of life\nTurbulence from life\nDestruction from life forms\nAnd he keeps us\nSo for God to do this for us it was a way around this statement of God's manifold spiritual blessings so it has generally been so understood\nJohn John Scott puts our understanding where or when he says the law is\nMy life to guide me to leave me into darkness\nDoing they want me to see my way\nHe's masturbation tuna living me from all my fear is from my sense from I hang up from a child from a tribulation from I heard from my brain and the stronghold in my life in whom\nI'd say refuge Celeste to look at those so who's\nDesire the soles desire [noise]\nIf you look at the song you've heard this summer that the second ... of the some\nExpresses Davis\nOne wonderful and great desire which is to dwell in the house\nAll the days of his life versus for\nThis sounds a great deal like ... three which in with David wherever in\nIn the house of the lord\n\nBut man it has to do with heaven\nAnd in some twenty three wow here and some twenty seven the reference is to the earth flip Tabernacle\nIndeed David seems to be ransacking the Hebrew language for now\nDescribe it the house of the law\nThe temple his temple versus for his\nDwelling versus five his Tabernacle versus five through six why\nDoes David have this saying I'm an obsessive long infant guy's house particularly when we remember\nThat the story is typical of Solomon was yet many years in the future at this point guy's house was still can't they can't name it erected for the ... when he brought it from Korea Jerry him to ...\nSeconds Sammy oh Tempe just six verse them or Seventeen hands of course it's clear and the answer is that it was not the earthly temple itself that saw in the navy but rather\nThe beauty of the law\nThat was to be found\nVery unique and special\nWay when we were studying when our studying some foreigners sex and found similar as I inverse hey it's just it that name is\nLonging for the house of God\nHas something to do with his main with guys people\nWho would be found that in the house but the case here here and the reason is soul it that some is\nMike gay he's a\nUpon the beauty\nOf the lord\nIs law himself that he is seeking\n\nWe moved from church house to house\nWho are we seeking\nThinking\nFor David and Jesse White house ... different main\n\nDifferent paint on the wall\nWhere it was\nA new program our new fad for David ... new kid on the block\nBut his purpose\nLong and desiring ... house to be in the house\nSo that he can hold the beauty\nOf a lot\nHe won't you contact with the lord\nHe wanted\nTo be a relationship with the lord you wanted to be in the presidents\nOf the law\nHow many times we flock from such just church not because we are\nDesiring to be in the president of the beauty of the lord\nSome of the herbs in a certain part of the community and we want to rub elbows where am I have a ... job somewhere and have a title position somebody has a program that's new we're going to get involved\nOr some has something to give away well jeez as fit in the equation regarding the house and him why\nI hear people say I'm going here because the word is preach because the president of the law is made man it fast because I I since his power and his words plans as me and helps me and we owe me\nDavid degrees and the\nHouse had to do with a loving God out of the house\nA man hey man and a man\nSo he was seeking the law himself or you can do little or\nPeople church half black rabbit some frogs from one church house to another\nWhat are you looking for\n\nJesus is the only one\nWho can satisfy the\nVoid in your heart\nAnd his parents his favorite is you'll watch only a Jesus ... holy jeeze those can make a dry only jeeze a skinny ... disease\n\nAnd so he ... in the temple\n\n\nIncome and terrorists or commentators falling over themselves\n\nTrying to prove that this wasn't allowed to liberate design for God's house\nBut rather a matter\nOf spiritual fellowship\n\nThis and\nThat is something wonderful\nThere is something beautiful there is something\nBrewery is there is some things blast sit there was something\nHis stronghold\nGod can be for you what he was\nPut David\nYou can read about the rich experience and appreciate the revelation but you can live your wrists barriers and appreciate\nThe actuality or the reality\nBecause life that they live and the relationship that he had with a God was he is you and I have to have\nWe should be able to say what God he is to us\n\nBut I Believe as he was alive the and he's alive now leading us through the dog ... sorrows up paying ... or ... trials and\nTribulations bringing us to play you some jar\nThe jubilation the lord is alive\nHe illuminates or understanding he lives a capacity to comprehend to know\nTo understand the wisdom of his word so that we may want to pass that he has constructed and direct it so that we would live in accuracy of understanding of his word so that we wouldn't know the war in Iraq\nAnd in darkness and in disobedience so the lord is\nMy life we've got to own\nIn the script ... it was David mine but we got to make it ours is the law does your life and I believe he is because he's your ally ...\nAnd he is your salvation he's you deliver us\nOr if it had not man for the lord\nWe would be on our way\nAs fast as we could get ... to hail we wouldn't have we wouldn't be dead or alive\nHe was the spirit that quick and that we were dead in a sense in a trust passes\nWe were one way I'm the dog and is this bad we didn't know how to get out and we didn't see a way out and we had no way out\nAnd Jesus saw a sinking in the ... of San ... nation\nAnd God they knew where we were headed\nSo since fourth is only

continue to\nThe shows and the increase in the ... the number of jobs out of school the individuals who are involved and murder and all the crime what are some of the basic things that she was saying no we need to say to our political leaders that something needs to change\nYou know I was talking to a gentleman the other day and I'm thirty two years old and the guy who are\nAll of a ... [laughter] I'm kind of enjoy the thirty two uh\nThe guy was talking to he was twenty four\nAnd at the beginning of our conversation he wasn't registered to vote and I'll take my phone up and we got to register online at hold them\nYou know after we got registered to vote you know now okay that's the easy part the next part is you have to be an informed voter that's where it's not just enough to get out there and go vote just line that we have to understand who these people are who are\nAsking us for the honor for the privilege to represent us and guide our laws I mean it's it's\nIt's almost as if you're asking someone for the privilege to come in your house\nAnd make certain that everything inside your house stays appropriate and you're coming into my house to make sure everything is appropriate I'm going to know who you are and what you stand for and if you really care about the fares are they going on in my house that's essentially what we're asking every time or every time a person gets out and ask for your vote that's what they're asking for so it's\nLike half of duty on the person to get out and say you know what I Want to lead the community and the other half is for us to go out and challenge that person don't meet him go to Ben\nHere what they have to say in the cyber yourself in your heart you know we all see the world as we want to see it so we know in the voting booth and we before the elections come up let's let's do some research to find out who these people are and see if that matches up with the vision that we have in our minds but the way the world should go and that democracy\nAnd there was we see a lot of turmoil and our son\nThe sitter leases associate or because of the other day I have to be at the city council mean when they came down to protest\nBecause of the disparity in the treatment they can get a\nAnd a war in Iraq do a birthday on an RV tail and see all the houses that are blocked a and all ... and I see the house of a change in the right to again because of mismanagement or oil because you say are over\nTo my people who live in the public housing and knows area who just don't do that this is a ... this is serious\nAnd absolutely right you know from the perspective of people United to advance the dream which is one of the first and foremost a a ... of the things that I Do\nUh it's it's an opportunity to work with all types of people just to help unite people as human beings and when you understand that philosophy I see a I had to live in the projects at a certain point in my life that they are or didn't stay there you say that that's the only a stepping stone to when you got to go\nBut I could not have ever elevated from there if I didn't exercise the new things and rice that I had as a human\nBeing and that has to voice my opinion you know you can tell you can tell your neighbor your girlfriend your mom or your dad how you feel about something\nBut you won't tell the people to how you feel and the right to vote who say that's how you tell their mouth so far the heads flippers and all the finger ... then your right to vote gives you the military and the opportunity to legal aid and justifiably let\nThe leadership know what you want and what you want in your in your gender\nSo now what are your what your opinion is our fault you know immigration rice on the health care ever you know the things that matter most of the country pertain to you and the reason why we're so far behind number one as a people\nBecause we have not taken leadership and ownership of the things that we need to in order to get us and things we need\nOkay a counselor I'm writing a book [laughter] you know the times of the book is white racism versus black hair and different\nSometimes we get so and girls and they All right\nWe get so engrossed in or people who are racial prejudice and cancer but did we failed to address the internal strife\nThere and then turn a psychological problem that retard those\nFrom being progressive so when you look at uh our communities are dead water rise can you offer too young to know who who who\nKnew in conditions that they can't change but it's his tears atmosphere do work for the spirit play in the revolution or the mess in the piece\nWell one one thing is that I like to I like that I'm a kind of disagree with you on something there that they can change that\nThat is no such thing is I Can't change out and say they can say yeah well I don't disagree we also have I had to fill out a ... and ... am I here and I heard you say without the holiday that channel is a no hitter yours and that's exactly right you can change\nAnything you want to can but the key to it is understanding how to change it\nSee many times it especially in our community and for an hour or an act of our circle we don't have money problem we have a management problem that's where and when you have a route to it then the cost of the lambs look like the room\nSo are we see on the outside on the surface is the results of the real problem the real problem is we don't have the understanding or the knowledge in order to operate where we need to make first of all for the young people\nYou are fearful a wonderfully and meticulously may first of all secondly you need somebody\nTo show you which way to go to say first of all you don't come here no one everything and you don't get in Eighteen twenty and twenty nine to five fifty years or so therefore I always look to someone that you see is going in the right direction you'd like to go in okay\nLook to somewhere because somebody around you is mimicking and doing something that you like to do\nAnd don't be to pry phone to ask for help\nEncourage chime in I'm Charles I'm for them to get your hands are so he

and ask for help and just you know and ask for somebody to guide you and be a mentor for you and you know as a as a as a youngster you know coming up in the world right now you know these are things that I have seen on a daily basis but as a on the air was a lot of that though\nYou know one thing that really disturbs me about the city that I live in the city I grew up in the city I Love one thing that really this Thursday about mobility as\nWe as if the people who have come before me have gotten so into the struggle that brought them to where they are they're used to relinquish anything that allows anyone after them to go beyond where they are\nEither and it gets dumped on sale\nYou know and and that's what holds us back into a cycle you know at what sense does it make for me to\nGo forward them and bank of wall down and put all that energy and breaking the law and down and fall I'm going to do is turn back around build a wall back up and tell you now you got to go do the same thing that I went through the build up to the ball down the ... and they get through to the other side\nThat's where I really if you tell that wall down rather shouldn't logically me that I proceed on to the next one and not that wall down for somebody else can come behind me and knock it down to somebody else and come behind that person knocking down the me sounds like progress but\nYou know we we call it the generational gap all the time but I think that there are people both young and and and both in our elder ranks who wants to meet in the middle I just think we need enough or a just a little bit more of that support of our elders standing and\nAnd then the feeling Israel we appreciate everything that that has been done to get us here let it be known that there wouldn't be no us
