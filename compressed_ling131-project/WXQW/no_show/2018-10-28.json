WG okay in\nThe morning and welcome to sunrise Sunday but pastor good no jumped in the German leader of new Shiloh missionary Baptist church in twenty seven fifty six also wrote in the primary below Alabama and know today's broadcast [noise]\nGood morning there's just no Johnson excuse me so I'm losing my voice a little bit welcome to sunrise Sunday another during the day that Moore's blessed day that the lord has given\nAnd allowed us to come out to destroy your station live but we might share we use the word of God as we know it\nAnd as we understand it\nA program goes out to all the sick and all of this shut in the brewery in our community were praying for you that God will be kind and generous to you in every way and bless you according to his purpose for your life\nAs we are sad to share special got church trembling understand the patch things up sister Josephine ...\nWho was a member of our church for over fifty years or served as our church secretary for a long time on the boat pop or Georgia and with me for my best or ministry at the church\nUh we're praying for the while the family that God will bless you and keep you in the power if he's president and your strength\nIn the name of our lord\nWhich still praying for the family of Michael Rogers I'm so he was a previous member of our fellowship his sister and other relatives remaining bad the new Shiloh church Angela Johnson and other family members\nWill continue to praying for it for praying for you that God will bless you and keep you as well and bring you to to to mode of your troubling ... a man a man or with those who wish sick wherever whomever you are you an ... system Asian night\nThat he had that\nHe is saying to us this morning is that he had fallen into what was apparently his final illness and he was on the very brink of death\nWe speak of a man being sold or so sick he has one foot in the grave and one foot on the earth but David is saying that he was so sick\nHis enemies had actually in their minds at least lead him out\nIn his coughing he goes from there's that God\nDelivered him somebody out there like David at some time in your life\nMay have been seriously ill may have been in that situation it looks like you would not make it looks like you own your own way to the other side but you reached out to God\nAnd he reached out back to you and he chose to bring you out of a horrible experience you were if you were experiencing\nAnd to live to you from the burden of your potential to death\nAnd so as David is able to celebrate and with George in the good news of God so can wait for David isn't the only one who has been sick\nHe's not the only one who has been down is not the only one who has had terrible problems many of us have had the same or similar\nExperiences and so version one contains a nice a really nice image of\nWhat happened but when David ... as you lived in me out\nThe deaths he chooses a verbal which reviews of drawing a bucket\nHere's saying that it is as if God reached down and pulled him up\nOut of the deaths period\nWhen apart from God\nThat was no hope for him none at all\nAnd so it is my brothers and sisters that David gives a very clear\nPicture of his own situation he saw himself\nDown out in the own circumstance but he also saw God\nLifting him up with the other hand a power and care as a bucket was drawn from\nThe way up and he realizes that without\nThat was no hope for him at\nWe need to realize that\nThat without God that that really is no hope for us when we when we were in the dismal state of life conditions\nAnd when we are unable to loose ourselves from the powerful grip of deadly circumstances we can give them God the auto we can give them dog the phrase we can give God the salute\nFor having mankind and merciful\nAnd to extend the vine and spiritual Curtis it to us reached down and pick us up from a six bed pick us up from out death bed pillow zone out free and give us another opportunity to experience the joys of life\nI Believe some like just like they have been that\nYou've had the experience is so you know you for yourself what God can do because you know what he has done\nAnd you also know that if it hadn't that man put him on your side there was no hope to be found that was no hope to be gotten that was no hope to reach down but God into\nCame through in the Nick of time and rescue you well\nThe image introduces\nThe first set of uplifting contrast lifted up\nVersus going down\nYeah yeah yeah he was going down and he was going down for the count he was out the referee back and count him out but God lifted him up\nGod who helped versus enemies who go yeah yeah yeah there are some people\nWho feel who feel was so much hatred so much animosity is so much a disdain for you that they do all over your sickness and as bad\nAs they wish for your demise your annihilation they can wait for you to fall from the place where you're standing but the contrast is God's help\nVersus the enemies who glow the next contrast is serious sickness versus Britain knew him\nHey man hey man you ... you could be down and you could be out seriously ill but God gives you renewed health health he restores due to health\nHe brings you back to a place where you where before you got to the place where\nYou are and it's the third fourth famous threat of a grave versus light\nLooked like he was on his way out but God kept him man he's done that for you he's done that for me praises holy name\nMan fits their physical suffering versus praise and face giving to God or yeah yeah sickness in this band\nCreating a physical challenges and difficulties and adverse it does but praise and face giving became the focus\nAnd became the focus of the day praising God and thanking God for his power deliverance thanking God for his help thanking God for showing up and showing out thanking God for his blessing thanking God for not leaving him along something about our\nListening to this broadcast this morning I Believe you can save ... without hesitation how good God he is and how good God has banned because you need but think of your own situation or perhaps\nThe situation of a loved one or have a friend about which you knew and you witnessed the move of God to be made manifest in their lives and like folk have said before we didn't do it won't do it\nDidn't need to do it won't eat do you see we'll do it yeah see has done it and he will do it\nAgain praise the lord prayers law praise or law brother\nPC crazy as the right lane of this session that'd be occasion for\nActs of worship is not merely the assurance that God would answer but the barriers of actual healing\nBecause God\nHas the answer hey man this is one kind of praised in expectation that God will master there's another kind of praise in realization that God has to answer some ...\nParrot joke crime has said you're ... you're pretty as of a dodge has has ever show up in your life because you found yourself you know doing things power laying circumstance of this bath\nOne foot in grade so it was me but God shows a step in and lift you out\nThe do germ of your this bath\nYour circumstance hold back the seemingly\nAnd give you another chance to live a life and now here you are I'm\nStuart the health because of the good news and mercy favor in Taiwan is a God now it's time to celebrate it's time to shout his time to say well alright\n... for God is a good God\nThe important point my brothers and sisters here's ...

I'm Sorry the ... the tea absolutely well welcome to the show thank you for coming today well thank you for having me\nAbsolutely and we're just today wicks either I'm excited and you're excited and double days excited we've been having this conversation going back and forth haven't dialogue\nWith just wanting um to excite the community um to get out and and and and know that uh the vote count\nAnd the importance of getting out to a whatever you're doing just um\nWhat else was getting in your way for that they get your scheduled in order so that you can press make your way down to the to the precinct to an end and expressed show and cast your vote on that's very important but just before we get into that we were having another conversation I Know you don't want me to bring it up\nBut I'm Still going to bring it up in our conversation we were having about um [noise] well I\nI I Know that by the high school is the best school in the city immobile but now you know I just wanted to have to differ with I have got a great school that it's in my district okay and everybody knows that lying always out ... ...\nAnd the bill would be what do you think about you know the now come on now what do you think about that and you know she's ... oh [laughter] so um our number they\nThat's right and William ...\nSee I was going through some green and white tea and so you all just get the message to me up to the moon\nBut we've got some great ice cream that multi color or black and white and black\nAnd white All right well where are you going to see all my heart there in the playoffs can come out to the main playoff but you know congratulations so all of them that's right it's all about our kids write about our kids so that so just before we get into the excitement of our of voting um I just want to talk about\nWhat you're doing in your community and and and as far as the lab you is this lab but they are that\nThey just well you know there there's some great talent that is that Williamson and and it's not just Williamson is throughout the entire school system um but Williams and it's one of the high schools that's in my district and those kids though they are doing amazing things as it relates to technology right\nUm they they they they've got a a an eight in innovation labs that they're getting ready to put together an okay\nAnd so I had the good fortune of preventing them a twelve thousand dollar a check from the state of Alabama to go to that innovation labs and I'm excited about him excited 'cause 'cause if you go and look at what those kids are doing I always tell folks from the moment that I saw those kids\nAnd the technology and their depth and their knowledge of technology I said we've got some winners and we've got to start investing absolute into our children's lives not only from the government side but also from the community sad and most importantly from parents\nAbsolutely and that's where we find um the kids are lacking that that love and that'll tension or from the parents and so we're asking the parents to become more involved and and the lives of their children because it takes all of us well\nYou know the village you know when when when I grew up in in in ... which is not very far from may feel\nThe village I can look back in the village was always the part that made me who I Am today\nI'm do integration came along and and I had to go to another high school to graduate from my foundation was that William center and I can look back and see many days of ... and the things that he taught and I can go down the line to teachers\nAnd and that is what we've got to get back to because there there there's obviously some deficits in some parents right but\nThat didn't just START I mean their deficit for years ago but from what you had was that village that field and the death ... and and I'm One of those folks who feel like we need to put the village back together again him so that we can create\nThese wholesome individuals that are going to go out and do the extraordinary things for this country and for our community\nAbsolutely and so that being said I'm Talking about the importance of voting on right now I'm thinking about um\nI have four grand bores a Tyler is a sophomore in college Taylor is in the ninth grader and Allen is a first grader\nAnd they don't have my little grandson he's Eighteen months old so\nThe reality of it is that they are dependent on on main depending on you and depending on the adults to make those decisions for them that they can't make for themselves right now so voting\nWe're ready for it to go into the right way and so they need to vote on November the ...\nSo give me your take on your vision for the future of Mobile Alabama being it'd be there in ... in Montgomery now and things that you were saying you experiencing and every one of a day or a month um well\nFor for for mobile my my vision is they are very bright because I think that mobile learned a long time ago that there are no ads but we can't succeed is an odd\nAnd when I say that they United and we all became a week from city government to county government state government to the community to the business community they all said OK gas\nWe're all going in different directions and we're not being successful so now everybody has United all ... around one cause I'm really proud to work in the delegation that we now have currently because when we go to Montgomery\nIf I don't care what the issue is it may not be in one oh three right but we look at mobile as one entity and we all get together and we fight for mobile what isn't the best interest of mobile that is what we need in the state of Alabama and we're very fortunate\nIn this election season there are some great people who were on the ballot that's why I say we had an opportunity now to look at people and we should put people back into the equation you know when we go back in twenty Nineteen we've got our\nGeneral fund that we're gonna have to find a funding source for you know I've heard people talk about the lottery\nWhich which which I Want you to know that there are many of us who did not fight against a lot of ... we thought that would be a viable option but others thought otherwise so but we have got to come up with some sustainable\nSome sustainable revenue sources for the state of Alabama but I think the future for mobiles is looking really good because we work as a week and I'm hoping and praying that we continue to do so\nAbsolutely but as long as you know than I Am and we are proud of view serving a or the mobile area I'm On a state level and I would say this to the listening audience that\nYou when you think about um when you think about a representatives and servants I Will tell you that are you looking for the example the example of a servant I Will have to tell you just take a look at this bar withdrawing um she is the example and then and and she don't just talk it\nShe walk and even though she's talked about ways in high school but she [laughter] she still says she said she has a passion for what she'd do so when when you go to the to the vote big about those people that\nHave the passion\nBut we've certainly thirdly we certainly thank you on this wonderful Sunday afternoon to remember we've got one more Sunday to go and see them all day on November the six please go out and vote\nAnd continue I saw something on yesterday and I'm just going to give a plug for him and his gospel fast and I just I just drove up on it and I stopped and it was the
