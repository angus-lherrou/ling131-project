[noise]\nTwenty four ministry for the hour an hour on first morning Michael Toscano so\nHappy that you have joined us this morning and we're a hope that she'll join us on the air by calling eight hundred seven three six six six six we'd like to know your thoughts on President Trump's\nThreatening to pull us out of this uh intermediate range this nuclear weapons deal that's been in effect since Nineteen eighty seven up primarily of course between the United states and the then Soviet Union but of course it also stops the United states from doing things elsewhere for instance countering China's military buildup a with nuclear weapons [noise]\nSo the president says that Russia has been disregarding the treaty the last couple of beers under Vladimir prudent and violating the treaty in fact a\nNATO says that the twenty nine of the NATO allies also believe that Russia is violating his arms control treaty and they've been trying to get information about their new missile systems in Russia and have not been able to [noise]\nBut uh there are some pros and cons obviously obviously you get out of the treaty and freeze your hands to do what you want in terms of developing weapons now just because there has been a treaty in effect since Nineteen eighty seven does not mean that the United states has not move forward with developing weapons weapons can be a\nYou can be drawn up they can be designed you can study them on computers you can do everything but actually build them in terms of this deal so it's not as if we would be so far behind that\nIt never catch up the problem is Russia if you believe some of the allies on President Trump Russia may actually be going ahead and building some new missiles in violation of this treaty that goes back all the way to the days of Ronald Reagan and my column Gorbachev\nAre being pretty good buddies they're toward the end of the Soviet Union which was crumbling partly because they couldn't keep up with the United states and the arms race we had a lot more money and so every time they would do something and try to build up some weapons we were just build more and bigger and better weapons\nAnd that all that bankrupted that country they've never been a rich nation but the arms race really bankrupted the Soviet Union\nAnd pretty much put them out of business now ... running an even poor nation and the Soviet Union was\nAnd yet he's been building up his weapons so do we follow the old Cold War method of building up our weapons and scaring the Russians and you know bankrupting them for about ... is a destabilize Russia a good thing they do have nuclear weapons we'd like them to release them enough money to\nKeep it together stay in power and keep those things under control we don't want them to fall into the hands of insurgents or some of the folks that surround Russia in some of the former Soviet Union satellite so this was a very very complicated issue it seems as if the president caught some of his own people by surprise by announcing he was going to withdraw the U.S from this treaty\nIs national security adviser John Bolton has been in Russia you know he was in Russia yesterday to meet with a Russian foreign minister staff and people to talk about this and how this would work to withdraw from the system of course now Russia\nIs saying that the accusation is that they're not complying with the deal are groundless\nAnd they claim that us violations of the treaty ah are happening and they don't like that either so they're saying that uh they hope they fish award from the Kremlin has that quote we are prepared to work together with our us colleagues\nOn the entire set of problems regarding the INS now of course you have to remember President Trump is a businessman he likes to negotiate so there may be some thought that what he's doing here is perhaps not throwing out the treaty maybe that's his first bargaining position and what he might be able to do is negotiate a better deal as he did with the NAFTA\nA with Mexico and Canada you know we're pulling out of this so you have a chance if you want to come in and give us some better than some better deals but it's hard to think how you could do this with the Russians because building up weapons and national defense there's a lot different from trade because you have lives at stake here\nSo the first thing we're going to do this morning before we take your calls and by the way our number is eight hundred seven three six three six six six and I want to know what you think about this are you willing to trash a tree and return to the old arms race of the past and put more and more billions of dollars into using weapons or to building weapons that hopefully we would never be able to or have to use\nOr would you rather save that money for domestic needs some new bridges in airports and trains and infrastructure and\nI'm sixty seven years old I used to hide underneath my dad about it on air veteran I don't believe Russia just want to hurt me I don't want to hurt them but with all this rhetoric about\nNews media Democrat or Republican avid Danny art enough on Russian meddling in you know when you started talking that kind of rhetoric these kind of decisions are made by hope a bomber mine's any a joint session of Congress and the Senate\nOr the ... and it's a subject we should talk about but uh when you're a member when we say we need to be harder on people they have to think what the end result could be ... I don't think there's anybody in Russia was hurt me\nI don't want to hurt anybody in Russian biased or listening to the radio show when I was driving in the morning\n[laughter] I understand you\nWere happy that you're doing that Wayne and please call back we like to hear from you again thank you so much [laughter]\nWe're going to a New Bedford Massachusetts to talk to Richard Richard is this a good strategic moving this be a way to get China into the street because right now China is not part of the treaty in China's got a lot more money than Russia does China doesn't mind building up anything Chinatown wouldn't mind an arms race with us 'cause they say that they can do to us when I Lived at the Soviet Union\nI think this would be a great mistake or to get out of this treaty rather than to go see it over inspections or something like that\nOf both sides pond and basically I think this amounts to see 'em on on the part of Donald Trump chicken further increase the military spending and continue to be creating good paying jobs in the United states by repairing our infrastructure or building a road ... uh you know you keep passing a\nMinimum wage of minimum wage and basically but I mean in terms of stuff with Russia this is just ... part because frankly I think he's in the hands of the Russian dancer tied by the Russian\nGovernment because of all the time he has to Russia according to crate on ... book house of Trump also that piece of pool in which I Would recommend for everybody\nWants to Russia and begins to did they they've been falling into Trump Trump and his campaign and his business is Trump would be nothing ... you'll be like I Can't borrow money in the United states because he's so long trustworthy so when he builds his golf courses in Scotland and Ireland and get all this money admittedly so from his son\nFrom Russia so what does that tell you about the ...\nWell you know what I'm getting out of the thing is I Can't imagine Vladimir Putin is happy about this because he's got a very restive country a lot of people in his country are unhappy right now and his his ratings are going down which is a pretty amazing 'cause he was very very popular up until a year or two ago but\nHis ratings are going down because of the economy being so poor there he does not want to have to spend money on weapons and if we do away with this treaty and the United states starts on a massive buildup\nShe's going to be under pressure to do the same and he doesn't have the money to do that so I I don't think that this is something that blood ... would welcome from if he's controlling President Trump is not doing a very good job of it this morning I'll tell you that yeah\nYeah but but but he did the same thing I mean he supposedly has already solved problem and North Korea but nothing came of that so what is that what else do they have to worry about is all blubber that's\nAll it is okay but anyway I much Richard always enjoyed hearing from you know let's talk to a Mike in ... Wisconsin good morning\nGood morning my home when you look at Donald Trump\nAnd you give them just enough she has more intelligence and gets more radios from people in that whole arena\nAnd uh we think is simple people all know we shouldn't do that but this man has negotiated a trade deals and now you look at his record\nAnd now he says he's going to get something done he gets it done he knows all about a potent as a dilemma that age and he knows exactly\nWhat the intelligence agencies just told them that they use a mid range nuclear weapons are being placed in certain places nobody's ever done anything less like this up until Reagan and a slip didn't slip through the ... now he's finally do something about it mhm I'm behind him a hundred percent\nAll right appreciate that norm are and and as you were saying you know when Reagan did this or we're supposed to Russia was in the same position that he's in now\nWhich is basically going down the hill going down the tubes financially and so that was a good time for Reagan to uh put some pressure and get Gorbachev to agree and perhaps the same perhaps history has repeating itself and this is the time or we can modernized this\nAnd get a better treaty out of it and also find a way to bring China into it because maybe it maybe that would be something that has been getting Russia involved so\nSome gun that exactly yes I'm trying to look at I'm trying to look at the glass half full side of this this morning 'cause we are coming up now on five minutes before the hour thanks for your call Mike I appreciate it much talked to a norm in Tacoma, Washington good morning an army been holding on for a while\nAnd we're paying for the phone call and not you you've been holding\n[laughter] yeah um there was a study done about uh people like ... ... people in power it was that a politician political leadership St ... the it'd be psychopathy the general public\nAnd show you got ... to ... and the clash of each other at the New York chess board and you gotta wonder like somebody what said if this is the best you can do guys like this that and there's something wrong with the gene pool show it is a little bit ...\nYeah well I I I worry about what they say about radio news anchors to suddenly people out to come to work at three o'clock in the morning\n[laughter] not that I Know anybody like that anyway thanks so much for the call normal check in with you later\nFour and a half before they are now there's more first like to come\nI\nI used to have a sweet tooth had to remove it when I was a kid so what do I crave instead of chocolate\nA big red box from Granger Granger satisfies my craving for great customer service what twenty four seven support effort was ordering and same day pick up or next day delivery options no busy signals know cavities I Love Granger you know why because when it comes to reliable product in technical support ... got your back\nColor ... cheaper yourself Granger for the ones who get it done\nRenowned medical correspondent and endurance race champion Bob are not empty\nPeople ask me how you keep competing at the age of Seventeen healthy living is important but so he's painless if you have paint you can't train so I'm thrilled I discovered salon pasta ... plus this unique topical pain reliever contains too safe and effective anesthetics to nothing has worked better for\nSalon ... plus cream or wrong\nNothing better written they apply what did it become OK for men to be lazier softer fatter\nWe need to bring the better this country back to greatness with age list male Macs\nA patent pending formula with an agreement that helps boost your total testosterone promoting greater increases muscles sauce and twice the reduction of body fat percentage that exercise alone plus and amazing sixty four percent increase in nitric oxide which can be handy in the gym and in the bedroom\nTake your manhood to the max by dry your first dirty diaper bottle free not tend to not Fifteen days full thirty days supply free when you text the word quick\nTo Seventy nine Seventy nine Seventy not\nJust pay shipping and handling filing a formula that boost total testosterone if your results with age was ... to it says please decrease you for your free bottle text quick\nTo Seventy dollars Seventy nine Seventy nine text Q.

and yesterday and he discovered what are they discover and the care of him he discovered people from Bangladesh Bangladesh that's not really a Central American country is it\nAnd and the news media they keep telling because President Trump said who knows who's in there they got it got bad people in there you got there and that's their team you got human traffickers he got drug traffickers they got here you have people from the middle east you gotta have terrorists from the middle east sitting there and\nThe news media ... bristled and they said you're not you're nothing but\nPure people people who are pure of heart people who are pure of Seoul people who have never done anything wrong people who just want a better life there are no criminals among those seven thousand people see the left as they can do this I talking about this all the time\nThey can look at pictures of people thousands of miles away and they know what's in their hearts they liberals have this power it's like a

think\nAbout if you ask a liberal sitting next to bill liberals hitting that she can tell you know in a Jesus like right in a in a in a profit like what they can say no all of these people are pure\nThere appear of hurt their ... their soldiers are pure their intentions are pure and a really nice to know is this on a morning a joke with the circle fest there the pigeon sisters they all know\nThat the president's lying when he says that there could be people in there who are from the middle east they could be bad people he said he said last night he was in Texas cetera during a rally for Ted Cruz we're going to get to that too because he was pretty hilarious last night\nAll over the place got a new Elizabeth Warren line that he rolled out last night I got some fun stuff there was a great show it's like Vegas since like Rodney Dangerfield\nAnd the president the United states at the same time it's an interesting phenomenon and a President Trump on us that this was this Israeli got the news media upset when they say they say well you can't say that they're bad people in the Caribbean and and the news media calls him a liar for saying it is but one of the ... versions or what the president said\nAnd caravan USDA very bad [noise] fearsome man [noise] and we can't let that happen to our country that is not\nA very that people on the news media says no and then there are for at least we only got to four four pieces and the doctor evil posed today\nAll called the president a liar for saying that [noise] because they say there is no evidence\nThat there are bad people in the care of that well there was no evidence that\nBrett Kavanaugh committed cereal gang rape has a high school student after drug in girls with ... but but that was the standard for Brett Kavanaugh now there's a different standard that the news media rolls out for situations like this the president suggested there might be\nTerrorists and they are in the crowd well it's ah it's interesting because the news media calls that ally\nAnd yesterday I read a story the president of Guatemala whose name is Jimmy is named Jimmy Jimmy and the president I called Jimmy the president of and that's his name of Guatemala he said that in Guatemala that they have in recent times\nArrested about one hundred members of ISIS\nWhich interestingly enough they say they deported back to their home countries now we can't deport people back to their home countries but brought to mind like they can report or deport people back to their home countries and so he said that there are a about a hundred\nISIS people in Guatemala that they've kicked out of the country I I there's no guarantee that they got 'em all or that they just went to Guatemala and not to outside the door on do it on a sunny hot Iowa or or any of them may maybe even\nMay he co they have airports there and and everything so you can go in there as well\nFurther more [noise] and the\nPresident yesterday when he was asked on the south lawn of the White House ah\nWell you say there are bad people in the crowd there and and and you can't you can't say that there are bad people in the crowd and the president said well why don't you go down there on your reporter\nOnce you get out there and check\nOnce you go into the middle of the crowd and poke around and ask people hey you know where you're from Honduras or maybe you from Syria I'm considering either physical characteristics that are that are similar\nAnd uh and then something funny happened after the president of Guatemala\nSaid that they got all these ISIS people or make kicked him out of their country I I'll go ahead and give Jimmy the benefit of the doubt and said that he's telling the truth I uh I I don't know if he is or not but yeah that's what he says and he's the president of the country so [noise] and then the president said he tells reporters well you know that the reporters yelling at him do you have any\nEvidence that there are terrorists part of this caravan ... curl asked the president and he said uh\nYou know what you should do John John ... have you seen those you know you should do John go into the middle of the care of on the care of and take your cameras and search okay no no John take your camera he said interrupting John Carl it's a news report\nSays that he was interrupting John ... not that John Carl was interrupting him say that this is the ranking system and the news media if any reporter is talking the president start speaking he's interrupting you seize interrupting\nThe reporter that's the way they see as very self important they're on television you know he says go into the middle and search you're going to find MS Thirteen you're going to find Middle Eastern you're going to find everything guess what\nWe're not allowing them at our country we want safety now the news media is outraged by this and and nobody in the news media seems to be aware of the president of Guatemala Jimmy\nSaying that they've thrown about a hundred I says the ISIS not all ... very specifically I was out of the country run and then something else happened that's kind of funny too\nAnd that is a Univision reporter who need busy on you know the network of Jorge Ramos who is like the Carl Marx of the news media and a and this reporter from Univision was in the middle of a crowd doing a shot\nAnd he said that he had run into [noise] he said yesterday when we were travelling through Guatemala I bet he said go out to her mother and he said we noticed people from El Salvador even people from\nBangladesh Bangladesh\nNow Bangladesh technically is a Central Asia but in the middle east but it's an overwhelmingly Muslim country with a lot of\nA radical Islamic terrorism and all that stuff so we've got that going for us so there's a president and a and the news media and the news media isn't system there are no bad people they can tell from aerial photos whether there are still photos or video either will do they can tell you that there are no bad people in there\nNow let me say what I think here for just a moment about uh about all of this I think politically because obviously all that matters says the midterms on how the Democrats are going to fare that's the news media is central focus that's the news media is only focus as how they can help the Democrats win the house\nOn election day which is two weeks from today\nAnd um [noise] here's an here's the thing right now I think this exposes the Democrats just being organized by the way I've got a story out of\nArizona one of their left wing community organizers from Arizona who's a radical was arrested down in Mexico crossing the border into Mexico and he's one of the community organizers this is Rocco by most fundamental transformation of America and by the way they can flow of\nImmigrants illegally is part of rock Obama's fundamental transformation of American to stand there going to reshape but in in sort of in a in a in the image of the third world this is their their goal their stated objective perhaps not say that often but said it every now and then by accident\nI think right now politically all of this cruise to the benefit of the Republicans because this is a Democrat project this is the Democrats this is their open borders stuff misses there you're a racist stuff and this is a Democrat after the community organizers down there with the orange\nIt's the yellow vest whatever color of their day to day globe as they know they go they uh they are a left wing or as from America who are down there organizing them from Mexico\nWho are down there organizing this stuff and they're on somebody's payroll they're being paid the news media that they're they're not involved in trying to find out any of this information\nThey're involved in making sure no one talks about this this stuff but\nBible riles W.

I'm In this place and\nAnd might have been misplaced in a place where somebody could have picked it up and taken it okay so it's really hard to know so I I guess I just wanted to make sure that in the event somebody does have that that um you know we figure out what to do to try to prevent something from happening\nWhere you know I talk about credit freeze is something I Want everybody to do anyway\nBut her credit freeze is very valuable because with the information if the information from the birth certificate\nAnd the Social Security card with its number on it if those two items fell in the hands of a criminal offense like opening it up wide for identity theft and applying for creditors if\nThey're her applying for um service with companies as if they're her and so by having the credit frozen it's like the perfect\nExample of how to deal with the perfect storm of key personal information being out there\nSo there is okay not really anything else for her to do other than by when the time comes that she needs to thaw her credit for some ... I Would like her to sign up with credit karma and credits sesame\nSo she's monitoring going on\nAt all times of what's going on with their stuff both of those are free to use you can't set up with them while you're credits frozen though\nMhm so yeah she\nActually she does have a credit card accounts oh\nGood good that's great so we'll have to be able to monitor anyway and she's got it frozen so the monitoring is really if somebody were able somehow to defeat the credit freeze system\nAnd so she's done what she should and you know getting a new copy of her birth certificate it's very easy and most jurisdiction and the replacement Social Security cards not hard either\nSo getting new document so it's not hard is worrying about what somebody might do with the documents that were misplaced that's the part that it's aggravating\nOkay and that's basically those are basically the things that she has to do and and she doesn't have to notify um you know the Social Security um office or any of those any official office or you\nKnow and how old is she she's twenty nine\nYears so that's not really an issue you know if we're if she were in her fifties or early sixties\nAnd her Social Security card had gone missing I Would recommend a process with Social Security where you can set up or something called my Social Security were you able to monitor that nobody is attempting to do an application\nTo Social Security but it twenty in her twenties that's not an issue\nOkay great so she's great great thank you very much for advice and\nBest to her and it sounds like a situation that could be messy she's well protected by having that credit freeze already there Kimberly with us on the car coward show Hi Kimberley\nClark how're you doing I'm doing well how are you good\nKimberly I'm so glad to have you here because I have I had quite a bit of feedback and the two occasions that I've talked about people doing their own a T straightening\nAnd you have a perspective on that you wanted to make sure that listeners heard about the idea of buying one of these at home\nTo straightening cuts\n[noise] yeah absolutely um being a business manager for a dental office you know there are there are issues around direct to consumer oriented on it we'll see that I really feel like the vast majority of consumers may not be aware of\nSo hit us with 'cause you're gonna share as the perspective of when things go wrong 'cause I hear plenty from people who use the at home a T stringers bit earth thrilled with\nThe result but I'm not hearing from the people who you are privy to so tell me what kinds of things are fouling people up\nSure it's the appliance itself the appliance\nStructurally is going to be very similar if not identical\nTo a clear outline or that you would get from your dentist or they don't ask or the issues come in and we're we've seen all health issues and in some cases costly oral health issues not to mention painful it really comes from now on the line or itself but the active street\nA patient teeth without the ... percent supervision of a dentist or an artist\nAnd so what kind of ah things make people vulnerable ... or using these at home a T straightening cuts\nYeah yeah that's a great question here really any oral health issues and particularly a oral health issues that haven't been diagnosed\nA big one is going to beat gum disease or particularly advanced gum disease\nOr you know so any time with with gum disease involved or if there's really any number of procedures at a patient wouldn't need things like selling or root canal or crown that hasn't been diagnosed and hasn't been done or you can cause severe damage to your teeth um [noise]\nWhat about this issue up for me as a patient in or hit on his treated a adult patient who is a threat to the store so loose adult permanent teeth or so loose and it looks like I was watching a video of a child who's ... shocking\nUm but that patient tied to dance gum disease I just didn't know it [noise] so\nLet me ask a question Kimberly if somebody is going to a dentist for teeth cleaning and exams on a regular basis twice a year they're going to be aware already aren't they that they would have gum disease\n[noise] yes and that's more of the ideal candidate you know if you're going to do or sit on it treatment without the direct supervision of it in a store or is it on as you want to have been regularly see are done is to ensure that your mouth is healthy enough for that so that's the exact\nUh you know in most cases that\nCan help mitigate problem ah you know however there can still be issues that come up just in the process of straightening T that even if you've been cleared by her dentist\nYou can still have issues I'm One of the bigger ones that I hear about and I talked to a patient last week about\nIs that she she kept describing it to me that her teeth or cleaning and banding together and the more that I talked to I realized that what she was saying she doesn't Dario uncomfortable painful what she was saying she can't close her upper and lower\nTeeth are so that's another part and pouring part of the or is it on a process that\nHurt or to really address\nYou know when you're not seeing a patient in person is not just straining their teeth but all lining their teeth so they stay together comfortably\nWhen a patient closes our mouth or you know anything like that that might require a dance treatments or you know or other load allergies to address it's just a lot harder to pick up on when you're working remotely with these companies\nWhile I appreciate that perspective very much and you know we've had a lot of strong feedback from people and the dental industry and the way that it doesn't\nIt all share the full story when I talk about people doing this and why they're doing and how much money they're saving the you've got a perspective it's very clear that people can have harm\nWhen all they're trying to do is trading their teeth

in how they set rates for a variety of insurance products particularly auto and homeowners\nNow I can add to that\nThan another factor insurers are using to either stick it to people or reward them is ZIP Code\nThat you live in\nWas a study just completed by the consumer federation of America that found enormous differences from ZIP Code ZIP Code\nAnd this is something of particular interest to me\nBecause at one point my wife and I lived in a house that was at a corner where three ZIP codes met I mean isn't that crazy when the postal service true the ZIP codes if I stepped in one way\nI was in the second step codify stepped in another way I was in the third ZIP Code and in my driveway I was in the ZIP Code that was our official one\nAnd according to what the consumer federation of America found there can be differences of hundreds and hundreds of dollars typically four hundred dollars\nFor taking that step across per year and what you pay\nFor auto insurance for homeowners insurance but there was a really I shouldn't say that specifically the study was of auto insurance just stepping across the street\nAnd\nNot all insurers do things the same way there not a monolith\nBut insurers routinely will use credit scores as a minor factor or a big factor in setting rates ZIP Code is a small or big factor and setting rates and the cause neither of these things have anything to\nDo with your driving record your age male female they have nothing to do with\nThe historical factors of setting rates it means that from the same human being the price differences from insurance to ensure or the widest gaps that have ever existed\nSo now you could be someone who has never had a ticket or hadn't had one in recent years my last ticket was in Nineteen Ninety

more down payment on the purchase of the house you're going to buy\nCoverage and especially going past the twenty percent threshold were you avoid private mortgage insurance is so valuable oh definitely\nSo there are two things here one borrowing the money from a credit union if your credit score is great who's going to be so dirt cheap for the car loan it's almost free [noise] what's your credit union quoting on a Carl M\nO the used car and they have a different race for seven years older than under seven years so it's about ... percent if you're over seven year old car wash a tribal all that far but seven years and younger is like one point one point I\nOkay yeah I was figuring somewhere around two percent so um that would be a good incentive to get a six year old car instead of a seven year old car they act like you know the value of the car will drop so much by the time it has five years plus older\nSo if you take out a car loan I'm really excited after having a Fifteen year old car you're looking to buy a just a newer used car wreck scrape so the only issue that would come up is he of having a a new line of credit\nNewly extended would impact your credit score to much do you know what your current score as\nWell that's one of my other question was about ... old sixty five\nOkay that puts you in really good territory if you're telling the psycho scaled eight fifty and taking out that new line of credit will impact your score a little bit should not take you\nDown to a level where it would take you from being in a bar or to what's for too many times as an a minus oh okay so where you call your credit union and talk with a loan officer there before you would secure alone for a car and asked that question\nBecause what you may want to do is you may want to consider paying cash for the car since you're buying an older one day and then if you need to later to me down payment requirements then at that point and take out a loan on the car\nHave but I Would talk to the loan officer find out how much that application for credit will impact your store because what you want to do\nFor the long haul as you want to stay which generally referred to as an

fatty things were punished thing [laughter] but it is that I Need to get some money and I wanted to rise from year to you\nDon't do it and say don't do it too late by Iran\nSay or don't do it for 'em or oh the the way foreign exchange works in the United states is a total and complete rip off\nIf you get them the euro's here before they go to Spain they're going to pay a horrific exchange rate to get those euros on the other hand when they get to Europe they can go when they land in Spain right in the airport they can go to an ATM\nAnd they can get euros at the bankers buying rate with no rip off at all like he'd pay if you got them euros here so they end up effectively with ten percent more money than they would if you bought it here [noise]\n[noise] ... ... so the problem that that there is though we got to talk about that is good now let's talk about bad problem is is that a number of us banks\nTo make up some of the lost revenue charge giant fees when you use an ATM outside the United states\nSo before your daughters go you got to get them a card where they're not going to get hit with those junk ATM fees of which there are many ways to avoid them [noise] so can I make some suggestions\nSure sure okay you know you have any military background that you could have accounts that usa\nNah okay um do you have any accounts that Charles Schwab no\nRight if you opened accounts Charles Schwab they can have a Charles Schwab ATM card and they can withdraw anywhere in the world the free\nShift into Schwab account as long as you meet the minimum there's no fees at all for having account with them and how long are they going to be overseas\nTruth from a\nPerfect so if they have a Schwab account\nThey can be overseas and they can um as they need money as you want to give them more money for their three or four months overseas you can deposit your swab office near you or even on your phone you can deposit checks\nAnd then they can continue to withdraw money is they need it over those three to four months again at zero cost is is the best deal going\nFor people who travel overseas now there's one other one\nThe state department credit union\nHas an account you can open\nFor Americans overseas is a specially designed for people that are overseas for years rather than months but you can have an account with them that gives free access to ATMs and use him in account being overseas that might be an alternative Schwab is my favorite\nAdam is with us on the Clark Howard show an Adam congratulations are in order to you is that true\nThat is correct yeah Sarah don't care if that was very hard what's happened that I'm\nHere in the next three to four weeks or my wife and I look great except for the mortgage and that's actually where my question is coming from today\nAll right well congratulations to you for having no lifestyle debt whatsoever for freedom that's going to give you it's just going to feel so\nBlessed that I Would say you can't even imagine the things that we're going to be able to do so wherever they're excited\nThat's great so where does the mortgage fit into this picture\nThat something that my wife and I have been kind of are talking about is what should be our next priority should our priority be to tackle the mortgage and job pay their mortgage completely down and that way we actually are a hundred percent that free or\nShould we start putting additional money into our four one K. or should we stacked up our savings account and have the ideal nine months of savings in their case but my sense are being unemployed for some reason\nWhile you are a planner so yeah and you know every every option you have\nIs a bright beautiful option because you've created the possibility to have great options so all it is as a matter of what might be the best priority with nothing but good choices so let me start with a question\nThat is key what is your mortgage interest rate\nRight now it's actually pretty low I Believe it's about three point six percent\nFix for the life of alone no priority at all paying extra and that so okay when I look at priorities ... do you both have for one case\nI have my own four one K. through my employer and then she's a schoolteacher so they have a different system set up but yes we both have retirement\nOkay and each interview putting in enough contribution to get whatever match there might be on the retirement plan\nThat plus additional yes\nYou're not doing raw higher rates I Would guess\nNo no we're not so bad and the other option Dr learned or\nCause the raw is what I Would do next

it look like what would America look like with Medicare for all it would not even resemble the Republican Miller the Republican Jim leaves on the line to check with this bottle of this or you\nHi I'm good how are you\nI'm very well thank you very much for being so Obama cares Medicaid expansion what are we looking at you because I mean we don't hear a lot about Obamacare these days\n[laughter] well I'm the Medicaid expansion part of Obamacare was intended to allow you know the Medicaid program which is funded by the state and federal governments to go to anyone making less than roughly you know Seventeen thousand dollars a year\nSo low income people um but because of the Supreme Court made that part of Obamacare optional states are now in a position of deciding whether they want to expand the program to low income people and their state or not and so there are four different states that are looking at doing this hum and the ... election day I'm In November\nSo what things are we talking about\nWhat we're looking at Idaho Nebraska and Utah and then Montana actually already expanded but the vote would make it permanent because their program is set to sunset and twenty Nineteen\nOkay so is this is this political way in the states I mean we have some special elections that are going on the people doing this for abuse\nRight well any time that you're dealing with Obamacare it tends to be very political and states and obviously the states or um you know much more right leaning um but the Republican legislatures in each of these places have resisted Medicaid expansion um they say that it would be too expensive for the state because the state has to pay for a portion of it\nUm and so they have not\nPass any kind of expansion and that's why advocates uh you know who are in favor of out of Obamacare really has pushed for going through ballots instead so that it that they can kind of bypassed the state lawmakers\nMrs series is no we're we're seeing the economy coming back and the jobs coming back and you are going to lose just into the workforce and um you know he's he generally be twenty six it was going to get off our insurance and he's getting insurance through his own\nEmployer now and so how much is that going on and how much does that leave me the pressure of people having to get on Medicaid\nIt can certainly alleviate a good amount of pressure because if you make more money than you know that Seventeen thousand dollars a year threshold then do no longer qualify for Medicaid\nUm so it can certainly relieve the pressure on states but they're also in states that didn't expand that program they have really high on insurance rates and in states that have higher on insurance rates you also have a horse health outcomes for the most part\nSo it's one way to kind of address some of that\nAnd also you know think about the fact that people might be so ill and frail with an illness\nAnd not be able to receive medical coverage was they had medical coverage maybe they could you know get the care that they need and then head back to the workforce so those who are proponents of the expansion would argue that all of these things and kind of works together\nOr ... ... when this happened\nIn many years ago when Tennessee ... and we could do our own deal as far as medical use concern and became tin junior and what happened was you had some employers in hand people ... ... there were all new insurance\nBut when they qualified for the ten year and they just do 'em all through your insurance and threw him on the government how much how likely is going to happen some new says\nYeah I mean that can happen a lot of the the thing is to that\nUnder the way Medicaid used to work before Obamacare at the federal government would only matched sixty percent of what\nThe whole program caused birth dates and they're still doing that for what you call their traditional Medicaid population so people who are on it who are disabled or pregnant women are on it um kids are on it\nAnd they're able to uncover a lot of this stuff they talk to people in the government's down there and they find out they're left is that is supporting this stuff they see the concerted effort with megaphones and people pushing people in front of news cameras and things I used to obviously somebody organized who's feeding all these folks\nWhose feeding seven thousand people\nWell every time they stop somewhere they're big tents erected there's food clothing there's water there's transportation who's doing all this is this is not an organic move or otherwise\nThey would be it would be like low cost coming through I mean they would come through and they would diligent plunder and they'd take everything they needed from wherever village they came through\nBut every time they stop these tense pop up and they've got all the food and all these people come through and they're fed and they're giving clean clothing and they're given everything they need and water and then they put 'em on trucks and then they take the ... the party to the next\nTown so who is paying for this both Trump President Trump asking that today I Want to

questions we want to find out who's behind this this is not some organic it just happened caravan coming to the United states just like the one before was not somebody that is organizing this and that is getting out the word and that its footing the bill for it\nAnd we find out if somebody in America you're right this is a an attempted invasion of the United states by these folks what's gonna happen when they get here they keep telling us Seventy days I doubt seriously if it's Seventy days it's more like seven and a seven\nDays there'll be here right before the midterms and then they're going to try to embarrass the president in what are you going to do with these folks and in the meantime we need to find out who's facilitating all of this and it it if it is somebody in America but I think there needs to be a serious look it may be charges against them I don't know what you can charge him with probably I don't know\nWhat the deal is if if you can really charge him with anything until these people do something on the American people are on the border in other words if they flood across the border and cause all sorts of mayhem inhabit\nThen you've got you've got a case against them or you can call it humanitarian aid up until then for anybody who's feeding this caravan of folks but there is somebody who's doing it so they certainly need to be called out in the open so we

going to do about it\nAnd anonymous gay male step forward today and released a shocking description of how he was sexually assaulted by senator Cory Booker back in twenty four team\nMan claims of motor came to his workplace to speak met him as he was coming out of the men's room and then pulled them back into the restroom and sexually assaulted them the young man is gain and he's a Democrat\nMan tells very detailed analysis on what took place it as work the man says he reached out to Ronan Farrow but the meat to reporter didn't show any interest in his story\nThe gateway pundit reached out to his attorney ... who told them demand is considering the situation as no further comment at this time\nSo yesterday the accuser posted accused Twitter uh he accused Twitter a shadow banning his tweets\nI actually tested that myself when I made my last post six hours ago\nAnd it certainly appears to be suppressed as of now it doesn't look to be the case anymore so says at Twitter was shadow man you know that is right they don't let you know the ... who can see your tweets we get this all the time I Will treat out some of them go well I Know how many\nTwitter followers were again now I don't know what I'm saying [noise] uh Eighteen point two thousand Twitter followers so I'll tweet out something that I Know\nEverybody scene and then I'll retweeted and re tweeted and it gets no response that I Know if you knew this you'd be going crazy goes to some of the left wing doesn't want anybody to know [noise]\nAnd it'll get one or two you know likes or you know whatever or re tweets and then that's it and I'm going Eighteen thousand folks out there and they're not they latch on to this I don't think so I don't think so for instance\nLet me give you a sibling check listening to maybe take me admitted to find that you remember um when was this yesterday or was that earlier I towards somebody sent me a picture\nOf\nList this year it was yesterday wasn't sent me a picture of this postcard this being sent out and um\nIt is a postcard that sent out and it's got vote November six year vote will matter more than ever I'm voting I'm volunteering to write this because the stakes are so high and it wants you to vote Phil Bredesen is post Marc Boston\nFan written so we talked about this yesterday and we got people from Oregon and everywhere else they're saying yeah we are getting these things to turns out there's this Facebook page that was set up now they're saying this is organic and ... and if he says grassroots and all this stuff\nHow many people have that kind of money to sit put postage stamp some amateurs and you know you buy the card a but the expensive part is the postage on each one to send them all over the I mean there are tens of thousands of these things going out all over the country and they're saying well this is just a couple of volunteers are doing this\nWithdrawal resources money of course but it's just a couple of volunteers\nSo I'm looking this I put this on Twitter and it got a hundred and Thirteen ... tweets hundred and Thirteen ... so what's interesting is it wasn't\nI to me when you got Eighteen thousand folks in I retreated a couple of times\nYou know hundreds that's that's nothing you know a hundred and thirty one folks retweeted the thing and about a hundred and Thirteen\nPeople liked it and you can think there's some overlap in there they liked it and then re tweeted it so you got that going on so I'm going okay well this seems rather\nSuspicious so we put this thing on Facebook\nAnd on Facebook they got thousands of shares so\nWhat's the deal with Twitter my only conclusion is is that most of those Eighteen thousand people never saw it even though we tweeted it and re tweeted it and ... they never saw it because somebody a Twitter doesn't want you to see it\nAnd that's the trouble some thing it would be one thing if Twitter told me up front hey we don't like you and conservative so we're not going to anybody see this and then I wouldn't waste my time\nBut on Facebook it got six thousand people that this thing reached and they got all sorts of ... years and all sorts of\nComments that's just on one of our Facebook page is the one that we can see the stance the other one we can't even see the stands\nSo you can ... and the other one we have more people probably you know I Would say at least I don't know six seven eight thousand people reached which is understandable out of it you know Eighteen thousand\nBut she got Eighteen thousand people follow him on Twitter and only a hundred and thirty one feel motivated enough to either like it or retweeted\nThat's because most of the Eighteen thousand never saw it\nAnd they don't want you to see it again when it comes to Twitter Facebook and things like this I'm a big believer\nAnd this is the private market you know I mean if you want to do this but you need the law needs to be that you if you're going to do this kind of thing you need to tell people up front so we don't waste their time with you will feel you know they're left wing\nBut I Know but I mean there are campaigns out there with me in a no big deal if somebody didn't retweet my thing 'cause it's not going to mean anything to me but if you're running for office and part of your strategy is social media\nAnd then you don't know that half the stuff you're putting on social media as being ... by some social media giant out they didn't want anybody to see it\nWhat does that do as far as the campaign is concerned your message does it get out\nThat's where we got this new world of trouble folks\nThat's where we need that's where we need some sort of law for full disclosure I you know again it's a private company they want a frontal conservatives they want to kick in certain fine but listen to all this stuff up front before we start wasting our time sending out a bunch of stuff on a campaign where we're trying to reach voters\nIn the meantime registering a dead people down in Texas so you know and they're ...\nYou know [laughter] by the way what happens once you're deceased what happened to your Twitter account\nWhat was your Facebook account is out there forever want you to say she has a lot of people that we known over the years that have actually passed away their their pages are still up pages you still up here so somebody would have to take it down I guess yes I guess probably they didn't share their\nYou know as we are yeah they do ... and all that so that that the pages stays active\nYeah so you're

get to the bottom of this I Would take myself to San Pedro Sula\nAnd start nosing around down there and see where this thing starts if you see some folks started to congregate look around and find somebody with a megaphone\nAnd uh some folks with tents set up and everything else and then start asking some questions where are you folks whose funding you and all that probably won't get an answer from them but if you stick around long enough\nYou know I Would think with the CIA the we have that's in every corner of the globe somebody's going to hear something about who's funding this thing and I'm telling you it's going to be some left wing organization like sorrows\nThat is funding this thing to send these people to the border to create chaos well look and I'm not joking about this could
