give us a call that eight hundred seven three six three six six six\nWould like to know what you think about Amazon raising the minimum wage to Fifteen dollars an hour for all of its employees you know this is part of a trend and the reason seems to be as unemployment goes down it gets harder and harder to find workers and sometimes there's a big companies say well you know are going to have to start paying these people more if we're going to attract some decent workers\nA lot of workers around the country have been pushing for a Fifteen dollar minimum wage uh there's a movement called fight for Fifteen that's been holding demonstrations all around the country the last couple of beers\nAnd they say that this is a way to fix wage inequality they say it will boost consumer spending because these workers will now have more money to spend at places like\nAmazon and other folks say that the producers opportunities from climate especially for people like teenagers and others who are looking for entry level or low skill jobs and they say that\nA mandating a minimum wage is difficult on some smaller companies because they can't afford it and what usually happens is the or some other folks end up being edged out of a job because they are companies can't afford it\nBut we've been seeing a lot of companies responding to all this pressure a target raised its minimum wage for new hires to twelve bucks an hour last month and they say they're going to\nBy the end of twenty twenty Disney has reached a deal with its unions to pay a minimum of Fifteen dollars an hour at places like a Disneyland and Disney World Walmart which is the country's largest private sector employer they've got more than a million workers here they raised their minimum wage to eleven dollars back I think it was in February and now Amazon\nIs following suit so let's get some details on exactly what we're talking about ... feet Justin about\nMichael the minimum wage increase will go into effect at Amazon on November first it applies to fulltime part-time and temporary workers at the company it impacts around two hundred and fifty thousand employees and one hundred thousand seasonal staff\nIt not just workers at Amazon who are getting a raise the Fifteen dollars an hour minimum will also apply to whole foods employees\nCritics including Senator Bernie Sanders have targeted Amazon in recent months after workers complained of stressful working conditions in low pay\nAmazon senior vice president Jay Carney said they've heard the criticism and that's why they've decided to act\nAs part of our culture to examine ourselves see if we're doing the right thing and a Senator Sanders was was one of the people we listen to a among many and when we saw the opportunity to raise wages at Amazon with decided we wanted to lead it\nAmazon is among the largest employers in the u._s. it's added more American Jobs in the past decade than any other company a move like this often causes other companies to follow suit in order to compete for employees Carney said that's what they hope will happen\nAnd this is really about America's workforce and you know we've seen as wages depressed for a long time and a lot and they're beginning to end shop\nAmazon is also going to begin lobbying for an increase in the federal minimum wage\nDo you know at seven dollars and twenty five cents an hour or Amazon Fifteen dollar of this war is now more than twice the federal minimum wage and hopefully Congress will take action to raise that\nSenator Sanders introduced a bill last month called the Doppler based does act ... sounded Amazon the legislation would tax large employers and won their workers need to rely on public benefits like food stamps Michael\nThank you Steve ... Hassan bomb and Bernie is happy about this by the way he put out a statement saying it was a wonderful thing and Jeff Bezos responded by thanking senator he says we're excited about this and also hope others will join in\nFact they are as a as Steve mentioned they're going to start putting some pressure on Congress to list the national minimum at twenty nine states now have their own minimum wages which are higher than the federal additive seven dollars and twenty five cents\nThe Amazon median pay last year was a twenty eight thousand four hundred forty six dollars and that comes out to\nMorning how are you I'm fine how are you doing in Fort republic I'm not sure I Know where that is\nNot too far from Lake City maybe twenty minutes alright so what do you think about this place um we had a couple of new casinos open and the first of all I think the federal government or stay out of it I think the marketplace can handle it and so\nI mean if if a company is going to hire you seven dollars an hour what more quality of work or are they going to get someone to fourteen or Fifteen dollars an hour\nYou know Amazon has also putting some pressure on local and state governments there because you know they've got this big second headquarters that they they're opening and they're dangling in front\nOf about twenty cities across the country right now like Atlanta Chicago right here in Washington DC and these local community and they just throwing caution and they when they are throwing millions of dollars at Amazon will build your highways ... infrastructure we won't pay taxes for a hundred years they're giving away millions and millions of dollars to bring those companies in\nAnd they want to be able to tell the people who are saying you're spending our tax money yes but they're coming in with Fifteen dollar an hour job so it's not just the federal government they're applying pressure on I think I think this is more actually about the state and local governments want that all those thousands and thousands and thousands of jobs that are going to come with their second headquarters so\nYou know part of it may be done and trying to be nice part of it is also trying to be nice to themselves\nAnd also part of it is they're getting into politics um you know they have already there's announcing that he's talking and Bernie Sanders next thing you know he's behind the scenes beaming up what George Soros son who knows maybe he's going to run for president\nHe might he might alright listen thanks for the call I appreciate the call back again let's go up to Sioux Falls South Dakota west and good\nMorning bank learning how you doing\nWe're great here how's everything up and they sent me a lawsuit falls area I've been there a couple of times I like it very much\nBobby Bobby while you know it's early out there too you know a ... which is a\nBar South Dakota weather but anyways um I like this is good I mean the Amazon or whether whether they're choosing to do this because of market forces a supply and demand employees more\nIn this case I Believe it has a little bit more to do with the political pressure and the way that they're going to let the public uh because of some of the negative stories that have been out lately about working conditions and a model that they're receiving but\nBob ...\nPresident in my industry and the trucking industry by what you see in our our wages go up significantly due to uh the regulations and also the um the demand for drivers um\nAnd so I think the market takes care of it at all I'm like the last place I worked at and we couldn't get anyone qualified to apply unless we are starting wage was like Nineteen twenty bucks an hour ...\nMom and I think that that's kinda how uh the\nMarket should work I mean if you aren't happy with what you're making no one's forcing you to work that job you can always go out and try to learn a skill that would require that would allow you to charge more for your time we we all set our minimum wage kind of what\nThe what we're willing to do for our time\nAnd your job I'm In that regard requires a lot of training doesn't it you just don't hop in there and drive away

Democrats the story here also says\nZero money went to Republicans on a hundred and twenty six thousand eight hundred eighty six dollars to Democrats just on the Judiciary Committee and zero two Republicans and these are taxpayer dollars that the Democrats get in the appropriations process they funnel it\nTo the death called and the death called funnels it back to them it's a nice arrangement

out that Donald Trump's father was rich and then they found out so it was Donald Trump\nBecause you know in keeping with the spirit of the magma Carter\nA Donald Trump's father Britain Trump wanted to see to it that much of his accumulated fortune went to his children instead of tendency below sea so that they could a fund Planned Parenthood or whatever but the Democrats say they loved Planned Parenthood more than life itself\nThey love that's more than we love life had kind of the Democratic party versus the Republican Party\nRepublican Party has the pro life party generally not all

various other places that they had to draft the magna quarter to limit the powers of the evil king king John\nAnd built into there is that a widow should be allowed to keep the or whatever property and fortune\nHer late husband had amassed it say concept that western civilization codified\nIn the year twelve Fifteen and the thirteenth century the Democrats don't believe in these basic principles of western culture in western civilization because they're the left they're not really they're not normal people there they're crazy people there are a lot of crazy people\nBut you know the the the trouble died from hell of al ... an ISIS radical Islam is\nBlood drenched jihad is through bay the blood of innocence kind of like the Democrats um they ah they used to say that they would win because they would say we love death more than you love life\nThat's what I say about westerners that we love life we live our lives we like to stay alive and not be butchered by savages and um and they love death because they well they do that I loved that they've proven over and over again they're savages and uh\nThey shouldn't be destroyed and President Trump said a very good job of that by the way not bronco by my he let them spread like herpes or Nineteen eighties but President Trump has stamped out\nUh and and ah I don't think the Democrats are happy about that they don't like talking about that very much but the truth is just as I said just to say we loved as more than your love life the Democrats love deaths more than we love life and that's kind of what this whole fight about Brett Kavanaugh as his really that's the subtext of this whole thing is that like ISIS and al ... they loved\nThat more than we love life so they're fighting and they're fighting and they're fighting\nAnd let me say that that I think right now\nOn the president was and fight go last night um should have said what he said maybe you shouldn't have but a lot of it was pretty funny did you see the

Mississippi I Believe a black man named Tom Robinson was accused of Robin Williams falsely by a white woman of raping her\nAnd he didn't do it but the town was up in arms about it because this young white woman\nSaid that Tom Robbins Senate black man had raped her so they put together a trial and everything and they were going to a ... a bunch of certainly Democrats looming around outside spool enough rope get ready to Lynch Tom Robinson till Adams Atticus Finch came along\nAnd he wanted to do the right thing and teaches kids a good moral lesson in the process\nAnd he's one of the great heroes American literature Atticus Finch and I'm looking for Atticus Finch and the story because I the way my mother raised me in this society I was raised in there are two kinds of people in the world the kind that see a Lynch mob and\nWant to join us ... now and then there are the kind that see a Lynch mob and want to stop it\nAnd I'd like to be part of the group that wants to stop the Lynch mob because the truth is that this is Brett Kavanaugh jumped on Fifteen year old Christine Blasey Ford when he was Seventeen and scared the bejesus out of her well\nThat would be a terrible thing but I've got a whole lot of reason to not believe that that happened\nShe said it happened I Believe that she believes that it happened\n[noise] I don't know whether she came to this conclusion and repressed memory therapy which seems to me would be one of the first questions that should be asked about where we can do this now and nobody has gone through the ABCs you know they've investigated in a ... a logical sort of way Brett Kavanaugh and his past\nExamining his high school yearbook and Senate committees with idiot senators pointing to doodles what is ... what is it hot or know how to pronounce that what is what is blue fin and it's something you apparently do in your office where their staff on a regular basis\nSenator but you know in there and in my high school mind at that time it was a reference to flatulence and this is what they're covering view I don't know if it's ... or move how do you pronounce that\nI don't know how do you pronounce that senator or you're the booth for in the room you where you go ahead and figure it out yourself but he's part of the Lynch mob that were Sheldon Whitehouse he is dumb as a during a backpack and um and then and they're putting all this other stuff now and again the second one we've got this um\n[noise] Julie sweating ... whose boyfriend has now come out the former\nDemocrat candidate for Congress and said that her own father is what next own father said that she's too crazy to work on a Democrat house campaign\nCrazy nuts her own father hoarding her ex boyfriend a democratic candidate for Congress at one point and he told her that she enjoyed\nGroup sex with multiple mad at the same time that's what they told me he said he's got to be bullied because he's a Democrat that's why the New York times just\nDidn't cover the story the most insidious power at the news media has the power to ignore the New York times is ignoring the story the Washington Post is ignoring the story NBC ABC CBS CNN MSNBC they're ignoring the story because it doesn't help the party line\nBut it looks pretty darn credible to me and he of course submitted vis vis a lesser the former Democratic candidate to Congress Dennis cat her there was a weatherman for channel seven in Washington DC for many years I remember him being the weatherman on channel seven in Washington DC\nIs no longer but he used to date Julie sweat Nick\nWho explained to him that she enjoyed group sex with lots of man and her\nNow this is a problem I think when she's one of the kids are she shouldn't be kicked to the curb she's a joke you shouldn't pay any attention to hurt all\nThat that she just she was just one of our callers pointed out yesterday while she was doing it every year with will obey or Kate Snow or whoever ... she was smiling and laughing and betting arise while talking about her own gang rape which doesn't make any sense in any context and certainly not in the context of the last couple of weeks Alan Dershowitz\nSaid that have Julie sweating to glide she should be tried for perjury and go to prison or the church is trying to\nDestroy someone would fall so I think it's pretty clear at this point nobody even knows ... she gave foreign names to NBC News when they did this big blockbuster interview with her which they said they couldn't confirm anything that she said but they went with it anyway because they're on the team and\nThey're here to take care of 'em\nKevin are down there part of the Democratic effort\nSaid that sweating it gave NBC News for names two of them may get a hold of it and get back to NBC News one of them said she'd never heard of Joyce right back and forth was dead which makes it hard to get any information out of that one\nAnd a trip to believe her as a joke so boom kicked that were just check that box throw it out the window that's a joke and\nThen you've got the second one the Ramirez woman from Yale new says that he ... under the New York times what they interviewed at least three dozen people that's thirty six people several dozen people they said at least\nMany of whom told the New York times that they had spoken to ms Ramirez in the proceeding week because you know the New Yorker had been talking to her and they had been shopping the story around to various news outlets that were published should and only the New Yorker bit because what do they care and\nWhat are they a news organization or some W ridiculous and um the New York times that they talked to a bunch of repels that ship spoken to just sit in the day's proceedings and that she had told her old friends that she couldn't remember who it was ...\nWhen she was a freshman at Yale but then she said what the\nHeck after talking to my lawyer and spending six days thinking about it I'll go ahead and tell the New Yorker that I was cabin up so you can forget about her because she has no credibility to joke just throw these people up you know you don't have to be a lawyer that you just play one on the radio and a good enough and then you're back to of course a doctor Christine\nBlasey Ford and her ... her allegations and President Trump a battered her a bit last night with some stuff that didn't make the Democrats and by the Democrats on the news media very happy president triplets actually go to President Trump since where here\nAh and President Trump last night or what is what does that start number nine [noise] um he was talking about Kevin Oh this is the big rally or last night President Trump where a man yelled I Love you\nAnd President Trump responded I Love you to you're not really my type\nOf but I Love you and it was fun a President Trump that the big rally last night talking about wind but Democrats have and that's apparently the right word of it will suffice anyway hey Brett Kavanaugh said this is also part of their crusade which has been ongoing for many years\nTo make all things normal appear abnormal while simultaneously making making all things abnormal appear normal\nNo I mean that's that's their program that's it and to subvert the constitution and of course the will of the people whenever the opportunity presents himself Donald Trump last night talking about the Democrats and their relationship with the judge Brett Kavanaugh\nPaula Yemen and all they really know how to do is them straw breezes destroy\n[noise] yards Kavanaugh\nSaid he wasn't\nEven a will follow the constitution as [noise] that\nThey don't want bad bad but that can be a big problem for them the constitution and it's a quite a nuisance to the left wherever you go big problem President Trump then\nThe news media went after he did point out a few things about Christine Blasey Ford's um [noise] memory issues I think it would be fair to say that she has memory issues and since this entire fiasco\nIs based on a test of her memory and I think it is relevant and valid to suggest that questions about her memory are hurting them ... to\nA what we are talking about here and a President Trump last ...\nYears this time I\nWas wondering how did you get home I don't remember how did you get there I don't remember where is the place I don't remember how many\n[noise]\nAnd I

people who I oh why oh why oh softer work I go\nAnd that's why I talk so much about the importance on living on less than what you make one saving money\nEach and every month each and every pay period we in the United states culturally are terrible at that the average American saves around three cents for each dollar he or she makes\nAnd if you listen to me for a long time you know that that compares or poorly a lot of other countries in the world where it's routine that people save thirty percent\nOf what they make but there is a counter movement in the United states are people who think heavily influenced by what they saw happened to so many people getting crushed\nLast decade by the great recession that people have become fears about living on less than what they make certainly not everybody but it's even got a name the FIRE movement\nAnd it's about being financially independent so you can retire early but not necessarily retire early it's really about the first two letters financial independence where you didn't have the choice\nWhat you want to do with your life\nAnd the people that are big and the FIRE movement are also big into austerity sometimes too extreme with

you have to live in independent life and be comfortable it's all about the lifestyle you become comfortable with it so the key as a ratio is a formula and it's pretty simple\nYou save money to the point that he was saved twenty five times the amount of money that it costs to live in one year and once you hit that target whether it's in your thirties forties fifties sixties or never\nThat's when you know you have enough money built up for the lifestyle you've grown accustomed to\nThat you can afford to live in definitely on the money you've saved and it I Know that it's an oversimplification but it really is that simple Susie you went on to say the power\nThat you need at least five or six million really you might need ten million dollars\nTo retire securely and respectfully I strongly disagree with what Suzie said there are people who easily can get by for the rest of their lives when they hit the point they've saved a million dollars\nBut this is a perfect example of a reason to

S. cars are going to cost so that more and if they stay in Mexico there's also a two and a half percent tariff so if you're buying it twenty thousand dollar car\nOr you pay an extra five hundred dollars to get not a better car a fancy car bus same cars more expensive but\nThe workers are going to be paying what are the least sixteen dollars an hour at least forty percent of this ring\nYeah but out of consumers pocket so it's not a net and it's a redistribution\nYeah and I see what you're saying I think what he was trying to get people are saying well they're trying to get the wages in the United states I don't know many car places if you don't already paying at least sixteen dollars an hour for hopes to manufacture cars and I think this was designed to keep so many of the car manufacturers from going to Mexico\n\nWhich just a shame because of the average ... factory wage and the U.S has already about Seventeen dollars and fifty cents [laughter] um but if you preserve the manufacturing jobs that punch workers from moving to jobs in the service sector or pay is actually about a dollar higher on average\nSo for fulltime job you're talking about two thousand bucks a year

read the whole thing and I'm trying to figure out where is this going\nPam Rose Evans ... you know this guy is okay he's a writer and as\nSoon as I get the story here I'm at and we may put it up after all that we're talking about I tell you everything we talk about we put on there but he's saying that um Kavanaugh Kavanaugh was on the kittens start when they were investigating Bill Clinton right\nAnd a ham roast evidence Pritchard says that judge Kavanaugh when he wasn't on drugs them but when he was on the uh Ken Starr committee that he was obsessed with the Vince Foster death now the interesting part is\nWas concerned because he had seen photographs from the crime scene that showed a bullet hole through the neck the cause of death and I'm not going to refine the whole Vince Foster thing but if you remember this this is you know he worked in the Clinton Administration and he was found dead at Fort Marcy park\nAnd uh they they eventually rooted a self inflicted gunshot wound in his mouth well some of the photograph\nCrime scene were lost but somebody kept the copy of one or two of them and they showed a what looked like a bullet wound injury\nTo the neck which would you know there was also a bullet wound to the head which was telling your shop myself in the neck I didn't get the job done so and is your most over there that doesn't make sense it in other words\nThe insinuation is that he was murdered and commit suicide and Kavanaugh was one of those who was vigorously wanting to get to the bottom of that when he was on the can start\nCommittee\nAnd so that's another thing you know people have said he's he's made reference to the Clintons around again and boy he was on the Ken Starr committee and the Clintons have hated his guts since then he actually interviewed Bill Clinton for some of this stuff too and ask some very pressing questions about his genitalia [noise]\nWhich I don't think that's been all been made public either but that's another story so am Rowse says that um\nWhen it got down to it and there was a guy named uh McGill gave him his name was ... it was one of the people that was working on it\nAnd this person was working on the star thing and resigned out of protest because\nThey had been told to drop this whole thing of up in foster being murdered Kavanaugh was one of those who was vigorously pursuing this and they say Ambrose says the cabin or just jumping the line with the rest of them because he didn't want to ruin his career I think that was the gist of it you got to the bottom paragraph\nWell in the process of this and I don't know where the Ambrose was working for news max or whatever but he mentioned Chris Ruddy now Chris Rock is a friend of mine he he runs Newsmax\nA I say a friend of mine I don't know if you've ever met in person but we've emailed back and forth a thousand times over the years about different stuff and we was first starting out with Newsmax we used to go back and forth a lot last conversations I've had with them as they wanted to run a and inconsistent truth on Newsmax TV and so we made a deal do that and\nUh they rented for a year or so I don't want us to running a anyway so I put it in an email to Christ that was going to respond and say did you read the ham roast beef to mention you do you have any idea what the hell he's talking about\nThat's supposed to be the latest or reason why we can't put a cabin on the Supreme Court is because he went out on the Vince Foster saying\nWell if you remember that time and I do with the time I mean those of us who were pursuing the Vince Foster thing oh we were the tin foil hat people in the rest of it and cabinet are probably got to a point where if the higher up saying that we're not going to do this what am I supposed to do you know I mean I pushed it as far as I can push it\nI can just go outside of Ken Starr and the rest of them as you say we're going to invest this is a murder and but this is a murder\nSo if if he if he folded the tent that's what he's supposed to do he's a subordinate in this investigation he's not running the investigation you press your case about what you want to do that we're seeing the movies about the CIA folks like Jack Ryan and all that stuff\nWell they press their point about what may think by are up should do in the higher ups make the call and you do what they say you don't say well I wanted to do so and that what you would have if everybody that's in an investigation it's either going to go their own path\nThen it would be absolute chaos so I don't if Kavanaugh folded the tent after making his case about Vince Foster and didn't get his way that's just the way it is\nFor them rose things that he shouldn't be on the Supreme Court because of it is kinda weird but that's just the latest weird thing that's coming up\nWhen it's the best time to talk to your family\nAbout staying in touch during a disaster\nFloodwaters Richard [noise]\nAre engulfing the edge of

recall a lot of details\nPayment fading facts that we're getting during her forte testimony and it has to make a decision based on those attacks the Sanders and the white\nHouse is OK if the FBI is not to separate interviews with Ford in ... cents each delivered extensive testimony to the Judiciary Committee a lawyer for forty at least indicated she was not contacted as of Tuesday nights but Gostin teeny little White House\nAnd you guys covered this very well in the movie so which is wrong much got bean came in in a in a Janine Turner I Believe within their little bit too I'm\nYeah I'm Sarah Jane Mars is really the lead attorney in the movie and she's absolutely amazing she didn't give the terrific rarely rarely emotionally raw performance it it it's a great movie I mean I really even though I directed it\nHighly recommend [laughter] well\nNow tell me about you you you've gotten some pushback from Planned Parenthood of some of these screenings amateur\nWell there was a there was a screening that was a scheduled to be in the same hotel at the same time as the Planned Parenthood I'm your fundraising event or something and so they didn't really get that screening canceled it was\nThey got it moved they they uh they talked to a hotel and to you know canceling the gods now screening and and the guy's not screening went on it it went on it a different place\nSo they didn't want you at the same places they weren't room\nYeah that would be a real bummer fell\nMore than what I [laughter] wow so you've done readings across the country right already on this thing\nYeah we've been in probably twenty five thirty city I'm so far and you know\nTomorrow it's been great and really it's a for me to direct period it's been great to just sort of here in audience respond\nTo it I've been sitting in a little room you know editing it and showing it to a few friends so it was great to see to experience what an audience felt when they saw it\nAnd you're going to be there tomorrow night right\nYou betcha I'll be in a I'll be in Nashville tomorrow for the screening I met in Raleigh North Carolina tonight we're going to do one and then a\nTelephone line 'cause we got a list there is over there so if people are in Raleigh where is this thing tonight\nTonight it's sad to see it is that the um AMC theater at fifty five o one athletic springs road in Raleigh\nOkay well so people that are in that area can go see it there as well the folks in the national or go see them are like so you you're going to do a cue inane about this is that after the movies that ring\nYeah after the movie and people will be able to ask me questions like why didn't you do it that way\nOr were you thinking and why did you use that shot Mick I mean I don't understand that\nYeah and after you have your head did it ever grow back [laughter]\n[laughter] well tell us about because I Want to ask you about you know being an actor in Hollywood and obviously the I I say obviously I was saying that you're a a little bit more on the conservative side is that right\nYeah so and yes people are as the as such yeah\nWhat does that ... hinder your getting gigs in that town\nWhile it may you know there there's certainly a lot of things that go on and I think well why am I not that I mean obviously better than that guy [laughter] but now you know it may and then sometimes it helps me and\nI mean I I must say it's never been something that you know if if they don't give you a job they don't call you up and tell you why\nRight um but all I can say is you know I get enough work I'm doing fine I don't really I'm not afraid of it any more\nPeople know where I stand in if if they don't want to work with me because of that than I probably don't want to work with them\nWill have you seen this are gone up a few notches since Trump gotten office\nYeah it's been it's been a lot of gray are definitely people or people in Hollywood you really feel a liberated in terms of like speaking out against against shop and against people who agree with Charles or whatever but\nLike I said I mean I I I continue to work I I I Know people that are on the left side they know where I stand either they don't want to tangle with me or they\nDon't care to or whatever I mean I I really have not a I have not any experienced any direct confrontation because of my politics\nWill you just you know going on behind the scenes\nIn which you know I mean this is something you don't bring this stuff up on the set anyway I mean you know people don't know no no and I\nCan say I think that I'm not never done that because I think it's unfair I think you know you\nWhen you say if you're an actor there's a certain hierarchy on a set and you're you're kind of start blowing off about your opinion and there's a lot of people there who may disagree with you but they can't say anything because an actor you know could say that guy's bothering me and that person is gone\nYou know so it it's just an unfair situation for actors to start\n... about politics on set so I never do that\nYou know I don't blame you so some are line seven as long as I said you're going to film at one time dot com does a\nLogo from the movie goes now that you can click on and get tickets is limited to two and I don't know where we are as far as the houses concern when I was talking with John Sullivan or emailing back with him and he says we're doing extremely well so I guess we're getting close to the capacity so people need to review these tickets\nYeah and and and if it can get tickets I Would say\nGo at any one income just go ahead and come because a lot of people there the tickets are free so people sign up for 'em and then they don't show up right so you know will we will have room for you want to see this movie comes here\nOkay so that will be tomorrow night at seven o'clock in the regal\nA Hollywood twenty seven that's a in a hundred oaks here's the central located great theater too 'cause they did our movie for a week so we did an inconsistent truth and\nThey're very really going to work with people that were there and it's a great theater they have the you know they have everybody's moving to this um where they have the big reclining seats and all that and they got all that going on over the Hollywood twenty seven too so it's a really great facility\nFor I don't want them to recline too far they might go to sleep\n[laughter] Johnny ... has been known to do that in the movie you're too All right Nick ... we'll see you tomorrow night at the Hollywood twenty seven and safe travels my friend are you going to be there I'm going to be there absolutely wide open in the next winter oh great well I look forward to meeting you I think you very much All right thank you\nMary mixers he's the director of God and now we also stars in it to a that'll be tomorrow night Bollywood twenty seven here in Nashville if you folks in Raleigh as he told you the theater there um and you can do as well so it's it's the preview in this thing and a lot of different places you might remember um the passion to Christ\nUm Mel Gibson came through and did this is what happens when you get pushback from Hollywood as far as distribution is concerned [noise]\nAnd I saw a male was I think he was he blazed the trail with a movie that's been a while ago\nBut I got invited to go to that special screening and then a Mel Gibson was there and a Ricky Skaggs invited me as a matter of fact and he was there and a bunch of you know a bunch of different people in the media people that kind of stuff and um they were going around and showing the movie a different churches like several months we saw it\nI don't know how many months before it came out I mean it wasn't like a week or so it was several months forget it was it was so far in advance\nThat Jesus his eyes were still blue from where we do you mean by that or she Jim Comey Zulu play Jesus in there you had to go in the electron his blue eyes so they had to go in and electronically changes eyes to brown you know so that they would it'd be more authentic\nAnd when we saw in his eyes were blue and so they wouldn't they changed it for the movie but Mel Gibson was there and they showed the movie and it was I remember it was just so powerful ... came down to the front and\nUh took some questions I asked him a question it was very good about that and he knew the matter of fact my thing that's when he set up its own distribution company to actually get the movie unseen isn't nothing ended up doing monster business because Hollywood did not want to distribute the movie and\nSo he said screw it I'll sit on my own distribution company and he did\nAnd they did and it became a monster hit and then what happened after that is Hollywood started putting out some movies sort of similar to what they didn't quite hit the mark because of the Christ was I mean that was a powerful if you've never seen that movie or you need to see because it is absolutely phenomenal\nBut that's what you have to do and a lot of these movies in Hollywood doesn't want you to see it's really you know it's really sad news saying we live in a free society but we really in many cases dome we got ... keepers out there I often tell you about the media bias not what they tell you is what they don't\nSame thing with the movies is not what they show us what they don't\nAnd you have no idea how many great movies are not distributed in that scene because the Hollywood gatekeepers don't want you to see um it's kind of disturbing actually but we are going around again tomorrow night in Nashville the regal Hollywood twenty seven my hands on those folks for um\nFor stepping up and allowing the venue to somebody at seven o'clock in the Knicks
