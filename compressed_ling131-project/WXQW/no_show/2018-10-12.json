whether actually they are that are ... the question is that they know that they sat factories where the weapons are being converted as an injury the red dye\nAnd this is less carrying the people and that and I did not come out and say how hiding in Lebanon and we all know that everybody knows that and they kind of put that\nBut he came out and said something much more interesting and much more

of outside playing baseball and running around but you know what\nIt has a I think helped to make me the person that I Am I Love to read one of the problem for me was when I went to college by the time I got into college I had to read so much for school work and then after college\nWorking in journalism and having to keep up on things that I had to read so many newspapers in periodicals and ban books about current events I didn't have time to read for pleasure and for a long time I did not read for pleasure I only read for work and I lost my my love of it it was a it became part of a ... job\nAnd I almost never got to read fiction for a long time until\nI discovered back then it was called ... books on tape and you get these little cassettes in a box and they would come in the mail and you'd have to uh\nI I think I don't remember how we ordered them to address was even before the Internet [laughter]\nI was really around and now it would it would come in the mail and it'd be a box and you can listen to them in the car which was amazing and I when I discovered that I'm not going to listen to music any more than a car I'm going to listen to books and I've been hooked on listening to books ever since I hardly ever read anything\nIt's in terms of uh novels I Would never get to read a novel and enjoy being in the world at an author creates for me and losing myself in that\nWithout being able to listen to it so now and I'm not driving to work or I'm making dinner or cleaning up the house or doing yard work by ... going\nAnd I get lost in the world of the novel that way and I find I have better attention if a book is read to me than if I read it myself which is interesting I guess I'm a more\nUh bought a Tory person and then in a miserable person\nUm I Do still read books occasion I've always got at least one hardcover book in the family room that I Will pick up but most of my reading comes from listening right now I can tell you what I have in my phone which is how I listen I'm listening to a Doris Kearns Goodwin is a brand new book or\nA leadership and she talks about the events in the life of four presidents that she has devoted her life to covering a theater Roosevelt Franklin Roosevelt Lyndon Johnson\nAnd Abraham Lincoln and it is fascinating I mean just in in one day yesterday just driving home from work I was thrilled I was having such a thrilling experience running up San Juan hill with Teddy Roosevelt and the rough riders and the Spanish American war and then by the time I got home and I was making some lunch in the kitchen I ... I was tearing up\nAnd and having goose bumps and listening to her account of Franklin Roosevelt coming back from polio and having to make a national uh parents at a democratic convention to place the name of somebody in nomination to run for president the Al Smith\nWho is had been the governor of New York and he had to practice for for months to be able to walk\nFrom the back of the stage up to the podium and it was it was an incredible overcoming of this disability that had taken over his life in a disability that changed him and made him the man who became one of our greatest presidents\nAnd you know I it was to both of those things thrilling and and being moved immensely all by the same books in the space of an hour only books can do that for us but are we still reading books well the Pew Research center says that\nUm overall Americans read an average of twelve books for a year but that's kind of misleading because of the real figures show that a lot of us are reading a lot of books and a lot of us don't read it also when you average it out\nFor for the average American the average American reeds for books every year and that's it's been that way for about a\nAh goes back to the twenty eleven\nSo I'm you know that's that's a that's a good I guess that the that that we are still reading but I Wonder about our kids are they going to read that got the short attention spans the Twitter generation\nUh you know it doesn't exactly Lund oneself to wanting to read a book that takes you know maybe a week or twenty or thirty hours of your time to get through so we'll have to see what happens\nJudges in certain states where they were elected are owned by corporations you know and I did not know how that was working in the rights a novel you write your story but he's also giving you kind of a factual backdrop so that's kind of interesting so it's a good combination\nAre thanks so much for the call appreciate it ... let's go to Henrietta in Annapolis, Maryland good morning what are you reading ...\nGood morning a well right now I'm lady on a book to read by I'm On Rosa ...\nYeah ... what do I don't know about her experience in the White House die\nYeah so I'm On holiday alive or is it that way\n[laughter] and there's a line for that one of all I guess it was I think it was on the bestseller list there for a few weeks so that's interesting so you want to get them behind the scenes stuff exactly\nBut by and just like you I Love ...

also a very interesting book because it talks about the scam of law schools\nBecause you know he's he's himself as a lawyer so he tends to write about the law and I learned a lot about law schools that I didn't know before while also enjoying of you know a fairly good story so you know as I say the critics don't like him because he turns these things out one after another it seems like at least

survive this\nNow I've said that on the air you're going to try to go in and steal money from vanguard aren't you Debbie is with us on the Clark Howard\nShow Hi Debbie Hi there how are you oh I'm pretty good if you're thinking of doing some real estate investing is that right the scandal roundabout way [laughter] what are you waiting of doing [noise] well what it\nIs I had a little bit of money and um and then my mother just showed her home\nAnd she is\nOn it and said to get out so I had heard about this on on on the radio site um that's the same channel that I hear you want and they were advertising and sit in a vast and then it's a whole bunch of people together\nAnd then they on the ... games like stores and things like that that have actually credit and and now\nI Know it kind of tired and I never shy about All right so this is a private placement real estate deal where you go in with other people and you own\nA shopping centers or store locations or restaurant locations or whatever and you owned a real estate but it's not\nSo it was a publicly traded investment it's a form of what's referred to as a real estate investment trust and Ari IT\nOkay and with these what happens in a rate is the idea of them is that a bunch of people go together putting their money together and they can own a number of different\nPieces of real estate or types of real estate right what's different in this case and this is somebody has been a more and more popular is that these are like private gatherers the money so you can't go to\nA stockbroker and say you know I don't want to own that read anymore and then ten minutes later you don't own it any more\nWhen you buy and you own the big concern I have with any of the private offerings are the fees that you have to pay\nOkay and the fees to get in or usually high enough flight somebody's got to pay for that marketing that you heard on the radio station Canada fees\nMay make it not a good decision to go into I mean you got you got the two things one one Syria and you can't just hop out okay and to you got to look at the expenses so my preference and this what we're talking about here\nIs almost certainly not a scam\nBut I think there are better ways to do what you're interested in and that is buying what's known as a ... index find where you own little pieces of many many different\nOwners of real estate that might own shopping centers office buildings hotels you know full office parks whatever [noise] and so I like that more where your money is really spread out\nAcross the country and across lots of different places and you can buy and sell those instantly and you can own it and almost no cost for the management of the real estate\nOh okay like and and each has\nSo what happens with that depends on if you go in a retreat or wheat index funds so if you buy an actual publicly traded real estate investment trust they pay you back over time the the money you've invested and\nPotentially any earnings they're having\nIf you own I'm a ... index like I'm I just pulled up while we're talking and like here's one that twelve percent of it is and medical buildings\nSix percent and hotels I'm six percent is an industrial buildings\nFourteen percent is an office buildings sixteen percent as and apartments I mean that's you know and that's what they do they divide out all different buildings all different types\nAnd that way you're not subject to the risk of any one industry\nOkay and there are many of these available that you can buy I'm going to throw another term as she besides read which is sorry IT all the other is ATF exchange traded fund\nThat's how you would buy one of these you can many I mean by for free you know no commission going in and no commission going out and then just very very low management expenses each and every month\nOkay [laughter] and they're kind of shape compare to stock market [laughter]\nWell it it is a just a different form of investing you know real estate and if you ask somebody and oh five but for real estate was safe everybody would tell you it was the greatest by oh nine people would say it's a nightmare right right so it's all about diversifying what you do\nThis market is only risky in the short term not in the long term owning real estate is risky in the short term but not necessarily in the long term action\nSo going into a private placement and you know a a private\nVenture where you own different buildings that a lot riskier than owning a wide real estate investment trust to read because the money is not is diversified and\nYou're stuck with them if you want to be done with them and that makes me very uncomfortable with the one that's not publicly traded\nMates with us on the Clark Howard show how are you doing ... good how are your car great thank you you want to talk about your child's what's the story\nI sat down and the other day after listening to your show and I was going to freeze my child's credit but got gears turning and wondered if it would be a good thing to open a credit card in their name before doing that and the reason that the idea came up is when I was young getting my first\nCar loan I had no credit just like everybody else does so I thought maybe I could use the credit card in their name responsibly so that when they got all the age to need credit they could sort of hit the ground running what's already having a good history\nSo I just kind of wondered what you thought about that [noise]\nWell I liked the idea especially if your kid doesn't have possession of the card how old is your child\nBut I have a nine year old a seven year old a four year old so no it won't be using the card\nYeah I wouldn't I wouldn't worry about it yet they're too young to even to worry about establishing credit and the way this tablets and credit will work and let's say a decade\nCould be very different than it is today there's a lot of computer modeling that's being tested where the ability to grant credit will no longer necessarily be based on somebody having credit it can be based on things like how somebody does paying apartment rent\nOr like the cell phones we were just talking about how somebody does paying a cell phone bill Mitt there's behavioral\nAnalysis that is far more sophisticated\nAnd is considered to be potentially a much better predictor of how people will handle dad\nThan what we use right now with traditional credit scores so what are your kids as young as they are I think it would be at this point over thinking you know I thought you were gonna tell me you have a child who was like sixteen and that can be a good\nTime to start something like a\n... under today to them I say yes around eight I just remember when I\nTried to tried to start this when I was young is you know you start with no credit and it was just kind of frustrating 'cause nobody would even look at you with credit\nExactly well that's why it just kind of and they told me back then the best way to get credit was to use a credit card responsibly and then go from there\nAnd that advice is still is sound when you were told it man is it is today but by the time your kids are older I'm not sure that will be the advice\nHold so freezing their credit today you've got a lot of paperwork to do to freeze a child's credit but it sure is peace of mind for them because children are so much more likely to have their identities stolen than an adult\nAll it never even crossed my mind until you said you know somebody could use it without even knowing it which is totally true I just thought well you know they'll assume that it's a nine year old child they're down by a car but for me at all so\nI I'm Sorry about that I Wish that the credit reporting industry did a better job and didn't make it so easy for people to steal the identity of a child\nBut it would cost the industry more money for the software that would that would actually prevent Paul the children's in that instance that doesn't really hurt them that just hurts you and your kids they're not putting any effort into that\nSo that is why doing the child credit freeze is such a great idea and\nThe better solution would be the credit bureaus did their jobs more thoroughly and more conscientiously than they do today and we would be able to stop all of the rampant identity theft that goes on

plan [noise]\nAnd so we pay if I remember right it's Fifteen dollars a month and all of his share the one spot at five membership I say all of us I don't really listen to music so\nIt's wasted on me but it's something that we do as individuals and the family where each of us have our own playlists\nAnd it's all part of the one master subscription versus paying a typical one person membership for ten bucks Samy goes on with Netflix where we pay for being able to have multiple streams at a time\nAnd on YouTube TV we pay for the ability to have multiple streams at once each of us have our own unlimited DVR\nAnd spot if I\nGot all fired up that people were pretending to be family sharing a membership but instead of getting ten bucks a person a month they were getting three bucks person among ... actually a little less and so spot if I started cracking down\nAnd using a location ability to figure out where one person was over here and somebody else was over there and they couldn't possibly both be living under the same roof so they were in violation there was a huge backlash and spot five backed down\nThe reality is the right answer\nFor for all of this is how Netflix handles Netflix does not care who you consider to be part of your family they handle it by limiting how many streams you can have the time\nAnd part of their whole economic system is planning for that so to them it doesn't matter if one of us on the west coast is watching it and one of us on the east coast is watching it\nThat we're all part of the family membership Netflix offers a much cheaper

fact a chain of the top twenty Shiite holes in the world are in Africa\n[noise] [noise] so we feel like nor that act like it doesn't happen [noise]\nForty you maybe want to do something about him why our main Shiite holes to it varies but mostly it's because they're run by ten warning dictators and if you help these folks\nGet rid of those people and actually have some true Republican the some of them are called republic but they're not really they're run by ten or an dictators are they're run by pseudo Republican presidents and things like that\nBut if you help these folks take charge of

chat with us about Taylor Swift James how are you\nA fantastic so it's great to be with you how are you\nI'm doing very well so Taylor Swift and trying to get everybody to register to vote she's not even registered to vote isn't that amazing [laughter]\nTrying to make a you know\nOr even thinking about Taylor Swift you know a lot of people in the industry or really praising hurt because back in twenty twelve she did this interview with time magazine\nShe said you know I'm not going to talk about politics I don't want to influence people on politics essentially saying that she's an entertainer um and you know that's the maximum that's been in the entertainment business was Samuel Goldwyn\nTold a group of filmmakers if you want to send a message use of Western Union\nAnd so it's\nBeen because of the century you know if you're in business and you're selling a product\nIt's not a good idea to take positions on controversial issues I mean the NFL has learned that um Hollywood awards shows apparently have and they continue to learn that and Taylor Swift ... it was not smart of her to do this but\nShe was receiving incredible pressure I mean it's the ... in the world of celebrities you know Ninety nine point nine percent of them lean Alaska\nAnd support the left leaning causes and so all of her entourage your friends the people in the industry for pressuring her and the media was relentless\nAs a matter of fact I'm the guardian had a piece that actually said that the cars Taylor Swift towards silent and because she has so much influence\nBecause she's a this amazing pop star with all these followers on social media her silence means she's still supporter of President Trump\nThen [laughter] [laughter]\nWell that's one of 'em and then even more extreme there were some outlets that claimed that Taylor Swift was sending messages to white supremacy some rooms with Harry imagery in her music videos particularly the one\nLook what you made me do you know because it has the leather and whatever and there are some white supremacist groups that really ... like Taylor Swift but you know they just fall into the large fan base that she has but there was one particular\nOutlet that that claimed that she refused to condemn the all right and the white supremacists and it bother Taylor Swift to the point where she hired\nA lawyer to send out a cease and desist letter or she was probably surprised to find that the ACLU came not to her rescue but to the rescue of those accusing her so I think all of this the cumulative effect of it pressured her\nAnd of course she's going to go left but it shows you know it's funny you you bring up the fact that she [laughter] she not registered to vote which is laughable but the other thing is she sets forth these causes that are important to her and one of them is the me too\nMovement feminism because she's a symbol of it because she was involved in a high profile\nGroped gate kind of case but she endorsed\nBread are saying that guy who could at least publicly claimed to be supporting Kavanaugh to be supporting President Trump a different to support the cabin on nomination therefore disbelieving the holy Dr Ford and so\nI don't think and then of course Taylor Swift slammed candidate GOP candidate Marsha Blackburn someone who championed legislation that helps people like Taylor Swift\nCollect money for streaming music so I just don't think it was thought through very well and that's kind of typical of a of a lot of these celebrities can fill what's been amazing contrast\nAnd even though the only political content was really Taylor and that's what she said we've got to go out and vote in the terms while that was within the context of backdrop of her endorsing the Democrats\nAnd so the audience so they they were just given her wrist sounding chairs but meanwhile people had shut up being\nA trillion dollars ... I got two words for al ... Dixie Chicks and you know maybe maybe she should learn from it I Know it's not the same audience specific you know there was a country on and so the Guardian's mainly but I mean\nIt's you know you look it's it's fine I mean I got some friends in the entertainment business around the conservative side they don't mind living that be known but uh you you always take a calculated risk and you've got to know your audience if your audience is conservative or of your audience is liberal maybe she's done focus groups I have no idea\nBut she's willing to take that chance we'll just see what the chips fall and hurricane will I think\nShe she knows she's at such a high a pet you know she has a hundred and twelve million followers on Instagram she can fall pretty precipitously and still be a superstar and maybe she wants to the movies like Lady Gaga you know I'm\nSo you never know and you know people typically the people who are conservative in Hollywood or people who have established themselves\nFor such a long period of time that they don't care anymore like Clint Eastwood John boy Patricia heat and Gary ... they're they are kind of a senior celebrities of Hollywood typically or there are people whose careers are all that you know cooking right now\nAnd they're going one day they could maybe\nThey're like a list them all on our except on the right to exist I thought well you know let\nThem all I Know I mean one of her last gigs was doing voice overs for a film called Beverley hills show ... to\n... now and we also do in Beverly Hills Chihuahua wanted to make us feel for\nHer to show up at the cabinet hearings was a big get bail yang for\nWell I mean they talk about the dog whistle maybe she's the one who can here and I don't know I mean you know the names are isn't rights for Newsmax a left or the left coast report you can go to James person H.

eight counts of murder and John Wayne gay see convicted of thirty three murders Ted Bundy\nConfessed to twenty eight murders and was convicted of two and Jeffrey Dahmer confess to Seventeen murders
