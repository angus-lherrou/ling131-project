of amity with Iran a treaty Iran and made a mockery of with the support for terrorism provocative fullest missile proliferation and the line behavior throughout the middle east\nToday's decision by the international court of justice was a defeat for wrong it correctly rejected nearly all of Iran's requests we're disappointed that the I.

allowed Iran to use it as a forum for propaganda\nIranian regime has systematically pursued a policy of hostility toward the United states the famous to central premise of the treaty of amateur regime

of fall short of course\nIt's not a safe now it does not mean customary international law tests\nThey were saying it may be tomorrow it may be on Saturday but it's going to be soon and he will probably be on the Supreme Court by Monday and then the November campaigning re boots in earnest and this issue that the Democrats\nThought they hand a lot because they were going to portray Trump as a says a some kind of a woman abuser and Kavanaugh he's putting on the court has a rapist and all this and now\nThe Republicans gave them exactly what they want enough rope to hang themselves they didn't really want that by the way they didn't want the FBI investigation but the got it and so what the FBI investigation and now showing by all accounts even from the Democrats are there's nothing new here they're calling it a cover up\nThey're calling it a conspiracy but there's nothing to Dr for just accusations it is and has been all along\nShe says one thing and everybody else she says that can cooperate it says they weren't there even one of our good friends not only was she not mayor she says she never met Brett Kavanaugh before but I Believe Dr forge\nHow in the world could you believe this woman if she says you were there and you want\nAnd that you knew Brett Kavanaugh and you didn't\nBut this is how ... you know she's not gonna lie under oath apparently for fear that she may have to go to jail for it so is this thing over as far as Dr Ford is concerned I Would think it is in the least after the election\nBut it seems to me but they're still trying to gather some information from the polygraph and the notes from the therapist and other things to see if Dr Ford was not pulling a fast one on them and there may be charges I doubt it but there could be it certainly not going to happen before the election I wouldn't thing\nAnd then we'll see the other question too and I've been asking the van stand for our senior research analyst ... other people\nDo you think the Democrats have learned their lesson dancers know 'cause this is what they know it is the politics of personal destruction because when you can't win an election\nAnd you can't get an impeachment then what do you do you do this kind of miss what happened in the Senate was being more refined\nSenatorial version of screaming at people in a restaurant that's what that was making all sorts of a wild accusations you've seen the guy we had on\nA video of him yesterday the round kicks the pro life activist and kick starting the head I mean this is what we're dealing with out there and I've told you since the election you folks say will\nThese folks going to come down no they're going to get worse and worse and worse to further they get away from any semblance of power the more desperate they become and with all the great\nNews coming out of the economy and there's more great news today when it's almost every day we're seeing more great news coming about the economy and people vote with their pocket but they're going\nWhy would I Want to change all this so am I sure that it's going to go well for the Republicans in November no nobody's sure of anything I'm certainly hopeful and all indications are is that the Democrats have given the Republicans another issue not just the economy\nBut now the character assassination of a perfectly good man perfectly qualified to be on the Supreme Court that they tried to dragged through the mud\nAnd it backfired on them and this is why I Want to be FBI investigation because now\nWhat does America talking about the FBI has put their stamp of approval on this thing what the Senate Senate Judiciary committee said all along about no corroborating evidence is what exactly the FBI is found them\nSo that carries weights and a lot of people's minds and I see is what I hear from somebody ... one of those things are Democrats well nothing's going to change them nothing's going to change them you're going to have a certain percentage of people\nWho will vote no matter what on either side\nWhat you're worried about an election or the swing voters the folks\nWho tend to go back and forth and there's about twenty percent of the electric that does is they go back and forth and you can see it because some years we have a Democrat winning the presidency some years we have a Republican winning the presidency and so people swing back and forth on various issues you're going to have the right infringed on the right do you have the left insurance on the left\nAnd then you're going to have those who need to be convinced\nWho were in the middle and aren't really political\nAnd this is the issue and I'm not even sure that the Democrats were going after the ... middle by thing where they were trying to do is stoke up the left and what they've done is they've awakened the sleeping giant underwrite the people on a writer so P. O. the\nThat the Democrats right now for what they tried to do to Brett Kavanaugh\nThat I think they're going to come out and vote in droves and that may not have been the case two or three weeks ago can you imagine\nIf they had done this in July trying to keep Kavanaugh from being on the court either failed her succeed and then we move past it by August and then this wouldn't even be an issue going into November but here we are just a few weeks in front of the election and it's going to be on everybody's mind\nBecause of the Republicans have any sense at all or they're going to make this part of their platform going forward in the mid term elections because you look at the majority of the American people sixty percent according to the Harris Poll says\nIf the FBI report comes back with nothing new cabinet or should be on the court so if you're voting against capital\nIt's not because you think he's not qualified and it's because you're a political hack\nLindsey Graham has a lot of moral high ground to stand on right now you may not agree and I may not agree with some of the things that Lindsey Graham is voted for has supported but bag I voted for both of Obama's\nSupreme Court nominees because he thinks that the president gets to choose who's on the Supreme Court when he or she is an office and given anything other than disqualifying characteristics as far as not being able to do the job\nYou're hard pressed to vote against somebody now I Would say a disqualification\nTo me somebody like Ruth Bader Ginsburg who says that she looks a world court decisions infringe courts in all the rest of it and you can point to that and say hey\nShe stood there and you're going to ask somebody like ... or if there's ever a Democrat presently and God Forbid and they put a nominee up you can say look Ruth Bader Ginsburg\nHas said that she looks at world court decisions would you look at world court decisions when it comes to deciding something before you record and if they say yes you're immediately disqualified\nThat's not a partisan thing that's trying to keep crazy activist off the court and I would say the same thing goes for the rights\nHave you've got somebody on the right and they tell you anything other than I'm looking at the constitution when I make a decision on the Supreme Court they don't have any business being on it\nIf they're looking at what some other courts said or what the hey ... or whatever\nAnd they don't need to be or if they say well you know I Know what the constitution says but\nI really feel personally this needs to change that I Believe we can do that on the Supreme Court and I don't care whether you're on the right of the left you're disqualified your job is to sit on the Supreme Court and judge each case that comes before you based on the law\nAnd which is based on the constitution and if you can do that you have no business being there I don't care whether you're conservative or liberal\nSo we're at Capitol obviously passes all those tests and this is what they said they\nSo he's a partisan conservative Obama he's a constitutional is he doesn't care about anything but the constitution and we saw in this week\nThat we got because the FBI investigation more outlandish claims throwing ice are you kidding me so you're not going to be on the Supreme Court costs you through eyes to somebody and I think the American people look to listen and when they're shaking their heads going this is ridiculous\nEven some Democrats out there going this is ridiculous absolutely ridiculous I'm just looking in the news for you here to ah Grassley says no handles misconduct and the FBI stamina overboard and\nSays and everything she says is uncorroborated says these uncorroborated accusations have been unequivocally and repeatedly rejected by judge Kavanaugh and neither the Senate Judiciary committee nor the FBI could locate any third parties who can attest to any of the allegations this investigation found no hint\nOf misconduct [noise] So Amy Schumer responded protesting in the Senate office building pills ... she's willing to get arrested [laughter] maybe maybe she should be\nThat's where we are so this
