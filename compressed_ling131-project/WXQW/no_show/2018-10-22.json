United nations about climate change\nYou recently said you're not a climate change and believer I'm Sorry you're not a climate change deniers her but you don't want to be labeled a believer in climate change given the threats Florida faces from intense hurricanes and rising sea levels don't Florida voters deserve to know where you stand on this or\nWhat I said was I don't want to be an alarmist I mean I Want to look at this and do what makes sense for Florida so for example for the people in northwest Florida\nI Will be there for you and you guys are resilient\nYou're fighting this was a terrible storm and we will rebuild but I also think you have to just look at the fact that you look at South Florida we need to do resiliency have more water you have flooding\nSo as governor that's something that I'm going to take on full throttle would I don't want to do is do things like Andrew wants to do what to do a California style energy policy\nThat will cause our electricity race to skyrocket twenty thirty percent\nThat's going to hurt senior citizens on a fixed income that will hurt our blue collar workers so what's the deal with the issues that we can deal with\nSomebody who

you can go from the Arctic Circle to the Mexican border and territory that's all perfectly legal where pot is perfectly legal for recreational purposes as just a little a little aside I digress but let me let me put that question to you this morning\nWhat is it that President Trump should do about this caravan\nThis caravan that his heading our way where the giant flags that looks like the Democratic convention that got flags in every country except the United states they've got Honduran flags Salvadoran flags maybe ... a Mexican flags Palestinian flags and I says flags whenever they have oh by the way the\nOr the or the government of Guatemala or they say that they have captured more than a hundred ISIS fighters and their country\nAnd President Trump says these are not all good guys and there's a caravan they're bad guys in there too and the media scouts like\nHow can you can't say that there are bad people in that care of it because the news media knows they can look at a crowded on TV and I know that they're nothing but good people and there are many has that power they're a very insightful as you've probably noticed on a regular basis or news media I think I'll\nDrop them plenty of stuff to get to do that but I Do want to I Want to hit you up with what President Trump should do about this caravan the impending whatever that is the care of had a really it's like the Alamo it's kind of like the Alamo but are updated\nFor the twenty first century where it eight eight eight six three zero nine six two five eight eighty six three oh nine six two five fewer there

kind of a dent in our first that\nHardly I think that it can positive because it's on it's on their type of thinking what is the great if we could use solar power because we know that it's very sunny side of how it would need to the back of the house you know we have to be on the front panels on the roof\nAnd that we didn't get a quote ... and had a couple of questions they kept telling the guy with giving us that he said\nAre currently federal tax credit\nThirty percent of what kind of OK quote did you get for installing solar before the tax credits\nI'm already been about twenty almost twenty nine thousand dollars\nYou must have a pretty big house\nOh well you have about three thousand square feet but it's a ... in that it that three stories to get there okay so that when you fat believe it or not and that wasn't that covers the whole story is I'm trying to remember how many pounds I mean I think I Would just take than all\nRight I think he got to do some more work and get some more clothes that sounds way too high\nOkay All right so what would you say for let's say if he was telling me thick panel ... wouldn't be a good All right\nWell you don't really look at that because the system's supposed to be engineered based on what your power demands or and somewhat translated from your square footage\nAnd it it would not be unusual for you like we have a ... thirty two panels and you're like OK wouldn't be unusual that you might need somewhere twenty four to thirty two for your house\nAnd even that many panels would be surprising if it costs that kinda money\nSo you only have one quote so far yeah that would be where I'd really concentrate what's your current monthly power bill average as best you can guess\nProbably around two hundred and thirty a month\nRight sort of you are spending a\nSo let's just rounded off let's say you're spending three thousand dollars a year on power you're not going to go ... thousand to zero have used ... twenty eight thousand on panels to get the thirty percent federal tax credit so it's going to drop you to let's say Nineteen five\nRight I don't know that would take for ever to get paid back on yeah for ... yeah\nSo that does not on the face of it the numbers don't add up to me and that's why you gotta go get more quotes awful okay and they want to be able to get a pay back net of credits in less than a decade\nOkay they said after ten years my total out of pocket with me there five thousand\nHow's that\nKiss the way that they said you know the monthly installment I'm certain them on the hundred and forty three and then\nThe installment and minus the energy saving energy production Woodward in the end it's like you know we're killing me by an estimate about sixty dollars a month okay sorry\nLet me tell you when you're running numbers never take their assumptions based on installment payments or anything like that look at it from the raw numbers or what you pay for a system minus thirty percent credit take your three thousand dollars a year power bill\nSo you're out how much of that you're likely to say let's say you cut it in half so you say Fifteen hundred dollars a year\nHow long would it take you\nTo make up that night team five plus interest you're looking at for ever and the day and that's why a need for yoga more quotes and see where the numbers really would flesh out

the wonderful things that you do to a educate thousands of people\nWell thank you you that what's going on with you\nWell I have a credit card account with one ah banking institution it is a little bit it's brought about Fifteen thousand dollars [laughter] I have money saved up which which I could actually pay it off\nBut that would exhaust my um emergency savings I don't want to do that I have another institution it's a credit union and they currently have a promotion going on what you can do the balance transfer and it's at two point nine nine percent for twelve month\nSo I was thinking about doing that\nAnd and doing that I was planning to close out the other account\nThat has the sixteen or right over Fifteen thousand dollars in it but I've been hearing I've heard often as they gave him from during your ah show do not close the account keep it open and use it periodically\nWill you don't have to use it I'm constantly but if you use it even twice a year for very small purchases it will keep it in your credit mix and that's very valuable for you to do you don't want to have just a single credit card\nYou want to have I always called the Noah's Ark rule you want to have at least two credit cards okay\nAnd the reason is is that be available credit that you have\nOn the two cards added together versus the amount you have charged on cards figures directly into what makes up your credit score okay and so you want to have substantial available on use credit\nYou also want to have multiple lines of credit that you can be graded on essentially in your credit report and your credit score\nWell see I'm also her well actually I've been through this before probably about Twenty years ago I'm retired military\nThank you so much for your service\nYou thank you so you bet you bet and uh years ago my wife and I were purchasing a fan and we were told at the time we had too much available credit\nRight so it had to do that in a mixed message right yes I'm telling you keep credit open and then it's unusual with a vehicle alone they tell you have too much of a a little credit but where you'll hear that the most often is when you're applying for a mortgage\nBut at the same time when you're applying for that mortgage if you don't have multiple lines of credit it makes your credit score lower and then people may not make you know the home loan or they may charge you a higher interest rate so can wait till something happens if somebody says no we don't like all that of elbow credit\nAnd then you choose maybe the clothes something but otherwise leave the lines open because if you look at what makes up a credit score\nAids and the two major areas of a credit score it pays for you to keep that old line open\nBeth is with us on the Clark Howard show hello

and look down over his reading glasses says no honey I'm rich you're poor and went back to reading is\n[laughter] oh\nBut I mean that's the way it was you know I ... I left home went to university a Near East Carolina University\nFirst semester and a half in this I don't want to get into broadcasting and went to a broadcast school and he says look out split it with you\nBut you got to go to work so I wanted to work waiting tables and paying my part of it and pay him from my apartment and all this stuff and I was cut off at that point I mean he paid for half the education which was a thousand dollars to go to the broadcast school and he paid five hundred I pay the rest of it\nAnd then I got into radio and there was no turning back here I've told you the story about the coats and I was telling us again\nTo my stepmother 'cause every time I tell this about star crime because it's one of those stories that you know it's one of those life lessons that the parents teach and you don't quite understand it when they do but I had already been out working for several\nYears as a matter of fact I started by started in radio and I'd say about this time I had been in radio about six years and I was working in Greensboro is a program director um and I got washed out in the format change and you folks and radio no how that works\nGeneral manager came in and says we're switching to a new form and you you you you're all\nGrown and they're bringing new people for the new form and then we were doing an oldies torment and they were going to like some you know beautiful music or something like that anyway long story short is\nI didn't have a whole lot of money saved up probably didn't have heart hardly any at all and so I figured I got to get another job so I went to work for an ad agency selling jingles suddenly Herman tell the story before and in order to sell the jingles you I was on straight commission so there was no money up front\nI had to go out and make sales calls and so\nI went I had to go buy some sport coats 'cause I had to have something to where I couldn't just show up and you know genes or whatever and I had some khaki pants and a dress shirt and so I was just going to switch out the tie and the sport coat every day and go make sales goals so I needed five hundred dollars for five ... a sport goats\nSo I went to my father's office\nAnd I said I'd appreciate your help on\nThis I said I'm trying to get off the ground and the sales thing of course he's the one who told my brother that al ... said that Phil couldn't sell sex on a true train but uh [laughter]\nSo he knew it was an ill fated endeavor but I went to when I said I I Would have really appreciate it if you could help me out and give me five hundred bucks I'll pay you back you know when I get up and running but I just need five hundred bucks to buy the sport coats and then as soon as I'm making money\nAnd get my commissions and stuff I'll pay you back\nHe said I'll go down to the bank right around the corner and co signed for you if you want me to I said are you serious you're not going to you're not gonna help me out he said I'm helping me out I'm going to go down and co signed for you get the five hundred bucks you can pay them back\nSo I stormed out of his law is man went around the corner guy working there was a loan officer was he was several years older than me but I knew him and I went and I said look and I told him the stories and we don't worry about that will give me five hundred bucks you don't have to have it in the ... sign\nAnd so I've gotten a check for five hundred bucks and I walked back down to my father's office stormed into his office in an office all the way in the back and I held up the check and I said see I don't need you\nAnd that's exactly what he wanted he wanted me to be independent where I don't mean to him\nWell that was called tough love it took me years to figure out he wasn't a big SOB he was actually just trying to make me independent and at work\nI work three months in that job made a hundred dollars and commission and figured that this was not the line of work for me and so I packed up everything I had moved to Nashville, Tennessee without a job and the rest is history and I ended up paying the bank back the five hundred bucks\nWe have to make people and I'm you know I'm trying to use the same lessons with my kids but it's tough as a father you know the main things you know but\nThey need to get out there and make it on their own and you know why you do this you do this because you love your kids right well then why don't we do this for everybody else if we really love our fellow man why are we going to give 'em fifty thousand dollars so that when they become adults I got fifty thousand dollars into bank there's no test\nWhat they're going to spend the fifty thousand on they say well they could do it for a down payment for a house or college tuition wonder if they spend it on I don't know for the night or whatever I mean they could spending all sorts of stuff\nBecause it's going to be no regulations as to what you can spend it on\nAnd who needs fifty thousand dollars for a down payment when they weren't wearing as we all do when we won our first house within what you do is you saying you put a down payment and then you put your own money in and you don't get a house straight out when you're Eighteen years old or Twenty one years old you maybe get one when you're thirty\nAnd there's nothing wrong with that you save your own money you come up with an al ... and then you've done it on your own business what you do for people you care about\nYou don't want to make them dependent on you as a parent and we shouldn't want to make them dependent on the government but here we are in a situation where we have seven million unfilled jobs is the largest number of jobs ever that her own filled in America\nThe ... five I'm Devin Walsh looking for change

Gates is making a trillion times more than I'm making it doesn't take anything away from me\nBut they want you to believe that there's a finite amount of wealth and if somebody gets rich that they're

we could buy it and make\nOur lives better well that's what I'm Talking about the left is obsessed with the wealth gap and the wealth gap matters not the only thing that matters is whether your and getting better or your getting worse and when we look around America right now most people are getting better\nAmerica's wealth gap they say grew rapidly through the late twentieth century and Nineteen sixty three families of the top of America's wealth distribution is another thing we don't the wealth is not distributed his burn there's no wealth distribution\nIs only redistribution of the liberals get in power and they want to take the money away from the wealthy and given the folks who haven't earned it\nBut families at the top of America's wealth distribution had six times the wealth of those in the middle six times by twenty twelve the wealthiest had twelve times the assets of middle income families now I Want to ask you this do you think in the middle income is better off now than they were in Nineteen sixty three\nWithout a doubt the middle class has more cool stuff the cars are nicer\nOr the food is better than the bees are bigger there's nothing in the middle class that has not better than it was in Nineteen sixty three but they're obsessed with the wealth gap\nHas grown well the wealth gap is grown but the middle class has gotten better off as a matter of fact there are more people moving out of the middle class and into the wealthy and if that's the case how is that bad well they they keep talking about the shrinking middle class\nThe shrinking middle class\nThe middle class is shrinking if it is because people in the middle class are getting richer now because people in the middle class getting poorer if you look at the poverty rate\nIt harbors twelve to fourteen percent any given year it doesn't matter what the only thing that matters whether we're in a recession or when there's a recession was about fourteen percent poverty rate when we're not in a recession is about twelve percent\nThat doesn't change so how in the world is the shrinking middle class a problem obviously the middle class is shrinking because they're moving into the upper middle class or the wealthy they're not getting poor or those numbers would be willing to twenty five thirty percent\nHe's run out say say specific government policies have driven the racial gap now we got a

least when I was there was a bad part it was all I could afford so like this [laughter]\nHey we let them be our wedding [laughter]\nSo you wanted to make a comment on all this financial stuff\nWell I tried it for a living and I can't tell you I ain't that many people here in Catholic that they like you were saying that\nThey had a horrible thing and people are ... you're right it had nothing to eat and what what you make everything you know wait how you manage your money or pay your bills on time\nAnd you can be I mean it can have them working as a waitress and decay she pays you're ill she had a higher alert and that did get through that Dr it's all about money may manage that it had nothing to do at your race at nothing to do that at all\nWell why can't we teach them the folks who sit there talking about how there's a wage gap and not you know I Can't get a loan for something and you can't get along because your credit stinks\nWell because I fortunately right now I mean a yet though politically correct eight days that they get paid a thought at fortunately it in more credit that black communities in panic mode if\nThey're the ones that are having these credit it can it has and talk to them and it told I hate to say that a lot of the education they are not educated and they hadn't been educated in bed early and then there's an area where it\nYeah and he gave me ... you know I come from the automotive industry\nAnd I can tell you anything he's going to do whatever it takes to get a car and that's not what you should do it you know you need to look at person can't afford it can't afford like they want to be and that's why you need to be guiding them what they should be buying not what they know like oh I Want that well\nYou know are they going to be able to keep it or we're going to recall in that\nThat might be right back here\nWhile I'm sitting here and get a kid who's the told his car or in the three ... pi loves here in Nashville and he's fine but uh he's got to get a new car and we're sitting there looking at stuff and I said look right\nYou got to decide what you can't afford it\nAnd um we were sitting there looking at a car and that was you know it was a ... a mid level but I mean nothing fancy or anything but it's a you know it's fairly fairly recent model\nAnd he says I think what I Need to do is go back and look at something that's a little older or because I can if we want and dependable and he wants to dependable any and some things some options that he wants on there but he says I just don't feel comfortable with that\nPrice point you know per month so let's find something a little older and something that I think that I can make the payment on 'cause he's gonna have to make the pain when they're like saying you know you don't make the payment that going to come get it\nAnd then not only they can get it then you're going to have you back okay I got to get another car well any time where you had to read though don't they on your credit for quite awhile\nPolio ... always a ban thing on your credit report I think they're\nVery bad thing is he now it's in that in a bankruptcy you know if you had a bankrupting everybody's going to see that the next seven years and how that works\nWell so how do we get to folks because you know again as as me as a white guy and they were trying to get the people in the black community willy who called from Flint earlier Willie could do he could do some proselytizing\nAnd the black community about this because he's been through it I think that's what it's going to take his people saying hey man make this a priority in your life don't go out and buy stuff you can't afford to make sure that you keep your credit strayed\nExactly it's got to get caught\nYou know it's just like I don't like that and I hear our wedding type eighty feet everywhere that they should be taking in high school if they don't want to high school they ... they didn't need all the other thing that they can you had to change a tire you how do you want to\nYou know he just kept saying why he got mad at you and all of that hit the guy a thing in high school before you go to college if he didn't say anything like shit\nGoing on and it's not but you're right it's not being taught but I appreciate you on the Robin thanks thanks sorry Mike in Huntsville would be a mix Mike what's up\nYeah so I just want to know that just because you pay your bills on time or the other lady didn't have a good credit score we paid off for house early we have a credit card debt\nTwo income family made a lot of money um bad credit score\nBecause we don't have any credit card any monthly credit card bills on loans\nAnd see that's another thing it's it's a it's sort of a convoluted formula do they use but yeah well they look at is do you have access to a bunch of money like a credit card but you're not taking advantage of it they look at that as somebody being responsible and I know there are many people have been cut up your credit cards and things and I'm sure there are ways around it\nBut one surefire way is to get a credit card and just spend a little bit on it and then pay off base and spend a little bit on and pay it off and they see that you could access ten thousand but you're only accessing five hundred a month and you're paying at all they see that as responsible\nYou know they don't see that as you know credit history because you don't carry a balance very balance our credit card so they don't know if I'm going to do with it or what do you have credit cards\nI Do but you don't you're not married author okay interest on it on everybody late\nBut you're saying that you do you have you paid them all off and don't use them anymore or what\nNot use them but I find them up or you know and the ability cycle\nAnd so they look at that and some money but it's a dozen that really a track record because you're not you're not doing it on to actually exactly\nWell look there are other ways to do it I mean I've had you know well I'll tell you this I mean one of the main things I look at for me as American Express and American Express you ... when I say you have to pay they make it now so you can slow some stuff and I've floated some things before but that's a good way American Express is one of those things where\nEuro looks very highly that if you're responsible with salt

because of you know stuff goes by so fast on Twitter so many folks don't see it but you need to see this kind of stuff because this is what's going on real clear politics I'm\nPresident is saying that or at least in some of these congressional races that are key then the polling is starting to turn for the Republicans again don't get complacent\nThat's all dependent on these people are being polled actually getting out and voting so heading there yet and you need to do your part there's a follow through on this the polls are just saying this a snap shot up today or when they were they were taken\nBut the real poll counts on November sick so that's what's going to be the determining factor we have a written a mob company this is out of the Sacramento Bee or rent a mobs company called

Jake Tapper was talking to him\nBut he says you were screened for four hours this week at a town hall homeless on homelessness homelessness has nearly a fifty percent in your city since you became mayor according to Los Angeles times\nNow the now there's a tie for outbreak likely due to the booming number of rats attracted by all the food and human waste on Skid Row in other places some critics may be saying why are you campaigning for Democrats in the midterms and traveling\nWhen you have this huge crisis in your backyard and ... said he says well I think they're linked together and I welcome a national conversation in Washington DC where you see more homeless per capita than you see in Seattle in San Francisco you see in red and blue cities well I don't know if there aren't any red cities are they're they're all blue\nSince we have a mental health crisis van I Will agree it's just what you do about it\nMayors can avoid that he says a lot of people told me never touched the issue of homelessness\nTime so passionate about it people are dying on our streets from opioid addiction I'm so proud of our voters in Los Angeles who passed two largest matters to combat homelessness\nAnd this is what people say isn't an solvable problem and I'm committed to solving it we're opening up new beds are type his numbers are about the same as they had been in the past we are focused on preventing homelessness\nWe've got veterans kids ah my wife and I are foster parents we have folks coming out of sexual violence to understand homelessness we\nReally do need leadership from Washington DC well who is the leader on the opioid crisis Donald J Trump for crying out loud he's made this a priority and his administration do something about opioids for the deal with this is you know we've got over prescribing ... going on for many years and that's\nGoing to take a while to wash out and people have not been able to get the opioid prescriptions so they turn to heroin it's a huge problem there's no doubt about that and we have to do something about it\nBut his solution is to is to create more beds in other words a homeless high rise so people are not homeless because they're homeless I Know that sounds counter intuitive to to do a lot of you folks out there people are not homeless because they don't have a home\nThey're homeless because they can't keep a job\nIf you have a job you can get a home and I'm not talking about buying a home I'm Talking about being able to rent whether it's renting an apartment and renting a room winning somewhere that shelter for yourself but you can do that if you're not working\nSo you first have to figure out why homeless people are not working\nSome asked to do with mental illness some asked to do with addiction but there are some folks out there that just don't want to work and the worst thing you can do is just build high rise for the homeless and expect the problem to go away what you do is you create a magnet and that's why you've got a fifty percent increase in homelessness\nIn Los Angeles is because they're putting these people in these little micro houses and high rise homeless places and then they keep coming and so we don't have enough to fit everybody that's because words gotten out that all I gotta do to get as they get to LA and you'll take care of me\nWe have got to reach the people and help them solve their problems you know folks like the national rescue mission that's what they do but there's accountability that comes with it\nAnd it's it's a um it's a Christian centered thing and that's why the left hates it\nYou're going to make 'em go to a church service to ensure that there was a talk show host on another station and she was a\nBig lib and um we were talking about the uh Nashville rescue mission and she thought that it violated their constitutional rights to make them sit through a church service in order to get a free place to stay at night\nShe really thought that that violated their their constitutional rights so they show up at the place they say look you can go through the line and get yourself some food and we'll give you a place to say but we're asking you to sit through\nA a a sermon we're going to have some I talk to you about about Christ and oh my gosh that's a separation of church and homelessness or something I don't know what that is\nShe thought it violated their constitutional rights they don't have to do it at all there's nothing that\nMandates of Nashville rescue mission and the other Christ based uh ministries out there and then there's nothing that mandates have to do anything if you're going to come to their facility if you're going to take advantage of what they're giving you then you're going to have to give something in return and all they ask\nYou to sit through a church service\nAnd these people wouldn't get people on the left grazing cane so I've talked to some of these folks out there who are standing on the street corners and one guy seventies when my kids were smaller or small they're not small anymore when they were little kids in the car we pull off I was coming to the radio station one day to pick something up on a Saturday I Believe\nAnd they were in the car with me and we pulled up to the traffic light there right off the off ramp and it was a guy\nStanding or the you know that you make what a sign that will work for food\nAnd you know I Know are these folks because these are the bombs so this guy came up and they actually knocked on the window and I cracked window right or wrong and all the way down like cracked window I said what can I Do for you he said man I Am so hungry could you just give me some money just so I'd be rid some of the apes\nAnd I said well you know the national rescue\nMission is about six blocks down this way ah and they're feeding says no I've already missed the window while I Know the national rescue mission I looked at my watch and I said no they're actually serving for forty five more minutes\nYou can just make it and you know what I'm saying that few\nGreat lesson for the kids I said this guy is a bomb if you wanted to eat there's ... there's a rescue mission down the street that will feed him but he doesn't want to go there because they ask something in return\nHe wants me to give him five dollars so we can go buy some more who ... or whatever it is food what will curse for your won't cursed for food that's right what courage and this happens on I was\nSitting in Greenwich Village with my brother in law many years ago the same time situation you know how they have the outdoor seating and all that and they have they have a little chain across it you know to this and you can get across the chain obviously some dripping train a chain but it's to keep people from going straight into the restaurant where they go through the front door and get to see that\nAnd we were sitting out there it was a nice sunny afternoon in Greenwich Village\nAnd we were having a we're getting ready to have lunch when they brought the bread and we were sitting there with our drinks and the bread and\nThis guy came walking up I mean he looked like he look bad timing skinny as a rail had no shirt on and they came up and he says I think some money I\nHaven't eaten in three days when my brother in law who's the kind this guy in the world you know he reaches for his pocket I raced on and grab the basket the bread and handed it to him and he said if you and walked off\nWell he didn't want to eat and eat and then three days somebody offered you a basket full of bread and you're going to say FU\nFU dude that's what we're dealing with\nSo when you're dealing with the homeless\nYou have to separate the needy from the greeting\nThis guy obviously wanted some money so he could shoot up some more heroin and I'm not going to help him with his addiction there are people that will help you do this but you've got to want to help yourself\nYou can't force people in the rehab they got to hit rock bottom and decide I Can't do this anymore I Can't I Can't handle this and that's the way that it's taking care of but guard city in LA thinks is Washington's problems see if we just through more money at it\nAnd you throw more money at it and go what do you get you make yourself a magnet for the homeless and you get more homeless folks do you get more folks who are looking for a handout instead of for a hand up so\nThat they had the creepy porn lawyer out there isn't a it's just it's it's raining bad news on this guy is one story actually
