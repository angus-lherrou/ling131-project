a in this particular case that's what makes me nervous and it's what makes been there and just be the idea stage in the hell out of okay well what happens for example Saudi Arabia is is I Know

can happen I'm not sure that it would make sense for him to remain there and be tortured because while you're and how many more potential witnesses add a lot more difficult situation for even turkey

to the United states\nWere appalled that\nOK okay maybe just maybe not how you thought here's an actor\nLast way pop star Taylor Swift made ways by breaking or stands up political neutrality and backing democratic congressional candidates in our home state of Tennessee\nBe effective Swiss surprise endorsement which was mainly on Instagram post or felt right away as thousands of people between the ages of Eighteen and twenty nine registered to vote according to vote dot org\nOkay now\nI'm going to get straight to the point about the Taylor Swift the fact that some of the media recently has a couple of days ago we're still cautious happening I think it's quite a down a little bit over the past year or so because I think more of them are like being pointed to the polls and going\nEd you say it was up in Tennessee or in the um Taylor's specific endorsement of the Democrat so Britain's in and and tendencies US Senate race you see at the time of the endorsement Marshall\nA bird the Republican challenger in this race\nShe was averaging a three point lead and the three most recent polls and Tennessee alright Blackburn three point lead in the three most recent polls prior to the Taylor Swift effect\nWhere is she today and the three most recent polls in that particular race is now nine points\nSo\nOh not exactly what you probably thought would happen here so the Taylor Swift effect in the immediate aftermath of the race that she finally weighing in on\nIs negative six percent in a week so does that you've got two sides to stories in one side the facts but here's the deal you got a lot of folks that are ... million or the concept that for every action the equal and opposite reaction or science guy on earlier in the show\nHere's the thing that I'm In in\nThe south in particular you had a lot of folks that will end up getting energized about the moment he got celebrities better away in the end and specifically\nWhen she ended up outing herself pretty much immediately or her lack of understanding of pretty much everything including the person she was endorsing\nSafe if you're in Tennessee and your foreign politics you might have noticed that she was a bit of an obvious hypocrites for a few reasons among others now\nShe said that in Marsha Blackburn doesn't represent her tendency values but you say here's the dirty little details Taylor isn't actually from Tennessee she's from Pennsylvania\nPennsylvania\nAnd she happened only moved to Tennessee to pursue her music career in high school oh by the way she's lived there less than half her life\nYou know him the Taylor Swift is a tendency values as say a Elizabeth Warren is too too Cherokee Indians you know the person sometimes referred to as Elizabeth Warren better known as the bad Pocahontas smelling now she spoke up supporting algae meteorites\n... rights as part of her Tennessee values\nBy the way [noise] I guess what\nThe Democrats the she endorsed bill Bratton says he doesn't support gay marriage and a bunch of other issues he's on the record as much [laughter] so it's clear that she's never even looked into what he believes in they'll go\n\nAnd then you got the optics we see for mainly you could after they some of those young bumps in in Nashville better\nYeah but here's the thing anybody noticed that he got Taylor Swift endorsing an old white guy who\nDoes not support gay marriage and the host of other elegy Beatty rights that Taylor says are part of her tendency values from Pennsylvania\n\nSo she's endorsing in the white guy bad even all these days and leftist politics right over a younger woman\nHuh Interesting\nI mean and there's a lot more we can continue down that rabbit all but it's not necessary but you see those in Tennessee they pretty much get the point to and law law\nIn terms of tendency values I'm from suburban Georgia lived in Knoxville for a time when I was small and I'm pretty familiar with tendency values and they take a look at these celebrity and and Hollywood endorsements and ah well\nNot often impressed so it probably is going to continue to have the opposite of the fact that they weren't as the ... I mean come on\nAll these celebrity endorsements work right Katy Perry holding up Hillary Clinton's arm\nBy the way it wasn't an awkward moment I mean I did the trick is does and so here's the funny thing if you're taking a look at when celebrity endorsements actually matter well she kind of Mr moment if they if she actually wanted somebody with her\nPennsylvania Tennessee ...\nWrites values she could actually weighed in in the primary because Columbia University actually did prove that some Democrats are\nBy celebrities for example Columbia University they did show pretty empirically that in the two thousand eight democratic presidential primary Oberlin price endorsing really did encourage an additional ... million people largely black do vote for Barack Obama over Hillary Clinton\nSo it's only Taylor Swift headway then whether Pennsylvania\nAllergy me the Tennessee values maybe she wouldn't have ended up with an old white guy who doesn't support gay marriage or the algae Beatty rice been made her look like she is as close as she actually is she could have had somebody that you know it was\nGoing to shake it off and do\nWhatever it is that she does these days but nice try Taylor nice try and find a way by the way as far Tennessee values part of the reason why you have the Democrat Bill\nBritain's and that is not supportive of those things eighty one percent of tendency ins are Christians fifty two percent of the evangelical variety oh by the way you might want to at least investigate the said that you claim to be from that you represent the values off saying\nTwo

um it was all a it was all kind of aggressive music that hinted towards we're coming at ya but they're the same they all come from the same cloth especially Springsteen were they were anti war\nA it they they are just so hypocritical I'm hoping that God that people are just not taking a serious anymore\nI can tell you I tell you this much in in Tennessee in particular there are some places where there's liberties ... if you're in California and no doubt that plays in fact there is research that did show up from Columbia University back to two thousand eight\nA presidential primary to where there are Democrats or a percentage of them that are activated by celebrity but you've got to a you know in somebody's got to be open to the message is what I talk about when a I'll describe being politically persuasive one of the most\nThe question so I guess how is it that I find somebody who I can uh you know convince of of what's right well did the first thing is you got to find somebody who is open to the information if you find somebody who's close minded\nWell it doesn't matter how hard you try they're not up to the information so when the case of the celebrities when you're talking about what's going on in Tennessee oh well you've got a large swath of that population that is not not going to be turned on\nBy a celebrity endorsement but what's worse and this is the most of the offensive thing and I say there's not really a true southerner in the sense that I'm from suburban Atlanta\nAnd to be honest with you I didn't even know what the the saying get out of the judgment until I was sixteen ... that kind of thing didn't come up where where I was from but I Do understand a lot of southern culture and\nYou know when you say that you have Tennessee now use\nAnd you're not only not from Tennessee where you're from Pennsylvania\n[laughter] came through many of the folks in Tennessee as those people and so it's kinda like I Know and see you and in in Jersey job

most part I'm and I'm Down in the you know the more conservative area but I just hope my hoping to God that these numbers who who who rely on these celebrities for their political opinions are shrinking more and more and more that's that's my hope\nYeah I I think the only celebrity that are necessary have to worry about in terms of this cycle\nIs the president of the United states I mean there is that I or in a certain extent you know he's obviously successful independent of the celebrity but you know hey just are\nPointing out with somebody otherwise probably will if I don't

the week already Michael Toscano here with us so happy to be in your company this and every morning of course call us the number is eight hundred seven three six three six six six would like to get the benefit of your thoughts on what's going on with Saudi Arabia\nAnd turkey and the killing of journalists ...\nSecretary of state Mike Pompeo is in Ankara in Turkey this morning he landed there this morning and has already met with Turkish president air to on this was following his talks in Riyadh with Saudi Arabia's king and crown prince about the disappearance of the journalist and what we all seem to believe now is is apparent murder\nTurkish officials say they believe that yesterday who is a prominent critic of Saudi Arabia's crown prince Mohammed bin Salman was murdered and his body removed from the diplomatic compound that Saudi Arabia has in the Turkish capital of Istanbul\nAnd some Turkish sources have been telling reporters that they have an audio recording indicating that the journalist was killed inside there and then his body dismembered now the Saudis strongly denied those accusations\nUh but uh when palm payer was asked whether the king or the crown prince said anything about a shrug she being alive or dead he said well they didn't talk about any of the facts and then the secretary of state\nIt allowed him to be photographed a video sitting next to the crown prince and smiling and being happy and talking about our firm relationship with that country this as the rest of the civilized world is condemning the crown prince and what they believe is the action the crown prince uh who goes he likes to call themselves and be as\nA he's a fairly close to what the Trump Administration and he's trying to portray an image of a of a new and vibrant Saudi Arabia about diversifying its economy away from a their old reliance on oil and making some social changes ... dumps done some of that\nBut he's also been cracking down on activists stamping out criticism putting people in jail he's been getting into diplomatic fights with some countries\nAnd so he's not exactly a you know somebody in the American mold\nMore in the ... of an older fashioned a mold from that part of the world war kings\nAnd crown princes run things and you have to do things their way Saudi Arabia is of course has been an ally in some important elements of American policy in the middle east and also on the fight against terrorism name occasionally provided some help so there is bad on the plus side at least as far as America goes\nThe question now is if they in fact we're responsible for the murder of this journalist who\nUh by the way was an American resident he actually lived in Virginia in just a few miles from the studio in which I Am sitting he was in Turkey apparently are going to the consulate in Saudi Arabia to get some papers to getting married to his fiance and he was seen going in never seen coming out\nOf the Saudi I excuse me the Turkish investigators in there they finally got into the consulate two weeks after the event and after cleaning crews were seen carrying heavy equipment in and out of that building and they found fresh paint which they believe is covering up toxic substances that might have gotten splashed on the walls\nAnd other issues or other materials that they really haven't disclosed in detail so the Turkish government is really cracking down on this and they are very concerned that this murder happened on their soil\nOf course a Turkish president or to not exactly a paragon of human rights either and well all this is going on and President Trump is saying oh no no you're innocent until proven guilty or which you know of course this is not a court of law um\nAnd what the evidence mounting against the ... I think we can be pretty sure that whoever killed this man if he is in fact dead were from Saudi Arabia there were these Fifteen high profile Saudi officials and when operatives\nWho uh went into turkey where they were there for less than a day they all came in on on a visa and got in there and disappeared for a few hours and then left the country they weren't there on a you know just to tour turkey or go around Istanbul and check the local food\nIt sounds like they have something more serious in mind so\nThe question of course is whether this was a rogue operation as President Trump suggested and as the king and the crown prince are trying to quietly put out the word that oh this is some rogue operation that went wrong we didn't want this to happen well we'll probably find out very soon the question is what does the United states knew about this\nIf if the crown prince and the king and the king talked to President Trump directly if he lied to President Trump what should the president do about that we can't have foreign leaders lying to the president of the United states and getting away unscathed\nI'm not sure what to do about that and maybe you have some ideas Nineteen

W executed\nOutlook [noise]\nTwenty four minutes before they are now on first lied Wednesday morning in the middle of the week already Michael Toscano here with us so happy to be in your company this and every morning of course Carlos the number is eight hundred seven three six three six six six would like to get the benefit of your thoughts on what's going on with\nArabia and turkey and the killing of journalists ...\nSecretary of state Mike Pompeo is in Ankara in Turkey this morning he landed there this morning and has already met with Turkish president air to on this was following his talks in Riyadh with Saudi Arabia's king and crown prince about the disappearance of the journalist and what we all seem to believe now is is apparent murder\nTurkish officials say they believe that ... who is a prominent critic of Saudi Arabia's crown prince Mohammed bin Salman was murdered and his body removed from the diplomatic compound that Saudi Arabia has in the Turkish capital of Istanbul\nAnd some Turkish sources to have been telling reporters that they have an audio recording indicating that the the journalist was killed inside there and then his body dismembered now the Saudis strongly denied those accusations\nUh but uh when it's on paper was asked whether the king or the crown prince said anything about a shirt and she being alive or dead he said well they didn't talk about any of the facts\nAnd then the secretary of state allowed him to be photographed a video sitting next to the crown prince and smiling and being happy and talking about are from relation\nTrip with that country this as the rest of the civilized world is condemning the crown prince and what they believe is the action the crown prince who goes he likes to call themselves and be as\nA he's a fairly close to what the Trump Administration and he's trying to portray an image of a new and vibrant Saudi Arabia that's a diversifying its economy away from their old reliance on oil and making some social changes and he has dumps done some of that\nBut he's also been cracking down on activists stamping out criticism putting people in jail he's been getting into diplomatic fights with some countries\nAnd so he's not exactly a you know somebody in the American mold more in the ... of an older fashioned a\nMold from that part of the world war kings\nAnd crown princes run things and you have to do things their way Saudi Arabia is of course has been an ally in some important elements of American policy in the middle east and also on the fight against terrorism ... generally provided some help so there is that on the plus side at least as far as America goes\nThe question now is if they in fact we're responsible for the murder of this journalist who\nUh by the way it was an American resident he actually lived in Virginia just a few miles from the studio in which I Am sitting he was in Turkey apparently are going to the consulate in Saudi Arabia to get sort of papers to get married to his fiance and he was seen going in and never seen coming out\nOf the Saudi excuse me the Turkish investigators in there they finally got into the consulate two weeks after the event and after cleaning crews were seen carrying heavy equipment in and out of that building and they found fresh paint which they believe is covering up toxic substances that might have gotten splashed on the walls\nAnd or other issues or other materials that they really haven't disclosed in detail so the Turkish government is really cracking down on this and they are very concerned that this murder happened on their soil\nOf course the Turkish president or to not exactly a paragon of human rights either and while all this is going on and President Trump is saying oh no no you're innocent until proven guilty which you know of course is not a court of law hum\nAnd what the evidence mounting against the ... I think we can be pretty sure that whoever killed this man if he is in fact dead were from Saudi Arabia there were these Fifteen high profile Saudi officials and Ben operatives\nWho uh went into turkey where they were there for less than a day they all came in on on a visa and died in there and disappeared for a few hours and then left the country they\nWeren't there on a you know just to tour turkey or go around Istanbul and check the local food\nSounds like they have something more serious in mind so\nThe question of course is whether this was a rogue operation as President Trump suggested and as a the king and the crown prince are trying to quietly put out the word that oh this is some rogue operation that went wrong we didn't want this to happen well we'll probably find out very soon the question is what does the United states do about this\nA but in this particular case you know as the case of nine eleven remember with those guys from\nAlmost all but one more Saudi Arabians including lobby\nThe exactly so you you you got to look at all this uh what the jaundiced eye if your market but our values should be the priority in this scenario and one stitch the best of gays should've let the chips fall where they are very much for me to go out of Yemen are consulting roll their back\nAlright thank you so much for the call appreciate it Tom let's go out to Seattle good morning Mike I understand you're going to get some nice weather today so that's some good news for you\nKnow good morning a turkey has been a tumultuous situation they locked up what three hundred journalists recently and held our American for years and they want that guy from Pennsylvania do you think turkey is collaborating with Saudi Arabia and why why don't they release the tape if they have a tape\nYeah well that's interesting because as I say a Seventy four Turkish president ... is not a paragon of human rights either and I've been surprised at how strongly he's been coming down on this I think it must be some kind of a rivalry between those two countries I doubt that he's that interested in a life of one journalist based on his overall record he's a tough guy\nSo that you know I Wonder what's going on there and the other issue this morning as you have all these international corporations and all these foreign ministers\nFrom the G seven nations who are who are very very upset and pulling out of this big international conference and I'm Wondering if\nIf maybe this will be a wake up call to the king and the crown prince that if you want to enter the twenty first century then you need to stop this you cannot run dislike as like a medieval kingdom anymore that you're going to have to come into the modern world and you cannot just you know do this kind of thing I mean maybe they'll learn if they're looking at\nDiminished power and money as as the generations go forward here because you can't rely on what you can dig out from under the sand for much longer to support that country and they they've gotten accustomed to a pretty lavish lifestyle and they want to keep their hold on on the people in that country and wants to oil revenues drive up a good a dry up\nAnd there's no money to give to the populous and there's no food no jobs\nThey know the veil the overthrown they're going to go their way of uh some of the other tyrants in that area so you know maybe this will drag them finally end of the modern world I think that's possible boil\nA sniff out turkey to who they are brutal dictatorship or they got to be sniffed out along was when we need to take the whole investigation and then we need to take baby steps and get this resolved but my bottom pale will do a perfect job\nMhm while he's meeting he's in Turkey this morning so maybe he's getting some answers and he'll come back and be able to tell the president what he learned a close up let's solve the\nProblem right there turkey\nYeah All right thanks so much for the call seven minutes before the hour let's move on to Green Bay good morning Jason\nMorning I'll make two quick points at all like to go on the first point is don't fully trust Saudi Arabia especially post nine eleven I think their hands are completely clean stuff I don't know but we need to examine this carefully escape it any other countries that may have make it better for us dredging\nRelationships with Saudi Arabia and the second point is whatever stories this journalist is working on their obviously has to be a grain of truth to them as far as the never would have been assassinated so I was opposed to what he was working on the war that leaves as far as a corruption than anything else do it without getting the Saudi Government\nThat's a really good point because of that that could a blow the whole thing open a course they could just be the kind of thing that they're sensitive they are not used to criticism so it could be something that to us maybe doesn't seem that critical are that bad but maybe to them it is and of course who knows what they're out there for\nWhat they've got their fingers I have no idea what he was actually\nA how close he was to anything that would that would give them that big of a problem he apparently didn't feel that uh\nThat afraid I guess he had a bit of trepidation which is why he supposedly according to some of the reports we had his cell phone running ... you know sending back audio to his fiance who was waiting in the car outside so he wasn't totally carefree about walking into official Saudi territory but he did it on his own free will we've seen the video of him striding\nThe building so he must have had a ... at least do pretty good shot at coming back out alive but apparently did not happen anyway thank you so much for the call let's go to Sharon in Charleston South Carolina at five before they are\nVery very Michael they're they're just funny listening to all the Republican sham border patrol under the Trump this little to do your duty\nKnows everybody knows Saudi Arabia behind that she didn't know that they could show up and you'll be able to do something to protect my show show because you know they were after him who knows a little too but we'll do party all the lab both a lap dog and a lot of\nFood at Shorty oil\nDoesn't sound like it doesn't sound like at the last two days though they've been coming out pretty strongly on uh the only ones that really talk I've been pretty negative on Saudi Arabia I mean Lindsey Graham it already can tried and convicted him anyway I appreciate the thought I appreciate all

have a lot of interest in 'em but they um there there is a lot of evidence in this case\nIt as just emerged in the last two you know Seventy two hours or so the last couple several days and the evidence strongly suggests that the crown prince psalm on\nA is the bad guy behind all of this it strongly suggests that going in I Would say that it looks like a salt mine sent his team of bad boys two is sun bowl aboard two different private jets Fifteen guys\nMy best girl this morning said anybody remember another time when I hit squad of Fifteen Saudis was dispatched\nTo commit some killing\nAnd say oh it's an interesting point on September eleventh two thousand and one Fifteen of the Nineteen hijackers were Saudis\nAnd ah Savage murderous butchers and and let me just say you know this is this if this comes as a shock to you then however old you are you're probably haven't been paying attention for that period of time\nThis is the Arab world this is Saudi Arabia this is the crown prince of Saudi Arabia as soon as the country with ... hobbies and and the chop chop square and all the major cities where where they be heading people in public and cut their hands off in public\nWith these very custom knives these fancy nice to have their lives that are specifically designed just to cut a hands off\nAnd chop chop square and if you're a Westerner or your present for the chop chop which happens I if I if friday afternoons they have the ah they administer the justice in the public square they will trot people out\nAnd lay him down hands behind tied behind their back lay it down over a block and they chop you're headed for the big head and shopping thing\nOr they chop your hand off they cut your hand off and then they they take your ear while you're screaming or severed hand with their little a fun night for the curve in a bar about it and they spin it around her wrist in your hand falls to the ground is still rising and\nThen they take care of by the arm all your screaming and they jam your arm into some boiling oil to cut her eyes that\nAnd uh it's like um they're both to chicken and jam you're a you're a stump in there and they caught her eyes the thing to stop the bleeding and the spraying all over like a you know Dan Ackroyd doing Julia Child\nAnd ah 'cause they don't want to get it on all the people's ... nice white clothing out there in the desert and that's just part of their culture that has been since ... was new it's Saudi Arabia welcoming to it I I spent several months in Saudi Arabia once myself in Nineteen Ninety\nIn the eastern province in Dhahran mostly\nAnd we would go down to ... mom on friday afternoons\nAnd get some roasted chicken or chicken ... and a hang out in ... ... square to see if they'd bring people out for the Trump shop you know\nAnd um and I never did the whole time I was there a way to go down all the time and and and and while this was going on they decided it was bad PR because all these western news media people were there but normally they'll take westerners and move here to the front of the crowd crowds gather naturally than a movie at the front of the crowd\nYou know we used it in the wild west we used to have public hangings and crowds were together the wild west cell in New York City we used to have public hangings\nAnd and uh the Washington Square park they used to have public executions in lower Manhattan\nAnd crowds would gather for ah for that so and then I digress a little but in the end the Saudi world and it is kind of their own world ah they have they see things their way and they do things their way and they've always done things their way and when you live in a culture where they had people in the public square\nAnd invite the kids to come down and watch and when they chop hands off\nThat shouldn't come as a complete shock when they kill and murder and the enemy of now it's it's a murder and it's a terrible thing and it looks like some on his behind that all the indicators are but at the same time\nWe shouldn't just leap to the conclusion based on whatever the initial facts are that we've figured the whole thing out we've nailed the guy he's guilty how are we going to hold them accountable and that's what the left is doing and when I say the left I made the news media primarily\nA who have just rushed to judgment once again going off half\nCocked with their conclusions which I I mean again it's certainly if this is the opening scene of a Colombo episode it certainly looks like we've we've got our killer Bennett's sell them on and the Fifteen guys\nThey sent in a guy who is a a bone and he's a forensic guy that said they made travels with a bone saw you shouldn't hang out with people that travel with a bone saw\nAnd I and it looks like these Fifteen guys went to the consulate in Istanbul wonderful city don't let it scary away from his tongue pull and and uh they greeted ... show good\nOr bad but the Saudis are trying out sort of a lame explanations like a well we sent the team there to bring it back to Saudi Arabia to face justice and we're interrogating hoops we broke it\nOr that really doesn't make a lot of sense\nIf it were such a mission and extraordinary rendition\nFor example uh you'd probably grab him or put them in a straight jacket by put over his head from the van put 'em on a jet bringing back interrogate him in Saudi Arabia\nIt looks however and I've got some gruesome detail that I Want to share with you from some news reporting that looks like they sent this team and including the several members of prince psalm on security detail\nThe New York times has done a little reporting here and they got a hold of photographs of print Solomon and in the background is this guy who was a regular part of his entourage and this guy is on the video going into the consulate\nThen they've got the bone saw a guy the forensic expert or\nExpert whatever that means who is also seeing with him on the tarmac or various air airports where the princes flying you know one of his giant private airliners\nAnd he's got a big entourage with them because these guys travel with big entourages when they come to Washington DC there might take cover an entire floor and sometimes two floors\nOf the greatest hotels in the city like the four seasons hotel in Georgetown and they pay half million dollars for the week or something even more than that\nBecause they go big they are they're they've got lots of oil money that we gave to them because the Democrats refused to make us energy independent over all these years but President Trump has done a good job of that so it looks like\nSo long as the bad guy but um the the the president of the United states as being depicted in the news media as a villain and all of this because he hasn't\nActed or recklessly enough or aggressively enough for or some thing um and they want the president to go off half cocked like they've got a half half cocked and the president pointed out to them you know there there are some issues with us and you guys are are doing the same thing you did with Kavanaugh\nAnd that you like hot areas he's guilty and they don't allow for due process they don't allow for any process at all they just leap to conclusions and the conclusions are always that\nThat this guy is the bad guy he's guilty let's when Trump once again total Lynch mob mentality by the left\nJust and the media but I repeat myself just as was the case with Brett Kavanaugh's confirmation process that's what we called that that was called the confirmation process the Democrats turn it into a quaint little gang rape thing but that was a confirmation process for a Supreme Court\nA Supreme Court justice and again anybody ever see a game of Thrones\nAnybody ever see a game of Thrones anybody ever see a mystery movie where maybe at the end there's a twist and the guy that you thought did it didn't do it because that happens sometimes too\nI'm not saying that's the case here 'cause I think it's probably the bad guy here but\nI could be wrong because you never know Solomon has been invoked involved in this power play inside of Saudi Arabia where he is this placing an awful lot of very powerful people within the kingdom of Saudi Arabia and these people have the ability to strike back\nAnd who knows whether the security people are actually loyal to sell them on or whether they had been conducted by the king or by another prince who wants to regain power there are hundreds of princes in the ...\nMost of them are irrelevant but the high ranking princes close to the king they've got a lot of power they've got pulled they've got people working for them\nAnd it is a a a byzantine environmentalists mid evil environment and ancient culture that hasn't really involved at a very rapid rate over the centuries and bad things\nHappen things like this happen and things like this are going to continue to happen to happen in the world that if this guy were not somebody that had written some pieces for the Washington Post and that says that really a\nA reporter for the Washington Post he wrote some peace is very critical of

Democrat\nOperative\nThat they present as a Republican\nAnd it's just I found that to be present and don't forget crush Yogi or Florida well how many things that are we supposed to be distracted by your just distracting me with a shaggy in Florida they they'd whatever you're talking about is a distraction whatever they're talking about is the most important story in the world\n[noise] they're not on a spit and and they they all they're suffering from Pete TST President Trump stress disorder and they can't pull their heads out of one another's ... positions it's a it's really\n[noise] [noise]\nAppalling and again ana Navarro I've met ... she was a number of years ago a perfectly nice person now she's all angry all the time because I think she's become a Democrat and\nThen the Kurds have to be angry all the time they just they're angry I'm president and you know I'm president and you're not so take that [noise] ah and whether or not telling you know I mean there are some great things let me we're talking about the the prince\nMohammed bin sell them on M. B. S. they're like called ... been Solomon and is the crown prince of Saudi Arabia has seized power from his father the king and he is implementing a what a lot of people called reforms\nHe's slapping people around he's throwing his cousins and a Ritz Carlton hotel where they're not allowed to leave\nAnd um and threatening them and he's taking billions of dollars from the he has taken billions of dollars away from other princes and Saudi Arabia many of whom might have an axe to grind with prince Mohammed bin saw him on\nAnd that should be taken into account that should be considered as now we're asked as a country to examine this case like we were with the cabin our case the Democrats love to litigate everything out in a public hearing\nAnd this is a fascinating circumstance of Foreign Relations and\nEconomic relations their\nKeys strategic partnerships in the middle east and around the world there are a arms deals on the line which uh provide the United states where the leverage down the road rather than the opposite whereas if they buy their hundred billion or so in weapons systems from the Chinese or the Russians\nAnd the Chinese and or the Russians will have sway\nOver the Saudis and we will have less sway over the Saudis it's a it's an old trick everybody knows how it works how the Democrats want to pull the plug on it which would be good for Russia and China but bad for the United states bad for the region bad for the glass bad for everything\nSo that was a Chinatown reference kind of obscure speaking of Chinatown there was another great motion picture it was called Lawrence of Arabia Peter O'Toole and Anthony Quinn and um all kinds of big actors Omar Sharif\nAnd Anthony quail it was a really great movie David Lean movie and a and honestly if you watch Lawrence of Arabia I don't know if you watch Lawrence and a long time it is a\nWorld class movie visually beautiful and it's a great story largely fictionalized account of a British Army officer World War one fighting the Turks no less the Saudis are and the Turks fighting\nOr what was the Saudis were tribal in a World War one and here comes the Lawrence the British officer\nWho is quite a dandy and he's out there in the desert leading Saudi tribal attacks uh it's really kind of the founding of the modern Saudi kingdom the house of solitude and all of that mixed into the tail\nBut to Lawrence is out in the desert with his\nUh Arab cutting patriots and they had just been busy killing some people\nWhen Lawrence audience when Lawrence um scolded them he was in a sense by the ... of the Arabs and he had ... the ah the tribal leaders sitting before him who had just brutally murdered someone brutally killed someone\nAnd um and Lawrence explained to them that they're going to have to shape up and joined the at that point the twentieth century we're still working on some of this so long as the Adams\nFight fight against type so I Want to be a little people Philippe bothersome to as you\nWell gritty Barbara sudden cruel a silly people are small people greedy Bob or a sudden cruel as you are and ah you know welcome a welcome to the world welcome to the planet earth there we are a lot of bad things happen and\nUh and they're going to keep happening I can I can assure you [laughter] and then there's the news media switches pressuring president Donald Trump to overreact to jump the gun\nAnd concluded that we know exactly what happened here when we don't know exactly what happened and we think we have a pretty good handle on what happened here\nAnd it looks like we've got a good deal of evidence to suggest that this Saudi team of Fifteen aboard two jets a lot of evidence went in with the intent of murdering ... mall ...\nThe Saudis are squirming and they're trying to come up with stories now they're saying well maybe we send a team there to interrogate him and then\nThey got carried away and hoops they broke him and then you know are they gonna do you got to chop them up into pieces and put them into an asset bath every this happened to bring along with the bones saw saying in the case over there a board our private jets\nUm it looks very much like the Saudis had this guy killed because he was a thorn in their side it looks very much like the news media not surprisingly and legitimately\nIs rising up in the United states and around the world to say hey we can have government so fascinating and butchering reporters even though he's not he has to be a reporter with some Arab News outlets where they didn't really have a great deal of interest in publishing but ground truth but who are we to a\nJudge their culture and compare their culture to our culture their culture is just as legitimate as ours is this is what the left has been telling us for many decades now for many many decades and and that's\nUh the ... of course until it's not and and that's standard protocol with these guys because that's the way that they are\nSo the news media's pushing the president over Iraq they say well we know what happened the news media always knows what happened that they know that with Brett Kavanaugh he gave those girls choir loads Nineteen eighty something and then they stood outside the door and waiting in line for gang rape pulling the train on teenage girls\nWith braces and thick glasses because that's what happened in the news media

they noticed that I noticed that they changed the metric it used to be less than two dollars a day\nBut a lot of left wing regimes have populations that live on two dollars a day and and they don't want to call that an\nAbject poverty so they lowered it they moved to the bar they do this all the time and you'd think over time the bar for abject poverty would go up and not down but it actually went down they lowered it to a dollar Ninety a day so the\nPeople of Cuba for example the slave ship called Cuba that the left just loves not just Michael Moore they all love it it's a slave ship it's a plantation and uh the average Cuban lives on less than two dollars a day less than two dollars a day\nAnd and they don't want to say that I live in abject poverty so they moved to the bar that's that's what they do\nIn any event Honduras Guatemala moved to stop migrant caravan after Trump threats oh no Trump is threatening the poor innocent people are ... that goes in\n\nAnd out of slash Washington and escort the last in Guatemala the Reuters news agency says the organizer of a migrant caravan is an organizer now let me let me just stop there for a second\nYou know the infection that is the left um has spread it spread to the United states under the ... a bronco bum administration\nAnd then bronco bothers saw to it that spread also to other countries like countries in Central America\nAnd the community organizer movement where do you think these caravans camera because they didn't happen before Barack Obama these are organized up\nAnd where do you think all the people got briefed on what they need to say to customs and border protection and and and to ice you got to say oh I'm leaving because I fear for my life because the violence in my country and bigger and they got briefed on it right now is true for some people it's true but not for everybody and they bring them up on it so\nThey've got this community organizer that's marching a caravan\nOf about three thousand people toward the United states they're going to walk they don't they're not going to take a boat they're not going to take a plane they are going to walk\nAnd guess what the plan is to have them walk and walk and walk\nAnd then they get here just before election day\nOh you see election day and the Democrats are work and I don't know if you saw this story a couple of days ago the Democrats have pulling this came out about a week ago the Democrats have polling that show that the Latino vote in America which they expect will go to them because they're raised us\nWe'll be weak will be fame will be less than what they want on election day for the midterm elections when they must win back the house so they can impede shut up and up in the American government and and bring the revolution and the civil war more rapidly than they're currently able to bring up\n[noise]\nThe Democrats have a dog in this fight and the organizer down there I'm going to guess he knows people here I just I don't I Can't say that for certain but I'm going to guess that the organizer of a migrant caravan from Honduras was detained in Guatemala on Tuesday as the U.S government that's President Trump\nThreatened to withdraw from both countries and El Salvador if the flow of migrants north to the United states was not stopped\nTake that\nUp to three thousand migrants courting organizers estimates crossed the from Honduras in Guatemala on a trick northward after a standoff on Monday with police in riot gear\nThe Honduran foreign ministry called on its citizens not to join the group\nNow the news media's been fanning the flames stoking and say oh it's growing every day it's doubled in size because it's drama and it's a TV show it's made for TV and it's made for the Democrats and it's made for the midterm elections the timing is\nNot just suspicious it's obvious it's it's like the timing of a Brett Kavanaugh accuser is coming forward it's obvious that this is the Democratic party effort\nAt least in part\nHonduran President Juan Orlando Hernandez set in a public address on Tuesday evening that's last night some Hondurans in the caravan had already returned home and the government was prepared to support them they're going to ... we will give you money if you don't go\nHey did not specify how many had turned back\nOver the border Guatemalan police officers detained march total of

tough stance on immigration but it's true they press on the United states made it clear\nThat the governments will be held accountable\nAnd Central America if they allow this be asked to continue and you know because we throw money around all over the place like we're diamond Jim and we're not twenty trillion dollars in debt we throw money to Honduras and El Salvador\nGuatemala and everybody else to Saudi Arabia gets us into that and you know it but but listen because we give in to those countries the president was able\nRock Obama could have done this too but I didn't the president was able to say listen\nYou guys are sitting here watching this and you know that you're being a paint on our butts and we're going to pull the plug on the aid that we send you are harder in taxpayer dollars\nAnd unless you stop them and guess what's happening\nAnd guess what's happening\nAnd guess what's happening and just in case that that isn't clear enough the president is a busy on Twitter this morning is reinforcing mess because he's going to make it stop unlike the ... the little girls of the Democratic party in\nThe media and um I repeat myself Donald Trump on his Twitter account Donald J Trump president United States not Hillary Diane rod him but\nThey treated the United states has strongly informed of the president of Honduras but if the large caravan of people heading to the U.S has not stopped and brought back to Honduras no more money or aid will be given to Honduras effective\nImmediately you could\nThe squealing breaks the screech of the tires as they threw the

was listening to your show the other day and I heard you I'm mentioning to somebody with regards to for one case um you don't recommend having anything tied up in the company's stock that she works for I'm\nBetty right that's right and that's something I've I've felt forever but even more intensely after Enron went by slash decade and peoples and total of their IRA was an Enron stock and everybody's retirement got wiped out\n[noise] so they got me to one little first I was wondering why should I guess that explains that um [noise] but then also my company actually offers a stock purchase playing for employees that is a Fifteen Percent discount when you purchase suck\nYeah does plan to have to hold it or at least one year before you can sell it and I was wondering what would be the best way to do about the energy\nI'm fairly new to invest in overall among you're doing it for a couple of years or ... years old and he turned that into the game kind of lazy I'm so my ideal is this the kind of keep you there\nUm and just let it grow along with my four one K. power but when I heard you the other day I thought maybe they might not be the best idea so I was just wondering what your suggestion would be\nSo I Love these plans where the company offers you a discount and I guess I take a little bit out of each paycheck and find the purchase of the stock that they give you a Fifteen Percent off\n[noise] is that right [noise] yes that's right\nYeah so I I Love that because they're giving you a direct incentive and you've got a guaranteed Fifteen Percent steel on the stock I mean that's pretty great and then the iffy part is you have to own it for a year\nAnd then add a year you can sell so it's possible the stock will go down over that next here and even though you got to discount you might lose money beyond the likely that he would lose money consistently and it's really a a\nA great gift they're giving you giving you an opportunity to be an owner of the company in part and on the stock so I don't have a problem with that\nUm and you could add the years mark ... the salad and take your profits paid the tax on it\nBut okay the four oh one K. thing\nThere's when you load up a four O. one K. with company stock that's the money you're depending on for your retirement money that you're doing and the stock purchase plan where you get the discount you can use it for any purpose he won after that twelve month holding period\nOkay and you know it was good at all out at twelve month so are there different issues and different concerns\nOkay actually that I guess I was wondering if I should be taking that money and you know selling it taken the ... and you know moving that just something else like an IRA\nWhy or why you took the words right out of my mouth what I Would love I'm smiling as you asked that because you made it sound like you don't get the investing thing at all and you ask the perfect question so if you how the stock for a year you sold it then I'd love it if you put it in a Roth IRA\nAnd 'cause you're allowed to put up to fifty five hundred dollars a year in Iraq he put money in a Ross and it grows tax free all through the next Thirty years he'll be working and then you spend that money and everything at CERN tax free\nSo up there and then that automatically diversified you away from the company stock and the four one K. you have what are you putting your money and then it\nWith a company matches a six percent so I put the social six percent match in there\nAnd then what do you ... what are you investing in and\nThe oh our most\nOf it was in um the vanguard I'm target fun\nThat's perfect and I would put it all and the vanguard target fund for since you're thirty three but sort of like um oh what would that be great doing like twenty six the twenty fifty five\nI say it's twenty shave the shower don't want to say yeah\nThat's fine and there'll be a great decision and then you're completely diversified away from what you're doing in that company stock and then if you did a Roth IRA with money you'd sell after a year of that company stock plan you could put all that\nAnd a Roth IRA with vanguard in the same target retirement fund twenty fifty five so you'd have\nYour uh four one K. at work and be a ... times and then you have your raw there would be after tax money and that would be a beautiful combo so sounds to me Brandon like you're doing a great job and you should know that\nIt's saving money for a time or thirty three puts your head and most people don't really think about it till they have their fortieth birthday so you're not behind you're kind of a head of a lot of people\n... with us on the Clark Howard show hell I'm Marlon\nBut afternoon ... lego and\nI'm having a great day and I hope you are to\nCertainly are um [noise] just the cost of one question I've um [noise] the state employees retirement fund I've been called a two foot clay employer for about twelve years\nAnd I'm\nFrom ... to it's higher in order to all the sun's out so I couldn't do that [noise]\nUm and take a lump sum would would there be any other plans that you'd recommend take a fight like a lady for about twelve thousand dollars which is a great sum but\nShould I call a light that what's another plan\nSo he said this is a state retirement plan ...\nFederal employees who I Am a plant store\nI see you got this twelve grand and so your option would be to take it where they can be just a monthly check for the rest of your life forget that twelve grams\nSo until I D.C.'s by receive that amount but they allow payable too I'm an air war or you can write\nIt depends on the state plan than a mind thing generally is I like for you to get the monthly check\nAnd the reason is you're not as likely to be able to generate as much money from that twelve thousand says the state will pay you every month and if there's somebody who's really depending on you five\nIn the event that they outlive you eat he married that you have a wife who'd be depending on you yes so what you can do\nIf you're if you're say plan just terminate at the time of your death and doesn't offer a survivor payment to your wife at that time you could do something pretty simple you could buy a term life insurance policy\nTo bed at the time of your debt to pay a a benefit to your wife and then regardless of where the sources of funds would be she would get a vast amount of money in order to have to live on in the event that she al ...\nCase so I couldn't buy a term life policy that would be like hey that for some time is that what you're\nYou know the white term life works and you buy it for a period of time Fifteen Years Twenty years science Thirty Years' sensors gotta set premium for a set amount of coverage\nAnd in the event you do pass away and the Fifteen twenty Thirty years it just pays a lump sum to your wife fuzzier survivor so\nIn that way you don't have to worry what can happen to her if you're not around um [noise] you know she'd be grieving over you but she wouldn't have to worry about money [noise]\n[noise] okay but I Do have a term life so it's a ... year plan which probably will expire and about you know there are six years and I'm estimating I'll probably outlive it so\nSo if you are in good health and you want to make sure she is protected for a many years to come you could buy a twenty thirty year a policy and you could let the one with the Sixers remaining lapse if he wanted\nAnd place it with a new one oh where you could have both temporarily because if you were to die unexpectedly in six years she might need more money to carry her through her natural lifespan for\nThis pretty stuff we're talking about [laughter] but um you

noticed and is happening to so many people in the country is you'll resolve you're going to set up a Roth IRA or you're going to set up\nAn IRA even put money into the account after you open it but you forget one more step\nAnd that is\nYou've got to choose the investments the money's going to go in\nSo many\nPeople's dollars per sitting in IRAs burning basically nothing and the default equivalent of like a money market account like a savings account inside an IRA or off you're not even going to be able to keep up with inflation\nIt's\nAbsolutely essential but when you open a retirement account you go\nThe next step that may or may not be obvious when you open that account with the money you put in\nYou choose what it will be invested in a lot of times people will be overwhelmed\nBy what psychologists refer to as the paradox of choice there are so many different funds are so many different options you just basically shut down you put the money in the account but you don't ever choose how it will be invested so\nKeep it very simple\nMost places that have you on any of the low cost places I recommend you're going to be able to put money into a target retirement fund\nAnd you put it in the target retirement fund for the year closest when you're going to retire\nAnd just put all the money in that\nInterview whiter want to do things that are more involved and let's say you decide well I Want to put some money and\nEmerging market says the term for third world countries or I Want to put money in some form of bonds or I Want to put money in a European socks or whatever it is I mean you want to do things more exotic\n... about it but for so many people starting out with a Roth IRA or traditional i._r._a.\nJust picking a simple default choice to target

Clark\nHoward show hello Dorian on coal color you great thank you if you want to try to understand something about what gives you your grade on how you're doing with credit is that right\nYeah my my question on he often talk about keeping your veil of credit below thirty but around twenty first happy ending you talk about credit card color kind\nMy question was a fair number also include blind flying good credit specifically home equity lines of credit\nWhat a great question and as a general rule if you have a home equity line of credit with a failed more credit let's say a fifty thousand which is a very common number for a home equity line of credit the percentage that you're using would also factor because uh\nHome equity line of credit many times is looked at as a personal line of credit like a personal loan or a credit card\n[noise] personal old also affected and ... just credit that to a ...\nIn a home equity line that's a form of revolving credit so and in all ... loan like a car loan\nUm mortgage loan would not be figured into the ratio for available credit\nThere is a clear correlation fit the credit bureaus can demonstrate and particularly fight go can demonstrate that the percent of available credit someone is using a revolving credit\nIs a direct indicator\nAbout when somebody is going to be a risky person to win too\nAnd so the way they the way the math works you pointed out to thirty percent thing\nThat you know money uses thirty percent of available credit is considered to be a low risk for or somebody who uses ten percent of available credit is considered to be an extremely low risk for or somebody who is likely\nNever to be an issue where the default on the other hand somebody who uses fifty percent of a veil more credit is\nAn extremely high risk of getting delinquent or defaulting on debt\nOkay because it used to be that in the past if he had a lot of available creditors look bad because they have said that she got into trouble and you can black a lot to get it right now to look it's gone and the other direction\nActually it has and this is where it gets confusing Dorian is that when you're talking to a mortgage lending underwriter he or she hates the available credit\nBecause they're worried just like you said so it's such a mixed message because\nQualifying for the best right on a mortgage is partially a factor of you having extremely low utilization of your revolving credit like credit cards\nAnd on the other hand that gets you the rate from the mortgage lender and then some underwriters will say yeah yeah yeah but I'm nervous you're going to take that visa card that you're using four percent of the available credit and you're going to go crazy going out and buying stuff\nLike\nThat so that's why it's it is a confusing message so my attitude and my advice is this\nLive your life using his widow of your available creditors you can and if you get to the\nEnd of the line and it's time to close on a mortgage and the underwriter throws up a roadblock at that time he may have to close ally and her credit or to uh get the mortgage through\nBut the principle of having a very low utilization is the right answer and the right thing to do\nThe whole talking very much thank you and you have a great\nDay Sabrina is with us on the Clark Howard show Hi Sabrina\nHi how are you clocked\nGreat thank you you are trying to help a relative what's going on\n[noise] well architects I got over his head and get oh I'm Sorry ... yeah well you know nothing about it he didn't come to come up with the [noise] and he he didn't have the four oh one K. to help pay off their credit card oh\nYeah exactly [noise]\nSo what we did was we were going to come up with a plant that I got taken point\nWhat we would like to do it too much I got to look at it papers and see how much but that is what could pay off in the Clinton credit cards are twenty four percent we will obviously make can pay back but it may be three percent\nOkay in a way way way way way way to stop you right there because I hear your heart\nTalking so Sabrina somebody who has run up a lot of debt and as a family member and you\nDo a work out for them and that's what it's called you know work out where you pay off the high interest rate that you become the wind or for the lower interest rate debts you said something right there that I got to throw the flag on you said and of course will make him pay back\nThe odds are that he may intend to pay you back but they're not high that it'll actually happen\nSo when you if you were to do something like this you have to think of it in terms of you are you will call it alone to him he'll even have loan terms but psychologically in your own mind do you have to be prepared that this may ultimately be a gift not alone\nOf course of course and knowing him that way I Do he well all I Want to or an inconvenient [laughter] back in the show and that's why the team and you were killed written over having run up didn't want to come by and\nWhat kind it was a lifestyle things or did he have a medical problem or what caused the debt as best you can tell\nIt started with a car that died and he had to go out and buy a car\nAnd then from there we also think that he got himself into a credit card debt Betty started back in eighty nine scratch on our own ... you know the answer is getting a lottery and then I think it's all so I don't know because he hasn't told the whole story yet\nBut he used to send me pictures\nOf cell phone telling his credit rating about over a country so he's a great extent or in the past I think he just got in over his head on that\nOkay so let me tell you what I think needs to happen next and it's not\nYou giving him alone\nOkay what he needs to do is if he's got the best of intentions and things got out of control won him he needs to sit down with a budget counselor\nAnd there's a group called the national foundation for credit counseling have you ever heard me mention them\nBy half he may have to hear it several times before he'll be willing to make an appointment and go in but they'll take him to the root cause of 'cause everybody's always got a story about how they ended up where they did with that right but it's a it's a plan\nAnd a map basically that gets you on to a new path and you just winning and the money I don't think changes whatever it was that got him to where he is and that's why I think he needs to tough love of a budget counselor\nTo help him see a path to better way of handling his money because even if you white or choose to win and the money the things that brought him to where he is does have to change for St\nPaul I completely agree\nSo what I Would say is ... have you broach the subject with him of lending him money\nWe've had we were going to meet with either tonight or sometime next week\nSo great because I don't want that out there yet as a carrot or possibility\nRight I Would I Would go in with the idea that you want him to go sit down with somebody at the closest an FCC affiliate\nAnd you go in with the information for them if you go to an FCC dot org\nYou'll be able to find the closest affiliate and generally they sit down and do counseling with him at most affiliates that's free or it's so cheap it's like and significant great they can go with the ... step if he's really boxed himself into a corner\nThey can actually negotiate a payment plan with the various companies he owes money to and they may\nAnd be able to get the interest rate marked down to zero should be better that are already ... percent sure and then you're not in this thing where you have lent money and then the awkward thing happens well he didn't pay this month\nShe didn't pay next month I mean we got to get to the heart the root of how we got there and how he's going to get out\nSo I said I strongly recommend this is a path\nYeah during the day today will see a mix outstanding clouds with

such an explanation as I told your mayor trying the mainstream media folks trying their level best to make this Trump's fault somehow\nOh he's covering up or I told you of the day it's not going to be longer they haven't already done this before they're going to say you know when he was talking about the media the media are the enemy of the of the people in the enemy of the state and all that kind of stuff well this is what happens you see people take this literally around the world that killed journalist\nWhy is it well I I Know I've I start to ask the question already know the answer I was going to say why is it\nThat these so called journalists at the Washington Post New York times rescue folks who are being into CNN or not the least bit curious that the cash heart Haji may have been a Muslim\nBrotherhood spy and that may have been why the Saudis killed him I'm not saying that justifies it would add to the ... actually it certainly is not justified just because the guy happens to oppose your regime that you're going to lure them into the conflict and kill him\nI was talking to a friend of mine today who's from turkey\nAnd I and you know I was asked him about because he pays a lot more attention to this stuff and I ...\nAnd he was talking about how this was\nA situation where you are 'cause I'm going you know how does this happen you got to be hit man apparently there were there the consulate the very same day that ... was there\nAnd a says is understanding is Akash Haji was wanting to go he was getting married or something\nAnd they are the ones who made the appointment for him he wanted to go to a different consul and the different country they said no meaning in Turkey and made it to the conflict on this day and this time this person also told me that the Turks that were working there and you know the locals that work there were given the day off\nAnd that sounds rather suspicious on the part of the Saudis I don't think there's any doubt that they had this guy rubbed out the question is plane and if you find that he is a Muslim Brotherhood spy it explains why it doesn't make it right\nBut they're all looking at best like all Saudi Arabia is killing\nJournalist I don't even have anything to do with being a journalist for the question is what are we going to do about it what should we do about it I've seen the Saudis do a whole lot worse than this and we've not done a thing about it\nWe never really probing the nine eleven and why there were so many Saudis on those planes and whether they had connections to the Saudi Government which some websites in some investigative journalist have said that they do I'm not prepared to sit there and tell you that all that is true\nBut it's certainly it is worthy of further investigation but mainly you know no they're\nNot interested in that I don't know what the um\n[noise] I don't know exactly what the endgame is really ... by the way diminish the Sousa\nDeath Albany shouldn't be me

welcome back how are you\nA hey I'm doing great are looking forward to being on the show we'll good glad to have you so let's talk about we'll get to the DVD the moment the midterms you know what I'm\nSeeing out there I got I got this uh well you look at a ballot pd and some of these is what I'm saying these whether you're caught referring to was bellwether\nCongressional districts running and so they tell me to look at these and so I started looking at him and this was several weeks ago and then went back and looked at him you know earlier this week there is a district Minnesota a general you've paid attention to this when it was plus one plus two Democrats\nAre about a month ago now it's plus sixteen the Republican\nAnd that's after the cabinet thing and now all of a sudden they don't want us to look at that district is no longer a bell whether they want to look at everything else what do you see I Know well you know neither one of his his into production business but how do you think this is shaping up here three years or three weeks down the road\nWell I think that I'm having a family if you can call it that was so I'm pivotal because\nIt has United the Republican Party as never before a and the reason for that is that even the Republicans were uneasy about Trump and thought that the left stereo was due to Trump bad behavior or Trump said he packed or from this or that\nThey suddenly realized that with Kavanaugh we have a complete Boy Scout not somebody who is not only someone who has intellectually impeccable credential but somebody was certified by everybody I Know a man and work with him\nAnd be morally upright either gentlemen and so on but you have here are kind of McCain Romney character of of of known rectitude and the left was willing to destroy that guy without it can go out for cooperation so the feeling that this could happen to any of us\nI think has sent a chill down the spine of Republicans were very alive we'd better moving to action here this is a very serious\nAnd what happened was in my estimation the Democrats underestimated are not only Trump cabinet where they thought that they were going to spring this on the eve of the confirmation vote on Kavanaugh was just going to say okay this is too much for me I'm Out he didn't he stood in the fall and then they had to bring somebody up\nWith the accusations and the so called witnesses and then we had to go through all of this\nThey never and then to me and this was when I was seeing him for Jeff Flake I thought we needed that FBI investigation not because you and I knew anything different afterwards\nBut the American people saw that as a stamp of approval to good housekeeping seal of approval\nOn what the Judiciary Committee already knew so once we got the FBI's stamp of approval on the fact that uh this forward and woman had one of the witness sushi hand we're not lining up with what she was saying I think the whole thing change to the point\nI I agree with that uh I also think that what's happening is that has the unusual ability not only can drive by not\nI mean look at poor Elizabeth Warren I mean she could get her to put on their feathers and get ahead rapid come running out in public right before the midterm there I think even her own side I mean this is from ... from Britain arrangement had\nUm I was part of a team that um we did not get handed the millions of dollars\nBecause our cars clutch kale in the acceleration which then three days later wait a minute we don't need a cultural electric motor\nAnd buying our car can accelerate from zero to sixty and under five seconds and it's a thirty five hundred pound car\nWhile and it gets two hundred and something to the gallon yeah well what's going on what it wants to say okay what are you always say well in his legs so it's only what does that mean equivalent\nThirty five thousand watts of electricity equals a gallon of gas in Clark\nAnd uh so you what you're saying is but if you hand slit say your own solar panels charging this thing up you wouldn't take anything off the grid and this thing would be charged up for free right\nWhen staying takes three dollars to charge it up off of rural electric\nFrom like empty and then it goes two hundred and fifty miles 'cause we only have basically a a gallons worth of energy\nA in electric batteries that we have a impact we use let the iron phosphate batteries instead of the lithium ion that kept causing one of our um I'll just say that's why competitors\nTo have their cars catching on fire on Seventy five degrees and we're about halfway to China where hardship takes twenty five hundred degrees to start that chemical reaction so guess what kind of batteries that company that everybody knows the name of Mao\nUses they're moving to the batteries are using oh they they have a\nRally real quick because we're short on time he met when it comes to like what is it Ninety two octane or whatever is that is that really better for your automobile\nIt depends on your car octane is resistance to bond or in other words function we call it ... it's really just to pass on so the bottom line is this if your car\nMeans because of compression higher octane so that it doesn't start the explosion prematurely before the spark plug in other words\nWhen you need to use the higher up thing otherwise if you're using the higher octane in a vehicle that doesn't mean it then what happens is is that the resistance to explosion takes place and you don't get all the energy out and it gets a\nConverted into catalytic converter and you're not using the fuel anyway so you don't get any better performance out of it some kind of depends on if you got to a foreign ... a a lot of European vehicles have higher impression so they need that so that it doesn't start explosion before the start of dust\nInteresting married almost ... ... the wealth of information and mayhem\nElectric car a range of two fifty and so that's I mean that's what I say when we get to this thing where you can charge him up and no time like it takes you to to fill up a gallon I'm thinking five to seven minutes eight minutes ten minutes maybe\nA then we're there and at that point you know I mean I'm a big electric car fan um there's the the the range problem that people have but then you know when when they put the cart before the horse on that too\nHe must should've work with somebody else they have all these charging stations out before he even wrote the first Tesla off the showroom floor but that's just make quick time out we'll be back into

some ... came up with is rather simplified evaluation of worrying he goes this way they are only two reasons for worrying either you're successful or you're not if your success\nOh there's nothing to worry about if you're not there are only two things to worry about your health is going to be good are you going to get sick that your health is good there's nothing to worry about if you're sick where there are only two things to worry about it you're going to get well or you're going to die\nAnd if you're going to get well there's nothing to worry about\nBut if you're going to die and then there are only two things to worry about either you're going to go to heaven or not and if you're going to go to heaven there's nothing to worry about I mean so why worry there does seem to be an obvious point in this I mean if you're a life sentence with one who made you then there's nothing to worry about\nIs there\nI'm Larry west with World Radio and I care speaking for churches a Christ we

goal to get into education and to get into the to infiltrate the government and they've been a very good job of it\n\nWhat it is incumbent and see how many of these folks who say that there that are members of the Democratic socialist of America that's a communist organization will know villages socialist they call themselves\nAnd I I read this many years ago now in this quote start when they was siblings putting a socialist anti communist the firing squad that's all I mean there's ... they're basically the same thing and when you've got folks who are members of the Democratic socialist of

know they're comedies and they want to overthrow the government's they've sent so it's in their literature the whole thing they want to get rid of capitalism\nAnd capitalist and so these are the types

and she was leaking stuff to the intercept you remember her name she had a real strange name\nUm [noise] you know what I'm Talking about the rain man\nI guarantee she's a member of these organizations is like where and how many of these people have to pop up on your rain or before you figure out oh my gosh we may have a problem with the Democratic socialist of America\nThere infiltrating the government's sabotaging this is what they do so I Would go through and find that new if an FBI background check if you got any affiliation with his organization you're fired\nAnd we're going to get real Americans in there for crying out loud come on man [noise]\nI Know I Know I Know exactly what some yo ... sounds like McCarthy is with well let me tell you something if you go back and read about the McCarthy he was about Ninety percent right they may be got an overzealous on some folks\nBut some of the people he was going after we didn't find out for decades that these people were all inside the government was like a Hollywood\nNow yeah and they were all lead up to them they were righteously indignant oh my gosh this is a witch hunt\nWhere we just found some which is what we still do and they're all in there and they all have look I'm not saying that you can't be a member of the Democratic socialist of America what I'm saying is is we don't named at this and this should be a security flagged it\nIf you're a member of an organization that wants to destroy capitalism you don't mean to me and the government apparatus of a capitalist nation will\nFeel who says we have to be capitalist because capitalism and America are joined today about how many times are going to tell you this well this is one of the old ... from uncle Phil\nCapitalism and America are joined at the hip if you're anti capitalist you are by definition anti American you can say oh I Love this country if it Rowley socialist and then it wouldn't be in this country anymore\nIf you think this will be a wonderful utopia if we would just be a socialist country then you don't care how about the United states of America because capitalism is what we are one built us\nAnd it's what we are throwing throw you can separate the two and then say oh well how might approve of the socialist states of America no that wouldn't work communist thing to them you know I didn't know where the United states of America and were based\nOn a capitalist system and the economy that's capitalism based not socialist capitalist it's the best if not perfect\nIt is not perfect oh by the way you know I've been telling you over and over and over again how this is a great time for entrepreneur is have you heard uncle Phil tell you this okay we'll check this out us and all this isn't a show for it by the way film at one time dot com show prep\nThe U.S economy is now sitting back on top of the world Economic Forum annual global competitiveness competitiveness survey for the first time since the financial crisis\nAnd you know they say about us well this is interesting because\nThey say that the the new Nineteen states of America is uh the the reason they give us this this top spot the reason we're on top is because of our entrepreneurial atmosphere\nAnd this is what they say that we beat out Singapore and Germany Switzerland in Japan and other top foreign markets\nWhere the score of eighty five point six out of a hundred due to our vibrant entrepreneurial culture and strong labor market and financial system is\n... there's never been a better time to be an entrepreneur if you've got an idea for something go forward this is the time what are you waiting on\nBut I'm scared but I understand that and I'm not encouraging you to take your life savings and go blow it on the next big thing but what I'm telling you is if you've ever had the hankering to be an entrepreneur launch company or launch an idea or whatever\nBeing prudent about it be smart about it but do it don't sit on any longer this is the time to take that idea and take the market at least try to because there has never been a better time now I I Will tell you this\nI think that that opportunity only gets better but I'm Talking about now looking backwards I Can't remember in my lifetime a better time to be an entrepreneur\nAnd the reason I say that even during the eighties as hot as the eighties were we didn't have the Internet\nAnd we didn't have social media and we didn't have apps and all of the stuff that just adds gasoline to when I hear you put something out man it's hot and everybody knows about it in ten minutes thinking about it that it wasn't that way before\nWe had three networks and then we had cable with CNN and that was it now we've got all of this on TV we get you to we got the Internet\nIs just the chance that if you come up with the smoking hot idea that it literally takes off overnight is so much greater now but it's every man and the history of the United states really the history of the world but the chance to take your idea and make it viral\nHas never been better so if you've got a great idea now's the time to do it\nBecause he is something else to how many times have you said something or done something or whatever and then somebody else's run with your idea Johnny B and I were just talking about this and the break it's amazing I was looking back at um\nWas an old clip of me on Fox and friends and I was on there with Brian kill me and they had me on talking about the Dixie Chicks thing and I'm sitting there and I\nThe debate on this thing too so I could make sure I'm looking at this
