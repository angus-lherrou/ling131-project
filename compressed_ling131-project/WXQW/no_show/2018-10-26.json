that that that Israel is the only democracy in the middle east um you know they get to pick their leaders we don't get to pick their leaders should they get to pick the leaders\nAnd um I think that the relationship has always been strong and we're going to work to keep it stronger than ever and\nYou think there'll be bipartisan support for the sanctions on Iran or upcoming or will be necessary

I've learned through the years is that things things shift and of course in the middle east\nThings changed pretty quickly but I think what what needs to never change is a is a strong bond between the U.S and Israel and I and I will say that you know a President Obama had differences with Iran as you pointed out\nBut when it came to a to helping Israel with with with funding um he was right there and we've always had a uh for the past twenty or Thirty years we've always had a both presidents from both sides of the aisle\nBipartisan even\nThe the relationship and that's really what I Want I

because a guy named Glenn sparks he's a professor he's a PHD out at the er\nAt the Brian lamb school of communications at Purdue University Brian Lamb my old boss over at CSPAN anyway a doctor sparks has done some research and find that when people watch scary films their heart rate their blood pressure and respiration all increase and after the film was over this kind of psychological arousal stays with us\nWe just may not be aware of it but what what Dr sparks says is that that means any positive emotions that your experience like having fun with your friends\nBar intensified so maybe the the dinner that you go to after the movie taste better so instead of focusing on the fight that your style during the film you just recall having a great time and you want to come back for more some people are just why are some of it's just like to have that kind of psychological\nThe arousal or or impact about ten percent of the population enjoys the adrenalin rush these are probably the same

lifestyles\nI didn't exercise versus having diabetes heart disease kidney disease and smoking\nAnd the result as I said was quite surprising\nBeing honest on a treadmill test 'cause you're at a higher risk of dying hadn't goes was high blood pressure diabetes kidney disease or being a smoker they said that being understood it\nShould be treated as a disease that could cure being exercised\nI'm pro or long period of time um\nSome research has some doctors thought that perhaps exercise could be over done\nAnd cause problems\nFor research has said that that was probably is correct and and that there was no benefit to the I'm Sorry no no restriction to the benefit of becoming aerobic really more and more if it could not be over done\nAnd it expanded the life expectancy even in patients who had the heart disease\nDiabetes hypertension and more smokers\nThe other good news was the benefit of becoming more aerobic leave that was the same whether you and your ... your eighties Tobias is

exercise the rest of the team does he can always judge a book by its cover and this is this is proof I mean this this study is is proof from that\nIt sure is and to get a little bit more specific um

Jersey democratic senator Cory Booker\nHas been recovered in Florida had a similar in appearance to the others received in the last few days that was the eleventh package this week shortly after twelve suspicious package address to foreign national intel director James Clapper and CNN was identified corresponded Evan per as if in New York\nA package that was a recovered and New York I just a few blocks away from CNN was addressed to CNN and it was addressed to James Clapper the former director of national intelligence this and the fact is that what they're covering the lord overnight which was addressed the Cory Booker\nHas all of the same similarities and these are all people who are critics of the current administration in\nNYPD total containment vessel now has the package meant for Clapper Anders transporting the apparent device to a safe location James Clapper target of the would be bomber has a warning for critics of the president\nTo look very scary walk like come at the clock boys briefcase which the news media told us that looked like a bomb at all remember that now these look like these are terrorist attacks on our instead of attempted assassination attempt that assassinations\nBut again it is like the idea of James Hodgkinson of the Bernie Sanders' campaign\nShowing up with a rifle filled with blanks and firing about somebody\nI don't think that the news media would be wedding dirty diapers over\nBlanks being fired at Republicans on a ... call that Jerry oh you shouldn't do that and they'd be laughing within five minutes [laughter] well good saying it didn't turn out to be bad news now\nAlso the news media they they have all ... they have news ... they have they forget what they were reporting five minutes ago forget about two weeks ago but just a couple of weeks ago in fact ... give a couple of weeks ago I was doing my research\nThe by the way we're at eight eight eight six three zero nine six two five eight eight eight six three oh nine six two five\nAnd there is a caravan headed our way to take care of and there's Caribbean and coming our way it's a it's like the you know I remember in the uh the wolf men when the care of and came at a town and it was the gypsies and then one of the Missouri wolf mini better local\nMancini junior in this case and then he became a wolf men too that was a that was how the whole thing started was with a caravan\nAnd and I talked about this yesterday that reporters CNN or MSNBC\nOr going out to the crowd sleeping on the ground walking north said as the sun rose you could hear all the people coughing hacking and coughing as the sun was rising up\nAnd I I might you know that might that indicate that there's some sort of a health a public health issue of some ... no no no not to the news media they're they're just because they're poor they need to move the United states and then they'll start coughing that'll be OK then I'll get back to that but\nIt was day before yesterday and I mean Wednesday I mean I mean forty eight hours ago that um there was a charge placed [laughter]\nAgainst the uh the person who sent letters with white powder to a series of Trump Administration officials including the white\nHouse and the president of the United states but interestingly enough and and they were supposed to be rice and and in fact the the powdery substance was made from\nCastor bean is which is what you're used to make the deadly talks and rice and but it hadn't been fully processed into legitimate rice and\nNow the news media set of that well that's nothing that's fake that's that's fake that's not an assassination attempt but when you receive inert explosive devices that aren't explosive devices\nBecause the devices won't explode the way that they're built or whether they're configured the way that they sent they don't explode I say they're not bombs\n\nIs a blank bullets\nNo a blank is not a bullet and an urge bomb is not a bomb\nAnd caster beans that are not rice and are not rice and\nBut the news media is fine with a couple of the scenarios Mrs literally from Wednesday at one fifty two PM from CNN the day before yesterday October twenty four of two thousand Eighteen by eat ally what kittens I Wonder if it's related to alley Watkins\nAt the New York times who have sex with men in exchange for scoops alley Watkins the award winning she hasn't lose sight blocker word coming but it's from the American adult video words are telling it said to different it's a different\nKind of a word you know what it's shaped like but we'll get to that later a Utah man charged for sending toxic letters to Trump comma other administration officials this is from day before yesterday this is from forty eight hours ago\nWhile the news media was going to wall to wall crazy bananas over what we now understand to be believed to be a number of inert bomb the white objects\nSent to a bunch of Democrats or with the return address on everyone going to Debbie Wasserman Schultz who is despised by Bernie Sanders supporters but let's not look at but close\n[noise] forty eight hours ago CNN was completely ignoring the story\nCompletely ... this is an on line by somebody nobody's ever heard of ... federal authorities secured an indictment Thursday oh this is fun I've got a Thursday even though the data's Wednesday against a man accused of sending maybe they can see the future over they're\nSending threatening letters to top officials they're not threatening letters\nIncluding a rice and lays\nThreats to president Donald Trump the Justice Department announced the indictment of seven counts against William Clyde Alan and said the indictments including the allegation that Alan knowingly threatened to use biological agent and toxin specifically rice and as a weapon\nAllen pleaded not guilty to all charges Thursday morning according to the statement from the Justice Department so they don't even know data's at CNN\nStatement said Allen was also charged with mailing a threat against the president of the United states and was facing five counts of mailing threats to officers and employees of the U.S government\nEnlisted officials threatened as defense secretary James Mattis chief of naval operations admiral John Richardson FBI Director Christopher Wray CIA director Gina Haspel air force secretary Heather Wilson\nNow all of these allegedly rice and filled envelopes were sent to these government officials\nSo recently that the purpose was just charge either yesterday or the day before depending on which part of the CNN story you want to believe [noise] and uh and this is a complete non story were these terrorist attacks was this an assault on our democracy was this an attempted decapitation of the government\nNo you know what it wasn't but it was a terrorist attack by a lunatic who threatened all of these people by sending what in the end turned out to be an ... white powder just as in the end this appears to be\nIn ... bomb like devices that are incapable of blowing up\nBut look at the reaction of the phony corrupt people at CNN and in the broader news media to the incident where there are in ... bombs scent of course was and they tell the prince of being targeted here why because a John Brennan\nHad one cent to him at CNN where he doesn't work\nThat's it that's the press is being targeted here and again we've had Republican members of Congress shot at and shot we have had Republican administration officials assaulted verbally assaulted accosted ah we've had them ... delivered unto them\nEnvelopes with what is supposed to be rice and that's a terrorist attack those are threats\nBut the news media just didn't cover that nobody nobody knows that this guy was charged two days ago\nAsking John Berman and Alison camera out at CNN if they know about the man being charged two days ago in this terrorist attack this assault on our democracy that this the attempted assassination is this is what CNN is calling the inert\nPackages that look like bombs with objects devices that looked like bombs contained therein which according to each and every account are not\nExploded ... not ... they they're incapable of exploding\nAnd still they're regarded\nAs a what assassination attempts assassination attempts it's it's a fraud that is the American media is\nTruly extraordinary and my alma mater has an absolute distress just a complete and utter disgrace others so Michael I haven't had any news today speaking of the Democratic party is highest echelons\nUm and also the news media is blaming President Trump for the the terrorist bombing attacks which they're they're not bombing attacks there turn out you know if you send something that's not rice and in the end it's not really a rising attack\nIf you're a firing blanks which James Hodgkinson was not it's not really an attempted assassination\nIf you know you're firing blanks and if you send bombs that are not really bombs\nIt's not a bombing attack it's an honor to object attack it's still a terror attack it's still terrorism it's still he's still a terrorist because these terrorizing\nBut the bombs were not they were not bombs that's very important to understand I think if you're going to be an adult and engage in a serious conversation on the great issues of our day\nOur news media as are not behaving as adults have and they're not engaging in a serious conversation on the great issues of our day\nThere for all the hate filled angry leftist sewer so filled with contempt for President Trump that they try to blame hurricanes on him they multiply what was the ... do a lot of Puerto Rico they multiply that by forty six times special to this one event [noise] no other hurricane will have the county\nIs it that way just that one so the hurricane couldn't be playing that count can be blamed on President Trump\nTruly astonishing hypocrisy ownership cockroaches CNN\nFraudulent current news media\nThis country to an extremely

on the on\nCapitol this he's done Chris plan show on six sixty W execute [noise]\nWe don't\nHave looked at the back of it but I Do now in my heart that President Trump there is a lot of responsibility for rhetoric that ... that top Democrats and the media what they targeted\nAmended almost said oh well then how do you explain the death threats against Brett Kavanaugh said how do you explain the vicious death threats to rape and dismembered Brett Kavanaugh's wife and Brett Kavanaugh's little girls to explain that was that Trump's rhetoric\nThe rice certain Senator Susan Collins house their dog had to be quarantined her husband had to be quarantined in addition to the dog not to put the dog first\nWe had death threats being leveled against every Republican member of the Senate Judiciary committee over the cabinet thing Kavanaugh's family Kevin O's friends threatened men is Susan Collins getting the rice and and blow up shortly after the rice and the envelopes were sent to the White House the Pentagon the CIA and\nElsewhere all the senior not all but many of the senior administration officials and the Trump White house and the Trump cabinet and of course is not ... who's rhetoric cause that I I guess that was Trump's rhetoric too because that's the way this works with these with these people these people\nAren't today amazing and that was ... she ah she doesn't have a brain\nWhich is not her fault she was born that way and her parents probably didn't have brains either I Know her her father was um an incredible incompetent to gave us the stomach considering the

six two five there are there are um gosh\n... also we have the GDP numbers out this morning which is kind of fun now it's not for point two percent as it was for the last quarter but the new GDP numbers US Economy grew at three point five percent pace and the third quarter\nFaster than expected gross domestic product expanded by a three point five percent annual rate economist Paul by Dow Jones expected the economy to expand by a three point four percent annual rate so at the projections\nBy one tenth of one percent but we're well beyond the three percent economic growth rate set the Democrats said we're unattainable and on achievable keeping in mind that rock Obama's eighth year as president we enjoyed at one point six percent economic growth rate the last quarter was of course for point two percent\nAnd that's pretty darn good to uh and uh the the left after if they take the house if the left is take the house\nAnd the midterm elections in a couple of weeks they will do everything they can to destroy the economy for the presidential election which will then be a scant two years away and they can't have a booming economy when Trump is running for reelection\nSo they will ah look to destroy tax cuts and undermine economic growth so that they can point to it and say see their numbers are so good this is this is what they do that's how they work\nSo that is a a big deal that means millions of jobs the difference between one point six percent economic growth and three point five percent economic growth represents trillions in to the economy\nAnd it represents millions of jobs in the United states of America the Democrats would seek to dash that because their political fortunes are at stake here\nIn New York Times has a gentleman types for the Democratic

happened and then there's nothing he could fall back on like they have they have paid off and said the only way thinking about how quickly elites won't have to live off that in\nAnd say that like ... when I my question is why\nWhy how interesting so if your parents were to pass away and they own a home free and clear and you're trying to come up with how are you going to have enough money to support your young brother\nYou are a real sweetheart to be more of trying to come up with the solutions for this good for you\nIn care so the idea of that time of your parents passing to turn the home into a rental property that I guess you would manage for the money a benefit to your brother\nWill I think that that may be unduly complicating a situation where would I Would think would make more sense is to sell the home\nAt the time the your parents might pass away and besides we don't know unless your parents or an extreme failing health they can be with us for decades to come right\nRight so\nSo that possibility of the home being a potential answer for your brother it's just too hard to say that right now\nSo I like the idea of better of your parents instructing in their will that if you are to be the executive tricks that the home be sold and the proceeds be put into a trust that you manage for the benefit of your brother okay\nAnd that way you have no idea what's going to be going on in your life all the years later hopefully your parents are going to live a long long time and who knows what circumstances will be at the time they would no longer occupy the house no longer be on this earth and so there\nThere's more flexibility [noise] if you then have money that you then have available to see that the care of your brother\nOkay ... yeah we we can think of my time in LA that that ... that guy down there and I guess I can at least I could have that as an option that we can get into she chaired by you know\nWhen you're a parent can do some things right now potentially for the advantage of your brother they can set up what's known as a um five twenty nine ABLE account\nAnd the only this is an account for children for dependence that have special needs of some kind of crime and so it's an account to your parents can contribute fourteen thousand dollars maximum to each year\nAnd the money can then turn around and grow tax free for your brother's benefit and then when the money is spent on his needs and care than the money is spent what's in it and all its earnings tax free\nAnd these are new accounts and if your parents have looked at this stuff before they may not even be aware that this is a new opportunity for people to put money aside for a child who has a you can be various types of special needs\nThat farm okay yeah we didn't know that that would that would make\nYou think your parents can't afford to put aside that kind of money for your brother each year\nNow I Know I don't think they can okay\nSo let's talk about one other possibility either your mother your father or either or both of them in good health\nYeah than I thought how\nSo another way that people find that needs for a child that they're worried about how when they're gone is to buy a life insurance policy where the proceeds better paid into a trust for the benefit of your brother\nAnd that is a relatively low cost way to take care of your brother's needs in the future\nAnd to keep it simple your parents would uh in the insurance policy that they would each by they would name you as the trustee\nAnd you would administer the trust because then it's a whole lot cheaper than if you hire a third party like a bank to handle this road for your brother\nAnd in fact\n... sounds like a plan in Keystone line\nAnd if you're a parent and certainly hard of any association for autistic children if they are in any support group there'll be people in their who've done this stuff that we're talking about and we'll be able to be of some help to them likely\nOkay fine yeah they have to get ... on that\nPoint but he got a lot going on in your own life but I'm so proud you know that yeah you own your own home at twenty four yeah\nIt's great that is wonderful how you're handling your finances Robert's with us on the Clark Howard show hello Robert\nClark thanks for taking my call\nSure you want to talk about life insurance\nI Do I Do I'm I'm sixty one years old Clark I've been paying on this policy sense so true which is roughly almost forty thousand dollars I'm at the air we have longevity in my family which ah if I go to Ninety One\nI'll have a total of about a hundred and twenty thousand dollars into a hundred and fifty thousand dollar life I'll see\nExcept that they are you not in a participating one where the actual cash value will rise overtime above the stated amount you\nKnow it will not rise or fall to state or a mile and no one really correct so you know hey over those decades\nA total and it would equal roughly Seventy five percent of the face of amount of the policy\nThat's correct [laughter] that sounds like a pretty lousy policy\nYeah it [laughter] yeah Labor Day and that's really what I meant it in our\nYou know we won't need those benefits we don't eat those benefits like this time with resources better you know more than a substantial paid for any time soon so my question was does it come to the point where I cashed out to just get term insurance level term\nOr just continue our\nI'm going to give you a process where you'll know exactly what to do with it exactly have enough money at stake you want to do what I'm about to tell you okay there's a nonprofit organization called the consumer federation of America\nHas a service that evaluates existing life insurance policies or they'll be able to tell you with the exact precision\nIf you should keep this policy dump it converted borrow against it cash it out what would be the right move for you\nAnd it's pretty involved what they do so it costs a hundred and twenty five dollars for them to do that evaluation but compared to the money you have a stake ...\nAgree I agree so I'm going to give you a a website you can go to that is a dedicated Web site to this from the consumer federation of America where you see exactly what documentation you've got to get together for them to run the full analysis for you\nVery good website is evaluate life insurance dot org okay and they're basically only charging you what their time cost is to do it because this is a non profit\nOn this sounded more\nYou'll know exactly what you should do is not even gray\nWith the scenario like you played out but for you and me you know this isn't what we do for a living so that's something we would not be able to properly assess can answer whether you keep it dump it or something else\nOr certainly a great courage than I Do appreciate it I really enjoy your show and I appreciate what you\nWill thank you very much and I hope you

in America\nPeople don't wear but as well as their parents did\nAnd then where people in America are living as well or better than their parents did and I tell you particularly the last decade when we had the banking scandals and the great recession immediately following when I Would give speeches I Would ask\nWho thinks their kids are going to have a better life and they had who thinks they're going to have a worse like well those were very pessimistic days but overwhelmingly people would say that their kids were going to have a worse life economical even they had and that is not how it's worked out overall in America\nKids continue generally better economic success and their parents have hair\nBut there's a clear divide and it was also clear geographically generally in the south east\nKids are not doing as well as their parents\nIn the mid west kids are doing much better economically than their parents which is interesting if you think about the years that the mid West was referred to as the rust belt and all that and lack of jobs and everything\nBut what was clear looking around the country and I just gave two examples there the dividing line was absolutely\nEducation voted in areas of the country where there's a big emphasis on education kids do significantly\nBetter than their parents had done economically\nIn areas the U.S and the southeast more than most anywhere else education is not valued as much and going to college not nearly as valued and college participation rates in a number of southern states or some of the lowest in the United\nStates kids\nDo not have the economic mobility or economic success or their parents\nCollege is not for everybody and it's not even necessarily about college but it's about going on to technical school said sport technical school trade school where you weren't skills that are in demand in the marketplace\nBut in an economy that now demands more and more knowledge and skill kids not\nGetting the education is what creates what's\nKnown by a condom is by the awkward in terrible phrase downward mobility I don't want that phrase they have to use I Want your kids have upward mobility that's what you want them to have and so I encourage you to encourage your kids wherever you live in the country\nTo understand the importance of education and\nTraining to get into a career and education and training\nThrew out there working lifetime so they have more economic mobility and more economic success\nDiane is with us on the Clark Howard show hello Diana how are you doing\nI'm well thank you

skeptical of minimum wage laws\nAnd they have enormous popularity with voters and whether state is a Republican oriented state or a democratic oriented state or where they call that purple a mixtape\nNo matter when there's a citizen vote citizens vote overwhelmingly of all political persuasion to raise the minimum wage\nAnd again I have never\nThought the minimum wage was good economic policy\nAnd I've always held to believe that if you raise the minimum wage too much that you create unemployment is employers to automate functions that people may have done at the lower end of the wage scale I even cited to you last year\nA study done at the University of Washington that put out a paper showing that and increasing the minimum wage in Seattle had been disastrous for employment and of course what's known as confirmation bias I saw that and I share that with you so today\nI eat\nOh because the researchers at University of Washington and a year later have said hoops we were wrong and in fact\nThe increase in minimum wage improve the lives of people who had been earning the minimum wage and did not decrease their unemployment\nSo\nThat was something that I was not prepared for first I Want to give the researchers props for being willing to revisit the research and acknowledge professionally\nThat they were wrong and that under further examination the minimum wage increase did not destroy employment\nAnd\nIn fact it did lead to net fat or pay checks for people because I always held to the theory\nThat you would reduced hours that people would be scheduled for work Andy would reduce the total amount of employment\nAt lower end jobs and on both scores it turns out I'm wrong at least according to this is deep dive research done at University of Washington normally when you have\nResearch that points to a different direction than prior research it's the methodology and it's people who have an agenda\nIn this case it's the same exact people coming up with a different result\nSo\nYou know one of the things in life is you have to be willing to have an open mind and recognize when what your beliefs have been and what they've been said at that those beliefs can be wrong on this one\nAnd Lisa looking at one of the largest metro areas in the country the Seattle metro area\nI'm wrong and we'll see over time\nIf in fact you do this place employment as wages move up and up you know we've had this big push around the country for which heard too is the living wage which is a Fifteen dollar an hour minimum wage\nAnd I\nI have been someone who has felt that if you want to improve people's earning power you get more skills you get the more training and you create a better position for them and the work marketplace\nBut it may be that it is about re allocating the pie in a way that I have never looked at and never respected as possible looking at the pie as being effect size\nI've never seen that perspective and now I say with all humility

talking about a walking billboard of I'm Crazy what am I told you about people with a bunch of bumper stickers on their car now I'm not saying that you got one bumper sticker too but you got your whole backside plastered with bumper stickers you're probably crazy for users\nHe lives with liberals with this guy obviously it was a big Trump guy that was doing the Trump responsible but Stephen Nelson is here from the Washington Examiner nails sort all of this out the even how are you ...\nThe guy a fairly was a Tarheel fan too because I think it was a Tarheel camp on his a dashboard so I guess all tar heels are now suspect uh what do you make of all this I mean they the left of course the moist thing no time to say well this is all Trump's full\nOh nobody was hashed hanging Bernie shooter when the guy shots the skill lease but the guy I work for the burning campaign so I mean what gives\nPractical that comparison has been coming up a lot today um but in this case it seems pretty clear that that the suspect was a supporter of President Trump um apparently is a political I'm\nLeading the heat necessarily Scott's a whole lot in the past I spoke to a former attorney or who represented him in that case and a a former\nEmployer who hired him to be male strip or in the past ... who said that they they don't recall them ever talking about politics or so you know we eat it's clear he\nYeah he ... you know we did there may be questions about is um\n[noise] a mental illness or it just looking at the car loan and adding of course the fact that he said these back just everyone but clearly we're going to be learning a lot more a political leanings him and his parents ah ah parents' support for President Trump going forward\nMan the question is doesn't matter because it didn't matter when we had a a guy who actually work going Bernie's campaign shooting Steve belief that didn't matter at all I didn't make a big deal about that either I said this is some crazy guy they're crazy people on the run in the left\nAnd I wasn't a hash tag and Bernie shooter a ... you know this is a ... bomber and all this stuff has been going on for the last few days and these people have in the field they can't wait while I was gonna say I can't wait to see a Rachel mad cow but I never watch Erdogan wants to work but\nIt seems to me a little bit unseemly to now trying to link Mr Donald Trump Donald Trump had nothing to do with this guy\nI mean that the distinction of course between Trump and Bernie Sanders is when you know what Bernie Sanders [laughter] you know even if even if he is incredibly denouncing people eat you know you don't really feel that I guess in motion and um he doesn't do it quite as um for schooling is President Trump\nI'm the president I mean of course the mailing bombs to people is it different than making light of the congressman body flipping the report they're very different things of course but um it that the people of course they're going to

one way or the other I there's probably a false bookcase this person is um it crazy\n[laughter] you know that I Believe true you\nKnow I talked to a ... eater I as I mentioned his former employer who hired him as a a a male stripper and the ideas and apparently this has been you know a profession of his throughout the years\nYou bounce from city to city doing these are very strict structures apparently more recently was working managing a female strip clubs and performing on the side of the male strip club in Miami\nA ... he's ... he's certainly a character a KIPP here and we had in ... a

and this whole\nVan bomb just stink of conspiracy but the thing that really bothers me the most my email but I didn't know if you look at it before the show under the day\nYou know the band just put it perfect almost like a bottle rap job as a as an outlet southern Florida which I spent a lot of time on there you are the some fading you would see some things that basically\nIn the case that ban has not looking like it just got that job put all that I'm thinking this whole thing is a scam they found the guy that had a medical problem that's been probably\n... before doing this kind of stuff and they're trying to figure out a way to\nWell just distract everybody with another problem to divert attention from what's going on which is what's coming up on the border\nYeah I I mean it does seem rather I mean it's like over the top guys are Trump guy is not like oh you may have voted for Trump or he may have gone to a Trump rally it's like this guy is just one thousand percent Trump Trump Trump Trump Trump it does seem a little odd doesn't\nIt seem unbelievable the almost laughable but\nAt the same time I don't want anybody to get hurt but there's enough information out there to say that this is all just a big ... to divert somebody's attention to you know make us look bad I'm a Republican or more specifically take the eyes off the prize which has those upwards of twenty thousand people coming toward the border as we speak\nSo you're in Missouri is that right I Am\nHow's the McCaskill race looking out there\nWell up they would only put a ... or you know a picture of her she's a little behind right now ... looking good but they're portraying her as a young ...\nA lady whereas she you know if you look at the local media craft I comment on a regular basis I think I'm about to get banned from the local uh television affiliates but\nThey're putting a picture of her from Thirty years ago ... trying to make her look like she is a young vibrant woman whereas in fact she's been in that way too long\nAnd everything they have to say about it is just completely lives than I Am totally for ... I think it's time for a change and I think he's the right guy\nWho wrote it remains to be seen or any weren't on how the voter turnout as you get up early voting out there\nYeah but you know it it hasn't been really I I think a\nChapter gather in the media but I Do know that there have been some early voting I'm certainly ready to go my wife my family everybody that eligible to vote where we got our\nEverything wind up and and I think we all know how we're voting I'm not normally a straight ticket guy but I think this year I'm going to have to including on proposition ... which is another gas attack\nTrying to you know just take more money out of her wallet there to improperly distributed to people here in Missouri that doesn't actually go to our roads and highways\nScreen and they would do that they will do you mean they're going to try to divert money that should be going somewhere to somewhere I\nCan't believe that you don't believe I never would have ever happen All right well preachy chicken and do things from a phone call that care you too it's\nI'm not saying I'm nervous because none of this makes me nervous because I got plenty to talk\nBut either way from a from a job search your people are all I bet you wish this or I bet you wish that I mean I've gone through how many administration at all I mean this is good for a minute I Will tell you this Trump has been radio build I Will not denied that Trump has been an absolute radio gold but\nHaving said that\nI'm worried about the country I'm not worried about my ... I'm not worried about stuff to talk about our find stuff to talk about no matter what happens and you can imagine\nIf we've got a Democratic Congress and a Republican president is going to be plenty to talk about so from a selfish standpoint and don't misunderstand me no van Gogh listening out there\nIf I were to say for ratings what would be best for me it would be best for the Democrats won and took over at least a house or the Senate and then we'd have fireworks all the time people all worked up getting all upset about what the Democrats\nBut I'm worried about the country so I Want to move the country forward\nYou know probably the worst thing for me can be absolute smooth sailing in Congress where we\nWhere we get um the legislation that makes sense and Donald Trump signs and then we move on on the next thing that could mean that that's got to be the most boring thing for me but I don't care I Love boring I Want to get the job done\nAnd I think that um that's what needs to happen we'll see what I had been predicting ear if the Republicans hang on and that's it is I think Nate Silver and you know he was wrong on Hillary so I don't know how much ... and she put a name silver\nMay silver I Believe is giving the Democrats in eighty five percent chance of winning the house and like a Nineteen percent chance of winning the Senate so he thinks that the Republicans are going to retain control of the Senate and the Democrats will take over the house\nI Would love to see the Republicans take over everything because what's gonna happen is it the Republicans they're replacing our rhinos Jeff Flake Bob Corker\nYou know a ... some of these others out there you're going to get true Republicans in some of these open seats if the Republicans win\nAnd that means that Trump's agenda is going to go forward and here's something else too I don't want somebody in these rubber stamping everything Trump does I won't conservatives if Trump's going to go off on something that's not conservative\nLike I've scolded him on this whole infrastructure thing we've got to rebuild the infrastructure there's nothing wrong with the infrastructure for one thing but the infrastructure doesn't need to be rebuilt from Washington\nState has their own gas tax they can do it and just like Doug was talking about Missouri\nYou know they want to raise taxes and they're not spending the money on what they're supposed to be spending among now this is in every state\nYou can look at your gas tax in your state\nAnd if the elected officials are honest they'll tell you that it's going to things other than the roads and bridges and that's the only thing your gas tax will be going to be it's going to light rail it's going to bite pans is going to green ways is going to museums is going to all sorts of happy horse dung\nThat has no business going to if they were to spend the gas tax on\nWhat they're supposed to be spending the gas tax on then there would be no problem it's every state is in charge of their own infrastructure there's a federal\nGas tax and there's a state gas tax\nAnd the federal gas tax us in the Washington and then it split up and then it sent back to the states and that's kind of a dumb thing to and I understand that you know some of these states\nWouldn't get what they think they need and I don't know I I'm a big believer that you do a gas tax in on the state level of the state keep their own gas tax and then they can do whatever you know they can build the roads and bridges\nBut as I as I ride around anything I say crumbling around here has has user error all over it\nAnd I'm not going to go into the details about four forty but they're finally fixing that but that was just a boondoggle of stupidity\nAnd trying to put ridges and the thing and toward the thing all the pieces by the way I was in North Carolina last weekend\nAnd they've got the concrete with some of the original thing at a hole in it so apparently who was doing it over here has no idea what they're doing so we have to spend millions upon millions to re surface that now and I'm sure you see all that in your state\nTo a lot of its way slumber misuse

seen the monk shot do you think it was like a woman yeah 'cause I thought at first because they flash it up there when they did the story first thing this morning and I said why oh gosh there's a woman and then they started talking about he\nAnd I'm going hey hey hey hey\nIt's a man so yeah it's it looks like a shame\nBut he's a ... it was in New York now lives in Florida and they've arrested the guy and then the social media that I'm looking at is not using the same last name which is a little bit odd don't you think I mean it looks like he would have the same last name cliff he's trying

a a good old boy Trump guy or somebody posing as a good old boy drum guy\nBut either way and doesn't make any difference\nNobody was hashed tagging Bernie shooter when that guy shot Steve's belief because nobody really believes that Bernie Sanders was the cause of this guy shooting Steve's beliefs and you can believe in your mind that Trump\nIs behind this guy sending the bombs well but he was in framed by his rhetoric and for what is Trump said that would that would leave some money to send bombs everybody\nWell he's he's always talking about the fake news and yeah well it is fake news but that doesn't mean that you send a bomb to the fake news folks\nAlways always tell my George Soros yeah we talked about George said look here's the deal and this is exactly what the left does they want
