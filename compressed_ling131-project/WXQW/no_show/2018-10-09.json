the law medicine ethics religion below above parents for their child and get\nIn the middle of it as a nine year old girl whose parents are fighting to keep a hospital in Fort Worth Texas from disconnecting her life support so there have been some developments in this legal battle\nAs a state district judge named melody Wilkinson who says she wants an attorney to represent nine year old ... ... in any negotiations between her parents can cook Children's Medical center so another hearing has been set for tomorrow\nOr the family had earlier obtained up temporary court order blocking a

and she has cancer and her tumor is grown to block her circulation and pressure her lungs in the heart doctor said cook children's in Fort Worth say she's beyond recovery\nPayments family obtained a

that's what we do there's more\nSaid the ... paid more days to live the hospital's been prohibited by the family Burr speaking publicly about Peyton his medical condition the hospital did release a statement do saying it realizes that families who bring their children to cook children's for treatment but their trust in them and then\nAnother hearing it separate Wednesday Michael\n... thanks Clayton novel in Dallas Fort Worth for first live it's a twenty two minutes before the hour now and you may be wondering how we got to this point how a hospital can decide what to do with the life of a child\nEven if the child is brain dead and they say there's no way this child is coming back the only thing keeping this body ally the is the fact that we're pumping the lungs up and down up and down and keep the I guess the heart beating the blood flowing well how does this happened while there's a law in Texas a\nIt's a it's kind of a unique law all around the country it was a put into effect in Nineteen Ninety nine that allows doctors in Texas to withdraw some forms of this life sustaining treatment even if the patient's family doesn't want them to as long as the physician has the backing of the hospitals ethics committee\nOr doctors in Texas are also protected from any civil or criminal liability meaning that if you're a grieving family member you can't take them to court\nAfter they've taken your loved one off a ventilator now there are states such as a ... for instance where doctors are explicitly forbidden from withdrawing life sustaining treatment without any agreement from the patient or the patients legal surrogates\nI think are just two other states California and Virginia offer abroad greenlight protection is like those in Texas so most states don't allow this but we have about California Virginia Texas I guess [laughter]\nUm which which uh you know has these complicated laws dealing with this unbelievably complex situation as I said there's a little girl at the center of this now we don't know\nIf the little girl is still in there get doctors say she's gone there's no brain activity girl the little girl little Payton is no longer there just the shell is left\nActually do all this quite a bit um my dad was buried in a trench gave more couldn't construct thirty one years ago they started his heart and they probably shouldn't because he was only there for about Thirteen minutes and uh they uh the\nTest today and many other head to dodge just showing up on a blog post shores brain and a five and a half days later he didn't have any not showing up and so they um basically Holly was kids for their ...\nWow a storage you have some amazing you know I think some of his mind go ahead\nFriend of mine his son was hit by a car and he was six or seven years old and I sat with him in the hospital or a good deal is going to\n[laughter] yeah well the thing I was about to say is you bring up a subject like this and you find out that it seems like everybody has had a brush with that everybody has had this experience and I guess that's because we are at the point in our medical science and technology have progressed to the point where\nNow decisions that used to be a little simpler are are no longer simple because it used to be that there's this girl was brain dead body would have died also but now we can keep the body going\nWhat's the relationship between the brain in the body for girls' brain is dead but girl is for all purposes gone\nBut the body is still there how how do you know if you're a parent who's cared for that body how do you let it go these decisions people didn't have to deal with before and we're not really equipped to deal with it yet again and it's only going to get more complicated as technology gets better and better and better we're going to have more and more situations like this at what point do ah does artificial life\nUh become something that we are not going to have to deal with what happens when we get to the point where you can\nUh somehow disassociate the brain from the body the body is dead but the brain is active then what do you do I mean it's\nIt's tough to get into the realm of science fiction but that's coming and we need to start thinking about this now are we need to do it it's law if sociology it's religion it's what we think about life it's it's what we think about kids and in our our our parents and anybody who's had an accident\nIt seems like at some point we're all going to be brushed by this anyway thanks for the call and I'm Sorry to hear

we've all aware that through the years of a situation where doctors gave somebody six months to live\nThat they're still alive today and that was said ten years ago so I I Know it's not quite the same but what the medical profession is up against Denise situation is human nature that she she faced with a mother it's human nature or not to let go\nShow you're going to everything that you possibly

give up their own life to save a life lived there\nMay be the strongest sing that runs through all of life and that is to you know keep your child your offspring alive that sort of we are meant to do and one of the problems here is that they are very few doctors who will accept the terminal patient when there are other doctors their colleagues have already said that\nIt's not appropriate to continue treatment few doctors will will take care of a patient or that way sort of blonde or professional courtesy or what\nOr just accepting the opinion of somebody else anyway thank you so much for

fooling yourself of course then I guess that they're well because he did he he murdered his ex wife that he had ...\nAny murder trail of blood and and the ... hand in glove and send the shoes and the and I don't know how much evidence that takes this is the last days I guess we should have learned over the oj verdict left a is a live in an evidence free environment and and\nAre just as was the case with the oj verdict and they said oh no no the cap set 'em up the cubs cap stood that OJ didn't do it somebody else said it we just don't know OJ went on a quest to those searching golf courses

that they believe that OJ is innocent and that Brett Kavanaugh as guilty [laughter]\nThat's pretty amazing that is truly amazing stuff but if you are if you're not interested\nIn evidence if you're not in evidence based life form as I Am as most normal people are then I guess you might be able to see your way to finding Brett Kavanaugh guilty or innocent [noise]\n[noise] [noise] yeah [noise]

wouldn't believe that at all that you're with me I wouldn't believe that at all okay\nSo the time share resale business is one that is not something you can trust\nAnd normally what happens in that business is they'll promise you that they're going to be able to find a buyer for you and all that or that they'll get you out of your obligation on the time share but you have to pay them up front how much to these people\nWant up front we haven't gone that far yet don't go in there that if you got as far as I Want you to not anywhere with them well\nWaiting for that on your show before you

get you out of the time shares so you've heard me on the show Jim that when you have a time share your stock is stuck could be right\nI Believe that's the case\nYeah and that has not changed in my overriding advice for you is when they finally get the place rebuilt that she just you'll have a brand new place to go to you just enjoy it\nThere isn't any way that you can think of which are thing being burned down there that we have an economy\nThat is a question go to the website time share users' group who can do that as a surge time share users' group and go look for your fellow owners on this time share that burned to the ground and see how other people are handling it\nAnd there may be in that there may be because of the special circumstances of the time share and not actually existing right now that people have figured out a way to eliminate their obligation to it\nAnd this is a case where the strength comes from communicating with others that own the same place you do\nWill definitely look into that\nAnd again the website is time share users' group it's where timeshare owners guide and help each other Scott's with us on the Clark Howard show Hi Scott how are you

five of 'em that are ignoring us and they're dealing with them with oil and everything else what do we do what these folks\nAre such an upside down world and thankfully this is all political theater and you have this this regime that is a brutal dictatorship a theocracy a repressive that people it's building missile that wants to build nuclear weapons\nAnd it remains as well just certified by the

money\nOr nothing to see here and unfortunately you're right we have some traditional allies in Europe that are sympathetic\nTo the Iranian regime sympathetic to the Iran deal that the Obama\nAdministration helped them cut a and really what we see is a continuing divide transatlantic a divide over a policy of appeasement or a policy of confrontation\nAnd with President Trump we have a policy of no longer than we are going to appease the enemies of freedom and sponsors of terrorism but unfortunately some traditional allies in Europe\nStill think the best way to a stop terrorism is

I in any way over the last year these three scholars and I guess they're scholars wrote twenty fate pay fake papers twenty of them using fashionable jargon visitors from the Atlantic\nTo argue for ridiculous conclusions and trying to get them placed in high profile journals in fields including gender studies queers studies in fact studies this success rate was remarkable by the time they took their experiment public seven of their articles\nHad been accepted for publication bias than simply serious peer reviewed journals sub but another twenty\nSeven more we're still going through various

and it was purposely being\nI guess making fun with all of these bees\nBuzz words they use in these journals so this is what these folks did they went in and they picked out buzz words that are used in gender studies and all the rest of this stuff and they put them in these papers and the twenty of them and seven us was Seventy six six or seven of them\nYeah they got a published it's unbelievable

we may be in the matrix you don't know you know you learn mosque is out there putting this stuff for the things that were in the matrix\nI'm Serious this guy I mean I think he's smart but at the same time he's nuts and sometimes there's a thin line I think he's cross that the thing that we're in the may well how do you know we're not well see this is again like global more can you prove we're not in the matrix\nNo that's not how it works you've come up with a hypothesis there were all in some computer\nGame from some being it's up\nTo you to prove what it's like the global warming thing we're destroying the earth with global warming can you prove it will know you got to\nDisapprove it that's not how did you notice they did the same thing with Kavanaugh\nThis has become the liberal ... were accusing you of attempted rape you got to disprove with no the onus is on you to prove it not me to disprove but you have come up with a hypothesis\nA theory but I have attacked a woman and tried to rape or it is incumbent upon you to prove it not for me to disapprove of it\nBut this is the way liberal logic works they come up with something and then there I guess mentally disturbed mind that they have convinced themselves that is true and they've also convince themselves is so true that you have to prove that it's not true\nAnd then they go out and not only do they\nProfess this new truth that they have come to the conclusion with no proof\nBut they scratch and applaud doors to the Supreme Court and they scream and they wear pink hats and they go nuts and they scream and galleries and they they just go across the country going crazy because they are so convinced of something\nAnd there is to me the essence of insanity\nWhen you have so convinced yourself\nThat you are so right there there is no other possible way to the point where you're hysterically screaming at people you know you're nuts well maybe you don't but we\nDo and maybe you're in the matrix and maybe we shouldn't let your child\nDoes the matrix I have a ... by the way does it have a rubber room because maybe we need we may middle lock these people in the matrix rubber room which you see what I'm saying\nThis to me is one of the hallmarks of insanity is if you are absolutely one\nThousand percent convinced that you're right but you have no proof of it\nBut you go out and declare this to all the nations and scream and holler and everything else with absolutely no proof and you don't need any prove all you need are your feelings because you feel like it's ... and it feels right it feels like this this is this is the basic foundation of liberalism in general\nIt's all about feelings and there is a place for feelings folks as I tell ya\nEmotions will bring you to a problem but they can never solved the problem it's logic and common sense that solves the problem you can be outraged feelings and emotions can bring you to we're going to do something about this but then you believe that emotion at the\nDoor if you actually want to solve that problem and that's where liberals don't get it\n[noise]\nSo chances are they'll never be an emergency ever ever again rely just in case let's

percolating like crazy the Mexico Canadian trade battle is won by Trump including South Korea\nNext fall will be the God does he does in Beijing communist red China\nThat takes about five hundred billion dollars a year so the last ten years they've taken out something like five trillion dollars to build their country and at the end of the day they need us a lot more than we need them so when Trump gets done with the Chinese is going to be the same thing that happened with Canada\nMexico and South Korea\nHarassment and it came out today that Trump's approval rating is sort of fifty one percent\nSo whether it's the economy immigration are federal judges I could not think of a better president than Donald John Trump he makes Reagan almost looked like a liberal because unlike Reagan and the bushes who were pinned cushions this guy fights back\nWhen Trump is hit ... Carter what he did on a Monday Night last night\nWith the Supreme Court saying that I hereby find you not guilty judge Kavanaugh you are an innocent man\nAnd he went after the Democrats with the other eight members of the Supreme Court sitting there and the Republicans to me it was beautiful it was wonderful this guy's got no backup ... stack up\nHe continues to teach all of us about winning in Trump's world it's about the fight and you're fighting spirit and your ability to be bare knuckle and think about this\nKavanaugh was a Yale middle aged judge who are educated and yell undergraduate and Moscow spend about twelve years on the second circuit court of appeals he's not the kind of guy defied like Trump\nBut when they push cabinet further and further and further Kavanaugh\nKind of look looked over Trump and said that's my model\nThat's the guy I Want to be they never imagined now there will be middle aged judge from Yale\nHad it in the fight back no holds barred street broiler fashion bigger but Kavanaugh studied Trump he learned from Trump so all of his brilliance and the eloquence all of his uh all of his grade school girls' basketball coach in your teaching at Harvard would not helping all to win this fight\nYou at people like Chris Wallace of Fox News who said after the testimony of the liar and she was a lawyer Christine for she lied about what happened at a maximum she was mistaken at a minimum we might go over that later\nBut Chris Wallace of Fox News said after she testified that it's over for the Republicans the Republicans had a bad day trial attorney I see it all the time a witness testifies and and you buy and hook line and sinker and then the other witness testifies and you say you know what\nI don't know what to believe now cabin all he ... he and his sense hypnotic laid took on Trump's personality any thought no holds barred bare knuckles and guess what Kevin Oh one by Trump rules he knows that if you want something air life bad enough you gotta fight for justice Trump proved\nAnd ah and he won the Supreme Court after\nChristine forward testified about the second front door and about afraid to fly and about the cost her phobia and how it changed your life and I thought okay that's on refuted evidence Kevin I'll get up and spoke and you know what I thought I cannot believe cabinet and then I waited for the next week to transpire and it did\nAnd the next week clearly demonstrated that Christine Ford was not telling the truth well as she lied or not it's a different matter\nBecause she said there were four witnesses and every one of our witnesses repeated a story or had no memory of the gathering question whatsoever the therapist notes were critical to death\nThat she released to the Washington Post but not to the U.S Senate committee she said for boys tried to rape her\nWhen she was in her late teens and the time was in the Nineteen eighties now she says it was one boy\nAnd it was a in at the age of Fifteen not or late teens and it was Nineteen eighty two not the Nineteen eighties she flipped on that because in the Nineteen eighties Brett Kavanaugh was not even in Maryland He was in Connecticut\nSo everything she said that the therapist was probably accurate because she said at six years ago before politics entered the fracas so when she said for boys tried to write for\nShe she was in our late teens what Eighteen or Nineteen years old and the Nineteen eighties sweat Nineteen eighty four eighty five eighty six\nThat didn't fit the scenario of Brett Kavanaugh\nSo she flipped and change what she was saying in order to try to take care of and all down and it didn't work and the second front door was put in twenty overweight and twenty nine\nBecause she wanted her psychologist slash therapist to have an office and a direct entry into her house into a room so the second front door with support and not because she was scared of only one exit but because a person she wanted to run out some of her house\nTo a small business owner a psychologist to have a direct entry way and of course the other thing was she was afraid to get on planes or boyfriend or many years testify they took single propeller planes all over Hawaii that she traveled to Haiti travel deal why travel to Central America to travel to South America travel to Israel and travel to Europe\nHow is the disease swim all these places hell no she flew everywhere including on single propeller planes which are quite claustrophobic if she was so nothing she said had any relationship to reality and over the week delight brought about by Jeff Flake\nWhose last name and by adjective describes his character refuted what she said and that's all right Susan Collins put up\nOn Saturday about three o'clock and gave that great speech I never thought I Would say this\nSusan Collins has a profile in courage as his Lindsey Graham Mitch McConnell\nBrett Kavanaugh and of course the president Donald John Trump those are the big winners and now today Brett Kavanaugh his first day on the U.S Supreme Court I'm sure he's going to do great but do not think for a moment in the fight is now over it's only just begun you fool we've got four more weeks to go\nI cannot imagine and America\nWhen Nancy Pelosi in charge of the house and Chuck Schumer in charge of the Senate and the

was the reason Rachel ... choice said those questions about coaching a friend protect going to lie detector test\nThe under oath to a sworn affidavit that boy from Christine afforded the Ninety nine

about little things\nThey lied about the big things and assuming she lied John what does that mean very Brett Kavanaugh's sanity and for a status does not mean he's innocent until proven guilty\nWithout a doubt I mean the only conclusion and one could come to\nFeel absolutely sad for the for the family and I feel a lot of fear that no kidding that kind of a tactic is actually a lot

didn't they didn't see what she said they saw and here still found guilty of that and bounce out of the marine corps where would you go to get back to your reputation\nRight [laughter] that would that would be it wouldn't come back you know uh but then again I wouldn't get their apart due process or prevented from such a thing\nYou know John [laughter] I'm a criminal defense attorney I've been in the attorney general's office when someone comes in and says I was sexually assaulted unlike many other crimes I tend to believe them if you come in to me and say you know what a\nSomeone stole my Chevrolet I'm not going to crush the new to say wanted someone zeal for no is this ever live so if you go in and say my left foot turning I'm not going to say well don't you mean you're right elbow no but when it comes to sexual assault\nTen to twenty percent of the time there are false allegations\nOf sexual assault that later on proves to be absolutely alive for example the Innocence Project has listed hundreds and hundreds of men who've been exonerated years later\nWho were wrongfully convicted of sexual assault Gregory counts in Van Dyke Perry to black guy spent thirty seven years in jail unfolds rape charges there was a host or university case for college she managed to haul observer chores raping an Eighteen year old fellow student\nCame out a year later she made it all up and it was a lie there's thousands of examples how a woman or man falsely accused of someone of a sexual assault for all kinds of reasons and all I'm saying is\nGive Brant Kammen all due process the right to cross examination the right to confront insecure users the right to me in the same room and look or in the eye which the Senate denied and now that we took ... new Jeff Flake oddly enough it was a good thing it took an extra week because conservative media\nTore apart the story or seen afford improve that she was either ... or or lie or or both\nCould prove that Brett Kavanaugh was in fact

no they're going to continue\nOn a tactical long ago this is what they do and that's the part that is absolutely mind boggling to me you know it's like it's just it just it just doesn't seem like
