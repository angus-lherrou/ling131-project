corresponding download brown tell this democratic congresswoman Maxine Waters got a second suspicious package this time said to her in California\nAnd so are some Republicans by the way\nA total of sixteen thousand six hundred and fifty eight family units these or nuclear families\nWere caught between the point of entry in September a new record and he's sharp spike from the previous months\nIn total one hundred sixty one thousand and I love and one hundred and Thirteen family units were apprehended this year\nRemember only one point four percent of the family units apprehended last year were deported so much to all of them remain in our communities along with the nearly half a million others who were never apprehended and this is growing every year so now we've got almost seven hundred thousand\n[noise] and it goes on\nThis is an incredibly serious matter of course national sovereignty the rule of law\nOr the nature of our immigration system it's being openly and brazen Lee violated and not just by aliens\nBy people in our own country like people in our own country\nWe spend a lot of time last night it's been picked up by a lot of news outlets a conservative news outlets since today as we have in the past on this issue pointing out the hypocrisy of the Democrats Hillary Clinton\nBill Clinton Brock Obama\nBernie Sanders Chuck Schumer and many others Harry Reid the positions that they took ten years ago Fifteen Years ago twenty five years ago the positions that they took on a legal immigration first of all they called them illegal immigrants\nAs recently as two thousand nine twenty ten Chuck Schumer called them illegal immigrants as a matter of fact he admonished his audience in two thousand nine he said look\nIf you don't use the word illegal\nThen you lose essentially the moral high ground what is this undocumented stuff he said now of course these reverse course because they're all about power in politics not about country\n[noise] so what's the point the point is the Democratic party is not even the Democrat Party of ten years ago it's certainly not the Democratic party of Twenty years ago\nHis position on immigration like its position on economics like its position in the military like its position on healthcare embraces increasingly radical\nPolicies in attitudes\nAnd it's not going to get any better it's going to get worse\nIf the media really want to understand the division in this country they need only look at themselves\nAnd look at the course of the Democratic party has taken you've a party where John Kennedy couldn't be nominated for the presidency today you have a party where Bill Clinton couldn't be nominated for the presidency today you have a party that would nominate Harry Truman for the presidency today and I could go down the list\n\nAnd so now you know individuals who won out radical each other\nHow many who is a centrist than the Democrat leadership boy so called ... can you name on his name on well I can name any I don't see 'em do you All right\nBy the way we have a wonderful guest at the bottom of the hour I told you each night now we'll have one or two candidates on here um there are many who are deserving of support and you know who they are but ah doesn't work that way on radio this can't be a condo learn to candidates\nLet's go to bill in Los Angeles California eight Seventy the answer K. R. L. A. go\nMr oh man thank you very much for taking my call I guess I just want to add in my my two cents here I'll be real quick about this caravan I'm a ...\nInvasions\nIt's a it is an invasion and and I don't know why I call it a caravan a it is an invasion and\nA lot I enjoyed yesterday next thing you know they'll call it a parade anyway go ahead as a\nLos Angeles is becoming Tijuana they've just made this new law or anybody could sell anything on\nA on the sidewalk and if you drive around on the weekend through Los Angeles it looks like Tijuana\nAnd isn't that nice pardon [laughter] so we're assimilating into Tijuana rather than the other way around\nYeah and I've had people at work saying well you should speak Spanish you should learn Spanish but I I\nI don't want to learn why should I [noise]\nYeah and I you know I come from a very democratic family I come from Scranton, Pennsylvania where my family were all minors\nAnd ah the Democratic party really look out for the working class they don't anymore if the Democrats have completely gone so far left that they don't care about the the working class in in\nIn America anymore and you know the biggest thing that bugs me I Want the wall but I think the biggest thing that could be done is it's both sides it's it's if if you rarely enforced verify\nAnd you want to these people and he said okay every illegal aliens you hire or going to find your ten thousand dollars a week and and I think Trump was behind it and if I'm not mistaken that was brought up during this whole dreamer thing\nWell give me another one why don't we enforce our visa rules forty five percent of the people here illegally comes to the front door and overstay their visas\nYeah exactly and it just really frustrating because I'm I'm a\nI'm I'm I'm a Republican in Los Angeles and I don't keep my mouth shut eye letter I'd let everybody know how I feel not not you know and and I usually do it and humorous way so I don't cause any type of problem\nBut I Can't wait to get out of California because the southwest in Texas in so many ... so many other states that from the seven days you're not going to be turning into a third\nWorld amazing people with them and maybe not in your case but people who've been in California their ancestors have been generations of or a family members in California they're the ones now immigrating to other states but people are coming here illegally from South of the border it's really incredible\nYeah it's it's it's very pathetic is just going to be and I I keep telling my friends in Twenty years

on the uh immigration fifty eight years ago JFK said that America has a limited capacity or taking an immigrant that's why we have a lawful immigration program [laughter]\nThe problem has been occurring for what I say fifty years sixty years we've had an immigration problem it was our problem back in Nineteen sixty at the problem today they\nAre the people that are responsible or the tenure in Congress people and the house and and the Senate okay that people have been there twenty five and Thirty years\nWhat's what can we do to solve it that people are all her more minutes\nWhile why don't you tell me what we can do is solve a term limit ... welcome you think Congress is going to pass term limits no they're not the the side and we got him power the piece I had a term limits and you ask me questioning you're talking over me so how do we get term limits\nThat we already have them the people the people that the term limits by going out and voting out you\nJust said to me we need to set term limits and now you're telling me that people set the term limits I thought you meant from a constitutional perspective we all know that people have the power to people in and out of office\nMore than we have ... thanks for your call I and I can't stand it when we kept one I Can't communicate with somebody and have a conversation\nIt's obvious we know we have the power to vote people out of office but when you get into states certain certain no one party states it becomes almost impossible doesn't it\nWe have a term limit for president in the United states the constitution was amended to provide for it no president ... more than ten years or two terms\nPeriod [noise] um we do not have term limits for members of Congress I think we need them desperately the only way to get that is who convention of States Congress isn't going to turn woman itself these guys like\nPower so needs to come from the bottom up\nIf you don't know a convention estate soon as you go to their website and read about a\nConvention of stage dot com couldn't be simpler I wrote an entire book on the process called the liberty amendments some people say what do you do I don't know what else to

before they are now on first lied good Thursday morning to you Michael Toscano here where they were in very happy to be in your company as always the phone lines are\nUp at you can still get in and give us a call at eight hundred seven three six three six six six and joined us as we try to figure out this morning where we are going from here law enforcement this morning is treating a series of bombs sent the top political figures as a domestic terror matter\nAnd they're devising republic to remain vigilant of course you know by now they're a device was sent to the homes of a President Obama and Hillary and Bill Clinton and former attorney general Eric Holder or California Democratic congresswoman Maxine Waters and democratic donor George Soros\nAnd the FBI is counterterrorism division is leading the investigation they're also looking into a possible package a similar drug dressed your former vice president Joe Biden is considered suspicious because of some similarities to the other pack and just put that one was missing dressed in return to whatever name was on the center so they're trying to figure that out now\nWe so we know what what has happened with these packages and some of them were apparently dangerous or the one sent to a Time Warner center which is CNN's headquarters in New York was what the NYPD Commissioner called a live explosive device\nA and could have possibly exploded when that package was removed from the building and sent to a facility in the Bronx where they were looking over those things so this is a dangerous situation where I'm going on out there dangerous not only to human life but dangerous to the life of our nation because somebody is clearly trying to do something here\nAh you know it's a this is the reason is considered terrorism and not political activity is is what were these things designed to do while they're designed to make us fearful\nAnd they're designed to disrupt something because if if somebody was really wanting to cause damage and kill people they could have been a little more sophisticated or in a way that they had gone about doing this in fact\nUh some of these packages were so um the reason that caught attention with some of them looked like they were trying to get your attention the way they were putting excessive postage and tape on the packages so it doesn't look like the kind of thing that an experienced bomb maker or really sophisticated a\nStaff of people trying to cause trouble might have done so it it looks a little suspicious of course uh\nUh some of the usual a conspiracy theorists out there are these people who try to prey on your mind and convinced the gullible that everybody's out there in the dark spinning these great conspiracies there they're already at it saying this is a\nFalse flag operation which as a turn that they try to use the show the very end with all the spies and everything and that they know this stuff so they always use that false flag expression and their core saying that well as the Democrats doing this to make the Republicans look bad and uh you know they really know the CNN made the packages themselves and their studio I mean\nYou know it's really unfortunate that people try to do this kind of thing for their own game so when you hear people talking about that this morning you know that they don't have your interests at heart they have their own writings that hard or their own uh\nLikes on Facebook whatever it is because you know this is probably going to be probably going to be not to or something who um that's coming from either the right or the left a Democrat or Republican it's coming from some troubled person who has taken it upon himself most likely possibly herself but it's usually a man\nAnd these people are usually loners and they attach themselves to an issue like this and they do something stupid like the guy who shot Congressman Steve ... and and the officers at that Republican a baseball game a couple of years ago of course the conspiracy theorists\nKept calling it a democratic attacked because on social media this guy said he like Bernie Sanders he was just a nut case Timothy McVeigh or some people were calling it a right wing attack because he was a right wing or when he blew up the federal building in Kansas City twenty something years ago it wasn't a Republican attack it wasn't a democratic attack\nIf idiotic stupid sick people who are trying to get attention just like\nOthers now I'll walk into schools and shoot up little kids they're sick people and that's probably what this will turn out to be I Would be very very surprised if this turns out to be any kind of an actual political action but you know it does in fact our politics and there's a lot of finger pointing going on from both sides already\nCan be find a way to show all that and actually just deal with the situation and then deal with our increasingly vitriolic rhetoric on both sides wouldn't that be a good idea\nYear

you called overeat eight eight eight seven nine five to seven zero seven or information\nEighty three sixty W execute\nOutlook [noise] twenty four\nMinutes before they are now on first live good Thursday morning to you Michael Toscano here where they were very happy to be in your company as always\nPhone lines are lighting up at you can still get in and give us a call at eight hundred seven three six three six six six and joined us as we try to figure out this morning where we are going from here law enforcement this morning is treating a series of bombs sent the top political figures as a domestic terror matter\nAnd they're devising the public to remain vigilant of course you know by now there were device was sent to the homes of a President Obama and Hillary and Bill Clinton and former attorney general Eric Holder or California Democratic congresswoman Maxine Waters and democratic donor George Soros\nAnd the FBI is counterterrorism division is leading the investigation they're also looking into a possible package of similar ... dressed your former vice president Joe Biden is considered suspicious because of some similarities to the other pack and just put that one was missing dressed in return to whatever name was on the center so they're trying to figure that out\nNow we we so we know what what has happened with these packages and some of them were apparently dangerous or the one sent to a Time Warner center which is CNN's headquarters in New York was what the NYPD Commissioner called a live explosive device\nOr and or could have possibly exploded when that package was removed from the building and sent to a facility in the Bronx where they were looking over those things so this is a dangerous situation where I'm going on out there dangerous not only to human life\nDangerous to the life of our nation because somebody is clearly trying to do something here [laughter]\nUh you know it's a this is the reason this is considered terrorism and not political activity is is what were the things designed to do while they're designed to make us fearful\nAnd they're designed to disrupt something because if if somebody was really wanting to cause damage and kill people they could have been a little more sophisticated or in a way that they had gone about doing this in fact\nUh some of these packages were sold 'em but the reason they caught attention with some of them looked like they were trying to get your attention the way they were putting excessive postage and tape on the packages so it doesn't look like the kind of thing that inexperienced bomb maker or really sophisticated a\nStaff of people trying to cause trouble might have done so it it looks a little suspicious of course uh\nUh some of the usual a conspiracy theorists out there are these people who try to prey on your mind and convinced the gullible that everybody's out there in the dark good spinning these great conspiracies there they're already added saying this is a\nFalse flag operation which are the turn that they try to use to show the ... in with all the spies and everything and that they know this stuff so they always use that false flag expression and there are of course saying that well as the Democrats doing this to make the Republicans look bad and ah you know they really the the CNN made the package themselves and their studio I mean\nYou know it's really unfortunate that people try to do this kind of thing for their own game so when you hear people talking about that this morning you know that they don't have your interests at heart they have their own ratings at heart or their own\nLights on Facebook whatever it is because you know what this is probably going to be probably going to be not to or something who um that's coming from either the right or the left a Democrat or Republican it's coming from some troubled person who has taken it upon himself most likely possibly herself but it's usually a man\nAnd these people are usually loners and they attach themselves to an issue like this and they do something stupid like the guy who shot Congressman Steve so lease and and the officers at that Republican a baseball game a couple of years ago of course the conspiracy theorists is you know\nKept calling it a democratic attack because on social media this guy said he like Bernie Sanders he was just a nut case Timothy McVeigh\nOr some people were calling it a right wing attack because he was a right wing or when he blew up the federal building in Kansas City twenty something years ago it wasn't a Republican attack it wasn't a democratic attack\nIf idiotic stupid sick people who are trying to get attention just like others now I'll walk into schools and shoot up little kids\nThey're sick people and that's probably what this will turn out to be I Would be very very surprised if this turns out to be any kind of an actual political action but you know it does in fact our politics and there's a lot of finger pointing going on from both sides already\nMy heart okay thank you so much let's go to Greg in Sioux Falls and Greg before I get your comments I just want to mention the last time we talk you mentioned the red Skelton and his version of the pledge of allegiance to the flag I did find that on the Internet and pulled aside so one of these mornings when we get a couple of minutes I Do\nWant to play that for our audience as you suggested but back to our thoughts this morning at nine before the hour on for like\nA really I don't know if we're going to be able to rein in or not\nAnd what it is is um you got you know the press and the distinction between being an actual journalist and commentator I think that line has been grade so much\nThat nobody can distinguish two different say anymore and it just um you know you look at the Donald ... Anderson Cooper's and [noise] you know a Rachel Maddow ... and stuff like that and they have kept this up and kept up with no factual basis for anything whatsoever\nAnd we want to talk about Sean Hannity and Rush Limbaugh this morning both just great and saying I mean\nIt's just point counterpoint type deal and there actually was a show on TV called point counterpoint I Believe and that was actually several um but the rhetoric has to be rainy and and the one thing that really disturbs me is where the hell is our attorney general\n... and that's interesting well you know the FBI is the lead agency investigating this because of his domestic terror but their image has been so ... this past year and deliberately so that\nAre we going to believe there is going to be there'll be a lot of people are sort of the country won't believe anything the FBI tells them if they say this guy was not connected to the Democrats are the Republicans are a lot of people who aren't going to believe it because\nTheir reputation has been trashed and we know where that has come from so I think the attorney general I I don't know maybe he needs to die I don't know maybe he's just been quiet because it's not part of his you know the daily routine as the FBI and you leave him alone to do their job and it's only been a\nYou know less than twenty four hours so maybe he will ah maybe he'll hold a news conference to talk about\nAdam and heard his name anywhere for what for months\nNow and he's been he has been kinda quiet lately anyway appreciate the call as always thank you so much Steve in Charleston good morning Buddha\nMorning Michael a boy you said a mouthful a new leader and about the blame to go around you know rhetoric from both sides\nAbsolutely a very\nQuick to let me ask you something to do that you know any of the Washington Journal host when you were over there\nAt ... any of those guys yes very well Steve All right so you're right that will be the\nTopic is more of course but but let me say this folks please understand it this is a a word rhetoric is simple definition is campaigns slash a political BS\nAnd areas plenty of blame to go around again how many times do you have to say at these people do not hate each other there are not going to miss the opportunity to act like they hate each other in front of a camera that case in point right now of course uh the President Bush\nDrop was particularly insulting to cruise and right now there are a buddy up you know is just the way politics is I don't know how you go forward I don't know how we escape it then you got Hillary saying don't be civil you got to hold her saying kick them and you know you were saying don't make it so and I'm not saying this was what happened\nBut there was a big guy says okay you will say lack of civility I'll show you lack of civility and her comes to bomb so let me to sleep but what does this is a very quick definition of surreal definition not mind of rhetoric\nLanguage the from the Internet language designed to have a persuasive or impressive effect illness audience but often regarded as lacking in sincerity Romania ... got to get past it and I don't know how you move forward Marco I really don't\nYeah well it's it's hard I mean if you were watching cable TV last night you would see one version of the world on Fox and another one on MSNBC and a third one on CNN and they've all got\nTo stop that they all have thought that they are killing us\nI Know I agree with you totally but I just don't know how you're stopping\nYeah well I'd have to say when there's\nMoney to be made it's hard to stop it anyways thanks so much for the call good morning Rick in Seattle Bush got about a minute left Rick anything to say hello Rick may have stepped out for coffee or something so let's move on to the dentist\nSpringfield, Missouri good morning did you hear from both sides are caused this but did you do not pregnant at the bottom line when he was saying if they bring a nice job do you remember that if you want to tell you if you you said well Mr Obama you know somebody else\nYeah I think there was something more to that but there but I Can't remember something about an hour to write about what\nDo you have Hillary telling people to be a shovel so people are being on shoulder yeah\nWell it is that this was this is the problem because it's the human reaction when somebody does something to you you said do you want to do it back to the problem is some point somebody has to go first and stop it so you know like but I looked for that or some sort of debris or\nGo to guy to baseball\nPractice [noise] well see that's the problem right there that kind of rhetoric sorry to hear that from you this morning Dennis anyway thanks for the calls we are out

violence in our politics from the rioting\nIn Baltimore and for just send me\nThe phone a a hands up don't shoot stuff the anti police campaign that has led to a series of terrorist attacks against police officers including multiple suicide attacks by Democrats against police officers now you said if you're a Democrat you're just turn the channel a moment ago you thought it was going to be NPR\nSOS not true\nNo no that is true that is true there have been a series\nOf suicide attacks by Democrats against the police\nSince ... Obama launched his anti police crusade which started with\nSkip Gates his friend the college professor at Harvard\nWho was arrested by a who was a sergeant Crowley was that currently\nAnd they had the beer summit and all of that that the White House and then we had a ... mile Britain's leave from Maryland go up to New York and murder officers Ramos and lo and he went to a nearby subway stop and committed suicide after murdering those two police officer\nTo police officers in their cars by the way what do we have now the number of police officers that have been murdered this year is off the charts because in many instances they're being targeted and murdered\nJust for being police officers and that's not happening for no reason at all that's happening because of all of the anti police rhetoric of the Democratic party\nAnd the news media do documentaries on how terrible the police are and then place are targeted and murdered many of which are murdered by suicide attackers five police officers murdered in Dallas that black lives matter rally that plays had to send a robot in with a bomb in a parking garage to kill that guy was suicide by police\nAnd I'm Baton Rouge three police officers murdered in a suicide attacks suicide by police\nAnd this has become normal now the news media doesn't look at it that way because pay lie all the time and they're really just spokes models for the Democratic party but that's a reality the the attacks on the likes of bending Shapiro and David Horowitz who they called Nazis ... Jewish\nAnd a and a band wears a yarmulke every day and I call them and not say\nWell these black clad hood wearing ... club the face covering club but wielding torch throwing leftists bashed their

of police officers holster when he got close enough to candidate Trump and he was going to shoot him dead now now now you ask the average liberal about this and they're not aware of this and then of course there's James Hodgkinson\nJames Hodgkinson was a big MSNBC watcher of big Rachel Maddow fan a big left wing Democrat\nSupporter a a a volunteer for Bernie Sanders who volunteered for Bernie on the campaign he met with Bernice people in his office\nIn in Washington DC sat down with him power out big lefty and apparently that that to the left wing rhetoric and Rachel Maddow and the Democrats and getting their faces from Barack Obama\nDidn't have any effect on it but one day James Hodgkinson ton himself on a baseball field in Alexandria, Virginia doing this [noise]\nTrying to kill every Republican that he could find\nThat was a suicide attacks by the way the police officers there after sadly surfing woven voice officers there shot him to death and all the news media wanted you to know\nOf the police officers was a black lesbian powers the most important part of the story to them as though that matters to the situation but for the fight fake set the news media at MSN at CNN [noise] that was apparently the most important elements of the of the conversation\nAnd in the context of all of this the Democrats and the news media but I repeat myself do what they always do and they start history over again might be Charlottesville incident where a Nineteen year old with mental issues crashed his car into a crowd full of people and murdered a woman and\nIn a horrible horrible event\nAnd the news media pretended that all those white guys with ball club is over their faces and clubs that they were wielding had nothing to do with it they were left wing mob that was in the middle of that scrum and the news media just air brush that out for them they dropped the James Hodgkinson story especially at MSNBC\nLike it was a flaming hot rock and they wanted nothing to do with it\nPolitical violence and I've been talking about it for quite some time UC Berkeley where we have the the rioting and they're smashing or get started with the Occupy movement where they perpetrated\nMillions of dollars in property damage to public and private property where scores of police officers were injured where the sexual assaults were so pervasive that they had to set up sexual assault tense and operations at all their major things they said why shouldn't they see one of the occupied people took a rifle and went to the back of the White House and shut up the back of the White House\n... bono was president\nHe wasn't home but his family was ... and and none of this really makes the great but when when there as a sudden the supposed righty that commits violence at which was apparently the case in Charlottesville\nThen that's a huge story on that as an blades and on the consciousness of the American public by repetition it becomes a matter of road it's something that you hear about on a daily basis it becomes ingrained in the conversation\nAnd uh and and when it comes to James Hodgkinson you could ask Joe Scarborough and make or present ski who is James Hodgkinson and they look and dumber than usual if that's possible\nA ... and I I marvel at a at the way the news media search history all over again oh no now there's this political terrorism and it's the right it's the right it's the right\nAnd it may very well be some lunatic on the right the mail these apparently in ... devices to now we have nine I Believe nine devices [noise] uh and it is a terror campaign anyway uh so I said to be sure however it did not begin with this\nAnd we have the media once again leaping\nThe Olympic conclusion leaping contests and and they have\nDecided they know what it's all about and it's guess whose fault it is it's President Trump's fault because his rhetoric has out alive forget about Brock Obama getting their faces Brock Obama's anti police rhetoric\nForget about Hillary there will be no civility forget about Eric Holder when they go low we kick them forget about Maxine Waters whenever you see them in public you should harass and\nForget about all of the actual harassment that's taken place this bidding on senators they they ah harassing them threatening people to families that burns dismembered animal Kirk is on the front porch\nForget about all of that because history starts yesterday\nRight that's the news media\nPanda I have in front of me a number of articles on the topic as you might imagine and are there is some reason to believe that this\nWas something other than what what'd you call it a legitimate terrorist attack designed designed to kill an injured people because if what you're sending out really doesn't have the ability to explode that changes the nature of the attack\nNow in the morning meeting we were discussing this just before the show is that are writing is a lefty\nOr is it the Russians

were planning on moving but not right away tell me about that\nFor it so I purchase a house or two years ago late twenties Fifteen looking to move in about two years from this coming January front and see what my best options might be ... selling core blanking out or what I can do [noise]\nYou are a serious advance planner [noise] so you're asking me about an event likely to happen in your life two years from now how do you know that that's the window when you're going to move for you in the military or something\nOh I was in the military and I'm currently a police officer so telling are looking to move from Texas up to Tennessee\nOkay so that you say you have a clear path and and I want to tell you I appreciate your double service to our country I mean you already put your life in danger for us as a soldier now you're putting your life in danger as a police officer and I'm grateful to you for that\nThank you\nUm so you bought a house at a time you got a exceptionally low interest rate on the house I'm assuming\nCorrect there was a three point five percent\nAlright and rates have moved up roughly two point since then\nAnd so what do you planning to move in two years I don't have a specific\nA strategy for you that you should sell now rent a home for a while then look for a home when you get to Tennessee because who knows what's going to happen with economic conditions and prices a couple of years from now the house market has slowed down\nAnd people are not able to sell houses in most markets with the ease they were before so what would you do today different than just no you're planning to move in a couple of years and you're going to have the benefit of that low\nInterest rate for at least the next couple of years\nBut you know pretty much I'm looking to utilize the a loan and cleaning up the policy and similar there after\nSome of the biggest issue with three ten in the house and renting it out for the most\nCompanies require two years of rental income or else it counts against me as far as that outcome she'll right um so that's kind of where I Am if I Want to just take some laws that they might be worth it emotionally to suggest that mortgage the tea I out of there\nAgain that is a fascinating scenario you're painting to me and one that that no one has ever opposed to me like you did because you're talking about um your family having to uproot twice\nAnd a couple of years but if you wanted more certainty that is what you can do you could keep this property\nYou move somewhere else as a renter you lock in that ultra low interest rate you have at three in a corner my only real concern with bad scenario\nIs that you then are in a position where you're going to be living in Tennessee with a rental property in Texas and that is very difficult to manage from so many miles away\nBy area do you have any experience with dealing with better the rental property agencies or whatever they might be called a ...\nWith what was that expression use I'm Sorry\nA is a property management\nOh yeah a property manager I use a property manager to manage a rental property for me that I have three hundred miles away that I just could not adequately properly manager and so it depends on local conditions but in my case I pay half\nOf the first month's rent is commission and then after that I pay a much lower commission re moving forward so I tend to attract long term tenants\nAnd so I've got a big hit up front and then small where after that the disadvantage to me is that anytime something breaks when I'm build for it for repair maintenance something like that just seems like it's not the most generous bill ever\nSummit don't tend to be fairly high because I mean they are providing a service to me overseeing the property and managing it so you have a significant rake off in your net revenue for cause of the commission's you're having to pay and the ongoing expenses you pay\nSo I I don't know even with that very attractive mortgage rate\nI don't know that you fit the scenario somebody who would keep that\nProperty as a rental going forward\nAnd so in that case I Would say why don't you keep it simple for you and your family lived there until it looks like you're ready to move to Tennessee and then put it on the market at that time you don't have the benefit of maybe a couple more years of your mortgage based on that three in a corner\nAnd then at that time you sell it and you move on there are no perfect crystal ball but that's what I Would do\nJudy joins us on the Clark Howard show hello Judy\nClarke how

uh rocks or accidents I have that are my fall\nWhile I silly tolerant but at what at what cost\nYou you just wait it out better than I ever could you know this is a gimmick with the non cancel auto insurance policies because unless it also includes a cap on how much your premiums can rise overtime\nUh-huh then I don't see any great virtue and somebody saying\nNo matter what you can be no wars driver and the world\nWe're still gonna ensure you but if it doesn't say at what cost\nThat promise means nothing [noise]\nOkay [noise] you know I've been talking to some other companies and I'm thinking gosh do I want to lose that fantasy but I'm just a shelf life how long\nHow long have you been with this ensure\nOh gosh forty years\nRight so let me tell you something about your insurer they are one of the ones that uses what's known as loyalty index scoring\nWhich is fine you would definitely be high on the loyalty index score having been with them more than forty years\nPaid a charge you higher rates because you've shown yourself to be so extremely loyal and they know that a certain percent of their customers tend not to comparison shop tend to just remain intensely oil and so you're rewarding for that is higher rates\nUh-huh so you're finding a significant difference and they quote you and what others are quoting you that's why they're charging you above general market rates what kind of difference to be found so far oh\nNot a not a huge amount a um my car is an old car and not so I carry a lot of the coverage on it you know like out of every six months probably a couple of hundred dollars\nWell you know a couple of hundred is less than I Would expect you to tell me is the difference\nAnd uh make sure the coverage is you're getting quoted are the same and they

what you may [noise]\nThere is a shift going on in the vehicle market and I want to make sure you're attuned to several factors coming together hall what ...\nMean that if you are interested in a vehicle [noise] your timing right now is very capable [noise] so let me hit you with the factors affecting the marketplace\nOne we've got\nA situation where we've had record or near record vehicle sales for the last half dozen years\nWe've reached a point where we're way past people who needed new wheels and we've covered a lot of people who wanted new wheels and so now the dealers the manufacturers are running out of the people need and want\nSo we're playing much harder to get\nBecause the replacement market for old worn out vehicles is not that large right now and the number of people who have vehicles that are older not as many because so many people have gotten newer vehicles are white\nAnd then you add in higher interest rates interest rates on car loans have gone up quite a bit\nAs interest rates in the general economy arisen car loans reflect the increases immediately\nSo now people are looking at higher monthly payments the third factor is something I shared with you about six weeks ago and that is that after years of an under ...\nFly of SUVs and crossover utility vehicles a lot of things we call as TVs are actually see UV is just you know what the difference is\nA true SUV is built on a truck platform\nVery few in the United states are built on a truck platform almost all of them are built on a car platform just where the body put on top of them that looks like it's a little higher like you think of as an SUB\nSo manufacturers were caught flat footed\nSeveral years ago when people shifted from wanting passenger cars to warning these crossovers so there was a continual shortage\nBelow what demand was now a vehicle makers of caught up the auto makers are making plenty of those SEVs and crossovers so now we got supply and demand imbalance at a time that the markets soften dealers all over the country reporting\nA more or fewer and fewer people coming into showrooms fewer and fewer deals closing and depending on where you are in the country a lot are noticing a double digit declines in sales\nSo this is a great opportunity for you\nIf you were actually someone who's in a market for a vehicle it means that you're in a position to have far more negotiating power\nEspecially if you're interested in their crossover or an SUV you're much more negotiating power then you've had in recent years so yeah you will face potentially higher interest rates but you can dial back the clock if you historically have gotten your vehicle alone at the car dealer\nAnd instead this time you get it at a credit union he will likely drive the interest straight back to below what it would have been in a car dealer before interest rates rose cause the interest rate differences so gigantic between a credit union and a car dealer and significant between a credit union and\nA bank the other thing is as you are\nShopping around for a vehicle I Want you to use the bottom line methods to shop for a vehicle if you're a

only saw it broadcast the last few months but the reason that the host all around and I noticed your name I recognize that it was living in a New Orleans right now grew up watching the TV but there's all the time\nIt's all a Christmas recommendations for us for a while you're ... recommendations for much stuff so that was a leap on that I got the idea\nThat it's great to have you I Hope you enjoy our podcasts\nThat has been great so far up and learn a lot for sure\nSo just got married\nYes yeah so we got married um and we're in the process of combining all of our finances all that kinda stuff and so I was just got older and\nUm we're both on the same financial standing uh she's got a little bit of a school that I've got a little bit of credit card that we both like by Simon Lonnie I'm so as far as combining financial skill as water or you know there's a lot of best practices stuff like that because I was trying to read on the line and there's all sorts of information all over the place\nOne of the factors I look at is how well both of you are\nOkay we're both in our mid thirties\nSo at that point when you get married after you flipped independently for a long time don't rush combining everything\nOkay because you've aged develop your own habits no matter how much it feels like you're on the same way when you're not going to be exactly on the same wavelength having been in a position where each have you had made all the decisions with everything involved with money\nAnd it can cause tension especially uh in the first couple of years of marriage if you just all of a sudden combine everything\nSo joke it's different for people get married in their early twenties which not as many people do any more but getting married in your mid thirties which is more common now\nI like for you to have his money her money their money\nAnd by that I mean are having a joint household account\nThat both of you share and you have money that you each contribute to that\nEach month for rent slash mortgage other household expenses that you figure out and then you still have some money this years in an account and she has money that's hers and account okay and then on credit cards\nI don't want you to combine those for a few years\nAll right so credit cards for a few years yeah that was actually going to be my next question because as far as you know combining joined a child that's a checking account I Know you don't like debit cards uh so I was reading you know there's a thing like with credit cards especially for a joint groceries things like that yeah I can make her like\nA cow holder or under my credit card or a joint credit card something like that is there anything as far as that goes with the credit cards\nSo for spending that you're going to do that fits under the house account category like groceries you're gonna both eat 'em your cell phone bills if you combine a cell phone plan any of this stuff you're doing is a combined activity\nIt's great for you to have like a house account credit card that you pay in full each month it has some kind of rewards attached to it\nThat is your first joint credit account but for things like when she's going to buy closer you are or she's going to get her hair done or whatever because you're each approaching it from years of making individual decisions those things are best at least for now left\nAs individual charges on eat on individual cards rather than on one that's joint\nOkay and so we can do like a joint credit card to realize that was gonna say\nYeah you can be co owners of a cart\nOr she can add to you for a house account she can and he was an authorized user you can add to her as unauthorized use or one of yours for the things that fit under house expenditures the concept is that you know over time you'll find how best here spending merges as your wife\nOr goes on together but doing it all at once can cause tension that you didn't even know could be there and\nThat's why the merging of finance there should be gradual instead of a media and congratulations to both of you you're listening to the Clark Howard show\n[noise]\n\n\n\nFor many Americans owning your own business

I. like tighten up when I'm answering the question 'cause I'm hoping there's no reason all ever green light them borrowing from the four one K. because they if they are the consequences so the situation has to be completely desperate\nBefore I always say do this and why why am I talking about this again\nI got a ...\nWell from a friend of my wife who was asking specifically about\nTaking money out of a four one K.\nTo pay off credit card debt which is probably the most common reason people do it\nAnd I was able to explain to a point that she was comfortable that she shouldn't do the money withdraw from the four oh one K. to pay off the credit card debt\nAnd you know the most important reason not to do that if you use money from a four O. one K. to pay off credit card debt in most situations people will end up having the credit cards charge backup\nWithin a year and a half but when that withdrawal is taking place so\nPlease I Know it's easy to do the Ball Four one K. borrowing but don't do it unless the situation is dire\nAmy is with us on the Clark Howard show hello Amy\nHi how are you\nGreat thank you you want to talk about hitting the bulls eye on the retirement target\n... looking at me proper used or misused retirement and I and I mean how strongly for that you have an angry and trick phone here and ethnic retirement plan to retire at home or yeah yeah\nWell I wouldn't say a hundred percent or not and but the idea\nIs that if you say you're building a portfolio and a four one K. or you're building one and a Roth IRA or traditional i._r._a. the idea is that if you are for people aren't aware of what we're talking about a target retirement fund his where you pick a year\nKind of in the ballpark of when you expect to retire and they tend to be and five year increments like year twenty thirty twenty forty five whatever every five years\nThat you're messing up the whole purpose of the target retirement fund if you put money into it and then still put money into other things in your retirement plan a retirement account\n[noise]\nIt's not like it's something you shouldn't do is just suggested that if the whole idea is to try to get the right mix of stuff that you were invested in that it really is only effective if you go all in on the target retirement fund\nWhere are you in your head with this and how does that affect you\nWell I have that choice I'm In my legs but I have also kicked off for like ... and I just had the bad part of it [noise] on hearing that or a return\nThat I Would expect who they are they on average about paper lash out if I work at all and that target retirement I\nYou know I I Can't speak to whether you would have an overall lower return over the years by diversifying out from it the idea that target retirement fund is really for a different purpose is to put you in a position where you have the proper level of risk\nAt different stages of your work life and then as you get closer to retirement\nSo there's nothing that says the you taking some of your money and your four one K. and putting it in other choices there's going to get you a lower return it's even possible that could get you a higher returns but it also might involve over the years potentially more risk to you\nIn law says you could suffer at various points of your work life\nShore okay if anybody says oh putting forty percent and the target retirement fund and putting the other sixty percent and other things is going to get you a lower return that's not an accurate statement\nOK information okay have a great day and can't entail\nWhat's amazing with the target retirement funds is that any of a number of providers of those in a higher re Ross IRA or four one K. were offering extremely low costs on them and others offering very high costs\nOn the target retirement fund portfolio vanguard which is generally considered to be the gold standard charges typically\nLike point one five of one percent\nTo point to oh of one percent where other providers may charges much is more than one percent\nFor having money in a target retirement fund that difference decimate eventually how much money you'll have to live on in retirement those expenses really mad or overtime\nFred is with us on the Clark Howard show hello Fred\n... thanks for all you do for us we get a lotta information from you they're sure do cart or I mean contacted by Fran regarding a multi level marketing company that are promoting a digital coin and I'm not really familiar with what ... year old coins are\nAnd they're talking about going public and they're not ready to show their face a and it looks like a ... game to me but I was wondering if you had any information regarding digital coin\nSo when people refer to digital coin that's generally a generic term for that one brand name that did establish itself in the marketplace called\nBitcoin and bitcoin is an alternative way for people to pay for things\nAround the world and it is what's generally referred to as a crypto currency is not a government pac money is one is that is accepted based on a daily value\nThe people who are willing to buy and sell bitcoins are willing to take that value what you're calling about is not bitcoin somebody who's trying to\nTrade on that basically what is it that you would do if you were to get involved in this point in business\nAre supposedly going to have to do anything you buy it and after a certain amount of money anywhere from a hundred and fifty to I don't know four five thousand dollars\nAnd then the coin is like is where it's like two or three cents now and it keeps the posing to rise the ... gonna rise and start a company where he can he years you're going\nOkay so I Would not go anywhere close to that because first of all when somebody any of us could say today we're going\nTo have Fred money or we're going to have Clark money and I want to buy Fred money 'cause it's going to go through the roof and I'm In a safe red money is worth so much money today but I can tell you in the future you're going to make a fortune on Fred money\nYeah for a cart money so I Would tell you that having alternative payment forms is going to be part of the future but they're not\nDesigned to be an investment they're designed to be a payment platform just another way to buy and sell things in somebody's promising\nYou're getting in on the ground floor of a get rich quick thing I Would not get involved with anything like that because they're your initiative you are eligible for if you do this and get other people to buy them or anything like that\nYeah you can get a commission if she can bring out of the people and that's what my antenna\nAnd how much commission like if you get me to buy you said a hundred and fifty dollars worth of you get me to buy a hundred and fifty dollars\nWorth of this this electronic Coyne how much do you get to the commission\nIdea that ten percent\nTo ... get Fifteen dollars than in rivers paying this together gets the hundred and thirty five\n... uh evidently\nThe whole product is this supposed money that you're supposed to\nSo stay on that doesn't actually exist yet to be used to buy and sell things\nThat's that's the story\nOK I Would tell you don't even think about getting involved in that because that is there's no true product or service that's being sold\nHere but it's just speculation that at some point people will be able to use these electronic coins and that sounds to me like that could very dangerously ended up being an

four\nDemocrats\nHealthcare is the number one issue on their minds in the country for Republicans number five issue and health care has been a subject\nOf debate in our country now for a long long time going back [noise] shoes generations at least and how we provide health care who pays how people are covered if they are covered and all the rest have been through all the debates about Obamacare\nAnd here we are at a point where we are spending far more on health care\nThan anywhere else on earth even versus national income spending more than double anybody else and our lifespans are shrinking and the United states not growing we now have life spans average lifespan that is reaching down to where some third world\nAnd trees are calling us what we're doing is not working and we're really affects you is if you have health care provided by your employer health coverage\nYou are making less money in your check than you would if health care wasn't so incredibly outrageously expensive the cost of healthcare United States one fifth of our national economy is my belief that the uh partisans\nBoth from the Republican side and the Democratic side or all missing the real issue arguing about what kind of coverage there's gonna be and what is going to cover and all that was going to cost ignores the real problem is the way we deliver health care and the country and what that costs\nAnd I want to go back to an example that I address briefly or we think it was like four years ago\nAbout how one of the poorest countries in the world has managed in a decade\nTo increase life spans of its citizens by an unprecedented amount may be unprecedented in human history and they've done it\nIn the most basic way possible the country's Rwanda an extremely dirt poor country that when they came up with a new idea a new way of delivering health care\nAt the time Rwanda average citizen was lucky to hit even middle age\nToday the average Rwandan lives and to their mid sixties which isn't fantastic but it's outstanding compared to where they were before and the way they did it is the kind of thing that could help us so much in the United states\nWe right now in the U.S have a very hospital based medical system hospitals are expensive they treat people when they're acutely ill\nAnd everything about hospital systems in the United states says about hospitals gobbling up independent doctor practices and specially practices and using them as a way to funnel patience into the hospitals\nAnd that's the beast is being fed and by the way when one of the hospitals buys a doctor's independent practice in order to come up with the money that they're paying the doctor to buy his or her practice may raise rates fifty percent typically\nSo we're all paying money for a system it's all about not worrying about people big time till they're really badly ill\nWhat they did in Rwanda is they recognize the lack of medical care that's available and rural areas and in poorer areas\nDo you think about so much of what we argue about how we're going to take care of people is about people in rural America and who are lower in ...\nSo what Rwanda did was they said we are going to provide basic medical care from para professionals\nAnd I'll walk you through how to set up a Roth IRA it's really easy to do so and you can contribute is just like clockwork just like

Mikhail\nIs with us on the Clark Howard show Hi how are you today that are you doing great thank you you want to talk about how good or bad an idea is to pay all your bills by credit card is that right\nYeah I Believe it to go out and I'm thinking maybe I could pay all my bills off and then every week you know pay a large amount of credit card when I get paid\nSo safe if you pay credit card balances and Paul\nIs a great idea because with the fights going on among the banks for market share with credit cards there are so many reward cars out there every single bill that I can pay by credit card I pay my credit card\nAnd then get the rewards for having done so\nSo I think it's a great idea as long as he never run a balance on the cards\nWhat do you mean um like pay it off before the end of the month\nWe'll just when the outcome so that you're never paying interest\n'cause you know credit cards all operate based on people who pay balanced isn't for called behind our backs by the banks deadbeats because we're getting free ride on the credit cards money\nAnd right now not only are they giving us the grace period where we can pay our bills\nIn full you know they give us the typically three weeks to pay our bills and fall but then they're rewarding us with cash back or free gasoline or free hotel stays or free travel or whatever it is\nAnd it's a deal for people who pay unfold\nOn August listened until you hit it works you know but\nThe thing is we get the deal McGill because of the people who don't pay in full\nGetting clobbered you know for the banks they lend money in an average rate of Seventeen percent on credit cards and the cost to the money to the bank tends to be about one half a percent to one and a half percent so that's quite a spread they're making\nAnd so it's a great deal for us if we pay balance system full but it's a horrible deal for anybody who's running a balance who is making a massive profit for the bank\nAnd they're also

they know and they knew right off the biggest things we're not meant to blow up\nBecause they opened them\nWhen you find that suspicious packages like this where they normally do\nThey take them somewhere with a robot bomb one everything and then they put them somewhere and then they blow 'em up right or they didn't blow these up they want to find out who sent this stupid thing\nUh so they didn't blow 'em up they open them up knowing that they weren't going to blow up because it's a hoax the question is where's the hoax coming from is it coming from the writer left\nYou know I if I had

saying this bomber left a bunch of clues behind and they're not saying all they know but they say they now know or they think they know where they came from in other words where they originated\nBased on postal stuff you know and I'm I'm On the same is not trying to help anybody out there but she's seen the postage stamp and all this other stuff\nI Would bet you there's something more to that and some of the post office folks could maybe tell me this maybe it's classified I bet there's more to a postal marketing you know post saying you know what I'm saying cancellation thing than meets the eye and there's probably a lot in coated in that\nThat average people don't know\nI Would think [noise]\nAnd it's just from a pie investigators examining suppose advised descend into two high profile Target Women working to lean forensics clues dealt with it if I sent them gathering fingerprinting DNA evidence\nTracking the origin of the packages and the components used to make the bombs [noise]

there is a high probability you're going to get somewhere investigative lay there will be some there will be no stone left unturned he says\nHighly unlikely that the person or people who built the bombs had been previously flag that by law enforcement the secret service maintains an extensive database of individuals and groups who have main past threats against the president or presidents or other top political leaders\nEither through letters or emails or on social media\nHe says a good percentage of the time this is not the first time whoever's responsible for this will have stuck their neck out those looking to do revenge or harm to someone it doesn't just come to them one day\nAmong the first steps they're going to be reached tracing the path of the packages to the postal system or

following this thing up and started with the drug busts\nAbsolutely let me say this the first thing the reason that film was so good uh there's two things up front I mean the the story was was really compelling and gray ripping but next year and a record did a fantastic\nJob he really did he's the main story tell her that the director he did a fantastic job and a Andrew clay been running a great script has so much of which was actually taken from the real uh transcripts or whether it's grand jury transcripts or court transcripts all the words were the real deal [noise]\nSo uh we started with a really good base\nAnd or the ... you know the story which is very compelling um my character Jim would you know he he's a detective who was going out on narcotics bust when they stumbled upon this\nClinic was basically and they had a war to go at a rate it as they did with the ATF and the FBI and it was a house of horrors of the things they discovered there just blew their mind and a gym would wouldn't let it go\nHe he kept pushing and pushing because he realized something had to be doing something had to be wrong there you know seeing that many feet into seeing that the peace in that big you know ... feet in jars of his down sterilized equipment I'm so fetuses stuffed in the refrigerator in\nIn in a um milk carton and stay and I mean it it it was just a house of horses so he kept pushing and uh finally they ended up you know now in this guy on three counts of murder they could've nailed them on you know several hundred it's possible\nAnd that's one of the the evidence on because this guy was so diabolical and so twisted he kept these uh these bodies lying around in his abortion clinic than\nHe yeah he did well one of the things that have happened if he'd had a bit of a dispute with his medical waste company so that particular time that they came in there was fortuitous for the investigators are in that there was a lot of evidence there uh it was awful for them to see but it was good for the evidence\nAnd uh it was it was a literal house of horrors this up he was doing it was so ridiculous at his clinic hadn't been inspected for Seventeen years purely for

not the Russians yes in Russia and actually hacked to begin to see\nAnd this is from a ...\n... ... you know but what whatever it's a it's another website\nThe Russians have actually had to be in the emails from the national Security Agency would have had proof for such activity in fact the NSA could attract such activity but they didn't do that the lack of evidence that not prevent a coordinated media campaign from spinning up to pin the blame on Russia for the staff\nAnd to portray Donald Trump as bulletins lackey and beneficiary any effort to tell an alternative story's been met with styled opposition\nFox News for example came under withering fire after it published an article in May of twenty Seventeen claiming that Seth Rich or young democratic operative at least be in the email to ... the family obsessed rich\nReacted with theory ensued Fox ... and ... but\nThat suits optical subsequently was dismissed well now there's new information courtesy\nNational security agency AKA the

wouldn't let them look at the servers they told the Russians attack them and the and the FBI James Comey's own testimony said well we never saw the servers ourselves but we had an expert third party that told us that this was the case and they are funded\nThe expert third party was crowd strike which is being the operative they work for the B and C they are made up of a bunch of lives\nBut what they're saying here is through a freedom of Information Act request the NFL has indicated that they do have documents relating to Seth Rich And Julian Assange they're not telling us what they are what's in them but the very fact that they have documents\nRelated to Seth Rich And Julian Assange tells us\nConnection question is will we ever find out [noise] good\nManners are very very important

few thousand people which by the way\nWhat do we tell your yesterday was fourteen thousand it'll be twenty thirty thousand if they make it all the way to the border at the rate they're going now but let's just say it's fourteen thousand fourteen thousand people we have no idea who they are flooding across the border is not a threat to our security are you\nKidding me the bomber\nSuch as it is Robert De Niro got one Joe Biden got one\nOf course we got Maxine Waters and Obama and Hillary\nWe now know that the so called ISIS flag that was on the bomb is a parody\nAnd it's it looks like the ISIS looks like the Arabic but it's actually in the middle of it scantily clad uh figures women and underneath it get her done so this is one of two people\nThis is either an idiot\nWho's gone rogue who happens to support Trump and thinks this is funny or this is a leftist masquerading as a rogue ... Trump supporter who thinks he's being\nFunny and at this point I couldn't tell you which is which\nBut I Will tell you this if we find out it's a left is that's doing this I'm not blaming Maxine Waters just like we didn't blame Bernie Sanders for the guy that shot Steve this leaves you have crazy folks who take politics to an\nUnbelievable level\nAnd believe that they're doing the right thing and they're not they're crazy it is not it is not the responsibility of people unless they're saying hey why don't you go there and make a bunch of pipe bombs and send them to folks and that's not happening that's not happening\nWhat we have here are fringe lunatics on both sides and we don't know who this person is yet whether it's a leftist or whether it's a right wing person but it doesn't mean that Donald Trump is the reason for it if it turns out to be some ...\nWearing idiot and not to say that if you're wearing a mask that you're using them seeing an idiot wearing a mask at if it\nTurns out to be some crazy left this anti for type well then that's on him it's not on everybody else now I Will tell you the problem is a mainstream media does not call the shots they do not call the balls and strikes accurately on both sides\nFor instance when you had the themes ... shooting and the guy was out there hunting Republicans not one person in the mainstream media attributed that to Bernie Sanders which he was a Bernie Sanders volunteer or anybody on the left or any of their rhetoric\nBut this guy we don't even know who he is and they're already blaming Trump they're already blame the Republicans they blaming talk radio they're blaming everybody on the right that they can and then they were not blaming anybody list is hilarious do I have this still up in a\nAnd\nThis is a John King ladies and gentlemen John King on CNN says no one is blaming Trump\nFor the attacks and then the ... Iran at the bottom you know the printed stuff at the bottom says CNN\nTrump has no plans to claim any personal responsibility for inciting cereal box [laughter] now I don't know if that's something that somebody has well that's media I they're putting it a bit so I assume this is not photo shop but I mean this is a typical stuff they're out there saying something out of their mouth\nAnd then two minutes later they say something completely not blaming Trump Trump needs to tamp down the rhetoric I mean look at this has just gotten toxic out there you're not blaming Trump but you need him to to to tamp down the rhetoric\nWhen folks\nWhen has Trump advocated sending pipe bombs to George Soros I don't think he ever has\nDoes he talk about the left wing media the fake news absolutely they are a huge problem and he's been tweeting about that today to matter of fact it's always instructive to go to the president's tweets\nBecause for one thing they're just drop dead entertaining but also they gave us a glimpse into what he is thinking now a lot of what he has been tweeting about today has been this opioid deal where they're trying to get that crisis under control\nAnd then of course he's been going around\nAnd uh and speaking for different candidates out there and so he's been tweeting a lot about mad\nBut he tweeted this morning a very big\nPart of the anger we see today in our society is caused by the purposely faults in an accurate reporting of the mainstream media that I referred to as fake news it has gotten so bad and hateful that is beyond description mainstream media must clean up its act fast and he's exactly right about then\nAnd then he ... is is the New York times and you wanna you wanna get were first class example of fake news\nThe New York times he says has a new fake story that now the Russians in Chinese glad they finally end with the Chinese\nAre listening to all of my calls on cell phones except that I rarely use a cell phone and what I Do it's government authorized by like hard lines just more made up fake news so they're out there saying that they have evidence\nThat the Chinese and the Russians are listening to Trump do official business on a cell phone and very rarely even uses a cell phone and when he does is the security cell phone use is a land line in the oval office when he does his business [noise]\nI'm just telling your phones it's gotten\nCranes you have gotten crazy man seeing any other tweets and just talking about the other places he's going to ah to campaign but so I mean that's basically it from Donald Trump I mean he's saying that the\n... the mainstream media folks were their lives are making people angry and they are have they made this person so angry they're going to send fake pipe bombs to Debbie what's the name show and the rest of these people who knows it may turn out the case but I don't know that you you certainly can't it sure does Donald Trump\nSo every time we have a shooting\nThey trying to

trust this guy\nEvery time there's a shooting they trying to find some\nConservative connection but what happens inevitably is more times than not is a liberal connection and then they just drop it they don't want to talk about it than if they find that at some crazy Bernie person or whatever shooting Steve skull Easter oh that is the main thing\nDoesn't mean anything at all\nAnd I'm here to tell you it doesn't mean anything but it's kind of not anything both times on both sides when we have a nut case it's either blowing up folks are sending fake bombs or shooting people at a baseball
