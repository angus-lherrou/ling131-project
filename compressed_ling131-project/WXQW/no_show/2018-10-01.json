illegal activities and people who are trying to move money from one country to another\nSo as a way to move money from one country to another it's a very efficient way to do it and it's also a very efficient way for people engaged in criminal activity to hide their their tracks\nBy buying things and receiving funds through bitcoin 'cause it's virtually untraceable\nSo that's why it's very popular with people that do illegal activity but there's a third group of people that are into bitcoin Johnny and it may be what your friend is into their people believe they can make money just buying bit coins and holding\nThem high right so let me tell you about that\nIt goes up and down like a yoyo they'll say bitcoin being used as a spec holding is not an investment it so it was

and spend less [noise] I don't want anyone ever\nRip you off I Am just on a slow burn\nOn a particular topic that is eating at me we in the United states have an all volunteer military if you're a long time listener you know I Believe\nWe should have mandatory national service people have to do when they turn Eighteen either in the U.S military or in some kind of public service for two years I think it's a somebody we're missing in society now\nIs the sense of common purpose\nAnd I don't like the fact that\nMilitary service is not a shared sacrifice in the United states anymore we Abou same small number of people being called upon to deploy again and again and again sacrificed potentially of loss of life\nHealth for family which is the continuous separation is not something that's healthy for most marriages\nAnd we as a country made certain promises to people who served in the military one is that they have in return for the sacrifices they make\nThat they have certain rights involved with doing business with banks that the rest of us don't have\nWent on active duty what can happen with interest rates whether you can be evicted whether you can be a for cause\nIt's on whether your car can be repossessed there any of a number of protections under the law\nThat are being ignored and when they're annoyed by banks rules aren't being enforced this is wrong wrong wrong\nI appreciate so much that when people see folks in uniform that they applaud that I think for their service but let's put more meat behind that\nAnd much really do things to serve the people who are serving us\nAnother example of this one came out of Georgia there's a there's a system set up in place\nThere when the spouse of a military person is transferred you know the military person transferred to another state the spouse is then given a waiver\nOf normal professional licensing boards in that say if they're in a profession that requires a state license recently a lawyer\nIn Georgia whose husband was transferred to the military post at Fort Benning was refused the right to practice law even though she was already a member of the bar\nNo doubt that this was all about simply protecting the lawyers already in place and preventing someone from coming in as potential competition\nI have to say no doubt and guess because the legal board it's supposed to issue the waiver not only refused issue it didn't say why\nThat is completely outrageous and unacceptable you know we need to do more than talk a good game we need to support our military personnel and we as a country really need to think long and hard\nAbout what I Believe so strongly through and through that all of us could benefit and our nation would benefit enormously if there was a shared sense of service in our country with mandatory service as part of the game\nI Believe the strong division in public life in the United states is because very few people that served in elective office have any military background at all\nWhere you meet people from every walk of life\nAnd it doesn't matter who you are where you're from what your religion is what color you are\nIt's all about the one purpose of serving our nation and I think that's part of what we're missing and understanding how much we share in common\nVersus the differences we have\nMike is with us on the Clark Howard show Hi Mike Hi

supposed to take that money and send a wire to British taxing authorities to pay that tax bill\nBut he's actually taking real money that he's wiring to scammers and then the check but he's deposited

know ... they're coming in\nI'm trying to do the email and then you started saying well is this a good use of my time\nYou know is this a good use of my time going through all this so I Want to hear from you people and so if you have some really interesting things to say and some of you feed me great stories by but I'm not talking about you who emailed me all the time when you email me with great stories\nStuff I haven't seen usually fall that's invaluable you're you're sort of like the vast than family across the hinterland let me start with some of this stuff to now of you know some of this I found a show prep some of you folks have sent me some of the stuff\nSome of it is unsubstantiated but we have ... this is substantiated we every city uh with Canada now what\nDid I tell you\nSo Trump last week is sitting there going yeah we're coming to a deadline I mean if you know the the default is we're just going to put a tariff on their cars over here and make a lot of money I don't see anything wrong with that so they want to come out of the day but we really don't like the guy who's negotiating what we really don't like this guy\nAnd when they ask him why he didn't meet with Justin Trudeau is going because there is nothing new to talk about when you got when you tell me you're going to do what we need you to do like help our dairy farmers in the rest of it then come back and talk to me and they did and here's something else too that nobody's talking about China\nHas announced they're cutting their import tariffs is watching us negotiate with Mexico\nAnd and Canada and by the way we have we have a new name for NAFTA it's us in the ... United States and Mexico and Canada it's no longer NAFTA now this has to get approval from Congress\nAnd I think they probably will approve it even Chuck Schumer says I was totally against NAFTA if this helps the middle class then that's great well I heard somebody today may NPR's somebody saying that um you know the I think forty percent of the I don't have the stance rooms don't quote me\nSomething like forty percent of the some of the car manufacturing jobs they gotta pay him sixteen dollars an hour\nAnd people were saying well that's a that's a\nThey were implying that he's trying to buy the votes of the middle class\nIt's not that at all\nLet me tell you why why that is\nIt so that there's not this tendency to send your manufacturing the Mexico Mexico has to pay a bunch of their folks sixteen bucks an hour\nThen there's no need and moving your car manufacturing outfit the Mexico thinking there and get cheaper labor 'cause you're not you may as well just stay here so it's not about paying\nThe car manufacturing a people more because they're making that kind of bread it's about keeping those jobs from going to Mexico that's how you when you're dealing with a third world country that can under cuts you on labor costs this is the way to do is say look if we're going to have a treaty they weren't going to have an agreement a trade agreement\nThen we're going to have a trade agreement that keeps a lot of these jobs from going across the border to you because let's be honest NAFTA was a great deal for ... sake oh it wasn't so great for us\nAnd so Trump has reached still missing and he's made all sorts of demand and he's gotten most of it he didn't get all of it\nBut that's what you do you go in and asking for four hundred percent of what you want to end up with two hundred percent and you're happy these other folks who negotiated the deal is doing with exactly what they want and they come out with half of what they want it and this guy knows how to negotiate here's the deal\nThe new pact and this is from political which is being called the U.S Mexico Canada agreements\nIs a major step forward and complain they want to Trump signature campaign promises gives the president of the concrete policy when they're out on the campaign trail this fall that also sets the stage for what is sure to be a high stakes fight to get the agreement passed by Congress before it can become law you remember\nWhat all these folks were saying all these tariffs on our friends like Canada is is horrible why we're treating your friends on the\nUh we had a better deal well never mind\nAnd so we're getting a better deal from China we're getting a better deal from the ... you were getting a better deal from Mexico and Canada and everybody we're dealing with because this guy knows how to play hardball\nTrump Administration already formerly notified Congress at the end of August of its plans to sign a new pact and face the deadline of the end of September to provide a draft of the agreement which they've done so am I now have us trade representative Robert Lighthizer\nSet in late August that officials are planning to sign with their Canadian in Mexico or Mexican counterpart at the end of November a date with also satisfy Mexico which is eager to have current president Enrique Pena Nieto sign the deal before his successor takes place\nThat's over ... member him he won that'll happen\nDecember first it's a great win for the president and a validation for his strategy in the area of international trade a senior administration officials send them to call with reporters\nPeople briefed on the outline of a revamped deal described changes in language governing dairy imports you remember that Trump was saying they got a three hundred percent a tariff on an air well they don't know\nNone of this goes through dispute resolution between the country's limits on online shopping that can be done tax free and limits on the U.S threat of auto tariffs\nPrime minister Justin Trudeau said that they left the office late Sunday night it's a good day for Canada so everybody's feeling good about this thing\nNow watch the Democrats tried to screw it up\nBecause they're going to try to screw it up so he doesn't have something to brag about come the mid term elections a formal vote in Congress won't be held until ... next year and it is still an open question whether lawmakers including members of the president's own party\nWho often clashed with him on trade will fall in line to support the bill I think now that they've seen\nThe madness of his methods and they see what we're going to get out of this I think they're going to definitely fall in line lawmakers from both parties along with powerful business and industry groups\nAre also examining whether new provisions such as a stricter automotive rule may end up making life more difficult for domestic companies rather than easier\nA senior administration official highlighted the great result on dairy issues that was achieved this pack opens up the Canadian dairy market us exports at a level higher\nThan the three point two five percent market share the Obama administration

than\nThe official all sorts of the candidates agreed to eliminate a recent milk ingredient pricing program than us farmers complain of dried up demand for their exports of the product\nAnd exchange Canada was able to preserve dispute settlements language Canada has historically insisted on an international panel to judge whether the U.S improperly uses duties as a commercial weapon Canada also agreed to a a an accommodation to its auto exports\nAnd responds to tariffs Trump's expected to impose on vehicle imports for national security reasons\nThat arrangement is going to likely involve Canada agreeing to assign bill that would restrict its auto exports to a level well above the current volume of train that flows south of the border line ... and hope to reach an agreement by the end of last year a timeline that was extended until the end of march\nThe three nations failed to make that deadline but they had been meeting almost continuously in Washington\nAnd they have finally come to a deal and as I say it's all up to Congress now which is not probably going to happen until sometime next year so in the meantime we have a ... classmate of Kavanaugh's who says that he was a heavy

the judge you\nThere's a lot of other stuff to talk about though Rachel Mitchell you remember her she's the Maricopa County prosecutor that specialized in sex crimes\nWell she sent a memo to the Senate Republicans and check this out five pages obtained by the Washington Post\nCites a number of inconsistencies and Dr Ford this testimony on Thursday before the Senate Judiciary committee pending explaining why the allegation would not be sufficient to bring criminal charges absent corroborating evidence\nOr he said she said case is incredibly difficult to prove she wrote but this cases even weaker than that Dr forwarded an invite other witnesses to the event and those witnesses either refuted her allegations are failed to corroborate them\nFor the reasons discuss below I Do not think that a reasonable prosecutor would bring this case based on the evidence before the Senate Judiciary committee nor do I believe that this evidence is sufficient to satisfy the preponderance of evidence standard or\nWhat day of Brett Kavanaugh was vigorously texting back and forth with Martin judge they key witness in this whole proceeding people will be all they'd be screaming and that would be enough to get him\nOff the confirmation that would be enough to disqualify him in the eyes of all these liberals out there but yeah we have Dr Ford who was by our own admission under oath in testimony to the Senate Judiciary committee\nWas texting back and forth with a legal in Kaiser over the last few days a key witness\nPoker either cooperate or not her story why would you be texting back and forth with her well she takes me first\nAnd I would just ignore the tax if I'm sitting there as somebody who is a key witness or not a key witness and accuser bumped somebody and a key witness contacts me\nI Would tell the Senate Judiciary committee immediately that this woman contacted me and I did not contact her back\nAnd then show them the text message of what she may have said in a text message but they're going back and forth and Leland Kaiser saying I Believe you I Believe you but I Can't remember any of this [laughter]\nI Can't remember going to a party like this I don't know that I ever met Brett Kavanaugh no one even see those text messages will the FBI investigate those text messages\nThat is something I'm worried about that they won't do and if you're the president of the United states and you have the ability to sort of guy this investigation by call up Chris Wray over there and say Chris you know I'm not trying to tell you how to do your job\nBut this woman under oath said she was talking with one of the witnesses days prior testimony do we need to know what they were talking about\nSeeing that they were setting their story straight or if Dr Ford was urging her to tell it her way do we need to know this\nIs highly unusual you folks who are in the law business will notice\nWhen you got an accuser and a witness in the witness is getting ready to take the witness stand and the accused during the witness had been communicating back and forth prior to her testimony that's problematic\nTo say the least not to mention all the inconsistencies and Dr Ford story which I Hope the FBI's can investigate that when did she have the renovations done she said she did this because of the Kavanaugh nightmares and twenty twelve\nPalo
