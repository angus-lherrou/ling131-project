at Northwestern panhandle cubs meteorologist ... says multiple tornado warnings have been issued in Georgia as hurricane Michael pushes through the state and local media says some of those twisters may have touched down\nBecause we still have the core even though we've lost the eyes ah the quarter wins around us are still sustain Ninety miles per hour so is that most of the north we can expect

on the worst power storms ever make landfall in the United states [noise] we heard of significant impacts that tend to air force base in many communities along the coast\nAt least one death and some four hundred thousand power outages are blamed on hurricane Michael in Florida\nOver a male politicians midterm elections are just around the corner\nAnd so it could be a potential turn of the American politics when it comes to gender says the skewed article from study finds charge a record number of women are running for Congress and there may never be a better time for such a breakthrough a new study finds that both men and women prefer\nFemale politicians over males a survey of fourteen hundred American men and women over Eighteen connected by researchers in Steven's Institute of technology I won't get bogged down in a lot of the various analyses that they do here but I I Will point out this because I find that to be a sort of the most important part when it breaks it down between\nRepublicans and Democrats or this is fascinating ah Democrats Democrat men specifically tend to favor a female politician\nMailed Democrats\nWill favor a female politician but when it comes to Republicans Republicans can go either way\nRepublican men and women\nAre fifty fifty they don't have a preference one way or the other you know now me\nI'm looking at two Republican candidates and they're pretty much on paper the exact same and and and\nThey're they're a resume their track record it says it I'd have to flip the coin between two Republican candidates one demand and Wonder Woman I'd probably go for the check\nI I'd probably put the baby up there I don't know why this guy I think it makes us look better when we have more women up there and frankly speaking generally speaking for the most part in in the modern era of the Republican Party some of the most to nations fighters for the conservative cause\nHave been women I'm just more impressed by them and I think they're used to take 'em to golf a little bit more than they can get it back a little bit better I think men are are are are are too easily cowed\nBy the media they they don't want to be called names [laughter] they don't want to be a a oh don't call me sexist don't call me racist oh no no I'm not going to do whatever I can to make sure that the media is my friend for the most part I'm speaking in general terms that's what we do and talk radio\nBut women see for a woman to be a pro life true red blooded conservative woman in American politics they hurt\nAt all and they don't give a damn really to life I'd had\nFight my way and the professional world being married for decades raising kids raising grade and you think I'm going to be concerned about about a Don Lemon calling me a name about Lawrence O'Donnell not approving of me please I'd given\nBirth I don't I don't have to worry about you I've been through it all but I I tend\nTo want to put the baby in there I like the checks generally speaking generally speaking up but I Do find it fascinating that when it comes to Republicans that conservatives it doesn't they don't show a preference which truly\nShows that it's the conservatives who don't judge people by their genitalia but don't judge people by chromosomal makeup we actually judge people based on who they are the character that they bring forth\nWhere Democrat men they're like oh well if it's a woman you betcha because I Want to show how look I Am I'm ... I'm I'm more feminine and now and all that just wait how about you betcha\nI think that this is a way you tell me I'm interested in your take on this eight seven seven three one two three months but I think that that generally speaking Democrat dudes are\nThey they want to show women how incredibly wonderful they are looking hardy wine state I mean you couldn't have found a better Democrat then Harvey Weinstein he exemplified personified that very model\nOf a male Democrat in the United states of America he gave the all the right cause as he raise money for all the ripe candidates\nHe was pro choice he he's never met an abortion he hasn't liked\nHe made sure that he was in the forefront of every liberal causes in America because that was his suit of armor that was his protection\n\nHe was able to be as as abominable and sexist and horrible and despicable as a man can be but as long as he gets the where the mantle of feminist liberal Democrat\nWho checks all the boxes on the list of the causes you support and the candidate you throw money at and raise money for a while then you get a free pass up to a certain point\n\nIt makes sense to me this is this is a Democrat do ... ah get the ...\nSay they they they can walk into what a coffee shop and order the right kind of a lot to say and and where they are pro choice buttons and have a conversation with a barista about how they're going to the uh save the spotted whale rally tomorrow\nAnd that's their opening line\nThat's how they get their checks most of them married not the checks the deeds\n[noise] but what do you think why

before the hour on first lied Michael Toscano here with us so glad that you are joining us this morning give us a call at eight hundred seven three six three six six six because we're talking about Columbus Christopher Columbus\nColumbus Day and how we celebrate that day and should we celebrate that day a lot of places are not celebrating it anymore you just heard that tune a\nThere's a new version of the lyrics goes like this in fourteen hundred Ninety to Columbus sale the ocean blue she had three ships and left from Spain he brought with him genocide racism capitalism and enduring pain\nIs paying for the sins of subsequent Europeans or was he a bad guy should we recognize the European visit to the new world in that way it was a not good necessarily for the people who are already here [noise]\nSo what do we do um Columbus Day as I mentioned a few minutes ago it's been a federal holiday since Nineteen thirty seven and for quite a few decades it was celebrated pretty much every place that was when I was a kid in school but now Thirteen\nIt's at all don't celebrate it they don't really observe it more and more counties and cities are going that way and many are renaming the day indigenous people day to put the focus more on the Native Americans who were here when Columbus came along today so\nColumbus has gone from being a hero to something much less than that [noise]\nUm so what's the deal here are we are racing history or is there something about Columbus that makes him unusually bad or should we at least recognize part of what he did or not what what was Columbus up to us let's go back he was looking for a route to the far east from Europe they were looking for trade routes and he kind of\nIt he he did have the courage to know that okay I don't believe the earth is flat I'm not going to fall off the end of the earth I think I'm going to be able I think it's a ball I'll be able to do around find a new way to the far east and we can sell things and buy things better\nSo that didn't actually happen he didn't succeed in his mission to discover the far east and he never actually even set foot on what would become us soil\nAnd he wasn't even the first European and the new world we now know of course that the Vikings and beat him here by about five hundred years so what was the difference\nWell Columbus was was well known and he was also sponsored by the government of Spain as you may recall and it was his discovery that got everybody's attention and sparked this exploration that really changed the world as we know it\nUh now I'm the downside Columbus a slave to people he tortured some people including as the Spanish columnist who didn't follow his rules we know that entire populations there were wiped out by the diseases bad that the Europeans brought but of course that was not something they intended and we didn't know about the microbes in germs back up and [noise]\nSo are you know we are sometimes you have to apply different [noise]\nDifferent standards when you look at people from the past you don't live the way we do know Columbus wasn't very much a man at this time and do we take that into account it's a very very difficult thing now especially because schools have to figure out how do we give a balanced approach to teaching about Christopher Columbus\nAnd that of course gets into the larger picture of how do we deal with the way white Europeans treated this continent when they got here and turned it into their own backyard never mind that there were people already here with their own culture\nAnd we just pushed them west pushed them what pushed them west\nValley killed a lot of them subjugated others tried to wipe out their culture and of course on the other hand we created the United states of America so how do you balance all that how do you teach it what do you think your group tells us now about how Los Angeles traded in Columbus Day this week in favor of indigenous people's day Jim\nMichael it's a long time coming says Rudy Ortega the tribal president of the ... band of mission Indians a long time coming because he says it involves\nTelling the truth that hurts sign now most\nTo understand that Christopher Columbus did not discover America he wasn't even the first Europeans to come here the Vikings arrived on the shores of some five hundred years before but Columbus is credited for opening the door to European exploration colonization\nAnd says Ortega the exploitation of the land and indigenous people he says these are truce started taking a long time to be recognized or I guess that's where many in our nation including our leaders these trees are hard to admit\nYou know how can someone who found that there are so right all the time had errors in their

[noise]\n\n[noise]\n\nIt is twenty four minutes before the hour on for a slide Michael ... here with us so glad that you are joining us this morning give us a call at eight hundred seven three six three six six six because we're talking about Columbus Christopher Columbus\nColumbus Day and how we celebrate that day and should we celebrate that day a lot of places are not celebrating and anymore you just heard that tune a\nThere's a new version of the lyrics goes like this in fourteen hundred Ninety to Columbus sale the ocean blue she had three ships and left from Spain she brought with him genocide racism capitalism and enduring pain\nZ paying for the sins of subsequent Europeans or was he a bad guy should we recognize the European visit to the new world in that way it was a not good necessarily for the people who are already here [noise]\nSo what do we do [noise] um Columbus Day as I mentioned a few minutes ago has been a federal holiday since Nineteen thirty seven and for quite a few decades it was celebrated pretty much every place that was when I was a kid in school but now Thirteen states at all don't celebrate it they don't really observe it more and more counties and cities are going that way [noise]\nAh and many are renaming the day indigenous\nDay to put the focus more on the Native Americans who were here when Columbus came along today so Columbus has gone from being a hero to something much less than that [noise]\nUm so what's the deal here are we are racing history or is there something about Columbus that makes him on usually bad or should we at least recognize part of what he did or not what what was Columbus up your last let's go back he was looking for a route to the far east from Europe [laughter] they're looking for trade routes and he kind of\nHe he did have the courage to know that okay I don't believe the earth is flat I'm not going to fall off the end of the earth I think I'm going to be able I think if the ball I'll be able to go around to find a new way to the far east and we can sell things to buy things better\nSo that didn't actually happen he didn't succeed in his mission to discover the far east and he never actually even set foot on what would become us soil\nAnd he wasn't even the first European and the new world we now know of course that the Vikings and beat him here by about five hundred years so what was the difference\nWell Columbus was was well known and he was also sponsored by the government of Spain as you may recall and there was a discovery that got everybody's attention and spark this exploration that really changed the world as we know it\nNow um the downside Columbus ah been slammed people he tortured some people including is the Spanish columnist who didn't follow his rules we know that entire populations there were wiped out by the diseases about that the Europeans brought but of course that was not something they intend and we didn't know about the microbes in germs back band\nSo uh you know we are sometimes you have to apply different [noise]\nDifferent standards when you look at people from the past you don't live the way we do know Columbus wasn't very much a man of his time and do we take that into account and it's a very very difficult thing now especially because schools have to figure out how do we give a balanced approach to teaching about Christopher Columbus\nAnd that of course gets into the larger picture of how do we deal with the way white Europeans treated this continent when they got here and turned it into their own backyard never mind that there were people already here with their own culture\nAnd we just pushed them west pushed them what pushed them west ... killed a lot of them subjugated to others tried to wipe out their culture\nAnd of course on the other hand recreated the United states of America so how do you balance all that how do you teach it what do you think your group tells us now about how Los Angeles traded in Columbus Day this week in favor of indigenous people's day Jim\nMichael it's a long time coming says Rudy Ortega the tribal president of the ... band of mission Indians a long time coming because he says it involves\nTelling the truth and hurt by now most to understand\nAnd I\nThink that uh you know if you lift the reservations or get rid of them that uh you know the economic development welcome [laughter] um but uh you know the previous caller you know what about Thanksgiving and all the story behind Thanksgiving about\n... staff or you know saving the parrot cans or you know that came over and and the care that is you know turned on him\nAnd Native Americans do deserve some recognition because they got rid of one of the worst officers in the United States Army history\nTracking by general Custer [laughter]\nYeah you know I mean he was you know even ground getting like him so I'm Chan after all the you know some of the atrocities Haiti or do you know he deserved it but uh you know he took two hundred and twenty innocent people with him [noise]\nUm [noise] but I really think that uh what's gonna happen is um [noise] you know people are think are forgetting you know the devastation that a court has an age group you know what the Mayans and ... people in Mexico\nI talk about wiping out a civilization I mean you can\nLike I mean you know they decimated it and you know the underlying reason why Columbus even sales was greed take a short cut to China\nYeah All right thank you so much for the call appreciate it we're going to go to a Edward in Seattle at eight minutes before the our ... morning Edward\n... we're so the morning how are you today\nWe're doing well can you hear me to hear you loud and clear mind you know can you hear me\nYes I I hear you loud and clear um what we can hear you apparently you can hear all very\nSorry also love story tellers around here but anyway I wanted to make a point that I'm\nA there are a lot of discrepancies in history that the kids are not being taught these days you know the a and a new phone instead of me oh will be you know I was always\nWatching the movie ...\nAnd it was a great thing for Texas well in reality of the almost fight for the Texas they have the slavery between um the Mexico air than Texas so it wasn't a big heroes and so forth I\nSay so you know coming out on the side of of being honest as Russia's main\nIn our ...\nYeah I think I think his line just went dead so speaking of the Alamo Karen you're in Texas what do you think should we not remember the Alamo\n[laughter]\nNo I think she said don't go correctness has got a little out of hand and they can build on history and don't eliminate and several callers from previous\nNot since I was working on a good way of putting I went ... very good way of putting that ... you know there there's good and bad and ah you know people in different times at different standards things that we think are pouring today [laughter]\nUh but we shouldn't bury that we shouldn't just take it and remove it and bury it we need to put it in some kind of a context and ah you know I I Believe that um that's a good way to go ...\nSo I guess a ... so we'll remember the Alamo and what what do we do about Columbus Day because it's a federal holiday we continue that or do we broaden it out what do you think\nOh late allowing the indigenous people day is just discrimination and the other way that he had it all included in what Columbus jak rather than a lemonade and to it\nShould we should we changed the name of the day to discovering America day then [laughter]\nNo I think it's already established is just taking political correct and that's a little too far but I go okay I appreciate the call ... things that are banning good about everything and you can't ... it's just hard to your wife but it's just the white people or\nAnd it if you want to get good as well yeah and call it all this other stuff\nSo long as we don't say things are good that weren't good and ... and and buried the things that are good because I think we all benefit when we get our an honest look at ourselves and our history anyway thanks so much for the call please

decades before\nAnd they have no way of proving they actually pay them off and Congress and its wisdom gave student loan collectors extreme powers where they don't even have to prove the validity of a

that\nI Want to airlines to be able to charge whatever fees they wish the only thing that I had called for and it landed up on deaf ears I remember talking with congressman about this and it just I was not penetrating the congressman skull at all but my idea was reciprocity\nThat if you cancel a fireman and delta American and you know I didn't want to charge you two hundred dollars\nTo change that flight or cancel it\nThat if the airline canceled a flight or it suffers a extreme delay they should pay you that same amount\nWhat's fair is fair but the Congress chose to do nothing about fees and said silent on it\nAnd the other thing with a new change is women that are pregnant now we're going to have priority in boarding\nAnd so they're not ...\nAbout or anything like that one thing Congress chose not to do and I discussed it recently on the air because the prior\nLaw covered it\nAnd now is no longer going to be part of the procedures going forward there is no requirement that airlines accommodate families of small children small children child not be separated from their parents on a flight\nI think that's outrageous and unconscionable unacceptable\nAnd the irony here is that even the hard discount airlines\nSpirit frontier in the region specifically accommodate\nHaving families sit together southwest accommodate families sitting together the three false airlines American United and delta\nSpecifically don't and I think that's mean spirited and cruel one thing that came out not too long ago American Airlines\nWas introducing the planes that had some seepage of twenty eight inches which if you're not familiar with what that means it means that even someone shorter than five three\nWould have their knees knocking under the seat in front of them on a flight\nThere was a mutiny from American Airlines employees and the public\nAn American backed off that but there is now going to be an investigation on safety grounds\nOf whether or not there should be minimum seat requirements on planes so that people can evacuate safely under the safety requirement which is to empty a plane and Ninety seconds or less\nAs you put more and more bodies on the plane what United does is called the interpretation where they're crowding more and more and more people in the same space are all those people going to be able to get out in time and that's why there's going to be an investigation of that\nBut here's one of the greatest weirdness as I can think of\nFrontier airlines one of the deep discount airlines has reduced its fee for changing cancellation and in fact if you book a ticket way ahead and you decide three months or more out that you're not going to go they charge you know the at all and give your money back\nSo\nIt's so weird that the three full affairs American United and delta charge these massive change fees and even one of the hard discounters charges last or nothing\nBut goes without saying that if you want to avoid

went back there Reagan spoke LBJ at the two hundred on his tour just birthday he spoke and and\nUh it was like a mecca for ... for future presidents poor current president's because even if you didn't agree with everything did she was a leader\nAnd their self made person and a lot of people who don't love everything about what Andrew Jackson did can appreciate when you're an alternate fourteen and have no money and no connections and you become a two term president that's what America is supposed to be you have the opportunity to be successful not a guarantee\nThat is exactly right and you're big on the prince George Washington's the um the secret six Thomas Jefferson the Tripoli pirates all these ... were the ... uh so you get a thing for the president's don't you\nYeah but what I tried to do is attract you at the president's point you know all these great people around them that made them special like what the secret to his firing with the Tripoli pirates it's people like the the Decatur and William eating and with Andrew Jackson\nIs you know you get a flavor of what can be used in life you know the great people around him who made him a special who looked up until we get to almost their eyes [noise]\nWell let's talk about presidents and smokes you've seen by now but a county West was in the oval office the day and put on the show what do you what's your take on that and I thought it was awesome but I'd love to hear your take on it\nCould put it this way I I cannot tell you the biography of tiny west I Know people who know music and say well he's a genius thought well that's fine when I'm when I find is touting is even the after the oval office today is no one said these traditional and they still liked him and they still accept it always works\nThe one thing that was the what was the no go side was when he supports President Trump than thinking if I said wait a second now he's ... now he's mentally during\nThese medications and now he's\nA horrible way second we were so tolerant when he was a musician and eccentric in a fashion designer and okay\nBut now he did a horrible thing of endorsing a Republican I don't even think it's top I think it's a Republican and I think it's just crazy and what he did is the ... which was kind of a wife gets seems the more you tell him and he's wrong the more he's going to double down\nMullah look I Love what he said the other day he said these people say the amount of control I'm Out of their control and I was a fantastic loan\nBut one thing I Would say is that uh I Do Jim Brown\nAnd I hosted radio show with him for five years and we were in friendships\nFrom the pot and kennel department of politics the president is trying to turn the tables on his opponents this fall a master of divide and conquer campaigning do Gibbs critics belittling nicknames calls this follows evil people and as encourage supporters to knock the crap out of the protesters\nMr Trump hopes to convince the public that his opponents are the ones who were totally unhinged well of course they are\nThey I mean you can look at him and tell it's in the eyes folks are you got to do is look at\n... go steal Cortez and say I am a local\nAll the women who confronted senators and elevators with stories of sexual assault in the demonstrators protested the chamber's or outside the capital are Mr Trump's rallies now part of a leftist ... ball a dangerous rebel\nMr Trump is often engaged in what some analysts call projection describing his opponents in the same terms they use to describe him\nWhat his own mental stability has been questioned Mr Trump regularly causes folds crazy psycho wacky\nAnd mentally deranged just weeks after a former aimed published a book about him titled\nOn hand used let's talk about ... calling the kettle black Mrs ... Lama roasted chic you're talking about somebody who's on hand used I thought that was the most ironic title didn't you on hands and I'm going well that describes you go to this woman\nIt I mean she was trouble look\nHere's the thing I don't know why Trump put her in the White House to start with I never watched The Apprentice but if you go back and look some of the clip she was on hands then and you go and why would why would you drank listened to the White House but he did I guess\nBecause he was trying to be open minded than you know giving opportunities to women and minorities and then this woman is just crazy you got to be able to call out the nuts\n[noise] even when Baker ran down some of the Democrats recent instigation the frame them as a response to Trump as if they had no agency of their own\nThey wrote at least some Democrats seem increasingly intent on matching Mr Trump and his Pew ballistic politics adopting a fight fire with fire approach\nFrom a vice president anvil Joe Biden the sheer boasted\nThat if they were in high school together they would've beat the hell out of Mr Trump or disrespecting women I Love those thing that I think Trump would kill him to which the president replied that if they didn't fight Mr Biden quote would go down fast and hard crying all the way [noise]\nSo this is Trump solve rights so you've got by now they're saying big bailout I mean we were in school together and Trump says if he tried that he'd go down fast and hard crying all the way and now Trump is the bad guy\nWhat I've noticed about him since the get go is he never\nStart sending these five figure than them and then people get so upset because it comes after somebody especially a woman like Rosie or some of these other crazy folks that have gone after him and he goes after them just like it goes after men which shows that he's not sexist this is what gets me let me ask you this folks\nI just that and the thing about this last night and I'm Wondering 'cause I Know what you're going to say anyway but if you happen to be somebody that is being\nA\nAttacks for lack of a better term out in public like Ted Cruz was or whatever if a guy\nComes up to you and Chavez you and throws a drink in your face what are you going to do if you're a guy\nYou're going to fight back what if a woman does that what you're supposed to stand there and take it I thought we were all supposed to be equal so if you're going to climb into this arena so you want to hide behind the fact that you're a woman\nBecause I Would say that if a woman throws a drink and a guy's face he ought to throw him drink right back in her face I'm not saying that you ... what I'm saying if she does something to you you do the same thing to her all you can do a bill oh you're talking about abusing women I thought we were talking about quality here\nIf you want to get in and start assaulting somebody you shouldn't be surprised when they turn around and do the exact same thing to you\nBoth Trump does this season equal opportunity offender\nIf you're a woman and come after him he comes back it's you just like you're on the same level as he is instead of saying oh well there's a woman I shouldn't say that to her that's crazy if we walk\nIf women want to be treated equally then they should be treated equally don't use this business so oh well when it gets to bomb a woman you don't do that to a woman\nWell most women I Know don't throw drinks in people's faces either most women don't get hysterical and start spitting on people if you get in that arena it's all bets are off I'm just telling you\n[noise]\nIt would go down fast and hard crying all the way I Love [laughter] this is Matt Matt seen Democrats California told supporters that they see a member of Mr Trump's cabinet a restaurant or a store you get out and you\nCreate a crowd\nHillary Clinton waded into the debate this week in an interview with CNN when she rejected that notion of civility with Mr Trump's

knows how to get things done he knows how to make America great and when I put on my make America great had I feel like\nSuperman oh that's the quote it's going to resonate for years to come can you imagine if folks in the black community quote unquote start putting on this Superman capes now\nThat it's safe now become out thirty six percent support of black Americans for Trump\nAnd you're going to start seeing it as I told you before I think Kanye is the bridge and I think he's been doing a heck of a job have I always agree with ... no matter of fact when he was trash and George W\nFor Katrina\nYou know saying that they didn't care about black folks will they ask you about that today and he says that's when I was a liberal and that's when I was a victim and I'm not that guy anymore

agree with this training and the way he conducts himself and he's a little rough around the edges bud look at all the wonderful things he's done for this country\nAnd when you reached that point there is no returning we reached the point of no return with that point because\nWe're almost there thirty six percent if this is real from rats most other polls that but the last one poll I saw Twenty one percent but whatever I mean it's it's a huge jump the most any Republican ever got was eleven or twelve percent and now we're\nAt the very worst Twenty one percent support in the black community maybe

disclosure I've never been a huge Kanye West and when you like it because it like from well yeah [laughter]\nI mean when he saying things that I agree with them yeah I'm going to be more open to him certainly I still don't want to stay in this whole thing about the thirteenth amendment abolishing slavery says you know we don't need the thirteenth amendment and he was talking about a trap door and how that was a crutch or whatever I'm Still not clear on what he's talking about there\nBut a lot of what he was saying was just I mean it just it was inspirational actually not just for black Americans were for all Americans and he's talking about how you know Trump is bringing jobs bag making America great and we need to get behind this guy he's our president all winning and I'm going yeah yeah yeah yeah\nWhat is their ideas their ideas to stop Donald Trump stopped Donald Trump from ... from making the country great again stop Donald Trump from record low black unemployment stop Donald Trump from unemployment\nNot miss low since Nineteen sixty two what is it about Donald Trump you want to stop tweeting well he's not going to stop tweeting just because you're taking control of

about making the country great again or whatever that will tell you if\nI Know you find this hard to believe in and tell you the truth if Obama during his time in in a in the in the White House\nHad come up with some great I use to make America great again I Would have gone okay we got to go with this guy\nBut he didn't everything he wanted to do was big government big government big government we have the slowest recovery in the history of the United states after the recession it wasn't as the recession was was Obama's fault\nIt was that he just exacerbated the misery with all of this the recovery program and all of the other stuff that was a government solution to it when I knew and you know and most of the American people knew what we needed to do was happy free market solution\nWell the pendulum usually swings when it swings way to one side and usually swings back on the other direction equally and that's what I was Trump Trump Trump came alone\nAnd matter of fact if we'd had Romney when we'd never have a Trump and we may be just sitting there sort of been a ... government free market solution and we may just still be muddling through\nBut because we got another dose of

you know why 'cause bonkers things everything else is bonkers\nCrazy things everybody else's crazy\nThese people are imploding as a movement and that's why you see\nThe violent mobs out then yes it is these are mobs going nuts on folks confronting people in restaurants screaming at him\nA as we were saying yesterday were done the lemon saying well last year of freedom of expression notes not trespassing as we told you yesterday on somebody else's business and screaming and disrupting their business is not a constitutional right it's against\nThe law but\nPeople like non dilemma and in some of these other folks believe that they have a constitutional right to confront people anywhere they want to confront him how long have I said to you about the kneeling that it's not a matter of protests as a matter of\nWorkplace you do not have a right to protest at work if you think you'd do try it matter of fact tomorrow if you're working at a bank\nSay you're a bank teller instead of being a bank teller why don't you just sit there and hold up a sign and say the man stinks or whatever or I'm taking a need for the bank or whatever and just and don't do your job and see how long have you keep\nYour job you do not have a right to protest it work\nDo you have a right to on your own time stand on a street corner in front of the bank\nAnd air your grievances absolutely but that's on your own time on public land not on a bank's properly and you don't have a right to go on the banks property and disrupt their business you don't have a right to go in a restaurant\nAnd disrupt their business but the left thinks this is freedom of speech this is why they're crazy\nBut they rewrite all the rules to fit their insanity\nYou're watching the Democrat Party implode and the reason is immigrant parties imploding is that because all Democrats are crazy it's because the crazies they've taken over the party and you folks are a lot lifelong Democrats you're seeing this and you know it's true\nI've told you this before but some of you are new to the program my father was in Congress ... years and he was\nHe was what um Tip O'Neill referred to as a ... way evil in other words he was a southern Democrat voted with the Republicans a lot of the time now he got worse about [laughter]\nOr better depending on your perspective he he got less and less inclined to voting with the Republicans the longer he was there I had a theory on why that happened but I'll tell you\nI remember going up and visiting and make a win and he was elected in a way to win and they may be frame and he chose not to run in Ninety four and without Ninety five\nSo he's up there twelve years a self imposed term limits during the Nineteen eighties I remember going up there and visiting him and we saw Nancy Pelosi and I remember on one occasion we were getting on the elevator and Barney Frank was getting off\nAnd you know mounted and loved him and he's a Barney and then we got on the elevator elevator closed and my father said that guy's crazy\nAnd I want yeah okay that's a ... and they said the same thing about Nancy Pelosi will flash forward to the two thousands and those folks are running\nThe Democratic party in Washington DC so the craziest took over the foreign whacked out left wing of the Democratic party took over\nAnd there are a lot of people who are in the ... for the Democratic party my father was one he was a it was a Democrat or the day he died but it was in the party of FDR and JFK it was the party of\nNancy Pelosi and Barney Frank the people that he said himself are nuts\n\nBut a lot of people stick with things because of tradition nobody that foolish folks\nI knew and the early Nineteen eighties when Ronald Reagan came along but there was something better than the than the Democratic party and that's what I jump ship and in it and it wasn't for anything other than I open my mind and I said\nWho is speaking to me in other words who do I agree with my not at my lawyer to this party or did I campaigned for this or that who is speaking to me as a party\nAnd it was a Republican is now I don't always agree with the Republicans on everything so I Do with ideology\nWhich is conservatism if you do that you can't go wrong because not all Republicans are conservative but most conservatives or Republicans summer libertarians but you go with your ideology\nWell what's happened is a lot of you folks have been sticking in there with the Democrats because you still think of the Democratic party is JFK this ain't JFK's party\nEven chevies party anymore I mean they've they've gone to the left of teddy these people are on hand\nAnd since Trump came along understand there are two things that you're dealing with when you're dealing with Trump\nAs far as the left his concern is a personality clash which I get that part I understand that he can rubs people the wrong way he can he can be bombastic he can be tested going be narcissistic I get all that part about it\nBut that's not really why they're so upset with them\nBut the but that's what they that's where they tell you that's really point to they talk about you know he's a he's a narcissistic he's outta control either\nThey don't know what's really got I'm Upset is that Trump is actually doing what Republicans have threatened to do for decades and that is to cut taxes and cut taxes for real cut taxes for corporations do something about the unbridled illegal immigration\nDo something about the runaway regulations and these are things that Republicans have paid lip service to for many years and it was just nibble that around the edges Donald Trump comes in there and starts\nI mean just kicking button taking names and that's what's got him so upset\nThe dirty secret on this is that what is really upsetting them as they doing it and he was being successful at doing it\nAnd that's what's got them scared because they had a large\nSegment of society especially minorities bamboozled into believing that if you didn't have the Democrats in some sort of control that you were going to be just wash decide in this society\nAnd now we have a record low unemployment for Hispanics and blacks and female unemployment unemployment or something like a sixty four year low it's unbelievable\nSo it's ... it's unbelievable what this guy who hates women hates minorities that minorities and women are doing so well into this guy\nAnd the Democrats are scared to death\nSo when you see somebody like a Kanye West who holds grain sway not only in the black community\nBut it was a millennials in the new under thirty crowd there going oh my gosh we may be losing complete control it catches on that you actually don't need us\n'cause I Want you to think about the difference in philosophy between Democrats and Republicans the Democrats are all about fear\nThey're all about oh if the Republicans get into office\nThen you're not going to have anything near\nThat yeah they're going to take everything away all the Republicans run on a list of the free market decide based in other words we're not promising you anything we're not going to take care of you were going to take care of those who can't take care of themselves but all the rest of us we're\nGoing to get out there and we're going to compete and made the bass man to man woman when or the best transgender we're going to get out there and we're\nTo let you be all you can be they're not promising you any sort of protection\nBut the Democrats are or saying if you let these folks and they're going to take the protection away and you're going to fail and the Republicans are saying I got more faith than you than than the Democrats are saying I don't have more faith than you because you're a minority you must be stupid way up to take care of you\nThere was a significant shortage of type o blood and play by play of all types\nThey say they thought drop in blood donation that people prepare

power again then they said ms\nBranch I think\nEntertainment here we Larry ... and that and there were cheating in our country\nAnd then one more I Believe Luther\nIt's more important for anything that we bring the mayor we provide for his uh hey you know\nSo you mention mental health one of the things you said about mental health it was an interesting thing he says he was diagnosed as bipolar\nAnd then he started looking around talking to some folks and went to another psychiatrist like I said really you've been misdiagnosed you're not bipolar what you are sleep deprived which is an interesting theory that my wife had um put forth just a few days ago\nThe list psychiatry said look your sleep deprivation is causing your symptoms of ... what would appear to be bipolar you get your sleep deprivation under control\nAnd you're not going to have the mental problems anymore and boy is is that not an insight for a look now somebody who psychiatry is rolling your eyes on this is impossible but how many of you folks have been sleep deprived\nWhile I have before and and on purpose and I'll tell you this week you were you were with us Johnny B when we did that marathon what are the forty eight hours and and I did forty eight hours straight was forty eight hours it was two days yes I was fourteen hours straight on the radio there's music radio we play music\nAnd we did I mean we literally did not sleep for forty eight hours probably more than that because we came in and you know whenever we came in and I can't remember\nBut um I don't know I was ... it was at least forty eight hours straight so when you get into the second day of that you start to sort of hallucinate you start you start snakes is starting to lose your marbles and um\nYou know I didn't sleep at all and I'm going this is I mean I don't know what we did it for charity or something like that and uh and we were a lot younger then too but can you remind them if you if you've ever been without sleep it don't it it'll drive you crazy and I know some of you folks have they're going to be I Can't sleep now too\nAnd you're just not the same and it's not just a matter of being grumpy it changes your whole mental\nAttitude your mental outlook on things so it makes sense so he was saying that the day of course of left wing media they're pulling them but the big thing the Pooh poohed I'm about as he says you know ... why where there's ... and I feel like Superman\nOh my gosh you're talking about something is going to resonate\nResidents can you imagine as we've told you with a poll from last leaders let us let a part of August ... thirty six percent supporting the black community for Trump thirty six percent so what we're seeing now\nWith ... and that number and I'm not saying that number is because the economy I think ... is a reflection of that Tonya he's part of that thirty six percent Kanye gets it as far as Trump's concern along with thirty six percent of black America\nBut once you see somebody like Kanye coming forward and being so adamant and I think today the profanity notwithstanding quite eloquent and said in his position on this then you're going to see some folks saying well the economy has given us cover\nAnd then you see more and more people come out they're going to say you know years things actually are I mean this is about prosperity this is not about keeping people down or is not pitting one group against the other the Democrats are famous where that class warfare\nAbout race warfare a straight against gains transgender is against everybody transgender is against the world um\nYou name it I mean they love to pit one group against the other these people against the end it's just the darn thing you've ever seen because normally day to day
