with us on the Clark Howard\nShow Hi Katie hey there how are you doing good thank you for\nSure you are trying to figure out if a Roth IRA is a good path for you or a type of insurance\nActually I I eat out quite often we're not supposed to find out or not I mean it's all eyes are kidding until we are talking about stuff like that and she's got a little current that I've never heard of that by the fact that we're getting\nNicer we're talking about an index universal life policy is that what you mean are you al yes okay so I Am not an unbiased person to ask okay I Need to lay that out for you I hate universal life policies of all flavors\nI hate I so it's going to be hard for me to give you a balance dancer here so why did I tell you why I hate them and why I Love Ross and just take it as one piece of information that you can use to make a decision OK\nOK so when the Roth IRA let me first say why I Love it and we'll compare back and forth so with a Roth\nWith money that it earns is tax free\nIt's not some kind of odd ball way to maybe get a tax advantages tax free Ross IRAs if you go with a low cost company will have an all an expense often about or less than one\nTenth of one percent per year for the money you have been a raw\nOkay the universal life products will tend to have an annual expense of one and a half to two and a half percent\nSo they will be many many times more expensive and over the years the difference between those expense ratios is the difference between you going to work for years\nMore or being retire because you end up with a incredibly larger amount of money\nIn a low cost investment versus a moderate or in the case of a universal life policies are considered to be a a hide ultra high cost\nInvestment now as far as the universal I products like an index when they're promising is that you earn a percent of the gain of the stock market in years against but they you don't suffer a loss in the years\nThat that has lost his right so do you know that's a complete and total why\nNow\nTotally kids is I mean it's like if I were to tell you the moon is made a Swiss cheese I mean it it really is and it's really yummy nutritious as better tasting than the Swiss cheese on earth\nI mean that's about as equally true is somebody telling you that that's what an index universal life policy does that you get the upside no downside right okay\nLet me tell you why that's a big fat lie\nRight first you're only given a tiny portion of the actual gained the stock market has an a year and you don't get what in most years is the most important part of gains in stocks which is the evidence the insurance company doesn't give you any of those\nAnd then the downside protection so remember you only get a little portion of the up the downside protection requires that you meet dozens of pages of conditions in the\nIndex universal life policy before you are able to have ... what would be referred to as the safe harbor of no loss on your money\nBut it gets worse than that with the universal like policy [noise] if they failed or perform as the illustration you're given says you can get hit with what's known as the capital call\nWhere in order to keep the policy from exploding and being hit with a massive tax bill you have to put in more money at a time in your life you may not be able to\nOK okay the\nOnly people who ever make out from any universal I policy is the agent who sells it and the company that agent works for ...\nI I mean I mean I get upset when I talk about universal life insurance because I Need to tell you Katie I'm has so many people call me over the years who bought one and they get one of those capital call notices and they're like what do I do\nWant another like fourteen thousand dollars for me I have to pay it wind within thirty days or else I mean it's just\nRotten arrow gosh\nFight so then I'll tell you the last worst part of it the illustration that the insurance agent shows you telling me showing you how the money is going to grow and not just this guy is going to grow through the galaxy and you're gonna have wealth beyond your wildest dreams\nThey're allowed to make up the numbers on there and most states so they can sit down at the computer and put in whatever rosy scenario they want and then it'll say at the bottom in mice type for illustration purposes only\nAnd other than that you can tell I Love them right [laughter] raw\nTire lays on the other hand are very simple product you can buy them commission furry and I've got a list of companies that sell\nCommission free Ross but money grows tax free as spent tax free they're ultra simple to set up\nUltra simple to have an ultra simple to spend the money from\nOkay I think that I explained to me it's also a long term insurance is that\nYeah the insurance and them as a joke okay because when the capital calls come if you can't pay them you not only lose the policy have a big tax bill but there is no insurance either\nInsurance to protect your loved ones who buy something that agents are going to tell you about and its level term insurance we're all it does pay to your survivors in the event

more of what you make there was a study done by professor at the University of Texas Arlington and was reported on and one of those pointy headed journals about public health\nThey found that when you live in a suburban sprawl county\nWhere you are going to ... just under three years less than somebody who lives in a crowded urban core\nI ah this somebody doesn't surprise me at all I always thought it was because of the time people spend commuting for that time when you're sitting on your rear end and the car going back and forth being sedentary is what leads to the shorter lifespan\nBut that turned out to be only one\nOf the three factors that lead to a shorter life\nAnd that is a significant thing though is that is your commute is a time suck\nYou have cut out of your life for each time that you might have used to walk or bike or go to the gym or whatever and so again that's one factor another\nIs that if you're doing a lot of suburban driving\nAnd you're more likely to be in an accident 'cause you're driving more miles but your accent is likely to be\nHigher speed than someone who's in an accident and of course urban area and the U.S the chance of injury or fatality is significantly higher\nAnd then the third factor blows my mind I remember this one research study so there'll probably be another one later who disagrees with some of the conclusions of the author of this but the third factor\nIs that because of all the driving\nIn a sprawling suburban area\nThere's higher pollution than there isn't a core of a metro area\nI always thought that the corps was where the air was really dirty but it turns out that that's not the case and the dirty air is what can lead to shorter life spans as well\nSo that long commute can be costing your health and costing you

break even point try the five thousand dollars would be about four years now which it might make sense to have taken that deal\nAnd over the life of the loan if we go at a lower age I think in the end it would save us around forty thousand dollars which sounds great to me so\nHow do they want half a point more than market potentially so the only way you really know though is that ... point we're

pet straight now fairly heavily tell me\nI was just wondering if you have an opinion about whole homes surge protection\nOkay so I had the funniest thing recently I asked last time for this question came up I later he was talking to a guy who's an electrical engineer and I asked him about that and I said\nHey is this something you think people should do and he said no I haven't done it in my own home\nAnd I don't recommend that people spend money on it I said but what about the issue if you ... you know you have all these expensive electronics and homes now\nAnd he said well I just have the electrical engineer telling me this piece that I have the um surge protectors ... they're really robust ones for each important piece of electronics in my home so instead of doing a whole house\nDone the individual one and one electoral engineer is not you know and they'll be all the only answer you should do but it's really interesting that his reaction was so strong\nAgainst the idea of doing poll house I of no specific reason I'd say absolutely do whole house\nAnd it's a lot cheaper for you to think of it like zoning 'cause how many expensive electronics so you actually have in your house\nChanges it that average I was mostly concerned about like the the er appliances that's what I heard about you know your other than your washer and dryer that kind of thing\nI guess they could blow in a big surge in a house but that's not something that I've ever had somebody bring to the table\nOkay well it helpful to know\nSo I Can't tell you because you know this is we're stepping up a little bit out of my area will actually a lot out of my core area of expertise which is why when this came up before I went to consult someone about it and\nI are you being pitched by your power provider for by an electrical contractor [noise]\nNo no one's really patient I've just read about it and so I thought I'd try to find out whether this is worth worth the investment or it's not something I should worry about that I hadn't heard on anyone's saying about kind of protecting things individually so that's a different approach\nAnd how much is to have the whole house [noise]\nYou know I haven't got a call but my sense is when I looked at were between around two hundred and fifty and four hundred and fifty dollars if you had an electrician do it\nYeah but then you've got the electricians labor to\nThink that would include I think that would be I think\nThat we had to hold the slower than the last caller with a price so badly\nWrong the wrong then they probably got a quote\nYeah so I that's why I Would check to see what it would cost to just to see so much cheaper to just to the surge protectors protecting your key electronics at least that's what I've done in my

speech on the Senate floor where she said she would vote to confirm Kavanaugh\nAnd calling for an ounce man gave the nominee enough votes for confirmation and gave senator mansion a certain degree of comfort that he would not be the one who kept the deciding vote\nManchin says he hopes Kavanaugh will not allow the part is the nature of the process that has gone on for weeks to follow him on to the court I'm Mike moss\nA poor guy [laughter] okay\nWell there you go so I make Chester and Jeff may be related we've got to find that out because it was really bugging me well here's where we stand where you can call him I mean it'd be in Florida that were you when I think it yeah even in Sarasota new blades okay\nHere's where we stand folks we got flake either yes again Murkowski use or no and then we've got Collins there was a U.S and mentioned it yes and so that puts this is my calculations so am I correct me if I'm wrong on my map here\nBut if Murkowski is a Republican and she no mention is a Democrat and he's yes we're back to where we were\nWere fifty one but here's a here's the wildcard moves a\nSenator Danes and I'd never even heard of before today I was at the state wide thing I abstain Bain's but I don't know much about him anyway Ajmi walking his daughter down the aisle at her wedding and that'll be tomorrow but he's going to be back\nSinister early on trying to pick a procedural vote to advance the nomination and they did that already this morning and then the final compromise\nAnd vote possibly at five pm on Saturday will Danes told CNN Today but GOP leaders may be forced to hold open the confirmation vote for Kavanaugh overnight\nAs a senator returns to Washington from his home state where his daughter's getting married if I'd come back after the wedding he says it'll probably be early morning ah we're we're taking it a day at a time to see what happens\nWith a lay without another twist the world has mental mix proceeding confirmation process for capital\nSo it made me and they may hold it open till Sunday Morning but they're going to have to have a political technically have to have him well the point is if they don't have him it's fifty fifty and Mike Pence makes a tie breaking vote\nAnd I'm telling you the Republicans don't want to do that because then that's all we'll hear from now until they turn into is out Kavanaugh was never confirmed by a majority even though he would be the majority is Mike Pence Mike Pence's vice presidents serves as president of the Senate\nSo he's got ... votes so yes hey just as an exercise unless there's a tie\nBut he is constitutionally an officer of the Senate in ... votes\nBut that's not going to be good for the Democrat so but I here's what I'm suggesting to you finding Mitch\nMcConnell's taken all this into into consideration and I think he has maybe one maybe two other Democrats aside from mansion who are going to vote for this thing who are they going to me I couldn't tell you I Hope it's not Claire McCaskill you folks in Missouri\nShe needs to go down and if she votes against Kavanaugh this change she ... she votes for them is a change she survived and\nYou know she's just not much of a politician she may do this but then again she is also that much of a liberal but she doesn't want to hack offer base constituency so she sort of in a\nNo win situation I mean I got to tell you this I went to uh the gods now moving we hand\n[noise] way and Nick Searcy who's the um the right now and we went and Nick on what few days ago talked about this thing we have back on on friday you and I were talking about this afterwards Nick is very unassuming this guy's been and all sorts of stuff\nAnd this guy was in fried green tomatoes he was in the fugitive he was a sheriff and the fugitive they was in cast away with Tom Hanks there was a buddy at FedEx when they were here before he went off on [noise]\nUm he's been on a bunch of stuff he's on a justified which I've not seen that show but he's a big star on that you've been watching that having to justify the name of it\nAnd I haven't seen that I actually Simon ah there's a TV a dashing of lethal weapon ... which is a fairly good and he was in it that I'd I'd ... back to the day we had him on\nSo here he is you know he's telling us all I got a little part in this well he's the director of the movie and I got a little part in the way he got a little part is [noise] [noise] hey is Kermit God's nails defense attorney and he's the one arguing the case and a lot of this is a courtroom drama\nAnd by the way it's not rose is not going\nBut it is something that will make you think on so many levels I thought it was fantastic and I went in there and not knowing what to expect for one thing but again when it's an independent film you're always worried you know what's the acting going to be like dean king was grade a village the lady who uh escapes my\nMemory now who's the prosecutor she was fantastic I mean everybody in there and and Nick Searcy was fabulous so I mean everybody and they did a really good job but\nAnd there's no butts on that it's just it's not an abortion movie and I think that's what people are you know that if you're trying to get ... um it is it is a it's a murder\nInvestigation because what was happening was Kermit guys now this abortion is and and you know what I took away from it was this the political correctness that we're experiencing in this country for one thing Tom Ridge who was the governor of the time\nHad explicit orders or at least somebody from his office not to inspect abortion clinics\nAnd you can say well okay you know their reasoning was we don't want to do anything he was a river or Republican governor don't want to do anything that makes people think he's trying to stand in the way of a woman's right to choose yet they inspect nail salons and they have to be certified every year\nThey hadn't inspected this place in Seventeen years boiling Seventeen years\nWell you'll see I don't want to give out with this guy if you've read the reports and all this is true story obviously the guy killed\nA bunch of and we're not talking about abortion king of post you know people for their pro life say well they're killing babies it when it's sort of abortion that someone you argue for another day these were full develop born babies that he was birthing and sniffing the back of their necks and killing them\nCrying babies crying babies\nAnd this had been going on for Seventeen years without inspection because of the political correctness of the atmosphere of going we don't want to upset anybody because you know the thing that we're trying to take away a woman's right to choose\nBut once you see this is just unbelievable now I'm going to tell you a couple of things that he told us after the movie that I don't think gives away to mind I just want you to look for it when you see the movie because I thought you know they have really got some really good actors of this thing\nThere is a is a there was a picture taken a while they refer to his baby a as one of the babies that was born alive and one of the um the nurses working there one of the ladies on when she was actually a nurse\nShe took a lot of pictures of a lot of different things she decided that she wanted to take a picture of this baby and this baby was born alive and and ... and they'll kill the baby so she took a picture of this baby a fully developed baby\nThat Kermit guys now like killed or maimed abusing as evidence was one of the things that convicted on one of the counts of murder somebody telling you too much about it but\nObviously you know the guys in jail for the rest of his life because they committed murder this is just the way they got it and\nWant a mixture she told me the director there's a scene in the air wherever they are showing the picture a baby a to the jury right and this is in the movie and\nSaid those folks are very good actors I mean they you know you you really did a good job so she said let me tell you some of them we showed them the actual pictures that was the first time they'd ever seen it so this was not like I mean it was good acting but what we did was we said look\nWe're going to show you the picture of this baby and you just react naturally has you would I mean there were people crying\nPeople you know disgusted or whether it was just amazing and they pan across the jury as the prosecutor is holding up this picture of this baby and the looks on these faces was so genuine that I thought you know these are so many of these this is Oscar material they didn't say a word\nBut it was genuine because they were seen that picture of a real baby in a real abortion clinic for the first time and that's how they got that that's how he got mad\nEmotion from these folks anyway long story short it opens a week from today God's Nell the trial of America's biggest serial killer\nAnd I would suggest that you tell everybody you know to go see this thing because it's not like one of those things are going to be grossed out and it's all about abortion no it's a it's a murder it's a murder trial\nI mean you know you wonder why in the world OJ got all the attention and this guy nothing I mean this guy ... murdered multiple babies and I'm not talking about abortion so for some of your pro choice folks out there I'm Talking about somebody would actually birthday child\nThe baby is in this world and then he snaps their neck and kills him and they did this month the odd thing about this crazy guy as he was keeping with the baby seems keeping the bodies\nRoadwork already started on Florida Street near ... but it's about to get more inconvenient for drivers in business owners the entire
