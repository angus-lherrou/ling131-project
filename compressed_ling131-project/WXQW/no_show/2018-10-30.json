minutes before the hour and on first lied to Tuesday Morning Michael Toscano here along with Willie Nelson when his latest recording you don't like him vote him out and we're all happy to be together in a company where they trust her this morning call us at eight hundred and seven three six three six six six I tell us what you think about\nThis year it's very interesting what is happening this year [noise]\nAbout um forty four percent of U.S companies say that they're going to carve out time for their workers to vote this year because you know one of the problems with only voting on one day basically during daylight hours is\nA lot of people can't make it to the polls they work jobs they have kids that they have to take care of it they have all kinds of things to do and the only get one shot every other year or every four years to vote seems kind of like a precarious way to run a democracy\nAnd you know one day and it's such an odd lead time day the first Tuesday after the first Monday in the month of November why isn't it on a Sunday or Saturday when more people are off work and didn't get to vote why isn't it both Saturday and Sunday you know why is it not a national holiday you know\nMost of the modern democracies in the world I think just about everyone except the United states hold their elections on weekends are mixed election day a national holiday\nAnd uh you know once again we're behind are doing things and the vet two hundred and fifty year old way rather than the modern way so uh maybe if you work for companies like uber or Lyft or Tyson Foods or Patagonia you'll get the time off\nBecause your company's your stores are closing down that day on election day sort of all the employees can get to vote\nAnd I'm Glad that the companies are doing that but I Wish we as a society we're making a little easier to vote right now some thirty seven states\nIncluding those that in the mail ballots to voters\nAnd the district of Columbia let citizens vote ahead of election day now this has been a a growing trend back in Nineteen eighty about four million ballots are cast ahead of the actual election day last time out for the presidential year and twenty sixteen more than a forty seven million people voted early now that\nThe case for early voting for people who liked the idea of simple you provide citizens are more options to vote whether by mail or in person I had the election makes it easier for them to do so they can avoid long lines on election day [noise] um [noise]\nBut uh some say that well maybe if you do it early people don't have all the full information that they would get by paying attention to a campaign now I'm not sure what they mean by full uh information unless you're talking about what political commercials which have all the\nAll the informational nutrition of a grain of sand in them for the most part they usually just negative ads anyway with false information from both sides so you know where do you get your information from I Would think that by uh you know we could do before election you should have a pretty good idea of what candidate you like or don't like and if you want to vote\nAnd um you know and now of course there's been a backlash and it's twenty sixteen some legislatures because\nWhat they discovered after the election was that Iraq Obama's lead and many of the close states was made in early voting and he actually lost the vote that happened on election day and that of course makes the point that for a lot of working people having an only on one day during basically daylight hours is very difficult for some of those people who can't get to the polls\nAnd so some of the Republican legislature seventh trying to curtail early voting\nA especially on days for instance on Sundays when the black churches would ... would you know take their voters to the their parishioners to the to the polls but but you know where it seems to me that the more chance we have to avoid the easier that we make up their vote and especially now you know there's so many ways of\nDoing it electronically and with all kinds of ways of\nAh knowing who the people are and they're they're all voter ID laws and a lot of states which are which some people complained makes it harder for people to vote other people say well you know now at least we know who the person is so as long as we get make sure that we get those ideas to everybody you know get battle that's not such a bad thing where you have cases a lot of cases this year where [noise]\nThat is ridiculous it's immature behavior uh you know yeah he is on the ballot to some extent\nBut actually the Republican Party is on the ballot again as American veteran there's nothing more disgusting to me there's been a party that continues to try to make it harder for people to look to exercise their right to vote you should be ashamed early early\n... I mean you know both sides do have their um their issues with is especially with the gerrymandering which both sides\nOf the interesting thing about them early voting no is it does help ameliorate some of that it makes a ... I Know they're cutting back on it in some states where you do have early voting it does give you a chance to overcome some of the herbal some of those hurdles I Know in North Dakota\nOr the Republicans there have affected Lee disenfranchised the a lot of Native American votes because they they just put put through a law saying you have to have a street address now if you live on a reservation most of those folks don't have street addresses that post office boxes but now if you want to vote you have to have a street address\nWhere the early voting the tribes have organized to register people with a street address while they go through this process so you couldn't do that without early voting so you see that's a good thing ... and this is for both sides that early voting out without trouble from both sides\nYeah that's true but also I caution anybody's early boat that you voted early by suggest that you double check and make sure that they can let your boat\nThere are some places or the early votes are held until after the general election man and a baby ... if they're considered to become a factor then count them but as far as both sides\nDon't don't ah I beg your pardon the Democrats are not the ones trying to suppress the boat they're trying to get out the vote and the Republicans have to do everything I can just press a reason being is because I don't know about you but I don't want my pre existing conditions taken away from me I don't want a lottery I don't want\nThem to come after ... security and Medicare Medicaid if you want to make cuts he shouldn't get little white tax cuts to the richest people in this country so a lot buddy I appreciate your time\nThanks like let's go over to our Missouri Gayle in Springfield good morning have you voted are you excited\nYou know I have not for that or vote 'em on\nElection day I Am very excited about voting and now I'm a lifelong voter and I wish that they would that we couldn't change it showed that people could travel on a weekend\nAnd on a Saturday and Sunday and I also wish that more than about thirty five percent of the people in this country they're qualified to vote would get ...\nGet bad and going up\nSure we have one of the lowest of participation rates of all the other democracies but of course they do make it easier to vote by giving us more time or giving the voters they're more time\nSomebody had said that maybe we should be a good day to keep it in November would be to do it on veterans' day which is a holiday\nNow I'm a mixed feelings on that because I I like setting aside a day just for veterans on the other hand what our veterans known for their known for defending our rights including things like voting so maybe they go together I I'm not I'm not sure how I went to decide to go out they\nCould they could do if they could they could actually about making like a day after day before actually stay and make two days to honor the ... and we're going to allow people to talk but it really is a privilege\nTo be able to vote people die all around the world\nFor the right to vote\nAnd you can see when you when you see places where people are having a pre election spread the first time how excited they are and how proud they are and let me get tremendous that in this country\nAnd I hope this guy apple are hearing I Hope people are hearing you I Hope people are hearing those will think you know it's not important for me to vote doesn't matter if you're voting for President Trump or voting against President Trump the important thing is that you get

fine\nShe was fired by the political good for the Politico only because there was something of an uproar after she suggested that the president was involved in it incest us relationship\nWith his

person of course given mind or the real victim is and all of this it's her because after she launched these hate attacks people online predictably said mean things about her\nSo she and the rest of the news media Dunn published the the main things that people on the Internet said about her and now she's the victim again she's the victim of anti Semitism she's a girl and people are being made their associates victim she is she is the victim and she's the one who he throws the Molotov\nCocktails and sets everybody on fire with the death of jail and then she falls back to form and she is the

fired when I was there ... all this out and I'm Talking about the anchors\nOn air behavior that would have gotten you fired when I was there because when I was there was still something of a news organization now at ... outlets had a a liberal leaning at the time but it doesn't have a liberal leaning now it's insane it's an insane asylum it's a it's a loony bin\nAnd the politics is all you all

journalism\nAnd the future of CNN in journalism is fit hopes to have a future in journalism because it doesn't have a president in journalism and I got to get into a good deal of that stuff in the meantime you've got Hollywood going crazy all over the place she got Democrats going nuts and\nAnd they are and they're just I I I have a stack of things here\nFrom crazy actors talking about the revolution nuts coming and if Trump stays in doesn't that said there's gonna be a revolution if if he stays in power there's going to be a revolution is a Hollywood people\nCan a U.S senator a

people they're just you know ... ... ... the problem is news media people if you can call them that\nAsks the Hollywood people for their lunatic idiot uninformed opinions and then naturally since

actor now shut up and you just play dress up and make believe as the good lord intended\nVox has a news organization as well\nAnd again all of these things to to get to today there there are many things as is often the case print said it was on Laura Ingraham last night on the Fox news channel where he had a couple of good comments on talked about the fake news media and\nAnd uh they say and I

this whole enemy of the people thing is not language that I Would use or advise that my president or anybody is president years the president continues to use that he he now has narrowed it a little bit and says it's the fake news media that as the enemy of the people and that's good and ...\nAnd as opposed to just the news media that's fine now the news media than people like John\nBecause they latch onto it and I say hey wait a minute on the news media you're talking about me and I proudly wrap themselves and the cloak of\nThe fake news media that President Trump is referring to and and

first time caller thanks for taking my call\nWill great to have you here and you want to share with me something that is on a credit report from the time the dinosaurs roamed the earth\nThat is correct time preparing a everything for possibly a mortgage loan next year so\nAs I've learned from you ever get a free annual credit report every year and I downloaded that last week something stuck out on that report and had a dilemma about what to do so on my credit report is a credit card that live up parents opened in Nineteen Seventy six\nAnd I wasn't born until Nineteen eighty five so you know I was probably added to that credit card once upon a time as it authorized use or you know teenage or something like that so my question is too I get my parents were both me and authorize user of card or has that card\nActually been helping like credit over the years\nBut it may have helped at one time but at this point I mean here you are at a point that you are I'm thirty three years old\nThat's correct and thirty three you've established your own life you of your own credit you have your own history and that are being ... card listed may be irrelevant\nAnd as long as your parents are good payers it made me a little bit to the good and mayor better prior time really to the good\nWell that was what I was looking to understand you know it's got a twenty thousand dollar limit a average monthly spend on this card is about five grand and it's been paid on time for years and years and years so it definitely is in good standing\nAnd then we wouldn't even be\nAll right now for mortgage lender and the underwriting department said ooh Ryan you got too much available credit we're worried about that\nThat would be the point at which you would check with your parents see if you are in fact are authorized to use it could also be an error and credit reporting\nMajor listed and so that would be the only reason you would want to have it removed some times underwriters a mortgage lenders will say we don't like how much available credit you have to worry about it a new home you'll charge up everything\nAnd that would be why you would would remove yourself\nBut other than that leave it alone\nOkay very good so basically take action if they say that you know those limits are too large but do you see my score swinging of you know drastically if in fact I Do are moving in the

and um any of the hotel brands they want people\nAs hotel operators to pay them for being able to use the name and logo an operational systems and when people use third party sites they become\nLess loyal to the brand the reason people use third party sites is because generally they believe and most of the time they are getting a cheaper price\nBooking with a third party been booking with the hotel brands own website or reservations line itself so\nThere's this fight going on where the owner of an individual property or the manager of an individual property wants to get as much occupancy as they can and so they are\nOffering bookings through these third party sites to fill rooms that might have gone empty otherwise hotel chains are trying to do everything they can to get them not\nTo

mostly found out that it\nWas the immigrant will come in and file a zero nine to pin it so they went to pay the taxes that was kind of ... when they start doing their tax forms and then we started getting child support letters say in that money was being held back child support what the other person I bought the documents from\nYou know old backed out the taxes and then the immigrant what quit usually about two or three days later once we notify them that their money's going to be what the hell of a certain percentage of ... child support\nAnd interesting streaming the system as it

congressional\nCan find it on so at one time dot com under blog tomorrow morning starting at six [noise]\nAnd it's all about this nonsense that Donald Trump is dividing the country and that he needs to stop talking about the fake news because it's causing people to shoot up synagogues what a non ... won the world is talking about Jim Acosta CNN have to do with people shooting up a synagogue\nWell it has nothing for the people on the BS NBC who were blaming mark live in and talk radio Martin living by the way a Jew for the synagogue shooting and donned the lemon\nClaiming that conservatives are the ones to blame for all of this he says I don't see Democrats killing people [noise] so I I offered non lemon some examples on Facebook today and you can read and this is just a partial list\nOf course the guy who was the Bernie Sanders' campaign workers at work or the shot Steve skill lease obviously a Democrat not blaming Bernie Sanders for then the guy who shot to be all end all night club\nForty nine people dead registered Democrat voted in the Florida Democratic primary in twenty sixteen [noise] but it's it's the conservatives who are killing folks understand people there are not cases on the right and not cases on the left and when they do\nThings it doesn't mean that the people that they may be a barn and political party of are the ones that are culpable but when you have somebody like a Bernie\nSanders' campaign workers shootings thieves beliefs and by the way if safe Phillies and security detail it been hadn't been there he would have probably killed everybody on

when Trump says he's a national uh the means white nationalist\nFake news and Jake Tapper saying President Trump in Pittsburgh is an uninvited guest for many local leaders is funerals again for the victims of the worst anti Semitic attack in American history\nTo say that the president as an uninvited guest and American city is fake news the president is the president of the United states and go wherever the heck he wants to you're not an uninvited guest just because you've got an idiot who's the mayor of Pittsburgh and a governor\nWho don't want to be seen with um doesn't mean he's an

the rest of the\n[noise]\nPaul Ryan said something today that I thought it was quite interesting being the constitutional scholars ideas and here's what he said about birthright citizenship and the president by the way the president didn't bring it up\nI heard one of the miscreants on on cable say the president brings this stuff up to divide than a first of all he was asked about it he didn't bring it up secondly it's not about dividing the nation it's about upholding the constitution okay\nNobody really knows how birthright citizenship was instituted we've investigated this\nIt started in the sixties bureaucratic like the old ins\nStarted doing it that way as the bureaucracy does this all the time there's been no law passed that conveys birthright citizenship on to illegal aliens there's been no Supreme Court decision that definitively confirmed birthright citizenship onto illegal alien children\nNobody's a hundred percent certain how this came to be\n\nBut everybody seems to be a hundred percent certain that the president can't fix it so the executive branch unilaterally somehow somewhere in the bureaucracy decided to interpret this as it's being interpreted today nobody knows exactly who exactly what offers but there it is and so when the president is asked\nAbout it and says how did you find out about this yeah we're working on executive no you can't change the constitution by executive order what does the constitution confer birthright citizenship on the children of illegal aliens\nOf course it doesn't which all explaining a minute but here's\nThe current speaker of the house Paul Ryan who is silent for months but now he feels compelled to speak out go ahead\nWell you obviously cannot do that um you cannot and birthright citizenship with an executive order we didn't\nLike it when Obama tried changing immigration laws the executive action and obviously as conservatives um you know we believe in the in the constitution [laughter] you know the conservative I'm a believer in following the plain text of the constitution and I think in this case the fourteenth amendment ... pretty clear [laughter]\nUm and that would involve a very very low in the constitutional process\nThe ignorance on this subject like so many others is unbelievable the speaker of the house who cares not one went about the history of the fourteenth amendment not one where\nYou have so called experts constitutional experts professors former trial judges ... New Jersey who say the same exact same ignorant beyond belief illiterate when they come to the fourteenth amendment\nSo I decided let's play a little piece that I did in twenty Fifteen there were three years ago we can go back\nFurther but that's long enough to provide a basic foundation on understanding of what those who wrote the fourteenth amendment and ratified the fourteenth amendment actually meant that's got to cut Eighteen go\nAnd yet nobody did a better job of explaining this then professor Edward earlier who I've talked about over the years and he's a professor at California State University who was also at the er Claremont Institute senior fellow there for more than a evidence to me right\nAnd he testified before a subcommittee a Congress many years ago almost Twenty years ago and he set forth the case now he's not the only one professor Thomas west task\nOr Leno growl yeah has professor at the University of Texas law school but he's more than than the framers of the constitution\n\nA set forth that is a primary or the fourteenth amendment go ahead have after the civil war\nThree amendments to the constitution the Thirteen fourteen Fifteen called the civil war amendments and we know pretty much what occurred professor earlier was\nTestifying you said it's my considered opinion Congress has the authority under section five of the Fourth Amendment\nTo define the jurisdiction for the United states of the fourteenth amendment of course and did it as my contention that kind of was exercise that power on many occasions the most recently and immigration reform of control acts of Nineteen eighty six and I would say they also exercise that\nWith the illegal immigration reform an immigrant responsibility act of Nineteen Ninety six\nHe points out senator Jacob how are you are now going to know more than anybody else ladies in Germany you know one of the things I find when I signed books and it's good to do it because I get to talk to so many of you people say mark your show is different because you really get into the substance that we have fun don't get me wrong we do our thing too\nBut we do really get into the substance it's one\nThing to say yeah yeah yeah obviously the constitution doesn't provide that's not enough that's not enough\nSo when you're in a debate format or political format or classroom format or this format\nYou need to back it up and that's what we do here we back it up senator Jacob Howard the author of the citizenship clause in the fourteenth amendment he spoke he told us what he meant he defined\nWho would fall within the quote jurisdiction of the United states unquote\nReady quote\nEvery person born within the limits of the United states and subject to their jurisdiction meaning to states there just is\nIs by virtue of natural law national law a citizen of the United states this will not of course include all persons born in the United states for foreigners aliens who belong to the families have them ... or foreign ministers credited or the government of the United states\nBut will include every other class a person's it settles that Greg question of citizenship and removes all doubt as to what persons are or are not citizens of the United states this has long been a great issue and the ... of jurisprudence and legislation of this country\nMr call screener Mr producer you understand that right\nIs it not plain English is not as\nClear as can be that it does not include alliums that does not include foreigners that does not include families are within bachelors or foreign ministers\nSo the author of citizenship clause intended to count the foreigners alien to those boring to investors foreign ministers as outside the jurisdiction of the United states\nThat senator Jacob Howard he knew as his reference to natural law indicates that the Republican base is little are Republican basis for citizenship\nIs consent consent of the country you can't south and my great you can't claim jurisdiction because\nHappen to walk into the United states senator Lyman Trumbull chairman of the Judiciary Committee any powerful supporter of the fourteenth amendment\nRemarked on may thirtieth Eighteen sixty six that the jurisdiction clause includes those quote not owing allegiance to anybody else it's only those person\nI'm calling who come completely within our jurisdiction who are subject to our laws that we think of making citizens and there can be no objection to the proposition that such person should be citizens\nOf this was familiar language the civil rights act of Eighteen sixty six\nDefined citizens the United states has quote all persons born in the United states and not subject to any foreign power excluding Indians not taxed unquote\nNot subject to any foreign power it is universally agreed that the immediate impulse for the passage of the fourteenth amendment was the constitution allies constitutional eyes the civil rights act of Eighteen sixty

just conveying citizenship on the children of illegal aliens there's absolutely no historical basis for this there is no constitutional basis for this there's no statutory basis for this\n[noise] my buddy Andy McCarthy wrote a brilliant piece of National Review is they want to do and he said well the fourteenth amendment has been codified it was a Nineteen fifty two I think he said well that doesn't really in my humble opinion address the issue\nCodified in the constitution as a way of describing an aspect of a statute is really\nPretty a pretty frequent practice it doesn't really lend anything to the interpretation but we know what the authors of the fourteenth amendment meant because they told us we have no real Supreme Court decision\nAre conveying a citizenship on the children of illegal aliens\nAnd then we have Paul Ryan let's play cut six again Mr boosts Paul Ryan is saying that you can't change the constitution with an executive order who is changing the constitution it's the executive branch the president of the United states who is the executive branch checking back being Saudi do interpret and enforce the fourteenth amendment go ahead\nWell you obviously cannot do that um you cannot in birthright citizenship with an executive order we didn't like it when Obama tried changing immigration law Jean jacket of action and obviously you're\nNot who's changing immigration laws you know I brought as a guest here Daniel Horwitz who's an expert in this area as he is and many incredibly intelligent he writes so very conservative reviewer and a Daniel Horwitz

constitutionally illiterate I cannot relate to what these people are saying let's put this in plain English here basically they're saying mark I could break into your home kicked down adored drop a kid there\nAnd he has the right to live there for the remainder of his life and there's not a darn thing you could do about it even henceforth\nAt what they're basically saying is nothing to do with the president there arguing we can't even do this through Congress\nOr the reality is that even if we agree to that\nOcean of birthright citizenship that there is a legal mandate eighth floor requiring a Congress and the executive branch to issue a citizenship to any child of any illegal immigrant under any circumstance as the court didn't among Kim are a very active it's decision but let's agree to that\nThere is no way you could extrapolate that to people who came here without consent the key words are consent and sovereignty nothing ever supersedes that nobody could unilaterally assert jurisdiction\nAnd uh make it that there is nothing we can do to stop this and I think mark more broadly speaking what the disturbing trend we're seeing is that throughout the last number of decades past administrations have\nActually use the executive power to subvert sovereignty it looks like Trump is doing a lot of things executive valley but the details matter and what he's doing is actually pursuing the law and as you mentioned there is nothing in the statute requiring this and it all actually happened by accident\nThrough laziness and lax enforcement\nExplained that it because people are under the impression including the current speaker of the house who's taken an oath to uphold the constitution and some of these fools on TV who pretend they're experts\nThey seem to think that the fourteenth amendment says what they say it says now were originally this and that includes ... lists and you look at the language as intended as written at the time and they tell us exactly

it is and the most literal and physical sense as if you were standing outside of our boundaries in terms of access\nTo the court in terms of rights in terms of everything so literally you are not on our soil and and that is settled law so when Congress merely cut and paste the text of the fourteenth amendment and Nineteen fifty two they could've never fathom such an egregious argument that\nSomeone who is in Nineteen fifty to the constitution was not interpreted as giving citizenship to the children of illegal aliens\nExactly it's like saying prove to me that the fourteenth amendment didn't mean to mandate gay marriage will I mean no one would have thought that and and and that's the thing here what are the best I could see from my research is that\nFor most of our history we didn't have too many illegal aliens in the early part of the twentieth century it was in the sixties and seventies and eighties it started to grow and there was never an active decision what happened was because most people are born here who are born here are obviously legitimate citizens\nAnd we believe in birthright citizenship for illegal immigrants hospitals\nNever asked any
