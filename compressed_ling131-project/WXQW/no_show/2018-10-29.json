eternity in Seoul sought extra kidney from a safe spaces choir loft and escorted me out of the building that because they had not apprehended the shooter at that point shooting\nAs news that horrible news is that the details kept trickling in and and it was getting worse and worse and the numbers were getting bigger and bigger and uh the individual was taken into custody after being shot by police good guys with guns\nAnd uh and and uh my friend Mary and I agree that this is just this is just sickening that they that way we become to some degree or another a culture\nOf vultures that we have\nA cultural sickness at this point which means that when we see a tragedy like the one that we saw Saturday at the synagogue in Pittsburgh that you can almost feel the country chairing its fabric once again a part\nThat we see people who are rooting for it to be an A R Fifteen or one of the many\nRifles that they would like to ban\n... and others rooting hoping well gosh that it's a shot and gotten instead of an A R Fifteen style rifle it was in fact to an air fifteenth sat rifle that he watched him but he also had three\nA hand guns he had three pistols semi automatic pistols I think all three of them were glock pistol and a and he apparently used all four\nFirearms about when you see this happening\nYou know that you can just you can do the leg work for the media you everybody who's been around and paying attention for the last ten years knows exactly how this is going to go and it's become\nSickening it makes me sick to my stomach it as its stomach turning that\nWe see something like this happened and we know\nThat there are people running for their political quarters that there there are people on television who are looking for a way to blame Republicans to his at a here's where we go we hear there's a shooting it's a synagogue okay here's a Muslim is a radical Islamic terrorism\nIs that a a a an American terrorists as as a um a a a thought and obviously in this case since an anti Semite that's kind of something that you would assume\nGoing in is it a left wing anti Semite there is a great deal of that going on is that are right wing anti Semite it turns out it looks like a this guy is a is a big anti Semite about an hour how he feels about smaller government and lower taxes and all of that\nI don't know it feels about the constitution I Know that on line based on what I've seen is a very violent anti Semite and he went in and saying all Jews must die and began shooting elderly people and I honestly a man and his nineties who survived the Holocaust to being gunned down by this animal\nA ... and what you see that the the political camps immediately start ripping at pieces of this incident like jak holds like vultures\nAnd saying well you know gosh I Hope it's not this and I hope it's that I Hope it's the other guy and look I died been involved in this\nFor quite some time now\nBetween being in the news media with CNN\nAnd being on TALK radio I've been around this for a very very long time\nAnd I've got to say it's just a you know maybe I've had it maybe I've had enough maybe maybe it's um\nMaybe this is maybe it is and maybe it isn't but I did stop to observe and to lament over the weekend that this becomes just another political football to be ripped apart\nBy the various vicious ruthless mean spirited hate filled political factions who want it to be this and wanted to be that\nBecause that advances their political agenda\nAnd you know that the left these wanted it to be a righty and oh boy they got that there are very happy when they find it was already had an air Fifteen ding ding ding ding that's more points for their side\nAnd that's how this sick game as is played now the guys that Trump hating\nAnti Semite he's on line painting Trump all over the place Trump is controlled by those the Jews he's a big anti Semite so everybody is controlled by the Jews there's an international conspiracy it's all controlled by the jurors but then the new so he's a he's a nut case sees a fanatic he's an extremist sees a mass murderer\nHe is a a mass murdering anti Semite or all of that\nAnd and the news media\nThat that's the left they blame\nThey blame all Republicans that it becomes all it's nuts Trump's fault of course it's Trump's fault but not only is it Trump's fault it's worse than that it's more than that just seen Dan Rather over the weekend which actually I I don't think I said my stack Dan Rather tweeting over the weekend\nOr that it's not just Trump it's it is Trump's supporters too and I honestly this is the language of a very very bad things that's what we're seeing all over the place is the language of civil war this this collective blame game that we play\nThat it's the Democrats that it's the Republicans that it's right that it's the left that it's an and uh everybody\nWants to beat each other's throats all the time this started some time ago [noise] uh but it's getting worse and worse and where and what you see a tragedy I think we've just had the humanity beaten out of us to a large extent and\nAnd we have a cultural sickness that has that has left us too much to a greater degree a culture of vultures those vulture culture and it is and it's so horrible terrible thing to say that I see hacks\nLike Dan Rather who's tweeting over the weekend that it's it's you know not just Trump's fault hey said\nMass murder at a Pittsburgh synagogue now again the smoke cat and they've been cleared and everybody's running to their political corners here\nA killer targeting African Americans in Kentucky the bomb maker\nThe focus should not be only on Trump you say should rightly be on Trump\nBut there's more but all who excuse of bats or stand in silence while hates is stoked for political gain weight and Hillary Clinton with her deplorable thing\nBecause I you know these guys that these are Dan Rather is a mental case and they're too many people that are mental cases they used as Dan Rather is only one of them um and and he hears indicting\nNot just President Trump now again the smoke at including we didn't know what the guy's politics were when Dan Rather is waiting to set but immediately he leaves to the conclusion the illegitimate conclusion\nThat based on the information that he had lumping together this a black\nPeople being murdered in Kentucky the bomb

years young and she has decided to sell her home in time so\nShe has been lately on her own up to Ninety years of age\nUh killed just about eight months ago yes\nWow very impressive\nYes Mary I'm so play she she did with the proceeds from the house is not going to purchase another home she's going to continue living with me\nAnd so the money will be for the purpose of living expenses for her\nA living expenses or I'm not saying Kay she does need a care in a hat or hospital or nursing how\nOkay All right so ah and then ultimately but when your mom does pass away what are her wishes with these proceeds if they're not needed for medical care and things like that\nCan be divided among her four children\nOkay All right so I Would\nSay that at her age you've got to just play it as simple as possible because you don't know at what point she might need a some medical care and may need to be in assisted living or whatever and this is gonna sound so unbelievably conservative\nBut I Would put the proceeds into a simple savings account\nWally yeah because you told me that the proceeds from this she's really not going to need they're also going to be inherited\nBy her children and then I Would recommend something completely different I Would recommend investing the money and letting it grow 'til the time of her passing that hopefully you'll still a long way from now maybe she'll break the century mark\nAnd ... and then you'd be able to whoever the executor would be able to distribute those proceeds but in a case where you don't know if the money's going to be needed for her care\nYou can't really invest it\nOK correct that that's what I was worried about\nAnd so that's why the proceeds need to go into is simple savings but not at a traditional bank is should be in an online bank where right now you can earn about two and a quarter percent\nOkay and then the monies available as it's needed and if it's not needed then ultimately a it would be distributed per her wishes\nYet so nothing exotic here no real way and\nIf you go on to be a couple of sites you can see the best deals on online and savings accounts\nGoats a bank crate dot com go to go banking writes

show Hi John how are you can call ... or you great you want to talk about your daughter\nMy daughter is a theater student and we were planning our current going to community college we sleep changes she wants to go to the ...\nState college which costs about twelve thousand dollars a year without truly embark\nTwelve thousand dollar tuition used to be considered to be a giant amount for in state at a State University or flagship State University and today that's actually probably a little on the low side\nAnd a lot of states for in state tuition\nYes so that's all I Know that she wants to go to the state for the theater program you know I've been listening to you for a while and my concern is is getting a ... as we don't have enough to pay that every year for the next four years [noise]\nAnd it being theater and I'm more I mean my wife lost her to follow her dream and do whatever she why shouldn't more and a conservative side not want to hear to getting gas and and so forth after you know I listen to you and that's a major concern for me\nSo my wife was a theater major in college is an actress and loves every minute of it except for the fact that your income is so we're regular and you never know when you're going to be working because actors live their lives being unemployed\nYou know Sunni at one job when she does on the actress\nPart she wants to ... feet are designed like ...\nWell you know that signers are set designers if they break through actually have\nPotentially more stable income than the actors forming on stage but your concern is a valid one from a dollars and cents standpoint but if she borrows\nMoney for school let's just say she borrows just the tuition forgetting room and board country live at home is the university near when I was\nLiving at home and we plan on you know playing a majority of it but we won't be able to you know pay the whole thing\nWorse worse case scenario it's\nOut of all year\nHow much per year\nAbout four to five thousand dollars for a year per year for her to borrow\nThen we would relax as her father letter per se dream\nToday that's not enough borrowing to be a crisis for her if she graduates with less than twenty thousand dollars in student loan debt or west\nThat will not be a problem for her even if she were to face periods of under employment unemployment she'll just have to hustle and and and work part time doing other things but there could be a compromise is well I could throw out to you\nGot me more than ... [laughter]\nSo I Would say the compromise is that you ... pursue her dream she gets her major in the theater designed but she also gets a minor in something that is a practical thing that could be a fallback kind of position for ...\nIs Scott Scott so she said that she would go for communication is you know to make us happy so she will be getting a could double degree\nSo communications wouldn't make me happy because it's not something that specifically translates into some kind of clear career path or some way that she could fall back on for income I Would like somebody who has a little meteor in terms of something very different\nThan the arts arts degree that she'd be getting from the theater department\nBut and and having even a minor in something that is that is a good thing to fall back on whether she have any stem mind you know um computer technology data ...\nTony good with computers she's good at math but her passion has skater so\nI got out of ... so she had to do that is there a major and did some minor where she picks up we know ours and it could be designed a Web design something like that she had that would also be a skill that would help her very much get into a theater\nBecause they had those skills to\nHang on and so I I wouldn't want her to put her major energy into her passion and her minor in energy into something that would earn her some money and probably the two could work very well together\nJoe joins us on the Clark Howard show hello Joe\nMark how are you great thank you you're looking at becoming a landlord\nOr to fix our focus on there because I was always our school districts there on the services are so personal finals or what it says so much ...\nWhere you are nice to say that although there are lots of schools that keep experimenting with ways to teach personal finance to kids and it's hard because when I talked about or have you heard me at the very beginning of the hour that it's hard when kids aren't spending their own money to get them to really focus\nOn these things but as an adult you just need the skills and that's when people are more likely to really absorbent and tune out\nClearly you own any rental properties\nBut what I call ... or probably about five years retiring\nAnd one in college or I haven't ever ... actually protect a condo for her\nOwn trucker ran\nBack or whatever who is Aaron cater a\nBird like a condo that record for my mother and we've been taking our property of buying a common occurrence area we're ready to go after an hour for my uncle I ever pay a\nMother with her friend and that and if we were just there may be on the\nWell what you're saying has become very common people are doing just that where they're buying condos\nOr a house and their own kid manages a for them essentially and is responsible for going out and finding roommates and making sure the roommates pay the rent I think it's a great\nProcess for your your child to go through 'cause you're putting them is like I'm a business partner with real money at stake and over time\nThere's significant money to be made owning properties that are available to faculty staff administration and students near a college campus but especially because of the risk that a kid a may\nImbibe illegal substances or whatever your rental property there could be a you know fight at the property when there's too much drinking going on whatever\nI've always recommended that any rental property you buy for a kid in in a college town goes into an El Al see\nBecause you've got to protect yourself from the liability risk that could come with that property it is a more enhanced risk\nThe other experience people can share with you who own rental property by college campuses properties tend to get beat up a lot more than a normal rental cars there tend to be more people\nLiving in it then you'd have in a normal rental property so you have to really budget for more repairs overtime than you would with another property but owning one has worked out beautifully for so many people if you don't mind the hassles\nYou're listening to the Clark Howard show\nSeville Valentine's week days to ... ... ...\n\nAn official methods for Medicare open enrollment thin so now's the time to be open mind looking at everything prescription drug plans and Medicare Advantage plans competitive Senate blind because climate change so can you help me I found a lower cost\nArms extra benefits aren't saved\nMoney open to something better Medicare DACA will call one eight hundred Medicare today hoping\nThey'll look in to somebody paid for by the U.S department of health and Human Services [noise]\nAnd I can't believe that we're playing foreign for basketball with a barber shop 'cause then\nAll of a\nI'm meteorologist John ... are with the news by first alert dorms E.\nW.

never got it\nBut this guy had he just from way back\nAnd take it anymore I'm going in\nAnd so he kills eleven people would have probably killed more if the SWAT Team hadn't been so quick on the spot

a gun and these places because it takes to police for a while to get there and even if they come there in the first minute they've already killed folks\nThat was another thing I learned from the

stock would you buy so I Know how to avoid it\n[laughter] I don't want to say that you know I I seriously thought about this I mean Amazon is down twenty five percent\nAnd the last three weeks I'm going to be on or by some Amazon stock and then watch them go down fifty percent so I Can't imagine they would go down much more than I mean Amazon is yeah that's that's the you know along with apple one of the biggest ... companies in the world I Can't imagine\nThat they're worth twenty five percent less than they were three weeks ago\nA hard to believe but there's a lot of things going on and I'm sure people are shaky about the mid term fan because the Trump era we can have all the house and Trump can further and began to business will thrive and of course he takes over you know\nWell maybe not as what they're thinking maybe Amazon is so confident that the house is going to be taken over the Democrats stocks dropping ah they should love Trump actually\nYeah of course for free if you're a professional broadcast journalist for every\nSingle time we see the news conferences that fame operators bang bang bang bang or making but I imagine why on earth than all high tech age\nCan Trump now have a little Muslim Haitian made so that when Farah get on the spot like that we're not a good question but\nTake a look don't quit yeah let's roll let's say no\nAnd it just shows this would be I mean within three to four minutes you could just have this one after the other after that why don't they do that\nI Would do that and then there'll be a great idea and then they would accuse them you know of attacking the mainstream media but you can run one right after the other there's so many examples of it I'm just sitting in a couple but there's so many examples of of bias in the median things they'd gotten wrong and they've gotten the wrong on purpose\n[noise] absolutely what you said about um if she could say you know and this is the this is a one minute example of clips which you know we have sixteen clips on this is a very tiny proportion of it and here is another one minute equipped to the point you omitted and\nThey would go nuts when\nThey want and that I Want to

Trump said this that are that are supporting that are organizing this caravan and the main one is well below sit in front of us\nAnd Fox News I was listening today and they said that they have been banned from talking to what blows in front of this because they don't want them to talk to both in front of this\nSo they said that they were having a little news conference and a reporter from Fox News walked up and the end of the news conference admittedly\nSo Fox News is reporting on what what blows in front of us is doing they're the ones organizing all this stuff so as soon as Fox News shows up they scatter ...\nBecause they don't want anybody reporting that they are the ones organizing this this is a left wing socialist organization that that that doesn't um they don't they don't want borders I mean that's what that's the whole thing is about\nAnd when you have a news outlet that is actually covering them and showing what they're actually doing then they start running you go

she knew about the show 'cause they'd done research because they asked me about a gas they ask you about James O'Keefe\nAnd uh they started going through you know trying to tripped me up and they just couldn't I'll let you and so I got my side of it and ongoing well heck I'll let you hear no you're not going to hear I'll tell you\nWhat she was asking the question she was asking 'em and then you can hear my response to it and and when I stopped my hesitated when she's\nBreaking in and you can hear her but she's breaking in and you know trying to interrupt me and so when I'm sound like I'm stuttering it's\nI'm trying to talk over her or you know trying to get my point through so the first thing they ask me it was all this rhetoric from Trump and then you know all is it don't you think he don't you think he and his ... by ... number one\nIs that right yeah and the ... the number one says button OK and says\nYou think he uh he's responsible for all of this well I think the way he deals with the folks that are on the other side and then you got to understand that people attack him first\nI don't know any instance where Donald Trump is actually blast out of somebody on the first is usually a reaction\nA but when it comes to like Bernie Sanders he was saying that Donald Trump or the Republicans were going to kill hundreds of thousands of people I'm up by a by doing away with Obamacare a mat certainly a would incite somebody who is crazy I'm not saying that Bernie holds any responsibility\nBut I have heard nothing from Donald Trump that would indicate that he's encouraging people to violence\nOr you had Joe Biden the other day saying words mean things and Joe and Joe said Joe says from the podium or you know if if we were in high school I take him out back and beat the hell out of him so I mean he says words mean thing Joe what about those words\nSo I that day and asked me for only we have the the cut but I was talking about is that nobody was using\nHashtags Bernie shooter when they shot Steve skill lease and said well that's a point and [laughter] and I guess it is so this is the first one is number two says James O'Keefe and um they asked obviously they had done some research so this is what I start to realize what this is all about the thinking\nOkay we got this weekend as have seen from from Tennessee you know and he's an James O'Keefe on the in James O'Keefe assist incendiary character and so you know don't you think that ah it's deplorable what you should James O'Keefe has been doing with these with these undercover videos\nWell I don't think clearly must do a lot of what he does ah I think most of what he does his knew what the job of the mainstream media is not doing which is uncovering what's going on behind the scenes with ah with some of these people on the left um I I think there's a dereliction of duty on with people on the left of not\nWanting to find any thing wrong with people that are that they agree with so I think James O'Keefe those great work he's got undercover videos\nOr expose all sorts of things that we would never have known weren't not for his undercover work doing\nWell then she said but but one of his undercover people are\nPosed as a victim and that's just the parable absolutely deplorable that somebody would would pose as a victim when they're not really a victim of sexual harassment sexual assault do you do you condone that kind of activity\nUm I don't I don't know that particular instance I Would say that if you're going undercover Hugo undercover as whoever you're going undercover for the sixty minutes used to do it all the time they\nThey send people under covered that had been swindled by different people and they weren't really swindled going undercover to catch the swindlers so yeah I mean you you play the part when you're going undercover to try to find out what they're doing and I think that's what he's doing\nSo I didn't buy you know the defendant James okay if he's been on the show many times and\nYou know if you're going to go I mean this thing to do this with seeing operations from the police all the time you go on to cover as a prostitute but you're not a prostitute\nYou go undercover as a drug dealer but you're not a drug dealer if you're gonna go undercover you do undercover as somebody that you're trying to catch the other person and that's what exactly James O'Keefe has been doing now the other one that says to the says rhetoric\nUm then she was asking me about all the little rhetoric out there\nYeah and you've got Eric Holder who says when when they go low we kick them I mean so you know there's rhetoric on both sides I Do agree that that needs to be tamped down a bit\nBut when people say well he he needs to stop going after the the news media\nAre I think that's when you start to squelch free speech I mean he has a legitimate beef for the news media\nWith a lot of stories that they have gotten completely wrong and I think probably on purpose and so when he goes after the media\nAnd there's some crazy guy out there with pipe bombs it does it means you stop going after the media anymore than it means that anybody on the left just stopped going after Trump if somebody were to threaten Trump and you know we've had several instances of people breaking into the White House and breaking into the White House ... alone in that area\nAnd nobody says all we gotta we gotta calmed down on the left so nobody will harm the president\nOr they just keep right on going way up Steve ... shot they keep right on going I think if we're going to have some\nBalance here it needs to be that the Republicans and the Democrats need to come to terms on\nWhat are the rules of engagement here and I think when you call for violence against somebody that is going up above and beyond what you should be doing\nBut I think on both sides for the most one yet Maxine Waters calling for handing people in restaurants in gas stations in anywhere you find them and I think that's bad rhetoric to so let's start condemning all of them and go\nSo she says well I did she says I refer to what we do and and and what he refers to as fake news as the fact based media and then she went on to something else and asked me some other question I just I couldn't let the fat and mace media go\nWell I mean before you go any further on the fact based medium and Paul Krugman said the markets were plunging after the election and twenty sixteen he had to retract that we had Brian Ross thing that a Trump asked Michael Flynn to reach out to the Russians during the election and he had to retract that we had we had the whole CNN with the carpeting\nWell they I think it's more the mistakes I mean whether or not but Paul Krugman and certainly not what CNN and the ... story with the Japanese when he was ... bring the food in there and they had the video showing that the uh the ... the prime minister of Japan of just done it just before Trump so he was just following his lean they tried to make him look like a buffoon\nThere's a lot of that going on out there and the so called fact based media\nI've often said to my show that\nMedia bias is not necessarily what they tell you is what they don't and there's so much being omitted so if you want to know from my standpoint of how we rectify this must tell all of it was still the whole story I mean I listen to you guys on NPR from time to time\nI watch um [noise] CNN from time to time I follow all these people I tried to of course I got my own slant on things because obviously I'm a commentator and not by journalists but\nYou watch Fox News you can watch CNN and you can get the whole story that way I Would love if there was an outlet out there that\nActually put all of the pieces of the puzzle together so that we can get the full picture\nOkay Mr Valentine thank you so much for your time and that was [laughter] so she was trying to get me to say all sorts of different things that I wouldn't say and I just you know I just couldn't front or what the facts I mean she's time of the fact based media and I laid out you know I have tons of examples if you want to hear him I don't know how long you wanted to do this interview but you know\nWe got all day I can run down all of them if you want me to and it's just it's ridiculous I'm so she did to me at the end of the day there was they didn't get any meat there you know they were they were going for something where they could make some money some hick from Nashville\nLook bad and making them say something and I just wasn't going to say it you know they wanted me to run from James okay first start around that I didn't run from James O'Keefe we wear jeans okay for them before anybody would have him on\nWe used to have him on he used to come to us before we got real big and goes to Fox they launched this stuff they used to come to us and we would talk about his videos before the day before they came out or two days before they came out and we still have him on from time to time but James ... busy guy\nSo she wanted me to condemn gee you know James O'Keefe somebody when you give the example of sixty minutes is a perfect analogy sixty minutes was doing investigative journalism and they would go on to cover as victims of all sorts of victims of fraud victims of\nYou know I don't know who knows what\nAnd you know back in the days especially when Dan Rather was doing sixty minutes oh I remember it was some of the best television I've ever seen some of the best investigative journalism they would find new car repair shops that we're screwing people over and they didn't really have a screwed up car they just went in there and acted like a victim\nWell that's what you do you you pose as whoever you're trying you know that you you you pose as debate and that's exactly what James O'Keefe does\nHe think he's going to get any undercover video if it goes in and says hey I'm from James O'Keefe organization from project Barrett toss where big right wing organization wants to see if we can catch you say in something stupid no you go in there as one of them are\nYou going there as a sympathizer of them and then if you say well you know I was a victim of sexual abuse and so and so and then you get them and then you get 'em to loosen up and they start talking and that's how you get your best stuff you don't go in there and announce who you are you\nDid anything nobody does that and it was investigated Europe but as I pointed out to her James O'Keefe is doing what you folks won't do he's doing what the mainstream media is neglecting to do which is to get the story\nBill Nelson faces a challenge from governor Rick Scott in one of the most expensive and closely watched Senate
