she can me be clear\nThere still are right now the future to her shouldn't be abundantly clear I Believe that's true and and there's another fun thing Hillary Clinton claims that she has somehow for

you're trying to get your spending to where you actually know where everything's happening and whereas going is that right\nThat is and how are you thinking of doing that\nWell I used to you than all below system and\nI think out of state so getting money out of the ATM charge fees my bank does repay those but it's just three hundred dollars you know three hundred dollars hundred dollars that's really hard to do the outlook for sure\nSo I was looking at their civil apps out there that offer thought the same thing all the choir or gas for account information\nYeah and they can't work without that um any in particular you've been looking at it and see if I have an opinion on an app or two that you're looking considering\nI looked at a to a good budget and al ... [noise] I think is the way you pronounce that I\nDon't know good budget but I did talk about envelopes awhile back and they operate they did operate on a premium business model let me see if they still do where you could have the basic version for free yeah so you still have the basic version for free\nAnd then there's a a more expensive one that gives you some more capabilities but most people\nWould be likely happy with what you get with the base free version they have a really fancy one for people who feel out of control\nAnd it's where they coach you actively and how you're handling your money but if you're just trying to organize yourself and do it in an easier way electronically I think envelopes would be a good way to do it and so here's the thing with giving up the information you have to give up\nCharles any time you give a connection to your accounts to an app a website whatever there's always risk but the risk level\nIs a possibility where the benefit level is a certainty so I think in a case like this\nI feel comfortable with you using this and giving them the information that they have to have in order to help you actively on below pure wife\nRight

area to stay safe\nRight so the cloud offer some protection beyond whatever anywhere laptop flood\nOkay 'cause there's no they stick your information is all Web based so there's nothing for someone to come and put a virus on your computer\nAnd access everything on the computer which is why chrome books are so much safer that's why school systems have adopted them so heavily\nNot just because

levels come and go in waves and in popularity and the idea is always the same it's a belief that this one is different but this product Weiner services the greatest and that is the fastest growing multi level since blah blah blah\nIt is a legitimate multi level what are the chances you're going to make money well\nIn a survey done by the website magnified money dot com\nThey talked with the survey over a thousand multi level marketing participants and when the computer but Mack the average participant was earning less than a dollar an hour working in a multi level not\nThousands and thousands of dollars and no free cars and all that\nAnd\nHalf the people earned\nLess than five hundred dollars and the last five years in the multi\nLevel there are so many women who got into the

problem is you're flushing your money right\nUm they're not applicable in this\nIn this controversy for instance section Eighteen US Code Fifteen oh three\nWhich broadly defined the crime of corrupt Lee and bring to influence obstruct or impede the new administration of justice that's on the bus provision however is\nMost properly used for judicial proceeding such as grand jury investigation and the Supreme Court as narrowly construed that provision there's also a teen us cold Fifteen twelve sub paragraphs see you all know about when you probably read that last night\nThen you know it makes it a crime for any person who corrupt plea or otherwise obstruction influences are him teams any official proceeding or attempts to do so\nBut this provision has been narrowly construed as well on the underlying code and the need for some official proceeding mothers should be fully aware of that problem since his principal deputy Andrew Weissmann was responsible for over extending that provision in the jury instruction\nThat led the Supreme Court to reverse the conviction and the Arthur Andersen case in two thousand five so\nChances are Muller is fully familiar with how far you can go with that\nAnd it does not include going after ... so in other words\nThe earliest saying these and other provisions simply do not make for a compelling case against Trump\nWhile Trump has shown breathtakingly poor judgment in firing Khomeini and publicly attacking investigators\nThat's not obstruction moreover Trump at independent grounds to fire combing putting many of the reasons cited by Rod Rosenstein and scathing criticism of called me and twenty Seventeen put simply this is not what an Obama looks like so\nIt looks like we're nearing the end of this investigation my question on this is will it come before the November ... elections are\nProbably not because I don't think Mueller wants to look like he's painting the elections either way I Would think that it probably would not come before November six but it looks like it's coming soon and I would think probably shortly after and you can write this down folks shortly after the November elections\nTheir flag and the tape and they're just on\nA shortly after the November elections Mueller's going to have some sort of conclusion on this whole Russia probe and what's going to be interesting is is probably going to amount to nothing\nAnd further interest is this a lot of folks on the right who have been just chewing this guy on one side and others are going to bail him as a hero [laughter]\nMonitor water and and what integrity this guy has\nI mean he went through the whole process that is due diligence and then there was nothing there and was man enough to admit it now I had been very careful about completely trashed and the guy I go back and forth on what could be going on behind the scenes I think that it's unseemly\nBecause you've had Muller and wrote Rod Rosenstein and combing working together before and it didn't turn out too well written column on then but that's not to say that that's necessarily what's going on here\nWe will just half this heightened ways I guess and see what comes up with\nAnd if he comes up with some trumped up if you'll pardon the expression charge against the president that I guess the president's going to have to deal with that but there is no\nCollusion obviously and then the left he's from a look at all these arrests they may look at all these indictments diamonds for what\nFor Manafort for tax evasion or whatever for I'm\nMike Flynn for a supposedly quote unquote lying to the FBI even call me said that was stupid to go after him on that it was a technicality they were trying to catch him on which really didn't have anything to do with any kind of collusion what about um uh oh what's his name Papadopoulos yeah what do you\nGet like three days in prison or something for lying to the FBI and again that was not lying about any kind of collusion it was lying about what he had had what kind of relationship he'd had with the Russians\nThey can't paint a thing on Trump 'cause it's not safe thing that you folks can you not just come to the conclusion\nThat Hillary ran a horrible campaign that it it was hers to lose and she lost it but\nShe did not realize that she could get out flanked in Michigan Pennsylvania Ohio and Wisconsin she thought she had those in the bag and who tried to tell her that I tried to tell her I tried to tell she she's leaving her back flying on a noticed and unguarded\nAnd and then Trump came within cleaner house well that's exactly what happened and I tell you I thought\nFor the world during the last week of the campaign that Trump and his people lost their mind what are they doing in Michigan what are they what are they doing in Pennsylvania where the ...\nBut they knew they were in striking distance and they knew in order to win they handed when one of those along with Florida and they felt like they probably had Florida in the bag it was an interesting gamble on their part\nBut it was an equal equally interesting gamble on Hillary's part but it was all ... election theatrics it wasn't anything to do with Russia\nYou know last night [noise] matter of fact we have any of the\n... we got the cuts that we send to their Luther on the on Trump and sixty minutes because last night we'll get to those at the moment\nIt was interesting because Leslie stall just try to bend them on all sorts of things and she asked him about the Russian collusion with the rest of and they said well China's trying to interfere too will play that for you in a moment it is interesting\nAnd I told you all along you know China is our biggest enemy but nobody and here we have now the department of homeland security saying folks China is trying to screw with the mid term elections and\nThe left out there called please come on who wants to believe bad do you expect us to believe that\nWell you're the ones who are crime that the Russians were trying to metal and they were they didn't successfully but they tried and I can guarantee you in twenty sixteen the Chinese were trying even harder\nBut everybody wants to focus on Russia because they made that narrative right Trump and Russia collusion and nothing there and I'm just telling me between now and Christmas I think Muller lets us know

accomplishment which has been the than the you know the renegotiating NAFTA getting Mexico and Canada on board for a different kind of deal\nI mean I I'm a little bit skeptical of how much hand he had an anyway he had two people or to advisors who are very experienced in this I'm working with him along side and he I Know that he gets a lot of credit for it but I think that\nUm I think that we should look at what was going on with the other two advisors\nUm and then but the other thing is and and I think the main thing that that is so overlooked is that his the personnel knows that he's he's been response reportedly been responsible for it in the White House ... it's been you know ... basically leading the White House straight to hell\nI'm and everything is going wrong if we can basically talk of the entire more investigation you can think I'm Christian for that because that\nThat happened because of a firing James Comey what's report the the the wall Street Journal reported that that was him they wanted that thought that was a good idea he thought for for whatever reason he thought the Democrats would like that\nUm and obviously that wasn't the case so just looking at looking at his actual track record what his resume that says so far about his time in the White House it just doesn't look too good and I think that I think the conservative media in particular wants to start paying attention to that\nYeah well so I I I've always seen him and his wife is sort of I don't know I mean I don't want to be too cruel but I mean or or to um I don't know\nAbout him but they seem to be big lives in the middle of the Trump White house and they're the ones who keep trying to pull him away from really the engine that he wants to do or you sensing the same thing\nYeah ... especially when you're talking about um to some extent the wrong guy I feel like she's more like painting on the wall than anything else I don't know how much of it and pull and she actually had because I I think the one thing that she was really pushing for was the um parental paid parental leave room uh I don't hear about that going anywhere but they're um\nThe the things that cautionary it looks like he has his hand and a lot more things um and then and yeah I think you're right there's a lot of it somewhat I don't want to I don't want to use the word distraction but in in the sense if you're just talking about what the trumpet agenda was it is I think the other thing was um [noise]\nWhat is it in a prison reform I don't remember that being part of Trump's you know I don't remember them shouting a chance of prison reform\nAt Trump rallies when they were lock her up\nTo a different kind of what you're saying that she is long ago\nHas chosen some things that that we're not on his agenda that she may maybe can sink or deeds into mid don't to\nPut her at odds with her father\n[noise] uh well I don't I don't see her I don't hear about it rather than the media or from her um directly about about particular positions that she's pushing\nWhereas you do hear about um other than the like I said the the paid parental leave and I haven't heard about that a long time now but other but you but otherwise you actually do hear about the two of them together\nAnd making decisions on the White House bringing in\nI'm Anthony Scaramucci with apparently they're move out obviously didn't go so well so um and and bringing a Mike Flynn and that was that was I think hers mostly I think the two of them together but the report that I read it I think that goes back to the Vanity Fair or was that she was the main one who basically asked them what job do you want to tell us what job you on\nJust completely be overtly demographic journey or anyway but I mean just to say so on the for okay screw it we're all Democrats we got you know you remember this call you right before the election and twenty six team that\nCan never remember the gloom where his name but it was a columnist for the New York times and he says All right we got to drop any pretense that were journalist it's time to take the gloves off we got to make sure this guy doesn't become president ruined and a lot of these news outlets followed\nWhat was that we had just a few a few was several weeks ago whatever was when they all got on the bandwagon oh yeah yeah yeah\nTrump says that the ah\nThe media are the enemy of the people and they never said such a thing he said the fake news is the enemy of the people\nYou notice he doesn't call Fox News the enemy of the people he doesn't call the Daily Caller the enemy of the people he doesn't even call roll call ...\n... he talks about the New York times CNN BS NBC and they are because what they're doing is they're posing\nAs legitimate news outlets when they're actually a propaganda arm for the Democrats and the liberals\nSo what happened we had one of these outlets call for a day of editorials remember then we're going to have a day of editorials on a Thursday where everybody is opposed editorialize about how horrible is that Donald Trump has waged war on the media\nAnd they all did it\nThey all did and they all live the they\nDidn't tell you what he actually said they told you what the talking point was\nThat he said that the media are the enemy of the people who never said that they said the fake news media are the enemy of the people\nSo we know where they are and they tell us to look at this out of the other\nOne the interesting thing is is it Trump in his sixty minutes interview last night with Leslie stall was able to dominate that conversation she tried to and look they have the luxury of editing too and they couldn't there's no telling what it looked like had been wrong\nBut even edited\nTo their advantage trouble at like he just absolutely took her to the woodshed she's trying to say this that and I\nKnow he's pushing back millennia Trump\nDoing an interview for twenty twenty sane thing pushing back well what about your husband's infidelity I don't this is a structure and I'm not I don't even worry about that kind of stuff I'm not you know she just doesn't let them get under her skin\nAnd now she's handing out water a day in North Carolina and Florida and places like this I guess Florida Today\nHanding out water to people that have been devastated by hurricane market say one thing about that too before we run on time because I Know a lot of you folks down there in Florida\nOr listen to the show I Hope this is a lesson the some folks not even a hurricane mark will stay put for a\nCategory for hurricane I don't think you'll stay put for category three when they tell you to evacuate you better evacuate 'cause I don't understand why people stay around there is nothing in my house to me is worth dying for\nNot ... and my kids like putting them in the car and take them with me there's nothing worth dying for yet we have the death toll is probably going to go up when they start digging\nThrough the rubble and find out how many people stay there and it was like a bomb going off and your house you don't stay when there's a category three or above don't stay in your house when it's coming through\nAnd I know the part of that problem is the news media hype and they always hide all going to be the worst because Al Gore says and they're all going to be getting more frequent and more deadly and all and so it's it's sort of like the boy who cried wolf but one thing you see it and just offshore and it's a category three or above\nMove get out of the way\nAnd it's a shame that I think probably most of the deaths of what they all have to be\nOr people who refused to leave weren't they I mean nobody got killed by the hurricane when they weren't there for their again so apparently the people who died died because they said don't say it's not worth there's nothing in your house is worth it [noise]\nOh my goodness oh grand piano that my grandma getting me it's not worth dying over there is not one thing in your house is worth dying over so when they say this is going to be a category three or above ... you can always come back if it was wrong you can't come back if you did\n[noise]\nUh\nOkay gang so chances are they'll never be an emergency ever ever again rely just in case let's talk about a plant or pain so who's going to do what anyone uh yeah OK perfect we'll figure it out as we go so who is going to grab the go back\nGo back and it is a factory farms that it's filled with things we really were really needing in an emergency against me want to have to\nAbout it that die good point so are we all know who to call if something happens then right\nI have to ... that in fact can and I tried to call have you read current governor of Palestine dad found no dad matter and without Syria will be killed ... [noise]\nYou know this is great I Am so glad that we don't have a plan\nWing is not an emergency plan to make sure your kids know what to do during an emergency who to call me wanting to visit ready done gun slash kid gets that information public service announcement brought to you by the Miami had council [noise]\nYour news source for news and information six sixty got when you were executed you

Huntington each kid sources that it was the ... gone wrong or perhaps they were intending to try to get a flood all hang out in the country\nIt looks to me like the Democrat is losing ground no I haven't seen the Santa's going ahead it's probably too close to call this point\nBut that's another one that told me to look at and I'm looking at it and what I see is it appears to be a trend it appears to be that\nThe Democrats are trending down and the Republicans are trending up am I going to make a prediction for November ...\nSix oh no no no no no\nBecause I learned my lesson they because they need to you said well I I say on the best information possible I'm not telling us that's going to happen and then people can you blame me when somebody doesn't win is my fault no I'm just telling on the best information that we have\nBut right now it looks like it's trending toward the uh the Republicans I'm trying to talk to you and grab another this one box nine hours of vox is far left so we'll see what they the Thirteen most important governor elections in twenty eight team\nAnd Florida happens to be one of them\nAnd say my main out on them you can see where they got ... latest maybe they got something in the October I Can't imagine they're on pope this than real clear politics doesn't have anything\nAfter September twenty seventh I Can't imagine that there's not something after that oh let's see what Scott Walker coming\n[laughter] who can who to them and we don't care\nUh Ohio I don't think we had any polling data they're just giving a rundown of who's who\nSo if we can get the latest from the polling data how red and green swung okay yeah peace something that may help the Republicans and certainly\nA Rick Scott is how they handle this thing with with the hurricane that's always that's always a big meal that I mean people go OK if you're going to be one of my elected officials had and you do you know how'd you do handling this\nOkay\nHere's one that listens to channel seem to think this is amazing now you folks in Florida may have seen something but I'm looking at the latest polling I don't see anything in October this is a huge deal it's a big deal and it's\nNot only polling data for October for crying out loud we're in the middle of October this is a oh come on there's bound to be\nWell when I'm totally the latest I saw\nIs that it looked like it was trending down for the Democrats will see how it turns out of course if the Republicans lose ... it's not the end of the world although I think any time a Democrat takes over

it's a New York times\nAnd that's the only polling operation I can see this polling in that district I'm sure they got some internal polls with the campaign themselves but um you know as far as that's

I've told you this long\nWith Kanye and the black community too when when you start hearing this ah I'm not crazy about Trump much and I think you're hearing them with a lot of folks out there they're going\nYou know All right let's just let the guy go I told you this the other day I'm Talking to\nSomebody I Know some of the vast staff here I was talking to somebody who was not a they hadn't been Trump brand they become a Trump fan but they were not a Trump fan the main reason they weren't a Trump fan is because of that Access Hollywood tape\nAnd so we're sitting there talking about it and I don't even know that he realized that\nThis but as he's telling me about the whole thing and he didn't really ginned up and excited about everything he's using some very colorful language\nNow what if I took a a a secret tape and I don't I never do that but what if I were secretly taping our conversation and just happened to send it to his boss or send it to his board of directors or whatever and say listen to this languages guy was using\nAnd I'm not saying something wrong with I mean this is the way a lot of guys talk and some ladies to when I Do believe these but some women talk\nIn private and it was the same thing I was thinking too you hear yourself because you're using this kind of and it wasn't you know like ... or whatever\nBut Trump was saying that not ever thinking that anybody else was listening other than Billy Bush and never dreaming that was going to be made public have you ever said something in private that you would cringe if somebody outside the conversation with the other person you're talking about ever heard it well that's the whole point\nAnd this guy is now a convert to Trump\n[noise] it was ironic that that kind of language was what was upsetting to them and I remember the time and go I was shocked\nBut then when you stop and saying okay Phil if you're ever so well I've never seen anything quite like that but there's no telling what Johnny being I say I know John ... himself or Johnny B and I say privately that if it got on the air\nWell we would go oh sorry [laughter] but that was meant for the air\nWell that's the whole thing between the Access Hollywood tape which I think was probably the low point of Trump's whole campaign and political career well I don't know Stormy Daniels\nYou know comes it's a tough one although the story that he keeps denying that but I mean this is something that we heard right that we could put our hands well a bad choice of words I'm that way because it was something tangible that we could listen to and make a judgment call alone\nAnd I think when we do that we go oh ... well at the end of the day that could be anybody couldn't it I'm not saying that it's a ... it's like the Shiite\nWhole comment about the countries I don't know where they said that or not\nBut people like um oh what's his face the art form are and see Michael Steele the ... it was among yeah Michael Steele\nAll upset about that\nBut he would refer to some of these poor nations the Shiite holes well that's what they are now you don't say that out in public but he didn't\nIf in fact he did say this this was to a choice few people sitting around in a meeting about what to do about poverty in some of these places and sending money and throwing good money after bad and the rest of it\nSo he's just he's just telling it like it is and most of us would agree and as you look back on these nations that he was talking about\nWell he was talking about some of the nation's in any actually means all of them that he mentioned we're in the top twenty\nOf Shiite holes from from the list of she idols for the UN they don't call it that is the poorest nations on earth and they are dumps\nAnd and Donald Trump was talking about them they are safer Michael Steele to get upset about some private conversation but I think all of this\nIs blow is blowing over and people looking in the economy and the going you know

to be the CIA [laughter]\nAnyway they want me to talk about tax cuts the economy now trades or for the rest of it and I'm going to tell them what I'm going to tell view\nAnd that he is when you lower taxes you're going to stimulate the economy of this happen every time it's been tried and it works every time and every time the liberals\nAre trying to tell you this is gonna be horrible because you're just given a tax cut to the rich and I'm going to really so we have this story debate ladies and gentlemen let me start off with the headline top three percent of us taxpayers pay the majority of income taxes and twenty sixteen\nThis is from Bloomberg\nYeah this is not some right wing bill top three percent of us taxpayers pay the majority of it and so it means more than half let's just stop\nYou don't even have to go we will go further but we don't have to do for the man for you to tell me that the rich aren't paying their fair share and the top three percent are paying the majority of the income tax tell me how that's not them being there more than their fingers\nYeah well this is what the liberals do but this dog again hunting anymore because people are looking at us and going this is tired old rhetoric from the Democrats\nWe know better we know better than when we got the tax cuts yeah the corporation got guts\nBut they also created jobs they gave bonuses they gave raises all of this came up so the Democrats are still trying to tell you this is kind of me don't look at it don't look at it I Know no no this is just a big move your imagination you only look at it because this is horrible take our word for it it's really horrible I Know it feels good\nBut it's like a drug they got you drug go where they have a GOP that's a GOP drug they've got you it's really horrible and it's not it's absolutely fabulous let's go through some of the numbers here individual income taxes\nOr the federal government single biggest revenue source and fiscal year twenty eight teams which ended September thirtieth\nBut individual income taxes explaining to bring in roughly one point seven trillion or about ... excuse me half of all federal revenues according to the congressional budget office if past the statistics can offer any guidance\nAnd twenty sixteen one point for four trillion dollar income taxes were paid by a hundred and forty point nine million taxpayers reporting a total of ten point two trillion adjusted gross income\nSo what does this look like well here's how it breaks down the top one percent\nPay the greater share of individual income taxes thirty seven forty three percent and then the bottom Ninety percent the top one percent payday greater share of into individual income taxes and then the bottom Ninety percent\nSo how can you tell me it's not all they're not paying their fair share the top fifty percent of taxpayers pay Ninety ... Ninety seven percent of all the individual income taxes top half of taxpayers\nPaid Ninety seven percent of all the income tax in other words the bottom fifty percent pay three percent which small percentile of taxpayers also pay three percent or more\nYou might have yes that is the top the zero point zero zero one percent or about fourteen hundred taxpayers that group alone\nPay three point two five percent of all income taxes on the top zero point zero zero one percent pay for almost\nThree and a half percent of the income taxes\nBut we're not we're not charging the rich enough votes\nAnd twenty two thousand one the bottom fifty percent pay nearly five percent whereas the top zero point zero zero one percent of fibers pay to point three percent so uh\nOne hundredths of one percent or one size that one hundred and one thousand\nTen thousand of one percent they're paying more now they were in two thousand\nThey're paying more in income taxes now that they were in two thousand\nIndividual income tax system is designed to be progressive those with higher incomes paying a higher rate while the end and patients or the duck reduction in the ... the progress sip it to curb his visible had the highest levels\nSo we've seen his share of adjusted income and the share of total income tax\nAnd you're saying it's just unbelievable the top\nOne we've always told you the top five percent paying sixty percent of the income that may be even more than that now the average tax rate Spain for the ... for the very wealthiest has fallen in recent years from a peak of twenty four point one percent\nAnd twenty Thirteen to twenty two point nine percent in twenty six team then was a full four points below the twenty six point nine percent of the top one percent paid on average ... they're moaning that\nFlag but this thing about that for just a second and we're we're looking at um\nThe top percentage folks I mean their pain by Israeli soldier the top three percent are paying more than half of the income tax but no no no we have to taxis people more and\nI think that the although you couldn't quote this on the screen you know you talk to somebody I think they know this now they heard when I'm Talking about your rank and file person out there they heard that the rich aren't paying their fair share but when you start really digging into it\nAnd you asked folks I think they instinctively know but it's not true\nEven so\nThis is the even bigger a development from all this they don't care they don't care I've often said it says so much about you when you're more concerned about those making more than you than those making less and the liberals are consumed with how much people are making them to make more than they do\nThey're consumed with how much the rich are making a flat fee or it's not the assumption is if we could take that from the rich and give it to the poor and everything will be fine no the poor would blow it\nThe poor would blow it this is something I Can't even say in polite company but I Do anyway and that is most poor people are poor because of poor choices\nAnd when he said well how can you saying that the same way I can say that most most rich people are rich because of smart choices\nAnd they are it's around the choices we make I Would be a lot richer if I made some really smart choices but I didn't I made some dumb thing I've done okay but I made some stupid choices along the way and I own it\nThat my wife will tell you why do we do that well you know I thought [laughter] that was your problem\nUh I think there's something I made some dumb choices and it all boils down to that\nLook at what you're buying on a monthly basis weekly daily basis what did you buy today it's the same thing goes with um you know with with uh the uh whether you're healthy or not\nWhat was your choices well it's not my fault yes it is one of them but I live in a food desert no you know there's no such thing in this country is a food desert for crying out loud there is no reason\nYou can eat healthier than you're eating now you just don't want to\nAnd I won't count myself I tried to do the best I possibly can but I could always do better and this is what I Want to tell people I may tell these folks I'm Talking to on Thursday I don't know I mean it depends on you know I just I just go off\nYou know they just crack me up forty five minutes and then just tell me when to\nShut up because I got a lot but it's but it basically will boiler down to this if you want to be richer in America stop being stupid okay don't blame me don't blame Trump\nDon't blame all the rich people don't blame anybody but yourself if you want to do better in this country is especially now in this economy\nThis is your time this\nIs your moment in history you will not have a better opportunity to better you're a lot in life than right now with this economy the way things are going now and if you don't smart and up and take advantage of it it's on you don't sit around their housing\nWith these folks on Thursday and some sort of run into by you folks [noise]\n[noise] I don't know because they told me they said look here's the deal you know we got people from all over the country really in many cases all over the world are we want you to tell us you know all this stuff but don't don't really beat up the liberals too much and I said well I don't need to be that the liberals this is a common sense thing\nThis economy is now positioned that if you want to take advantage if there were ever a time that you wanted to say okay when am I going to whether it's get richer and I'm not saying that she would actually be rich 'cause I you know that's not what people want\nAll the time I mean that's the assumption to from the left oh they're not rich they're not happy hunting that so but anyway but if you want to better you're a lot in life if if you want to get ahead if you want to do some of the things that you've been wanting to do now is the time\nBut deadly UK are genius five I'm Devin Walsh\nPresident Donald Trump that the ride in the Florida Panhandle detour devastation left behind by hurricane Michael he in
