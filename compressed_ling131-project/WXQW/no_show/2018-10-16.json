time ago actually with the revelation over the weekend by Congressman John Ratcliffe has been doing a tremendous job um exposing along with Devin Nunes ask Mark Meadows Jim Jordan and various others\nHave been doing a great job of exposing me a disgusting\nGovernment corruption in our intelligence community or department of justice in the upper level management of the FBI in this scandal to get Donald Trump now folks\nAre here's what happened this week it let me put it in context for you for a moment for those who are seemingly missed this story somehow I don't know if you've been out in bars or whatever for the past maybe your space travel if\nIt's like that Bruce Willis movie or what was that with Ben Affleck where they're drilling into the asteroid you've been gone for\nDonald Trump team was spied on by the United states government there were Pfizer warrants issued to spy on the Trump team you may miss some of that but that is what happened in the FBI is given conflicting accounts repeatedly of how exactly this investigation started that sit in a nutshell it's a very wonky case\nThe my book as extensive footnotes audit even by by use liberal footnotes too that way to liberals can't repeat what they said in the past on it but\nThe case is very simple in its essence opposition political party from Donald Trump Brock Obama's White House weaponized the intelligence community and the in some cases law enforcement community in case and the FBI the upper levels and their management\nChain to go after the Trump team that's it now\nWhy am I bring that amount not they give you go well what's great what else is there are lots to talk about I'm bringing this up so that break this weekend makes sense [noise] Radcliffe at least they just a torrent of information and Maria barn Romo show on Fox News and that that Arizona on the weekends\nAnd he said that there is some potentially exculpatory material hanging out there about George Papadopoulos why does this matter of folks and what the heck is going on [noise] remember the FBI's reasons for starting this investigation the most critical counterintelligence investigation possibly in modern us history\nAgainst a suit to be president Donald Trump at a time a presidential candidate the explanation as to why they did it has changed so many times that they cannot seemed to wrap their arms around why they did it themselves\nIt started as a whole was all about Carter Page that it was all about George Papadopoulos then as I explained in a ... show which was all about alpha bank\nThat's in my book and lays it out alpha bank\nOh you haven't even heard that story and I'm sure you buy promised you\nFolks the reason the story keeps changing is because they were constantly looking for new reasons to spy on the Trump team because the older he's kept falling apart [laughter] this is what's going on [laughter] they tried the alpha bank law that didn't work let's try Carter Page oh there's no evidence he's a spy either let's try George Papadopoulos all man up is working out their\nShocks what do we do now\nThat's the reason the story keeps changing now here's the problem here's the problem they're having the last story they settled on that was advanced by the New York times back in December of last year\nAnd that they've stuck to since you hear the liberals parrot this to\nSell George Papadopoulos today George Papadopoulos this low level Trump advisor met with Alexander down or this Australian diplomat in the United kingdom talked about this Russian dirt and that's what did he passed on the information and there you go bingo we got it\nWill make us gentlemen what's the problem with is\nProblem is when you go into a fight as a court there's a verification process for the information and you're supposed to present\nExculpatory information to at some point if it means the case that the main target let me give you an abuser example this sometimes a little complicated me ever been a federal agent [noise]\nIf I Walk into court and swear in front of a judge for a search warrant that I Believe there's probable cause at a prime a crime has been committed that there's evidence of this

that that person may not be guilty of the crime\n[noise] ladies and gentlemen the chances of losing your job if not being\nPut up on criminal charges yourself depending on the severity of the allegation are significant\nIt's becoming clear as day now that the FBI according to multiple members of Congress you've seen this information had information that George Papadopoulos was completely innocent of this that this Russian collusion thing was a fairy tale is made up but the information they presented\nTo the Pfizer court was not that folks was not that it was only the stuff alleged basically in the ...\nAnd here say based items that can never be verified now why is this important that there may be exculpatory evidence\nSupporting folks\nBecause of this whole entire case right now is married to this latest narrative this is all they have the entire reason for investigating the Trump team was based on a case where the FBI and information that guy they were targeting\nThey're

your student loan to zero and less than a decade\n'cause some people are facing Thirty years with student loan debt but that's great that you are done you pay off on a more aggressive schedule or just work out so you were able to pay it off at nine\nMore aggressive schedule I I kind of made a plan a of getting it paid off\nIn less than ten years because I feel like this you know over my head like this just said over Thirty years that's just too much\nI'm really a struggle with it a little more way more than the minimum payments and that it paid off in nine years\nAnd I don't know if you've heard me say to others in the past to successfully paid off student loans you need to keep your proof that you have successfully paid off your student loans for the rest of your life\n[noise] [noise] right and I need to contact me about that before ... last payment\nExactly in ... you know has had a lot of spotlight on them for abuses in the student lending industry\nAnd so they especially your one that you want to be a hundred percent certain do you have to prove that you have successfully paid off your student loans problem in this area is that\nStudent loan lenders were granted

unbelievably abusive what student loan [noise] miners are allowed to do and that's why you've got to make sure you have every bit of documentation you can to fight back if five ten Twenty years from

make a promise to as I say the name\nUm that they will actually\nContribute to your\nStudent loan payments and that's one of the things that helped me out you know I I was on it and the ... to a

was just wondering if using or we're off the IRA\nWould be as a savings account for him would be a global strategy\nSo doing the raw for an eleven year old is beyond fantastic because you have to it has to be a custodial raw\nBut all three of my kids had Ross from the second day started working and so it allowed them as teenagers to start building up money\nFor the long term and so you can open Iraq with any of my low cost companies I've got and find it a only up to the amount you're eleven year old earns in a year okay and then that money can either grow tax free for the Next Fifty years\nAnd will grow into an amazingly large amount of money over fifty years\nOr your\nSon when he reaches adulthood can pull out contributions that have gone in\nAs he he's a young child through that and then through the teenage years he impose contributions out tax penalty free any earnings would need to stay in their till he is in fact at retirement age fifty years away\nOkay that was kind

Aaron Rodgers fall back in you know he was going at him too\nAnd mud they pulled ahead by a touchdown or more ten points are so what I'm saying they got this so I watch the thing that theory in till the very end of course it was a plastic Aaron Rodgers\nI'm going to run down the field with a minute and forty five seconds and win the game where the where the field goal from a old men Crosby over there or which by the guy had a horrible I think he missed like four or five extra point kick everything last week and so he comes like he's the hero so they end up winning\nWho could have predicted that it was going to end like man I mean most people thought it was going to be Green Bay blowout\nOne that's what I'm saying about politics it depends a lot of things and again like that happens on who's on who's off you know who's got the ... who doesn't the when the temperature it was cold and lamb or you don't really have no idea how many factors\nGo into who wins or loses a ball game and it's especially the way in basketball basketball and college basketball on any given night especially when you're looking at something like the ACC or Duke Carolina rivalry anything and um my point is as it looks [laughter]\nIf I were to set the odds in Vegas well I don't even have to set them\nYou've got Nate\nSilver at uh five thirty or sort of free fifty eight or whatever it is stupid website is over they\nMake the big live but he's got the Republicans retaining control of\nThe center of the baby percent now that may change you\nKnow everybody had Hillary and Trump's chance at one point right the election night I Believe it was like eleven percent that he could win or less as it stands now I'm just telling you things are starting to line up but here's the deal\n\nYou folks have you know and vote that is the wild card and all of this and that's the temperature you know that's the temperature game time in limbo field is how many of you folks are going to actually get out and vote\nAnd it's it's the same thing for the Democrats and many it's gonna be and it usually does boil down to this and that sort of boiled down to an election night in twenty twelve and that's why Romney lost the Republicans were not enthusiastic enough or to either one Romney or now want Obama\nAnd very rarely do you get somebody who is voting because they're voting against somebody mostly live to some of that but you got to have somebody voting for somebody\nAnd in this case I think it's voting for Trump's agenda it doesn't even have to be for the person\nI mean I've seen that from from state to state from race to race from district district you may not be that excited about the Republican but you're going my gosh we can't let these people Chuck Schumer Nancy Pelosi take or are you crazy and the rail all this wonderful is and I can't tell you how many people I've talked to\nThat are in that boat they go home you know can't look out I was talking to somebody\nI Know I say this and then the new Republicans get mad especially Marsha Blackburn spoiled\nI don't think Mrs across the board\nBut I had somebody tell me this yesterday they said look you line these candidates up on any given day I'm a vote for breakfast and but I just can't do it this time I can vote for him because vote for him as a vote for Schumer\nWell whatever whatever trip should trigger whatever floats your boat you gotta do what you're going to do uh I'm just telling you ... for the first time that I can remember it seems to me that the voters are actually plugged into that instead of the actual personalities\nUsually in\nAny or whether it's an off year presidential electorate or whatever it really boils down to the personalities which is kind of sad but I mean we all fall victim to that we we fall in love with the candidate or whatever we don't\nAnd either we're excited about somebody or we're not and if we're not that excited we just sit around and just ... and they'll go vote or whatever but this year I to me there is a\nPowerful bowl\nYou can you can see but you can almost cut it\nFeeling that we got something going good now and we got to hang onto it type thing I mean to me it's about people saying the economy's going like gangbusters we don't want to screw this up by by by chance putting somebody in there who might put Chuck Schumer in charge\nAnd the Senate and that's what I'm saying\nAnd I'm seeing a less enthusiasm about the Democrats on their candidates\nThere's just more enthusiasm I guess I'll put it to you this way to me it seems there is incredible enthusiasm on the right about the movement this time he reminds me of I don't know if you've always remember this Nineteen Ninety four\nSpeaker Newt and the Republican Revolution and that was more about the movement you know that was about forwarding Bill Clinton that was about you know that was about all sorts of stuff but I must tell you what happened in Nineteen Ninety four it was a sea change in politics and the state of\nTennessee\nBecause we not only hand a Senate seat the and the governor's race up and a bunch of congressional seats up we had two Senate seats up because Al Gore\nWas vice president had to have somebody to fill his seat so we've got Bill Frist we've got a\nThompson Fred Thompson and then we got to do what is the governor then end up trade and they're making a trainer Sundquist and then I think the great move I'm wrong I think that's when they tilt it and the Republicans got the majority in the congressional delegation in Maine and I think that was the case and when I look back\nIt was a short hop skip and a jump from there are several later years later it was you know several years later but\nThen the legislature when Republican in the state Senate Republican and now you're a Republican governor I mean it's all it completely ran when I moved to the same in Nineteen eighty five it was completely blew it was blue dog Democrats but it was Democrats you didn't find the Republicans to speak up anywhere\nIn the congressional delegation was primarily Democrat the guy but there was a Democrat in the state legislature of the state Senate there was made up but\nThat one little that won\nThe election or mid term election\nCompletely turn this around I don't know about your state it may have done your stayed the same way what I'm saying is this is another midterm election that may have repercussions\nFor decades for decades\nBut it's all going to depend on you individually and getting out there and doing your part getting out of the in voting and if you just say oh why we got this we don't got this unless you've got this and this is ... civic thing it's just a matter of fact\nThat we have one of the most booming economies in memory may be one of the most booming economies ...\nAnd they could go\nJust like it was one tilt of the Senate worn tilt of the Senate to Chuck Schumer and then they get nothing through but here's the encouraging part to\nA lot of the Republicans that are retiring the Jeff Flake the ... people like this there rhinos what we're getting in place of them if they're replacements when and there were\nAre actually true conservatives in most cases that's a huge thing ended up itself no longer do we have the builds up resistance in the Senate to Trump then we've\nAre genius five I'm getting Walsh a good Samaritan you

an outright lie from the lawyer and the president\nAnd then in a statement of his own the creepy born lawyer took issue with the characterization of his clients laws in this case is a total defeat for her and a total victory for Trump\nGiven that this was only one of the cases that Daniels has brought against Trump ... the main case still in play\nHe says as Mr Trump and his lawyer Mr hard no harder know\nAre the main case relating to miss Daniels is a lawsuit involving the NBA the nondisclosure agreement and the payment of a hundred and thirty thousand dollars by Trump Mr Conan violation of campaign finance law they pointed out the lawsuit over the NBA came before the defamation case and is drawing the most public interest in light of this\nThe creepy born lawyer claim when Mr harder and Mr Trump issued a statement the purposely lied says being says I guess be purposely lying to the press and the public by claiming total victory for President Trump until the feet per Stormy Daniels\nWell here's what I'm\n[noise] harder has said\nDespite having all these attempt to spend the situation as best they can the loss in this case is devastating for his client as it was arguably the strongest case she had an or multiple claims against Trump and Michael Cohen\nThe defamation can claim against Trump was based on his tweet about her use of forensic sketch of a man who allegedly threatened her to keep quiet about Trump\nBread called this a ... job about a man who didn't exist well judge ... ruled that the tweet was rhetorical hyperbole\nAnd the regarding a matter of public concern that would not have surprise me if the decision had gone the other way\nBut what harder is saying is on this deal about the um the NBA were not pursuing that that was Cohen that did that because we're not saying that she's violated anything we're not the ones so you're suing us\nSo so Cohen has pleaded guilty to something that Trump's going we weren't even involved in that so now

results of your test would mean before you go out there and say yeah you know I'm a I'm jerky here it is and then there's ... ...\nActually no you are a wider than the average white folk here in the United states just saying oh by the way but that wasn't the best smack down the ball now in the grand scheme of of entertainment and uh the the full fledged W W E version kinda smack down here\nThat came from none other than the Cherokee Nation secretary of state Chuck asking junior this was the statement that he put out yesterday who\nCoined DNA testing do not even distinguish whether a person whose ancestors were intention is to North or South America sovereign tribal nations said the only legal requirements for citizenship in the wild DNA test can be used to determine lineage such as fraternity\nTo an individual it's not evidence for tribal affiliation or by the way he was in a DNA test to lay claim to any connection to the Cherokee Nation or any tribal nation even vaguely is inappropriate and wrong\nIt makes a mockery out of DNA testing and it's legitimate uses well also this honoring legitimately tribal governments and their citizens whose ancestors are well

she claims are being born up\nGoogle or a broad\nOh by the way I mean details you know the whole thing's so\nPart of the the liberal argument that I've heard of and throughout the day is well I mean what difference does it make anyway and Trump's tax returns okay let's talk about the tax return thing real quick\nSo let's say that at worst you think he got something on from Trump's tax returns here's a person who lies literally about who she is and always has and the problem is for folks who say well I mean but who did it hurt old but it wasn't it wasn't a victimless crime\nThere had been
