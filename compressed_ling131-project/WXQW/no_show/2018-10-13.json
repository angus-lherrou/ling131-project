W ... down and you\nMm\nJon Benet Jon ... the author of genocide is now an auto form the story of Apollo right the great\nSuccess of NASA Nineteen sixty eight that was then this is now we worry about ... the my favorite robot and Bob has a book university near about Hubble but within these last days it's going to stay smoke can you update us Bob\nI should point out that the universe in the mirror is now available any book and it's you know has an uptick includes the uh the two thousand nine repair\nAnd I predicted this kind of stuff happening and that book\nNASA today released an update on their effort to bring Hubble at a safe mode of back into full operation the key here is that they have a gyroscope watering backup gyroscope they've lost by transcripts of the last ... years since less repair mission that down to four gyroscope so\nThey they were down to four gyroscope say last one\nAnd so the backup gyroscope is going to bring be brought up in the line if you have three gyroscope she got three dimensions no control and you can point to telescope precisely will they brought up the back\nBack up and it didn't function properly so that leaves them only to working ... hours cups and trying to figure out what's wrong with that one bad gyroscope though the backup gyroscope but here's the bottom line they still don't have an answer to that but\nIf they cannot get that job if they can get it fixed just the U.S a Hubble was now they said they got to go back to full operation test before but if they can't get that fixed they're going to drop down to a wine gyroscope load\nWhich means they will be able to do science but they will not be able to take the same kind of shot pitchers they've been doing for [noise]\nI'm twenty five years we will basically have lost helpless capability and we will no longer be able to see the sky with sharp division as we have for the last twenty five years it's going to go back to what it was like\nBut for Hubble when we essentially what blind traumas why now I Know Charlotte's talk about it that the optics and these new big giant telescopes but they can't do will help us and they will we have limitations\nHigher boats out good news here high a boat say is uh enjoying it sells in orbit around where you go and what his mascot\nWell OK mascot was one of those are any land hopper bounces they down last week\nI got was this was a German or French designed mostly German and it was it was all box set down hits the ground bounces a bunch of times once it's settled that has a little a little bit on that allows it to push it up and a jump a few more times\nIt only had batteries for about sixteen hours function at work that Seventeen hours it takes three hops and to and this week they released images showing where it traveled on the surface I got that posted on behind the black sea can see where traveled took a lot of close up the images\nAnd the bottom line is that it would have found is that the surface is crazy than expected it was absolutely no flash spot on the surface everything is capitals and rocks\nAnd that might tell us why this week\nThe highest ... team announced that they are delaying the landing of higher boost to till January they will do it later this month that delaying until later January and they said the reason is because the surface of the of our youth group is so Boulder strewn that they don't have any flat spots anyway and they don't want to take risks\nAnd so what they're going to spend more time doing observations from orbit and uh to do a much closer to study the surface to try to figure out if they can get down to a spot that will have less risks that that's what we stand right now with Bush or John\nQuickly Bob update anything irregular in this in the ... were headed towards minimal anything ...\nWe are in minimum job and that might be the entire irregular story here because we're not really supposed to be in minimum for at least another year and we're in a less no doubt about the minimum began about three four months ago\nAnd is the number of sunspots it's his place enough in men about we are at the minimum ... minimum wage you know the point where it's actually the lowest but we're in minimum right now and this means that this was a very short ... week solar cycle that just ended\nAnd that is unusual that usually if they're weak they um they allowed in this one was weak and short and uh once again a less so a sunspot activity usually is associated with colder climates on the earth\nAnd lo and behold we had cold climate so last decade or so or the so called ... global warming is pronounced and real and there's no question that\nAnd so uh that's what we stand right now what is going to happen in the future\nWe don't know for ... this is really what the next cycle bring us it's pretty exciting because it might be a ... a ... or no the solar minimum that is not big put the Athens or we could be ... a a grand ...\nAnd ... grand minimum this'll be really an exciting thing for straw for scientists all the science you shouldn't have to see what what kind of\nInsurance ... space right now at this what the ... we don't really understand why these things happen we understand vaguely what causes them but why they vary in change and why the sun has a cycle is not really understood ... how the dynamo is on the medical field really producers could stuff\nWhy it changes so having a grand minimum here would really give scientists to the opportunity to get a better understanding\nFrom the more sip of superficial this team and a half right now\nWe go to the surface of Mars quickly Bob we have a less than a minute honey called that look like the product of that ... that water what creates the cemetery\nJust idea I posted

just like honeycomb this complex I don't know what is you got in between the hold you got the whole tiny holes [laughter] it's like a doodle it's kind of reminds me of Britain's don't dance in a cave but now it's not really\nAnd so my point is I really haven't the faintest idea what caused this there's a lot of mystery here you can try to pin down to a\nUm uh the location when the drainage coming off the giant volcanoes\nFlowed into the northern plains but it just doesn't really make any sense at all it just tells you is boy would be really good to get they get an idea of what's going on but

chapters of John\nYou'll find him still giving him a structure him him giving them covering him telling them about different things that they were going to face and they want to go to but the first thing he had to do was calm them down\nLetting out your heart be trouble\nDo you let it you let it God ain't gonna ... you have you have to let go of the food and you have to let go of but do you have

they and they do well and and you don't blast deal these your friends and thereby don't blast down that drive you know my neighbor\nI was going how it's going to I wanted to get out rarely he'll look around and he wasn't around then he probably knew what I I I you know people will bless you so bad it was hard on people but you know we just speak the truth yeah I'm On a label encouraged me\nHe comes and he said man how you doing he said I told her one day someone get out his ... he said man whatever you do don't get out there ready [laughter] but it was somebody I encourage you that really makes you feel good looking pound takes me and said value really did a good job on the radio\nAnd and it really made me feel good about a pet you on the back\nBut it was somebody tell you down for no reason we got a bad habit in our communities and now we have our own people down for no reason to try and you know I didn't get a little trouble but you guys just said you run the back or somebody\nAnd you just you know you look out for men are the costs slide and you run to back us up about it and you lose everything to somebody that don't have nothing and then they then then when they look up what is man looks at Charlotte\nAnd their mother China takes all your stuff but you know homes and send your doors on for no reason and how you deal with how the accident and most of the child and why is that when everything 'cause when you came ain't nobody had done that don't have that somebody run about half the time\nSomebody that you hear hey God and the day and in the last year but they are not able to take your guy because you just have had accidents that when they said that what they call an accident that drive you just had at union when they got you made a ... vote\nAnd you get broken into and all this\nThing that you've done start coming back and you can buy 'em fair shoe box from somebody you know and you know that they don't make shoe boxes you know they don't have a receipt for it and I'm just use that for example but when they break into your house\nYou're going to lose a hundred times that much\nThey will come in and clean you out so my advice to you if somebody comes to you it was something if they don't have a recede with it on the you know they not in business to be selling it you better leave them alone\nBecause you can read just what you ... and their view ... something that belonged to somebody else somebody going by yours\nSo really you need to wake up and we need to stop doing things that we know is not right and be thinking it's a blessing you know\nAnd I had a young man now than they tell me he found out he saw me and I've been just me and bless all day and I said\nI said oh man as good you know and and I was kind of you know listening to him and not say anything until the until me he's seen a man drop his wallet and he picked demands while the up and he said it was three hundred dollars in their wallet and he got three hundred dollars out and he threw the while it down\nAnd I told him I said well no\nThat's not go I was blessed in there and I say God don't bless you to steal from somebody else and when you see that man dropped his wallet and you don't know whether it was a light bill money you don't know where that was his ... you don't know whether it was for you know so then you put him in a real bad and\nAnd you got his money I understand that this call and the demand and tell them you know so you know drop your wallet\nAnd you took two or three ... and I said I have three hundred dollars is a little cold shoe\nA world of trouble whether you believe it or not so now and I'm telling you now if you're in a way possible that you can get with that Bush or you need to get with that person and and give them the money back because Im not\nGoing to be a heavy burden on here there's a brown and the monkey or ...\nYears old saying is hard but it's hard but as for how we want to know why some people\nAnd I didn't get a chance to get a house that old saying me his heart but his family ... an hour is less than that it's a matter of preaching the other day and they were saying a hard one is fast but to God\nEverything's ... what makes you say that's right you know life is hard because we is naturally you gonna go do some things in life but God what makes it fast\nContrived and and when when you when when they say is hard but it's fair\nAnd it's hard when they come back to you but it's fair you know you did something out there that you know there wasn't right and then when they come back to you it's hard [laughter] but it's fair [laughter] you read this with you so you know I'll tell you we need to wake up\nAnd start realizing that this is a real live and God is real and they would have gone is true\nAnd we must believe and try to live by then would you got to strive to live by the wood um God and I'll tell you you know you know when you really trust and believe in God but you don't get stressed out\nYou know because you break up in the morning you said a law or thank you for this day and I ask you to supply minor leagues to ask you to bless me and I hope that nothing go wrong to this day for me but now if it\nDoes you know nice gone to supply your needs and whatever whatever hand that he deals you you got to play it must have brown\nI'm I'm changing gears only in ours has at least another day and now as I'm come across I mean we don't have much revive a normal when I was a kid with five on was something even when I was honestly doing so much wrong\nPeople used to get on the phone says some land revival around the corner the vow off the street in front of a\nVow to do something you get rid of revive\nTo community if he's voted come in is like when you when you when you when when they come in and you stop and they come in and put that machine going in and ... and ... and ... to make you\nCome back to life it's probably some in a word of God that changed your life in your community that's right and now a day to read and we don't have a revival too much checking your tension that you don't see too much trouble in known too many charges\nBecause as a program now\nIt is now it's time for money a man that program and says that for money God is really not in it that's right so you look at now is not being revived in fact we got the race so much money\nYeah well there was all brain when now\nWhen they when they fall short while they put on a real violent put on a live but and and you know to to kind of um rectify the it's all about money is that you know now if I was a pastor and I mean I\nStill have a normal ... sold them outside of him you know and and the only thing that I'm a fan is only playing I'm saying is if\nYou if you're guilty you know try to correct it if you're not if you feel like you're doing the right thing when the NBA don't worry about is you know because you know you pleasing God but if I was a pastor\nAnd my congregation a scene that things are getting out of hand and now we need to have you know we need to be revive\nWill who know more\nAbout your sheep than you do and that means you should be the one revive them not to send to Chicago a\nCalifornia law across town to get somebody to come and revive you people that\nYou don't even know but you know\nAnd you know what they mean revive in in your community ant and\nMess what\nHappens when you knock on wood about the money issue but when you were about the money issue you want to send him get somebody that's going to calm and draw a crowd\nAnd have you know and I want you to think about this just a mile when uh it just about everybody that gives a revival one new revival go on the most that ... that that that supports it is going to be the members and you run the robot will all week\nAnd they'll come in and you know you\nBe some different if he didn't take up nor overrun with just run over by for the souls and we don't have time to be told them I don't mind it costs we'll you know if we're doing it for the right thing going going to see us through he go make sure that uh bills are paid a life you know everything is going to work out\nBut now when you go to a guy that take up the money every night and then you got to say well you know you know we we we me another two hundred dollars you know in order to to to me the obligation here tonight we just didn't get enough you know [noise]\nUm well now something is kind of wrong there and you send in and get\nTo people from out of town and you gotta wine and dine them you've got to put them up and they got 'em in the old ... you know how to how yeah and and then you gotta have that money so now\nMore than boils down to\nYou taken advantage of you sheep\nBut you know some of the brown now every body gas to get paid to do a ...\nAnd they become a you speak a lot of people don't call them that they get paid and what I have seen this ... auto preacher put their program Anna ... ... if you ...\nYou know I'm not telling you know story if you if you how often the church or lower down in the church you going to see just what I'm saying it's true you know I'm telling the truth that\nA lot of times when even when the man come to preach he had he'd be playing his congregation eagle our enemy and told him don't go over there and put all your money in that church [laughter] that's something to tell something about\nHow much money that they're so or see somebody church you don't know how to lord\nBlesses you to to to to to\nTo see the church and so you think some of Taylor Marilyn Adam been around out an awful thing you want to know you say you you ... they they they ... they know you ... don't put don't put all this and this church\nBecause we don't take some of them is that why comes up where they take up the money in that and put it on a group of room put up put the money and a group so that mean they know how much money that they they trusting gay so if you don't mess around and gave a thousand dollars mhm\nBecause passes what happens is islands thing and then you know I'm not saying all the time but the people come in and say well I've been called a breach him in all of a certain angle and [noise] you know it was only five of the law\nUntil they got in the pool a pit until they got on a special seat you know a on a Sunday and seem like\nThey do
