not\nThere's there's nothing to do with a criminal investigation I Will be honest with you I suggested\nTo two senators suddenly Senate Judiciary committee that ask Dr Ford why she doesn't walk into

important point\nHe said because in a court of law medicine cabinet does have the presumption of innocence Senate quarter law there is due process and a quarter law if it's a criminal case it's beyond a reasonable doubt\nBut as a prosecutor Rachel Mitchell said in her paper there's not even a preponderance of evidence here and I would add there's no evidence\n\nSo we have a circus way of the Roman

Montgomery County Maryland not one and I'll tell you something else [noise]\nOne of the reasons they think they can continue to say the most outrageous sickening insane things about Canada is they

call at eight hundred seven three six three six six six because we'd like to know what you think about the latest\nThe latest thing to come along the robot brothel I Am not joking is the thing it's a\nIt's happened already and a couple of countries in Europe there's one opening in Vancouver and also coming to Houston unless of course the mayor and citizens can stop it\nOr there is some moved to do that it's a it's just what you might imagine it is a sort of a I guess they've been taking the idea of those\nTo even say it is a blow up dolls and they\nThey made them you know the modern they upgraded them uh they they have robots that look what they say nearly indistinguishable from real people they have artificial intelligence software and they learn to react to ah to people that can answer questions and a natural voice\nIt sounds far fetched but it is not the human form robots are already here working as sex workers Tavis company is called kinky ... dolls [laughter] they opened up there\nStore in Toronto last year they're planning to open a second location in Houston very soon and they hope to have kind of locations throughout the country by twenty twenty now there has been some backlash but\nAt some times you don't actually have a specific a law that can do anything about it because it's not prostitution that's not a human being it may seem sick it may seem farfetched and kind of\nFrankly a little disgusting but it's not illegal if there's not a human being acting as a prostitute now some people say well you know there is a a an upside to this thing because\nIt's one way to help stamp out illnesses that are generated and spread by sex workers on the streets or in Brussels where they are not licensed here which is of course where it is in most places not licensed\nAnd so you don't have inspections and people get sick they can die from the things they pick up in these places that would that's one thing that would not happen they claim that the\nThat these machines to undergo at two hour cleansing process after each use\n'em there is no special bylaws in most places that would that would affect the things that also against women off the streets and out of that life so there's something good there I guess but what does it say about us as a society that we need to do this are we are are those are other people among us who are so lonely\nThat this is what they are forced to do is a therapeutic for them or will it make whatever problems they have a worse especially as they become ... and this is really object to find sex isn't it you're turning the female form a into an object at this point because in this situation it is an object\nAnd I don't see any information here that the says that this is something that women would go to I don't see anything about male dolls that seems to be more or something that attracts man looking for female companionship of some sort\nSo I I'm not being sexist by concentrating on the male part of this but uh you know I think we can imagine that it would be mostly a bad thing that the men probably wouldn't do that I couldn't be wrong if if you're a woman and you would find this attractive in any way\nOr give us a call at eight hundred seven three six three six six six because I Would like to hear from you it's interesting that that the the porn industry has been such an early adapter of of a new technologies as a guy or an author and professor down at the Florida Institute of technology he recently wrote a thing about the\nThe digital brothels and he points out that the adult entertainment industry has always been an early adopter of advanced technology and this goes back to the Nineteen eighties when the VCRs first started coming out\nAnd and the people who make porn movies realize well they could close down all these leaders are which are expensive to operate and just you know put their terrible little movies on VHS tapes and you could buy those online or you could buy those in video stores and they made an awful lot of money by doing that\nYour your boat load our butts up buddy love the show\nAll right thanks thanks for drawing you know what we're going to talk to our Ryan uh Ryan on the road to ah to Wisconsin to Kansas City 'cause Ryan you're one of those guys you have a very level headed you you always come down right in the middle of things to tell me what do you think about that at the end of civilization [noise]\nNicer take longer mom but in lieu\nOf problem in this country already with sex trafficking and I'm now others might say to me well ... well how do you know well we keep hearing all these stories and we keep hearing these advertisements about sex trafficking and\nWhat really concerns me that the grand jury unhealthy environments and bomb who for women but the but\nLook what I mean that that kinda that kinda\nThing [noise] I don't know what's going on in in terms of those a lot of that or ...\nWhatever Congress is looking at my um who practicality late wife who\nLouder meant to be OK liking every law that Congress put their lungs like this or anything in society you know\nIt is hard to change you you you can't legislate morality but you can keep certain things you can make it much much harder for companies to make these products and sell them because a child sex dollar a sex robot is so sick and harmful but uh\nYeah I think you need to do that also if nothing else it's a statement of a society saying this is just something we will not tolerate\nAnd and the thing about the about brothels as you know we talk about the human is Asian all the time oh this is the bottom of the humanizing as you can get because you are completely removing the human emotion from the the act of sex and\nNo one other thing on a lot of money you know short circuit shading mine\nAre All right thanks for that Ryan speaking of Kansas City that's also where we find Martin this morning good morning march\n... morning or I'll be real fast a mutt take all that it was to do that what about we produce that you know over the years you know the whole reason of the whole reason behind sex is to reproduce\nPutting you on a guy who goes to have sex with adultery produced we want that guy having kids [laughter]\nJust kidding [laughter]\nYeah well I you know I hadn't I hadn't thought about that what about the idea that it might reduce disease or that that gets caused by the current way human using humans for sex trafficking\nNow and now they took it in for people that does have things like agents certain diseases and stuff that is the only thing that you can do to keep it down and now I might actually understand\nWhat you heard a you heard rye and saying that you you know we were talking about you can't legislate morality so for you is a is it more practical thing like this is just something that we don't want to in our community for a variety of reasons or is it is it the morality of it is that the idea that it could be dangerous what ... what is it for you\n...\nI think it'll be dangerous mhm\n... yeah well I mean I I really do\nIt's um a dangerous I guess for is a dangerous for the individual who goes in there or is it dangerous for society as a whole because the one thing that's less dangerous or at least there's not a ... a woman in danger at this point it at least is the man who goes in there and I again we're talking assuming that\nMostly men would be doing this because as far as I can tell these ... only have female\nSex dolls and there are so it's it it might be dangerous for that man but that man is making a conscious decision making a choice he doesn't have to go in there a lot of it\nWomen who are currently in Brussels are there are not by choice of their own and they are often in physical danger ... at least it would eliminate that I'm just trying to play the devil's advocate here to see if there's any any mother's side to this argument how the dentist yucky and we don't want to do [laughter] yeah so obviously I\nAnd I just add all said and the good old ... and that's just that's just my take not not that I'm not against anyone else's opinion about it but I don't I just don't see it being a good thing you know I ... I Believe just taking all we ask what you know\nFor sure I appreciate the call Martin or I'm going to try to get one more call in before we got to go to break let's go down to those two are Steven

my fiance is sixty seven we're both retired and we're getting married and gradually shouldn't\nCare and we had a meeting with financial planners to get health planning for our financial need during our retirement and\nI'm looking at ... ... tax planning and that sort of thing and we want to make sure that you know either one of us have enough income in the end of our death and we don't want to our families and sell\nThem on what are they for if you're not going to be a burden on your family\nIs actually right in that way you know we hit it with\nYou know the issue of long term care and insurance and it really shows um [noise] and so we were just wondering if he might have any suggestions or [noise] um\nThis is this a real problem because generally you have a segment of the population that doesn't need long term care and that's people who have a very large number of assets generally north of three million dollars okay\nAnd then people who don't need a long term care because they got nothing they don't own a home you know they're renters they have a very little money say they've got no investments so there's this group of people in the middle that don't have millions of dollars in assets\nAnd to have some things like maybe owning a home and other accounts they don't want to be impoverished by long term care and you mentioned not a burden on the family so if you're in that middle section and would you say that you and your fiance are in the middle\nI wouldn't say that we're in that middle [noise]\nYou you do have to think through what in the world are you going to do if one of you ended up meeting assistance with what's known as life daily activities needed long term care needed a assisted living for nurses skilled nursing home what do you do and the market\nOffers perfect answers to the long term care insurance will generally you pay for a three to five year period depending on what you buy\nTheir will have an inflation adjustment to deal with medical costs to inflation over the years the premiums are not guaranteed they can go up and even initially you're looking at several thousand dollars a year aren't you\nYeah [noise] so it is one of those things there is no good answer\nTheir strategies people do where they go see an elder law attorney and title assets in a way that the assets are not at risk is considered to\nBe a um a strategy that some people don't like the ethics of others are happy with the war you are you by the long term care insurance\nOkay and I read online ad out an option regarding staying in community care [noise] and I get the idea that it's basically investing in\nThe community care facility where\nThe life stages ones you go in and independent living than men as your needs change you move from place to place but they they don't provide the care for free I mean you go into a state that facility that deals with the stages of aging you're still gonna have\nTo pay for the care right so it doesn't leave the the cost burden so if you if the two of you want to make sure that you're not a burden to each other and you're not a burden to your kids and you're both healthy now\nAs much as it hurts to write a several thousand dollar check a year\nI Believe it or not I recommend it\nOkay [noise] but I Want\nYou to get a five year benefit if you can afford it and a decent inflation adjustment which would usually be minimum three percent per year\nCovering inflation over the years 'cause a benefit to you today is sixty five let's say you wouldn't need any kind of assistance to your eighty five\nRight if you don't if you don't have inflation adjustment of benefit that looks good today will be useless Twenty years now but I Do have one other alternative okay [noise] going\nBack to age eighty five you can buy something known as longevity insurance does anybody mentioned this not at all generally nobody mentions it because the commissions on it or not very good okay\nSo you can buy a policy Mitt only pays the benefit if you make it to age eighty five and then at age eighty five it pays a very generous monthly benefit for the rest of your life\nAnd so it's money you can live on in the event you need any kind of long term care\nIs therefore you die before age eighty five poof it goes up in smoke okay but it's a very affordable way for you to find much later in life when the odds would be higher but you would need care\nAnd so I'm like the longevity policies as an alternative you'll have to look around on your own you probably want to look for a fee

I most focused on how we're going to address it in the United states and that is our food supplies come from everywhere\nThere's something I'll give it to the example when I'm Talking to a school group something like that\nAs a way to really get their attention I say you know it was really easy when I was a kid not to have to eat vegetables all the time or eat fruit all the time\nBecause we only had fruits or vegetables when it was in season now and they got really interested in that now because we live in a worldwide food market\nBut it seems that things are in season all the time but whatever fruit or vegetable you want is pretty much available twelve months a year but that food chain we now have\nHas come with the added complexity that people can get sick who source of the illness hard to track\nAnd keeping people safe has become so much more difficult so we'll have these outbreaks of foodborne illness and you can have fatalities you can have illnesses that can go on for a significant period of time\nBefore the CDC or whoever else is loose on the case can track down the source and shut it off\nYou'll hear from time to time happened with lettuce or spinach or whatever\nWell the nation's largest grocer Walmart\nIt will have a new system fully implemented in less than a year where with any food item sold in the store there will be full farm to store tracking real time so if there's ever anything a dentist\nSide as a potential source of illness it will be able to be tracked down a whole lot quicker\nAnd the recall will happen a whole lot faster\nAnd the danger to people will be greatly reduced we cannot make a food supply a hundred percent safe but Walmart is doing is great and any number of large players\nIn the food industry both manufacturers because it can also be how many people get sick from things other than produce you know give me actual um\nCanned food or or processed food that can make people sick as well and so food manufacturers are part of this process also and John who is part of our car dot com crew recently was in a store with what\nWere you buying a frozen shrimp frozen shrimp\nAnd it is okay to name the store in this

was an abnormal sound uh you know not the normal bleep are so I looked at the screen that says it was looking at and it said a do not solve this item\nOr an it printed out a little ticket it said attached to the bag of shrimp and Paula manager and so the manager came over and a U.S but you know what this could possibly be and she said we really don't know we all we looked at the expiration date or wasn't expired didn't expire till next year\nI'm In and I said well you know maybe there was some kind of recall and the manager said you know that that's entirely possible or the you know at this point we don't know so I've looked since then to see if there was a recall on any kind of frozen shrimp and there had been won in a couple of years\nI'm semi stumps in is that maybe there's a recall in process and it just hasn't been announced yet but they would not let us buy that bag of shrimp\nBat is fascinating and it's a mystery maybe will unfold over time but that is the kind of

I was going to wait until Seventy [noise]\nBut I was reading something called the Sunday newspaper and end up business section there is a question to answer and there was something about Social Security and it surprised me basically said if you or a Social Security age with a minor child the child could get Social Security benefits\nSo I was kind of stuck with that so I went to the essay dot Gov Web site and found\nSeveral scenarios where kids can get Social Security the parents died there disabled the child is disabled and then there's the one I was looking for it just simply said if you're simply old enough and your child is young enough that they can qualify for Social Security of course they were more politically correct 'cause they said if you are Social Security age and they were a minor [laughter]\nBut it didn't do anything to say what the amount would be so I made a phone call the Social Security and I said you know here's my scenario what do you think of it is the end result of that conversation was they said yes there's no reason your son wouldn't get fifty percent of the benefit\nThat sounded exciting but I've learned that you don't trust people on the first phone call or customer service kind of people I've done that before I've listened\nTo their advice made a decision turned out that gave me the wrong information and I made the wrong decision so I thought I'd better double check this I made another phone call different dad got a different person they basically said the same thing they brought in this idea of a maximum family benefit\nBut she said yeah you get fifty percent of what your benefit is though she called me a number of that was way lower so now I'm left with wondering well what do I do like a another phone call too I Know\nI Want I Want you to spend some money to see if it's right for you to do this you know costs to forty dollars to do what I'd like you to do\nTo ready ready\nThere's a website I'd like you to go to called maximize my Social Security dot com it's the most sophisticated tool that I've ever seen or heard of that will allow you to run the exact\nScenario of your exact situation\nAnd figure out if your answer is different than the the general answer the back of the envelope answer is always wait as long as you possibly can preferably Seventy to take Social Security even though nobody seems to do that but\nIf you run the analysis\nPutting in you have a minor child and all that at maximize my Social Security you will get the answer that will be definitive for your exact situation then you'll be able to see the numbers laid out for you it's a forty dollar license\nAnd it will buy you the guidance for a year or so you can do to what you can run different analyses and figure out the exact right moment between you being passed sixty two and a Seventy when to take\nCan I add one day and sure\nI did go down for Social Security office that I felt more comfortable with somebody face to face and they did verify that and they quantified the amount of money to get the thing that was surprising was they said it would be fifty percent of my full retirement age and\nWhich is actually my six to sixty six years two months is that full retirement\nYes yeah\nAnd so when you compare that to what I'd be actually getting it's really a sixty four percent bump that he would get and in my calculations based on what they print it out and gave me it means in accumulation of an additional Ninety five thousand dollars in the first seven years of taking my benefit\nSo really what my question and I will check that website as well to confirm this but this is what Social Security told me what I'm Wondering is pushing that break even point where's a Seventy is the winner if I push this down the road a little bit basically the the\nBreaking point for me would be at age eighty where without their child benefit\nA sixty sits starts to win but by adding\nAnother Ninety five

upstairs and and then there would be like a whole line of guys just sort of waiting or to have a do it I'm really salacious really insane stuff like if if it were if it were you know true this would obviously\nNot only derail Kavanaugh's nomination but you know be criminally prosecute all big deal allegation by she goes on and be the last night and almost prompted wants to turn that back says that says that you know she didn't have any specific firsthand knowledge\nThat Kavanaugh was doing any of these things just essentially said that she saw Kavanaugh near the punch at these parties said that she saw Kavanaugh you'll handing read to look up to girls\nSaid that she saw you know boys like hanging out upstairs\nNear doorway that these parties but you know almost every extremely serious allegations of this sort that she made again and that sworn affidavit she walked back during the interview so it was just sort of bizarre to see you I mean we're\nReally expecting it this was not this is not like a well a corroborated allegation even prior to last night I mean I think\nMost people who have been following this job is as definitely the weakest of the three ah but but I mean especially after last night I mean I don't I don't I don't think many Democrats are going to rush to make Julie sweat Nick\nA centerpiece of you know there\nThere are pushing against Brett Kavanaugh would you hadn't seen some Democrats doing a prior to that on day\nOne was a he was he with her on this interview\nHe was not mere with her he uh he he himself\nGave a couple of interviews later on Monday Night which is essentially at least in my opinion it was sort of form of damage control where uh [laughter] you know he he knew that interview and not gone over well ah so he was he he was sort of ... what he said then\nHow was that indeed had no first hand knowledge of these things from having a ... and now they're friend sweating next\nHad cold sweat neck and that it was a that it was Kavanaugh who was responsible for you know these these alleged planning and execution of the alleged gang rape but this friend identity is unknown the Syrian not he did not volunteer her name\nThere there was no mention of her or over the fact that you know a sweat with not speaking from her own first hand knowledge in the affidavit last Wednesday I and and I and the other thing that I think really deserves to be pointed out here that\nIt just seems kind of obvious that hasn't really gotten a whole ton of traffic is that when you when you look at these allegations I mean like it's a start with the one with a Christine Blasey Ford and the one with Deborah Ramirez both those allegations\nThat they are uncorroborated explain that you would even if they they they were true you would sort of expect them to be uncorroborated right because they took place behind closed doors allegedly they were you know they they were private things they were like extraordinary events like it's not the usual thing\nAnd now it has been their demise at least so far we've still got a few days to go but I can see victory I can smell it\nFor me at all is because this has not been a trial of Kavanaugh it's been a trial of the Republican Party Kavanaugh is not on the ballot\nBut Kavanaugh is in the minds of a lot of people across the country they see this now for what it is it's a witch hunt is ... got to tell a gym Dave in Michigan you're up next day was\nHell have you heard that Christine Blasey Ford's father actually worked for the CIA and work for a bank where the CIA used a quack money and so forth\nAnd that way to record on the Internet said this and that also said something about him being involved in doing security for some people that are just say you might call them each state affiliate [noise] so\nI have heard that but I haven't been able to corroborate that story that her father was in the CIA [laughter] they're also accusing Christine Blasey Ford of ... and her psychology position at the College of running some course for the CIA and I don't know whether any of that is true\nYeah there was somebody that said something on the Internet not telling you what within twenty four hours you couldn't find any more\nYeah well you know they're looking for though I Know what I Know and I'm I'm with you I Would be careful\nThough because I've been sitting on that story for a couple of days are you part of the deep state no I'm part of I'm part of cooperation I don't want to go off half cocked on some of this stuff\nIf we do have evidence that her father was in the CIA that doesn't necessarily mean anything but it is an interesting twist is that\nWhat I have not been able to get confirmation on that story anywhere I've seen it on several Web sites but it's a ... original story that I\nDon't know is true but we'll be by one eight hundred six one eight ... we're back into [noise]\n\n\nAnd ... chronicled for making full protective of farming before he took him ... for ... for natural disaster happen and we were outside the home we were told me that the part that's our meeting point I mean if I can\nSee all the way I have a meal moderates who played by

understand or anybody suffering for claustrophobia could possibly\nGo into the ocean and enjoy that experience because I Can't imagine a a more under way alien world on the face of the earth than diving in the ocean\nIt does hit rails for new to this woman is qualified to vote when she flies all over it and she's flying anywhere I mean that's a quite a claustrophobic thing\nThat's right that's right but uh I just don't understand a it's a lot like a human being to be not just don't understand how someone what part of you could do that\nYou know one of your right I just wanted to bring that up\nPretty sure that mob thanks for the phone call too much we said hey ... year or next Jacob ... what about it\nYeah how are you doing\nI'm doing great yourself\nUh I'm doing pretty well so\nI was going on I was actually wondering did it become OK could be guilty until proven innocent or not the other way around\nWell when it's a Republican who wants to be on the Supreme Court and the Democrats are upset about\nThe case nowadays because there there are plenty of a Democrat but are you know Marty right now and doing just fine let it go plenty of allegations that are against them with a lot more\nEvident than what I think for anything for Kavanaugh\nWill look let me let me tell you how big this goes you remember we told you that Keith Ellison the congressman who wants to be the attorney general Minnesota this guy was cleared supposedly by the Democrats bogus what it is the Democrats say was cleared\nLawyer who was unable\nTo substantiate the domestic violence allegations against Keith Ellison is a partner of a law firm the donated more than a half million dollars to Democrats\nYeah nearly fifty thousand or two actually Keith Ellison campaign [laughter]\nTalking about a

J. Smith and a\nLegal in ... or whatever name and is now if they changed their testimony from the written testimony is we've got a problem all by the way I've been asking\nThis and I promise out where's demeans house you remember to me\nThis is fraught with some of the folks on the left we're hanging their hand on this we have this entry in Kavanaugh's calendar from that summer in question\nAnd he was meeting TJ\nUh and Martin judge and a and and a couple of other folks over it to me this house and you remember I was asking this why don't we just find out where the Kennedys houses\nWell the folks on Dr Ford side didn't seem to be real curious about that they didn't press that point they didn't want to know where to me\nIt was and now we know why ten minutes house was ten miles from the country club\nAnd the floor plan does not even closely resemble the floor plan of the house she said she was attacked and you know how we found that\nLast they found him he's yeah last they found him his house and he was in a well but um everything's going to be okay so to me it's house\nTen miles from the country club\nThat was one of the last thing that I was worried about in all of this if they can find a nice house and it's two blocks from the country club that matches the description interior wise of\nWhere she says she was then Kavanaugh's we got a problem and had a problem to me south ten miles away doesn't resemble the house she says she was attack then so that industry has um obviously little to do with what she was saying so the only thing we're waiting on now is to see what Martin judge it is Martin ...\nKeep same our job he and the rest of these folks say in their\nInterviews with the FBI we know judge has already been interviewed I don't know about the other ones now the Democrats in addition to a judicial temperament\nAnd they got a list of like twenty two twenty three other witnesses they won't be a witness and at this point you got to say no\nNo no no we're going to the allegations if you haven't heard this from a Julie sweat Mick are crumbling too she did an interview with NBC and has fallen completely apart what I don't know that um they're actually gang rapes going on I mean you know\nAnd some of the all the major points of her contention by the way she I Believe she gave a sworn deposition so ... was she line we also\nHave the meal of the double door at the Ford residents which I told you about last week and now the mainstream media finally picked up while the mainstream I don't know but I Do real clear politics is pretty mean\nStarting to pick up on this to it appears that the double door the second door was not\nAn end in twenty twelve it was in two thousand eight and it was for some Google folks to rent part of their house out which is illegal in Palo Alto\nAll they've got to do now is go over there and see if there's a wall between those two double doors if there's a wall between them it's a duplex and it was not put in because of her claustrophobia unless she's going to run through the wall if she gets really really really scared and go through the second door and I told you at the time\nThat makes no sense whatsoever to put a double door well some people are saying well it's it's just an Hannah door on the door they got it's like a it's like a heavy second or what I Know it turns out as a side by side door\nAnd why would you put a side by side door unless you're turning your house into a duplex so\nAll they got to do now if they do this and I don't even know if they need you need to do this I mean there's so much other evidence is piling up against this woman about lying about this that and the other\nUh but if they were to go to her house and find out there's a wall between those two I guarantee your husband's over there with a with a sledgehammer right now and you go then is a big hole in the wall what oh no no no that's the way we wanted it and I know it's sort of that rough look you know\n\nSo if they find a wall between those two double doors this woman was absolutely blatantly lying under oath\nAnd she ought to be prosecuted for it so we've got the testimony from the Ramirez woman now she's saying well I couldn't say defended leading the guy who showed me is when he was Brett Kavanaugh I think it was but you know I was really really drunk and I have some gaps in my memory from that night because I was so drunk\nSo that's falling apart Julie sweating next falling apart a Christine Blasey Ford all that's falling apart\nAnd the witnesses that she says we're there you have the same testimony to the FBI the game to listen to do this year committee the clock has expired folks with things over\nMitch McConnell apparently believes that it's going to be over sooner rather than later 'cause he's calling for a vote this week\nSo again if you can get Lindsey Graham with civil legal exhibits on an easel pulling her and say you wanted an FBI investigation and we gave you an FBI investigation and here's where the FBI investigation showed\nBoom boom boom boom boom\nLet's vote oh my gosh\nSee what this does and this is why I wanted an FBI investigation and start with is because this is that I Know I'm repeating myself but\nIt needs to be said the FBI and the minds of millions of Americans puts a stamp of approval on what we already know it doesn't change what we know it just bolsters what we know it legitimize is what we know\nIf they had ... votes through last week\nOne of two things would have happened Kavanaugh may not have been confirmed for\nA he would have been confirmed that have been a shadow over this whole thing we wait a week we give them enough rope to hang themselves and they do because they count on two things first plan a was Kavanaugh's going to withdraw his nomination because of all this with the ring\nOr they these withering accusations against him he's not he's not going to put his family through this because they know he's a decent guy\nBut they didn't know that he was determined to regain his reputation they thought he just linked\nBack to court and just not fight the thing they also didn't realize this thing was gonna boomerang on them if Kavanaugh state in they thought\nThat they had the goods that lease the alleged good news and the American people by the end up being your Republicans would never go for an FBI investigation\nWhen I keep telling me last week from me in the briar patch\nThat was the call from the Democrats so what they wanted was to\nVehemently demand and FBI investigation and for the Republicans to say no we're not going to do it and then they face saying\nThey're obviously hiding something while the Republicans gave it to him and now H accusation that comes out and this guy told you they're going to be won practically every day the latest is the judge Kavanaugh while he was a junior at Yale through I said somebody\nClick click click click\nWhat's the what's what's going to be tomorrow when he started a food fight judge Kavanaugh wants to water balloons in a car\n[laughter] you\nJudge threw eggs at our house judge Kavanaugh once played ding dong ditch\nI mean it's getting more and more absurd and as it does these people go down the drain you can see I'm circling right now [noise]\nYou know and then no they're gone and Kavanaugh's on the Supreme Court not only for the full support of almost all the Republicans flake may flake out on us\nBecause he's not up really easily been mutts we may see some Democrats sewer certainly in some hotly contested states that are Trump\nCountry may come over and vote for Kavanaugh I Hope they don't actually I Hope it's a party line vote and that the Republicans win and cabinet gets confirmed that they can beat him over the head with it in November\nBut this is all about putting the Republican Party on trial and what they thought is the Republican Party would ... the court\nAnd they didn't they thought they would pay them and they would look guilty and they didn't\nAnd they gave them everything they wanted and at the end of the day looks I now again it's only Tuesday so we don't know what's gonna happen my presumption from listening to Mitch McConnell is this thing's going to wrap up tomorrow Thursday the FBI\nBut it's the Asian now the Democrats are demanding the FBI come testify before the Senate or

Republicans don't want that person and it's always political the Supreme Court\nNomination process was always political\nSo the only way to take the politics out of something as contentious as this is

foolhardy to try to cook the books if you're the FBI you go when you take depositions essentially you sit down with folks you ask them questions and then you leave the room and that's it and then you

they move through the mail who was in contact with them any indications of existing threats\n\nSo what you're watching now is the breakdown\nOf the constitutional order in the United States Senate respecting the Supreme Court and what's interesting about this is the institution of the United States Senate has its sits today is not what the constitution created\n\nIt's not what the constitution created you had this progressive movement that became especially strong and its earliest period\nThe turn of the last century the early Nineteen hundreds as it was building in the late Eighteen hundreds and you're the sixteenth amendment the federal income tax which was always\nA desired result for the hard left and then you're the seventeenth amendment which utterly destroy the United States Senate\nSenators are elected way members of the house are elected no there are six year terms of course but their elected by the people of the state the Senate has no actual purpose anymore\nOh I understand trainees and so that's not my point in terms of its fundamental foundational purpose\nIt's been bastard that\nThe Senate collectively was supposed to represent the states collectively\nIn the federal Congress to members from each state states would determine how they're chosen they can be elected by the people although very few where they can be selected by the state legislatures most of them were\n\nBut this so called populism movement\n\nAnd the progressive movement eliminated that\nAnd so you have this kind of pure democracy as opposed to Republicanism when it comes to the United States Senate and you see the consequences of that\nYou also see the consequences and another institution the United States Supreme court the United States Supreme court even though some of my constitutional is in conservative friends seated Lee disagree with me I had written about this and the ... versus Madison decision the Supreme Court seized power\nSeized power from the other federal branches\n\nJefferson knew immediately what took place as did other individuals who are believed in diversified a government\nHave libertarians today that argue strongly in favor of Madison versus Marbury and when you really read the case and you know the history of it it's a bastard as Asia and not only the constitution\nBut the parties involved there is no way Marshall chief justice Marshall should have been involved in that decision I'm not going to go down that road right now I'm just\nI'm just explaining that the Supreme Court's power today is far beyond anything that was contemplated
