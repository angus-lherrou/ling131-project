Jeff you on the scene where the Russian train travel to the front and by the time it reaches its destination all the troops have jumped off in deserted\nYeah I'm ... I mean this was the ... the Russians were\nIn no doubt that they were being used as cannon fodder and uh yeah there's there's that example where\nAre you know units marching along the road arrived with their destination and you know battalions have been produced strength by half by desertion and then Trump trains will arrive at the tournament is and the and then they'll open the box you know the empty all the true slug jumped out in the middle of the first on the way\nThe the the Russians were a it was it was just a horrible tragic war for them they they had so much manpower they had a ... a army of Seventeen million at Seventeen million military aged men in this empire of a hundred and fifty million\nUh but the problem was is that they they couldn't arm them because of the of the because of their\nBackward industry to begin with but also because of the of the uh astro Turkish German blockade of all the Russian porch surely going to come in through our angel ... a goal of mine who was the quarter master general the Russian Army said\nSupplying this empire during the war was like trying to supply a house where all the windows and doors are nailed shutting you have to bring everything and down the chimney that's that was about the situation was like inside Russia\nSo they were really hamstrung throughout the war and so all these all these troops that were going to the front row imagine a fewer than a third of the man you don't have a rifle they know they're just going to be sent on armed against enemy fire and a and a devastated\nThe Russians are pulled out of the war by Lennon after November Seventeen and the war ends the an Eighteen on the western front there's a separate peace treaties of the song as your main entree on and I hope I say that correctly Jeff\nAnd why this book sets up the catastrophe of the twentieth century is that in those treaties they create the various states Poland Czechoslovakia hungry even yogurts lobby\nAnd Austria that we will see pulled apart by the second war and here in the twenty first century are still sources of tension turmoil in the world what Ukraine is made up of pieces of the old hops Berg empire\nSo Jeffrey you've written a book about what I read now or the fundamentals for the conflict that we still live without solution\nYeah uh you know I think it's a it's a little known fact\nThat a despite the you know the despite the the punishment inflicted on Germany at the treaty of Versailles you know reducing the army to a hundred thousand troops the or the billions of dollars in reparations the loss of of of Germany territory\nIn Europe but also Germany's overseas colonies reduction of the German navy to twelve lightweight ships it it seemed like the Germans took a real pounding the treaty of Versailles but what in ... but they were paradoxically strengthened by the a book by the Paris Peace conference because\n... the solution of the Oscar Hungarian empire and they're written and the polling back of the Russian Empire or Soviet Union\nMeant that there was no dish vacuum in east central Europe a that was really up for grabs the the ... broken up the Soviet Union had been pushed far far to the east\nBy the creation of new states like like Poland and so uh and Romania and so what this meant was that you know the power on the scene\nThat was a rich is she's in a in a most opportunist during the Germans you were going to be able to push into that space colonized and ignite the second World War ...\nSeptember first Nineteen thirty nine the next day to ... to be a mad catastrophe the outbreak of World War one and the collapse ...

worrying either you're successful or you're not if you're successful there's nothing to worry about if you're not\nThere are only two things to worry about your health is going to be good or you're going to get sick that your health is good there's nothing to worry about if you're sick where there are only two things to worry about it you're going to get whale or you're going to die\nAnd if you're going to get well there's nothing to worry about\nBut if you're going to die and then there are only two things to worry about either you you're going to go to heaven or not and if you're going to go to heaven there's nothing to worry about I mean so why worry there does seem to be an obvious point in this I mean if your life's into with one who made you then there's nothing to worry

what we are today in the same place there are so many people\nThat even though they have come to church and they have hurt the masses seal the enemy a has come to try to make sure our lives they crowded to make sure I was also not\nSure he ended up proper place in the proper position so while I'm sitting in church instead of me listening to the word of God my start wondering oh here start wondering over there uh I saw I see so many people I don't do it because I don't take my phone in church less it's absolutely necessary so many people just get on the phone and just started doing things on the phone\nDeath spirit is called discretion\nJust that last second when you're people over there and just ... could be just one word that God can speak through the leader to give you that can take you all the way through the rest of the week a elder Davis middle saw Sunday Morning if you move out will fall\nThis morning when I woke up that was in my post got if you move from me I'm going to fall I'm going to not make it but because the preaching of the word of God has been\nTaught to me and I have ... decided to open my spiritual and received the word of God has received the promises to God I sit down and our bread and I said I don't know all of it but I'm declaring that that I Do know\nAnd because of that when the enemy comes lack of flood I Know that he's going to lift up what standard that's going to cause me to stay well living up a standard system jazz is separate mean guy going to fight for me and all\nI got to do is just stand and trust in the law lean not to my own understanding at all my ways acknowledge him\nAnd he shale direct my path so I started out by saying I'm Sorry I got to live over there I started out by saying there are so many people that ... someone have spoken to you concerning promises that's what it is that God has promised to you\nAnd you are really struggling you ascribe and you're trying to\nBelieve God try he looked just like it looks just like it's just simply in possible for that the to come to pass why because they already told you knew in foreclosure they already told you they're going to get your car they already told you you laid off these things have literally showed\nUp in your life so\nI'm standing on a promise but I'm standing crying\nAnd that's not to cry mhm crime itself lord I Believe you yet in all these things I Know that our more Dana ... how can you set a self bonuses Jessica's that've been through it all I've been through all of that and I know that I'm On the other side not elder Smith\nAnd I'm looking at all those things that are\nThat the law allow me to go through to come through to say hey he's there he was there all the time\nHe did not let me go crazy\nHe did not let me lose my mind he did not let me just in bad health ... steel stand on his promises and still recognize that God is able to do all things with their Abraham say he's a friend of mine I Believe he's a friend of mine he's a friend of ours and if you trust in him\nThings will work out on your behalf\nAnd you know it really is more sounds to me that you have the testimony of Peter you know a bomb told them as they say the desire to serve you\nYou say book when you've been converted to strengthen your brother and so you can see from the other side when people are going through and when they have been through what you've experienced how to encourage them and how to tell them\nTo have faith in God will deliver and oftentimes when it comes to have one thing that works against us this time\nBecause we say we'll all do you say it but he never put a time on Abraham waited about twenty five years before ours was manifesting and so we have to understand the Bible says that away from the lord shall renew their shrimp shrimp to wait\nBecause in waiting you get weary you get tired you get frustrated because you're wandering lord when and how and where is it going to manifest and so we have to understand even with prophecy\nThere is no no time in the room with the spirit so when the profit tells you that something is going to happen you just know that it's done in the room with us for but induce season is going to manifest and that's one thing that has helped me I Know that dog he was going to bring the manifestation in the fullness of time but\nYou know prophecies are in eternity ... there in the ram a ... return it to so when you're dealing with that you have the knowledge of that\nIt kind of like how they give you that that weight that you need that ... that weight that you need to stand steadfast is them use that word that you have need a job so that you can wait oh God you can\nWait for his promises to manifest in your life or some are so many times we ... it does like in a relationship sometimes people walk off just to ... to ... one day to ... early if you want to just wait it just a few minutes the mailman was commenting\nAnd he was going to bring to you that that you had need a job\nBut you waited you you you could you didn't have the weight that you need to wait on God to manifest themselves are there are so many times that I Know myself and some others that I Know that we are [noise]\nYou know kind of talk talk to each other to encourage each other [noise] um\nThe you waited all situations when the ... go do it this way or go do it that way sometimes that's what I gotta get get you in a place where it took a little longer\nBecause you decided to listen to that boys instead of the uh\nThe ... instead of waiting for the promises to be manifested just lie key problem as David said lowered my times\nIs in your hands so ... so we have to kind of like understand what that means my times or in your hands the Bible tells us in their\nDay that wait a pound the lord\nTeach every new this rent so why on weight and held up what what what should I be doing see a lot of times we say things but we're not saying it where someone can just really catch it and hold on to take that you know a wonderful piece of food let me put it like that\nAnd you can remember tomorrow what it tastes like broad yesterday so sometimes that's all a person need is to know how should I\nThe shepherd has the heart of the sheep he has the desire that the sheep be blessed and into the sheep be nervous than fair and so I have a different perspective of gone now and I understand that things are going to work out because I Belong to him\nI was reading and studying or this week about Joe has a fat\nAnd when the congregation that community rather came up against a war that was a fight in other areas and they will all try to\nReally fight for the land and a ... foot ... what did they do they went to the sanctuary really and they began to go to ... let me put breaking down down they went to pry out\nAnd thought God and we know about to leave out standing up in the\nMidst of the congregation and he said this war is not near as this war belongs to the law at Loyola gay them in prey I gave them instructions on how to win this war and simply all they had to do was obey\nThe destruction that was given\nAnd as they obeyed they were able to take this balls they was able to come out with great gain great increase the enemy fought each other and uh did the largest did all kinds of supernatural themes that calls them to be victorious\nAnd you know these kind of things when you have those supernatural experiences it causes you to have more and more confidence in God\nAnd believe him that he say and and his instruction his way to go\nIs going to be our rights or what I was a listening to it my thoughts this morning is telling us that\nThere are ways about God that deals with our faith that gives us the proper material a lot of times when you go to seminars or when you go to a work shops and go to places that training sessions or they give me your material um\nAnd you go and you study and there's always someone who's who's going over the material who's talking to you about the material to let you know this is how this works this is how they got all kind of ... now to let you know ... if you followed this uh program if you followed that program\nEverything is going to work out and you got to be successful well this is how the law works in our life he\nGives us instructions to the word other leader to the word of the profit or it could be just your past the preaching the messages that are in the messages are as he's preaching he's giving you a prosthetic word that's going to cause you to gain in this world well\nWe're not trying to gain the world as far as living but if you are going to live in the kingdom I've listened to pass the yanks are this morning he was saying that uh we are not on this world we're in this world but we're not this where\nYou know you you hear people say it all the time and sometimes even what you mean when you said at where some of the fact that how you function\nDa da da da da da da da da and it's not so much from the instructions\nOr the world system but is from the instruction of the kingdom in other words God has spoken\nHe has given instructions he's already done I did tell us that he went to the end you'll begin here so whatever your beginning years all you're doing basic basically it's just walking through\nWhat God has already gone through and prepare the way for you but it depends on your conscious a dog or the choices that you make your your conscious has to\nBe calm or this the readings from the book or the Bible and as you continue to study the word and study that word\nThen you begin to see the kingdom and as you see the kingdom you begin to live in the kingdom or the ... in ... six thirty three I think he first came in love God\nAnd he has righteousness and his way of doing and as we do that\nWe're beginning to have much success in our life ah one thing that I noticed that a lot of times we eat a lot of people a lot of time take shortcuts or I'll go that way because it's things like the world is gaining on us seemed like they are getting more the approximate faster\nBut if you know like I Know you stay steadfast movable\nBelieving in God and as you do that you come out with great success you won't be so ... you won't be so sick and your body because God has bring brought you into victory that he's already to promise to you and all you got to do is see kids came them and he will bring you into this this this\nAnd you know are you speaking earlier about uh believing the lore and being except Bush and believing is profit and prospering\nAnd um I Believe in limited to the scripture about God declaring the end\nBefore the beginning and that's the beautiful thing about prophecy\nA prophecy basically declares the finished product before the war even started\nAnd we have an idea where it is God wants us to go and I've seen so many times uh where you may have one thing in your heart and your spirit and thinking this is the way but you run into the profit just like a saw saw was going because he had lost\nAll his father's donkey and he was going to retrieve them had no idea\nThat God wanted him to be taking over the nation of Israel and so prophecy has a way of bringing the best out of you wants to has been declared and so I'm Glad they're gone his place uh the believers in a position where they can profit\nFrom the prophetic ministry our lives can flourish a faith can be built a because once we see that word come to pass once we see the manifestation then we understand according to the scripture\nThat the spirit of prophecy is the testimony of Jesus and so it lets us know that God is concerned about us he's speaking into our life he's concerned about our destiny and I'm Glad that when we are\nA enveloped with safe and we understand the word prophecy and the manifestations that God wants to bring into our life we can take advantage of that because we understand that he has given the profit to live to the body of Christ in front of the body of Christ\nAnd so I'm Glad I have a comfortable place to understand the value of the prophetic ministry um I I Know sometime when I was growing up everybody was scared of the profit\nBecause nobody wanted their shortcomings or whatever to be exposed but God is in uh the the business or in the ... the place to bring you to a better you and so in that he ... his love and kindness draws us he said with\nUh my goodness brings you to repentance and so he's declaring those things in your life so that you can get better so that you can get things in shape so you can fix things up\nAnd this is why God has given the profit that he can turn our hearts back to him and so when we have faith in\nConfidence and that and understand the value of the profits that we don't have to be afraid we understand that God is bringing us to a better place a better understanding and it's through the prophetic teaching so we understand the God wants us that's profit became necessary to keep her her fault\nAnd to hold it because I'm not going to [noise] to allow the circumstances are situations to dictate my today or tomorrow I Am looking through the eyes of faith and so for you for not what I see but free for what I knew God has spoken\nAnd what is the player for my life to me you know a brown didn't see him so being a father because he was old his wife was old she was barren but one guard spoke to them and say I'm going to bless your seat and you'll see she'll be money upon the earth [laughter]\nThat's what he believes and that's what he had in his life to matter of fish you\nKnow I was listening and I'm ... there is a prosthetic side of all of us and we have to recognize it realize that this is part of your Christ's life you're part of your Christ's life so this is what Jesus the first ... three\nThirteen say price has three had three dean us from the curse of the law [noise] being made a curse for us but it is written curses everyone that hang is on a tree [noise]\nThat the blessing of Abraham\nMight come on the gentile stew Jesus Christ that we might receive the promise of the spirit through through faith\nThrough safe so as we all know that or in the fall of man in the garden as a man fell that part of us that was Christ um fail to your so we were L L L A native from that part about herself\nAnd I'm just born in seeing shaped into a nickel to as we came into the world system as we came into the earth for him [noise]\nAh the conscious of that side of us that conscious of just straight believe in God that conscious us just straight habit and what we need it from him that wasn't there so therefore when Jesus came [noise]\nUh and went to cavalry he restored up and put us back in our rightful place so those who believe that believe this does that believe it's you you must\nHave that confidence to know that I'd been restored and I have been in place back in my right foot place in my speaking to us place we are speaking spirit I been restored back to the place that when I open my mouth and not declare it\nWe don't have to live and that we don't have to\nDo it does is it does not have to remain in your life because of Jesus had salary they went to a cavalry and his strikes that happened to him it to kill sickness and you have to become conscious of that and you have to begin to just sit and meditate that Jesus literally took this from me before\nWell before the foundation for so many things that you just have to sit down and I but it is not a time run it out\nAnd you know I get a little long winded but ... I Love to talk about the works of God and and those things that's already been done so many times we are trying to work to grace the braces already\nA bit apply that is already been done so I have to work from the knowledge and understand it it's already God you know sitting out alive now I Want to take the opportunity to invite you\nTo a common wish it with that that the greatest showers of

Bush twenty and it says is and in the morning as they passed by\nThey sell the fig tree dried up from the ... and Peter call into remembrance say is on to him mass\nSo the whole thing tree pushed out cursed is wither away\nAnd Jesus answering saying onto them have faith in God have faith in God\nI Want to share with you and drop of a thought they meant that you might remember a main concern in these bushes that we rent to you on TALK about the importance of faith in the life of\nA believer the importance of faith in the life of the believer brothers and sisters we got to say if you were saved by faith\nThe Bible said we'll save by grace through faith and then not I'd be assailed not of works less and they should both Amy and so therefore it was an hour works that saved us\nIt was an odd goodness that saved us it was a guard that saved us and he saved us a man by faith\nWe we heard the word we trusted what we heard and we acted responded according to that\nAnd God saved us if you save today but if you're not say God has dealt to use the measure faith you have a measure of faith and all you need to do he used that faith and car on guard\nAnd God save your today a million after hearing the word of God\nOn today and you believe that God is able to save you you trust him a man just yes just repent ask him to forgive you for your sins ask him to hear your life this what do you have to do no one can do if you\nYou have to act on what you have and you have that faith you have\nA measure of faith but you got to use it got to put it to action they have to have an object and this object is Jesus Christ when your faith in him a man he will save healed deliver he will set you free [noise] you know I texted\nA aim in her in the right or wrong praise God we we celebrate Jesus a man had enter the temple there in Jerusalem and a man just looked around and he left and went on to better man a man on the next day he was a\nSauce fake tree you saw the tree as he was on his way back to Jerusalem\nHey man he saw that the tree and he desire to get some fruit and he came to it but when he came to the fake tree he found another matter leaves no figs for the Bible said he was not\nTime for the face to be it was not time for that treat about these things yeah you know\nThere's a season fall\nThings and all fruit trees to bear a man and this was not time\nBut Jesus the Bible says spoke to the tree\nThe man who talked to trees I won't talk about that but he spoke to the tree and said no man he'd fruit of the hereafter forever Jesus curse that fig tree hey man he because if a tree\nAnd they come to Jerusalem the Bible said and Jesus went into the temple and you begin to cast those out who was settled in and buying in temple they when they was Robin does a man that was coming to the temple to make sacrificial offerings\nIf he's you object ... a man to accomplish do things that he says you can accomplish the thing that he says you can do you can do them but you got to do them you got to step forward by faith\nAnd just do what God says hey man that was two men who came to Jesus one day and he he they asked him laws that have mercy own us they were blind\nAnd they was unable to see and and and Jesus said do you believe that I'm able to do this praise God and they said he asked lord we will leave you able and he touched them in the Bible says\nThe eyes begin to see but he said be it onto\nYou according to your faith or corn into your faith ... knows that\nThey may not know that we're here some say oh you need is fame as a must have seen the size of a must see and you can speak to the mountains praise God but honey I won't you know there are some mountains so high marks the seaside faith even going to move them\nYou're going to have to have a faith that's going to grow\nA man that's what the ... percent he knew anything about that much to see the Bible said a man that must have seen is the smaller serve all seeds all other seeds but when you plant that must have seen in the ground it grows into a tree\nAnd a half hours of the outcome in large in it a man in other words that must have seen South Bay will grow up to the point the way it will be able to withstand whatever it is that comes up on it\nThat pushes up on it I mean I Know you've got to have a faith a man that is going to be able to handle the situation is another thing to have the same throw at you said ms so and then it's all the time he comes to steal them to destroy a man so we're gonna have to have a faith that growing\nSo many of us Amy around the world because we know hit a word we don't receive the word we don't go to church we don't hear that word ... faith coming by hearing hearing by the word of God\nAnd the only way for your faith to grow you gotta keep hearing the word you gotta constantly hear it over and and sometimes you need to repeat it over and over say the same thing over and over until it gets down in your spirit rode out down here and that's paid to begin to grow\nAnd you have the faith than ever there were three people in the Bible that Jesus said they had great faith wage pay a man but he said to his disciples they didn't have the kind of faith that this century in Manhattan there's man a man said\nHad to serve and seeking home really affects the policy and Jesus said I'll come in here than the man said no you don't have to come under my roof speak the word ...\nIt would just say it and it'll be done and Jesus marvel at that man and he said the man a man had great faith but his side was the one who follow them every day didn't have that kind of say praise", "year": "2018", "show_name": "no_show", "city": "Fairhope", "day": "20"}
