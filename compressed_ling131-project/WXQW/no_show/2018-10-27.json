potent yeah amen this or that sits there six wet and out of Bush right God for thank God for them they was at my camera when I\nIt is about the properties of God in the lives of fate pull people hey man no matter what you do a little matter where you go how you do it a man is all done through the Providence of gone they meant in other words go we'll\nShelby done the sharing of a property of the covenant other your shirt so the cover and they made a covenant that God had made yeah God keeps coming to God keeps his promises a man it said to consideration or part and hear burst guard\nIs the class to be the sole calls of events in the store it's a man and that's the one day and we have to realize is that all these stores we read throughout the Bible\nThey made is not about the characters in the Bible\nWith is all about God and his we're getting carried out God is just using these people a man and and and and to get his will to be done just like today God wants to use some of us may and we got to be papal taught his word they may he wants to use us to carry out\nA man his promise\nA man's so the people in this event boss payment off to a\nConvention at this point second guard is deliberately behind the scenes statements\nAnd you know you can see a no brainer single but we see his works and then we see the power of God we see the thing that God do a man you see when the people if I could just said it got down by the ... see a man they didn't see\nGuards but they saw the power of God had were around him and when they when they got hungry yeah they never did see go hey man they all weigh random most but yet they saw the power of God when the rain down matter yeah from ... guard is always sort of\nBehind the scenes a man not that he's not that they may have but we can't see them but we can see and understand his power a man and disrespect the account is very similar\nTo the book a roof they met in the store records no worse from guard\nA man if you read the book a roof you won't see God's name\nAmen but you'll see the acts of ... all through the book but roof no miracle no cost to contact\nA note prop prophetic article it does not even let me state that ... covered it they will ... will cover and right now there's not even say anything about it just shows that guard is at work and all kinds of ways yeah a man reports the children of\nCollege detailed guard and sovereign working through the circumstances of those who are acting in bay yeah hey man the role of faith expresses the personal prior may may and the role of base expresses the personal\nPrayer yeah hey man you got to have a personal relationship with the guy that you serve you got to trust them mhm but here's the bank\n... due to circumstances and all of us go through circumstances and the acts of responsibility and the anticipation of guards papal ...\nThey made in other words I as you go through your circumstances as you go through your bags and try to carry out your responsibility you have to anticipate that the guard base\nIs going to come through may man his predominant because of God do not it said do not visible active and there's no less that word behind the scenes to it back to his will and progressive in the lives\nOf his own they may not be once again hey man we can't see you know buddy their ... but I Know who will me on yeah hey man I Know who brought me down that highway and all the way to this point they may not talk to him this morning\nIt may not be able to share with them this morning a man and he got me right here and I don't know that yet I didn't see him but I Know that he lives and I can see his body acts and everything that I see\nIn the world they may and so this story high ever is more than a a an object lesson then they're buying God and it is a major part of God's program ball conventional blessing but those who to trust him\nAn act of Corning with his real name and so this is what Abraham and Isaac had to do\nA man they had a man to to act\nAccordingly eight minutes so guards will they had the trust thing go man you know you had to you know know had the tourists go for God to come down to tell him to build a boat yeah hey may cause there don't start raining yeah had never seen a rainbow and it took ... to do that yes a minute for Abraham\nA man they even take his son ...\nLead reading that late on a Sunday school lesson and he would take his son has it on a mountain ... to the sacrifices because God asked him to stay man and ... gland him up there so may as well has the lead will it said many potential setbacks a ball because\nThe the participants and eat seeing take positive\nAdvantage of the uh the initiative of God in their lives and critical moments you know they're just\nSo we see that we see that where you put your trust in God and have faith in God and then there are some situations that can set you back that can be aborted yeah hey man he can be a border if you just put your trust in the law and so the servant did not bail\nYou got to them and the Sam was not miss a labor will agree man and I know as it were had\nA man with a label agree will agree and Rebecca gladly accept a man and the match was old a Minnesota guard promise a man was continuing the legacy vow to continue you know we prayed to the God of Abraham Isaac\nAnd Jacob a man so so so does Jacob his own way a man so it says a attic gladly accept\nThat the law trumped all the potential hazard and broke about the compliance of all persons concern when opportunities open up for us the power of the\nPlan yeah hey man and that's what we have to do follow the players right that's right\nThe guard and will you follow God's Plan your hair thing it's going to work out you know hey man the plan of God has laid before we still must be willing to say yes I'm a man to the private ditch your movement of God in our lives no matter what the circumstances he'll\nStay man we must say yes to go\nNo matter what it looks like we're gonna have to go through they may we must say yes to go they may and so by Rebecca saying yes\nAnd and labor willing they agree and a man then God's Plan\nIs now a man of salvation is now in the movie so rebellious I example\nHave faith in God Almighty and will change our lives in ways we could not even begin to imagine a man a guard change in our lives if we just say yes to the
