accompaniment\nTo this is the first former which David is said to me the author generally but some of those crime to David occur in the first two months of the salsa some one through Seventy two but some also occur later\nSir\nThis is the first song which is given a historical setting\nNamely when David flat from his son Abd salon and shares\nWith us so many dangers that he face\nOpens up and allows us to see the\nTurbulence and that to mope that right oh\nTo his life and upset his spiritual\nMental and physical equilibrium but the beauty\nOf this song is that he shares his fateful is in a\nGod\nSo that no matter\nThe mounting numbers of enemies no matter\n\nThe possibility of death he depends on God he has confidence in the U.S he has on the same faith in God\nSo he finds himself being able to have sleep through\nThe night knowing that he's surrounded by\nTrouble because he's confidante in sustaining power\nOf God\n\nSo let's look at some things number one a war order of follows a world of phone calls\n\nHere is very likely that many of you are listening to this broadcast this morning\nCan identify with having follows him is\nPeople who don't like you people literally hate you people who are in the end she was a view people who seek you under my eyes you annihilation people who wants to flat out why you away and off\nThere is\nMaybe you were one of those persons\nYou may not be facing in imminent\nMilitary battle like David Was [noise] when you wake up most mornings\nBut you are facing a battle one kind or another maybe the climate\nEnvironment in the department of a company where you were made me want to warfare\nYou may be around the coworkers\nWho despise you gossip about you and you really care about you\n\nKnow conditions may in back in fact be cutthroat\nEnvironment even\nIn the possibility of violence bribes or stealing\nYou may be facing\nSerious that\nThat's mounting a day after day and you seem to\nBe in a jungle unable to find your way out of your situation and your condition\nLeaving you\nIn great for them\nSo you may not be facing has said thousands of enemies as David Was\n\nBut how many of them is does it take to make life miserable\n\nAnd possibly lead to the loss of your job I tell you one and they would do\nOne demonic spirit wouldn't do one one person in the church hours can bring service of love for fifty\n\nOne person can undermine enough\n\nTo keep you\nFighting a challenge\n\nThat becomes more and more insurmountable\nIn fact the more prominent you are the more you grow the more you mature\nThe more you achieve the more you advance the more the show's fourth blessings in your life\nThe more enemies you going to have\n\nThe more vulnerable you going to become the more people will come after you that's always\nSeemingly and then they is on the part of some people\n\nIt's been a lie is putting other people down session anything that carriage getting their reputation doing everything they\nCan to destroy them\nThe bureaucracy there is a former the million man for anybody I\nBecame that if you work for state government or\nOr government agency like I did\n\nOr again you may not be attacked by soldiers\nCommanded by your son that's tough enough that's the enemy you running from\nIs your own son\nYoung family trying to take\nYour life\nSo you may not be\nConcerned about being attacked by soldiers commanded by your your son\n\nBut your children may hate you and may have in fact betrayed everything\nNot just stand for for that matter your\nHusband may have done it or your wife may have done it\nYou saw your spouse was your ally but he or she has become part of the frightening force arrayed against you\nThey said based on what they saw all based on what say\nObserving concentrated on\nWe can attack the phone\nThey're stronger than us they're bigger than us\nAll the people we saw that word giants\n\nAnd we saw and I say I was looking like me are grasshoppers\nCompared\nTo those folks\nSo we saw them as bigger and better and greater and suffer and we saw a sales from my own\nAs grasshoppers\n\n\nAnd you know what we look at the same thing them phone the way we saw a chef\nBut two other spies that we're with them namely cater Ben Joshua\nSaid uh\nWe should go up man we should go ahead and possess this land\nWe can certainly Jews is we can certainly achieve number ... certainly I Believe\nNow where people go spy\nCan get we get in these in these men\n\nAnd they reach a breaking point\nOf nervousness because of having become overwhelmed by what they saw\n\nNow they they they were around long enough to know that God was fighting the battles that they had God on their side that they had the great has happened to him man could have ... they they were aware\nOf some of ... exploits some of his engagements to deliver them\nFrom easier\nNot to mention the experience of the receipt and all the other things I dodged the demand affairs his power\n\nBut what was the difference\nThat you can see something different than the to get to see something different\nThan you can\nBoth group the group of two and a group of can sorry exactly the same thing the people weren't diminishing size\nThey were not ... as the two and giants and the eyes of the can they were as much giants and the eyes of the two as they were in the eyes of a\nChance\nBut to tend to look only at the giants and something God in God but God that they have a bigger giant better than all giants they had a great power\nVinnie and they may save face God had made them a promise that was as he was not going to written on them being able to acquire other land but say hand to engage the occupants in order\nTo gain access to the land but at least ten waiting to\nBack up from an opportunity back up from a chance back up\nFrom he joined gauge the moment but for us to overcome the challenge before us that we might achieve a promise that we might\nGain access to what has been determined and designated\nAs ours but\nCan\nRare to scan fat cats our in reining duck and high rate you may but to\nSay that we can do this\n\nSo by looking at the jazz and forgetting God they saw themselves as itsy bitsy people\nWe can use small for his job\n\nBut to to Joshua and Kayla kept\nThe eyes on God kept the eyes on\nAnd to them\nThe giants for absolute black image because God was so much bigger there's no doubt about what God has done but it's all about\nWhat they had witnessed they thought about what they have seen that it's all about the display of power unmatched by any\nMan and they knew that they had on their side of greater giant\nSo it is my brother so many of us\nIn Christ to them forget that the power\nAnd that he's on our side and he's working with us and far is that the lord and cheese\nIt has made a promise never to leave us for ... sake us\nSo we can be confident that at all times in all situations on every circumstance\nThat no matter what the first us no matter what comes as no matter what challenges us\nNo matter what Mary is that seems like it's going to the straw was outlawed is able to keep us and sustain us in every situation and in every circumstance and we believe that he's going to bring us\nThrough when Peter got off the boat desiring to walk on\nAnd I am asking price to being him to come and cry for me it as long as he kept his eyes on the lord\nHe walked on the war and\nThe way we're dancing when you've got to say on the wind was blowing when he got out there but when you took his eyes off the lord and began to look at the circumstances of the of the\nConditions of nature things seem to be worse and then he began to St Lawrence had to reach out and catch him and say oh he ...\nHe began to Wal Mart looking at God in Christ said as long as they kept his eyes own law he was able to walk on the water\nListen my brothers and sisters that some things you fall and fat in there are some things you write messed up there are some things you just can't new but you can with the news again doing by yourself that's what I'm saying that you run away from\nThat God since you deal with and tackle\nBut fear has overwhelm you because you think the problem is greater than you since you could be a passive and such but your account towering because of the challenge of the guys are other groups or people in the church\nSo now you're questioning the veracity of God who gave you live on it and who called you who promise never to leave and to be with you who gets giving you an assignment and sent you do it and now you're running because you think the problem is to me nothing is too hard for God nothing\nNothing no values to me from God there is no giants that can make God look like a midget you got that believe in God you got to trust God you got to hold on a sudden changing hand you've got to remember\nThe dog um your salvation\nSo also David\nAs soon as David turned his thoughts to God he was reminded of how strong\nIt is\nI got him as a man my son got great army but I'll take get man but when I take my mind all of them\nAnd I think about the warning about who wrote that he is my shepherd\nWhen I was saying about his keeping power is staying in power he's staying power went out to think about his roaring power now think about this a vine capability we're not saying about he fails and nothing succeeds and all things\nMy phone who's even a formidable\nArmy is flocking to the side of my rebellious San seeing manageable\nGet some sleep go ahead\nAnd get you some arrests and doing the most income you'll be refreshed the same God who watched you all night and can't be all life and refreshing for the morning\nBecause he wants you know he got the U.S\n[noise]\n[noise] so what you really have the confidence express and these versus here's the confidence of the next morning David went to sleep trusting God Bless\nYour confidence level this morning last night did you go with sleep trusting God\nTonight are you going to go to sleep trusting God even though you know that some stuff looking you in the face\nThat the fight with you that some day you can't pay back some situations you can't get out of that some trouble with being steering in your life he went to sleep trusting God\nThe lord ... sleep you and not God you're a human I'm human body and he used a rash have you ever laid down\nOn God's brash and arrested that as it was your pillow trusting in God knowing that he has now and will not fail you\nHe has a wake up in a way going with the events of the day as was the best of the previous life family in a guy's hand he is saying I have\n... good night you're asked I'm relax I'm I'm replenish new\nAnd now I'm not afraid\nOf the terrorists are new day I'm not afraid of what my son's plans and schemes are I'm not afraid of here near me I'm not afraid of the oh man\nI Will not fear the fight against me you are out there who God\nA long it an appointed\nFor some some circumstance I'm selling some positions and meet some\nCondition I chose not to fear of God is not\nGiving you a spirit of fear of power in the bluff but sound mind and God is\nA moving rarely unwilling to the liver you\nHe has done for David document and then the script you\nHere's preserve our editor for ... an awareness and knowledge and wisdom to know that wasn't God meant for David ... new for you if God don't deliver you like he delivered David then you can't help God getting done the things that God wants to have done here\nAs a a helper a fellow at work your mind and toward what God\nGod well now you said he will not let you fall by the wayside he will take care of you so as I told the summers are covered this crime\nAnd deliver a mock guard is to deliver me he real delivery me you're a law image we scatter\nFor free but for you guys up\nThere and help me God God is in you know our trust in law\nAnd order\nTrust in the law firms are no friends our trust in the law broke rich our trust law\nOur trust in the law that gets a cold our trust in the lord and circumstances and situations no matter what\nThey are our trust\nIn the law because God God God Knows they deliver a ... a law\nSaying that

tell people which way to go out there for you know but I Do just want people listening to us to see a couple of things about what's happening around here I Want them to see that\nPoverty and our children because our life is about our future I'm thirty two years old and I'm expecting a baby girl I'm Out of the future is her life right now it is when I look at the future of our state I look at our children\nPoverty right now in the state of Alabama amongst our children is way higher than it was right now than it was in two thousand and what we're seeing is twenty eight percent of all of our children across state\nOr in poverty thirty percent of those children under five and here's the thing\nMost of those are working families that means that they're doing all they can to try to make ends meet and they really standing on the front line to provide for their families there have to be other things happening in our community outside of what they're doing and that is in our government\nOur government our state level man they do a lot more than we give them credit for maybe that we're aware of all the way down the health care everything that they basically affects our way of life\nIs affected by our government which is why\nThere's a lot of fifty years ago\nYou know my predecessors went out and fought for the right for us to vote and it's why they stood up\nAnd and face the water hoses and the dogs and everything else that was thrown at them for the right to vote and it's why they saw was so important even beyond the obstacles put in front of them\nTo continue to push the message that our voice is our boats and our boys matters and the only way we express our voice is to vote\nYou know our looking at a concern to Chuck Schumer and there's a a\nSupreme courts are Kavanaugh's nomination a problem to being a ... on on the Supreme Court he made a profile statement the other day saying there or if we feel that we have been shut down\nIf we feel to do that we don't have a an active participants or all the all of them really to do rather than talking raise all that sand is to do\nSo on November the ... will be the midterms elections talk to our audience about what is the significance of the midterm election and how they'll vote really makes a significant difference\nIn Alabama right now you know this is a pivotal time for us we've got like a dramatic

I was coming over and I was looking you know I was\nLooking at the newspaper and something caught my attention and while I was looking at that in a A R P newspaper fail to\nFlow or you know and all and I thought\nAnd I had my Internet opened the of course and it's like there's there's a lot of information out there and some times when it starts to come at you and there's so much people start to shut up\nShut it off and we don't know how to do that that's what I Need to do is focusing on that that pertains to you that\nThat pertains to your loved one in your friends become more aware and does area because she can't get it all but you don't need to shut it off just because it's constantly coming at you you\nCan partner is to also be aware of what's out there but also ask the right questions now\nThat pertain to you is and I\nFind that doing a little bit or reading or ahead of time or something helped me to focus my question\nYeah when I when I go uh sometimes I'll read something and I'll say yeah that's how I was feeling any give me a better word or something then I was able to come up with on my own and so I think I get better information because in mind\nReading the various things I get a little better understanding so I can ask a little better questions\nAs a primary care physician I always suggests to patients before their next appointment\nTo always write down any particular question now she we also\nI also like to discuss any new medications any possible side effects because sometimes what will happen patients will get into their appointments and they will forget what they wanted to ask the physician accident because that's a good um\nI guess a good habit to start to always ask questions before you go in and kind of well right now yeah of course when you go to\nPut them on what you're going to put them on whatever it is you keep up with to keep up with your point yeah keep it with that so that you can always Andrew next question if something comes up before you get there and then you have that with you because I can remember sometimes I'll ask too\nAnd then I'll be long gone and I ... I was with my change into\nSo into the other question yeah right and you only have so much time in at a point but mhm right so yeah those are important things to to do to prepare for your primary care doctors\nAnd and speaking of primary care and speaking of the ah you give me and then all of that\nThose are two of the focus that is why this month and they are the ones that we want to speak to a we have a national primary health care and then something new I think what started last year\nUm is that a check your man that's right check your man and a and so we want to talk about the importance of checking your man than having your positions check your man than a\nAnd I know positions that kind of into that now because our most with everybody that you you need to take you to uh take your dad's art take you're up to date last and all and so we're going to talk\nAbout and also any supplements that you may take ... over the counter medication\nThere are some side effects of calm some supplement that patients are not aware of\nTake for instance garlic and vitamin e both of them are natural anti coagulating which means they can cause they know the blood so you need I Need to know if a patient is taking one of those and then what amount before any type\nYeah and and some people just think those are important you know you can give it to me so I don't need to to uh let them know that I'm taking this but you're preparing for surgery and um you know preparing for surgery and you're taking that and\nThe doctor that no exactly yeah and the surgeon really needs to know you really need to know yeah uh people kind of discount things that they can just walk in and buy 'em\nAnd and especially a lot of a natural medicines and things now people are so into those\nThat's right and there can be drug interactions as you mentioned was a number of those summer known and some are not known so but it is important to mention that\nI saw a report that the U.S said that the total number of prescriptions written since Nineteen Ninety seven is eighty five percent higher\nThan it used to be but the population has only grown about two and a one percent whoa so more and more people particularly those over the age of fifty five or taking multiple medications and if you are not just utilizing a primary care doctor\nIf you're going to multiple doctors there may not be knowledge among the health care professionals\nThat you're on these medications and so that's where this a chicken him in the day started last year of physicians your primary care physicians are an important piece of that but also your pharmacists yeah that's right so they encourage everybody\nTo put all of your medicines and a brown bag even as Dr Michel mentioned those that are over the counter as well as supplement\nAnd have them checked out um we are looking at an industry where are the the rise in the number of unnecessary medications is costing about two hundred billion dollars per year\nThere
