denied ... heard such a recording star kisses agreed to plead guilty to price fixing is part of a broad collusion investigation and the canned tuna industry\nIs unhinged Malcolm\nBlood ... want to eat I are really the options for the U.S to react to this we're going to impose the sanctions on Iran we're going to need the kingdom support as an ally\nAnd how uh how does the United states maintain the alliance and meet its own national interest and yet they react properly to what happened\n[noise] well I I mean this is a great test right now for secretary of state Mike Pompeo\nA in because you need to balance a few things you do not want to get into a situation where\nAre you you know uh uh sabotaging that Mohammed bin Salman is a an erratic figure that uh he overreact and does something even more self defeating\nOn the other hand the Saudis need the United states just as much or more I'd say more than the United states in Saudi Arabia and um they are still going to have an imperative an ex essential imperative to fight the Iranians uh regardless of the relationship\nSo that's my first point on that and the second thing is I think the United states and I'm not just talking about human rights are important American value or that we should have credibility what may criticize Russia or China\nThat's all true but that that's less compelling to me there is a very real cost\nThat we need to impose on the Saudis if only to protect its draw a line to make sure that any other dictator who is America's ally\nWill get the message that you better not go after you know permanent residents in the United states and the third countries that other journalists that mean that\nI think a very important thing that I have to supporting norm that we would like to uphold at this point that the Saudis have violated and so they have to pay a price that said I Am not in the camp that says we should reevaluate the relationship I I don't I don't think that's\nIn America's interest by any stretch 'em so there are some options and there was options I think of revolve around a couple of points on is something known as the global Magnitsky Act\nWhich allows the United states to impose restrictions on the travel and uh finances of individuals' without addressing necessarily the military to military or the eloquence relationship between Saudi Arabian ...\nAnother thing I think is again to resist the temptation to go along with the Saudi cover up a net does not mean that Donald Trump has said\nYou know gave a speech where he blames ... comment but just not having the United states\nYou know it will come you know outside on whatever story the Saudis are going to give us about their minister of intelligence and it was ... and you know the crown prince of know about it if we believe that that is not true\nThen the United states did not feel that they have an obligation to go along with that and that's an important point as well and then I Would I Would ask\nThe state department to investigate the disappearing journalists I Would um\nYou know I Would I Would I Would think about you know not necessarily a wholesale suspension of arms sales but something where you know they got the message that certain systems and my aunt that aren't exactly necessary\nBut I think they have to be that there has to be understanding that they pay very heavy price at this point he even if I think it's unrealistic to the United states can effect or you know some sort of changing the leadership at this point because my ... has\nEliminated all many of his rivals and a lot of ways so you know in the world is stuck with him but that's not necessarily a good\nThing if I were on the eve of the Iran sanctions on the eve yeah is that is that a significant factor just a coincidence\n[noise] well I mean I don't know why uh again I think that uh any rational person they would have been in the room when these decisions are made in ... said this is crazy to to do what you're thinking you're going to do here but\nUm you know there I think that there was a mistake from the Trump Administration which was that they basically looked the other way when you saw all the sort of science calming Hariri thing ah you know some of the ... I mean we we we've heard rumors that it wasn't just\nThe Ritz Carlton House arrest\nWhere he you know got a lot of money in back taxes as he claimed there were some members of the royal family who had much more grim faced a out a teleconference early this has been recorded in some places so the U.S should have been a little bit from are on these things maybe to have dissuaded\nUh Mohammed bin Salman from thinking he could get away with something like this and it's ... that's a kind of speculation and by the way it's an argument also for taking a tougher line with other allies like general the the in Egypt where you know I the last I heard something like sixty thousand people\nAre arrested not all of those people are Muslim Brotherhood\nYou know a terrorist I mean there are a lot of you know regular dissident liberal that you know only a few years ago in a decade ago George W.

is Steve Cook the any Enrico macho by senior fellow for Middle East and African studies at the council on Foreign Relations\nSteve a very good evening to you okay a one or two private aircraft planet

evening to you um you know\nMy mind I it is a happy coincidence for the government of turkey that at a moment when the government is Saudi Arabia which is adversary a turkey is under fire for the disappearance of a journalist named ... ... um the Turks\nSuddenly a release a pastor\nAndrew Brunson who's been held since a number of months after the attempted coup and you're into two thousand and sixteen\nI think the Turks all looking to ride the wave of goodwill coming from the release of Brunson and the outrage here in the United states over the killing of ... uh to their great benefit\nMalcolm you have written a obviously a lot about turkey and try to assess\nA president or the one's intentions this clearly was a godsend for him at a time when is it kind of means in clubs they've had this new focus a Ford the public attention\nSo the question is what does how do they benefit will to press\nThe oil refinery the major oil refining took it get a waiver to continue buying Iranian oil after this November sanctions\nDo you think that um that this will boost are the ones efforts to transform you know the new turkey is he called it and give him a cover after his horrendous actions including arresting a hundred thousand people\n[noise] it's it's really rather extraordinary I think that the the Saturday missteps in ... disappearance and pursue murder ... show she\nUm had made everyone a paragon of press freedoms and protections when we know that he's actually the world's leading jailer of journalists\nUm and he is riding a certain amount of goodwill on it is true that a major Turkish oil refinery to press one to waver on when it comes to sanctions on Iran although she\nAired one wants to hang tough on and on the question of sanctions it turns out that actually trade between turkey and Iran was higher under sanctions that it was after sanctioned so and it was all kinds of incentive for Turkish ministers suing gauging graft and corruption around these these sanctions\nAired on after releasing this American pastor who'd been in prison looks like he's going to hang up and try to defy the United states on and on sanctions but overall he's looking forty good right now I'm at a time when his economy is on the verge of collapse so I think\nUm Saturday missteps or have really helped him in a lot of ways it's a it's a rather stunning turn of events\nYes just last week Steve we were hanging around the water cooler thinking now putting air to one and Rowhani talking about invading the sanctions and kiss kiss getting about the loss of turkey and now Turkey's back\nIt's it is this what Turkey's been like for the last hundred years since the end of the Ottoman said goes out of favor in favor out of favor is it's cyclical\nIt is to some extent cyclical course during the Cold War every time we had a problem with the Turks who was swept under the rug because the Soviet Union was the overarching a threat to both countries\nUm and now it's kind of come in and out of favor although official Washington has tried to continue to sweep things under the rug I think with the return of Andrew Brunson or there is a a brief respite in the tension between the two countries but there's a long list of problems between\nTurkey and the United states chiefly um the Turkish intention to buy Russian air defense systems\nFrom uh from Moscow uh the uh help fit the Turks had given the Iranians in ... in a dating sanctions\nThe U.S relationship with Syria a Syrian Kurdish fighting force that the Turks regard as as terrorists these are these are just three of you know Fifteen or so problems between the two countries\nSo it's likely to rear its ugly head again after the good feeling after the release of Brunson um but you know official Washington has a has a long history of sticking its head in the sand when it comes to a Turkish misdeeds about them\nBut there are other aspects of this that again and get a little attention as people just focus on the murder and how they murdered them how they cut them up [noise] um and one of them is the regional message both what the United States does ... if they don't come down strong enough or they come down to strong our allies read this\nAnd one in particular and I was hoping you could comment on something that is sort of baffling we've seen how president el Sisi was United States recently we met and he very positive and yet his rhetoric\nAnd some of his speeches have become a more of a throwback to the anti Israel language of the same time that they are fully cooperating in in military and security cooperation\n[noise] yeah it's interesting and it comes around the same time as the annual addiction celebration of their quote unquote victory in the October Nineteen Seventy three war\nUm but I think that you know there is a limit for the Egyptians when it comes to cooperation with the Israelis and I think that\nAt least publicly I think that the military to military and security cooperation is extremely important to to both parties but um she she is vulnerable politically he hasn't consolidated his power\nAnd one of the things that Egyptian leaders are you know they go to the well on is a is Israel and painting Israel as an enemy and and and having to\nYou know have kind of national unity uh in in a confrontation with a with the Israelis I think that says a lot of rhetoric for\nPublic consumption but behind the scenes\nIt strikes me that the security cooperation will continue if only because Egypt since really need it they've proven themselves to be benefits like incompetent and trying to pacify their own territory in the Senate financial and they needed a significant amount of Israeli help\nThe thing is he still I'm taking phone calls from Moscow [noise] oh I

that you're joining us this morning call us at eight hundred seven three six three six six six we'd like to know what you think about this topic you know it used to be a way that parents used to have to dread talk\nYou know the one about the birds and the bees but now there's one that most parents probably dread even more especially in African American communities where the talk\nOf especially with a young young black boys is about what to do if you're surrounded or approached by law enforcement of becoming a big thing all across the country\nAnd a trust me I Am not picking on the cops here at all because both sides have their uh have their issues to deal with the police you know they never know\nWhen they pull over a car who is going to be in that car how they're going to come out what might be happening as they approach and they take their lives in their hands every single time they do that we all understand that but there are differences between dealing with adults\nAnd dealing with kids especially teenagers\nAnd that has been leading in many cases around the country in recent years\nDo unfortunate things happening when both sides I don't know necessarily how to deal with each other so right now in cities all across America [noise]\nA there are people who deal with law enforcement and deal with kids are trying to find a way to make interactions between police and kids a lot safer or their training police officers to remind them that you know teenagers in adults are different\nUh officers are asked to make a list of words that describe themselves as teens and that sort of gets officers thinking about what I like to be inside the brain of a teenager so that maybe when they respond a certain way and helps the officer understand that they're learning that the brain is still a balding until we get to be about the ...\nYou're twenty five years old and a teens can make poor decisions they can react badly some of them might have a smart mouthed against them into trouble and officers have to learn that the you know there's violence mental health substance abuse issues that all contribute to these problems maybe in a way that didn't happen when they were younger\nAnd so the police across the country are getting training to deal with this\nAnd also kids are getting training to deal with this situation when they're pulled over by a police officer or if they're approached on the street\nNow we've had a lot of focus on the black community because of a lot of high profile cases where officers have 'em have used weapons and sometimes they shouldn't have sometimes maybe it's defensible you know every situation is different and of course you always have to understand that police are making split decisions they don't have the uh\nThe the nice a situation where you can think about it the day after no they're right there on the spot and they have to make a decision do they protect their life do they protect somebody else's life of what was going on there\nSo there's a lot of training that's going on a police are are are being\nTold that they need to spend time with kids and\nA and that the the more familiar kids get with them that perhaps that old and died down play any kind of a an easy when they come together [noise]\nUh there's there's something called the civilian interaction training program it's a project that the Texas commission on law enforcement has produced attained a teaching kids how not to have problems with the Texas law enforcement officers and now going through these training materials is mandatory if you

developed countries like\nJapan or in Spain and Switzerland a project of life expectancy of at least eighty five years I'm not so good news is the expectancy of us who is projected to be\nEighty which is just approximately one year more than\nWhere we are now [laughter] so [laughter] so before I give you some ... some boring facts about the American\nHealth care system lets her view a life expectancy is now and to know a few of the top fifty countries throughout the world than\nWhere we as Americans place on the top fifty list\nI didn't notice it but then she was absolutely amazing and we can't look at the time to go into why it may just\nAt the very top of the list\nAs a country of Monaco where the average life expectancy is almost Ninety years old car and I'm like wow that's amazing that's amazing and I'm\nA I I actually looked up to reasons which people can do on the Internet we don't have time to go into it now as to why that\nMay be and Japan is second with the current life expectancy of eighty five\nBut the bad news is that there are forty one other industrialized countries with better current life expectancy than the United states which is currently eighty he um [noise] and disinformation as I\nWas very eye opening and shocking to me considering the our average healthcare costs can the u._s.\nPer person is ten thousand five hundred dollars per person while the average health care costs and the other top twenty industrialized countries is forty three hundred per person huh I think about all\nTen thousand five hundred and we're not anywhere\nAnd they were forty three hundred but their life expectancy is better than ... than than ours another\nSort of bad things such as that goes for years Americans pay two to five two to four times excuse me more for the same drug\nThat you would have and countries like England and cramped wow why is that\nSo to me the real lesson to be learned from these but says is to not sit back and expect our health care system to be very effective to help improve your life expectancy beyond where we are currently are and\nWhat do I do about that what I suggest\nPeople need to do about the suffering and ... you need to be proactive with your diet\nOr exercise\nDealing with stress and in my opinion is dietary supplements wisely those that are documented to supplement it\nYour your diet\nSo that's my take away from this current incarnation\n... the numbers you mentioned in just amazing for the ten thousand five hundred for Americans the forty three hundred for for everybody else and and you mentioned Monaco Ninety years old the U.S eighty years old\nAnd it's just it's astounding or when you consider that as you mentioned the healthcare system but also also our diets and our lifestyle lifestyles a big ... is a big problem\nYeah but you know that's that's true uh uh the levels to take\nCountries like Japan which are highly industrialized and highly populated very dense ... so they're dealing with tons of traffic and stress and why are they have years better than a\nAnd and yeah and that could be could be diet than it's known that country's based on a I'm\nA a thing American diets\nCould ... either\nYeah and um I I Would imagine you're looking at a non communicable we can communicable diseases to diabetes uh COPD that kind of thing obesity lung cancer\nWell all these things certainly

in Afghanistan yesterday here's Barbara star\nGeneral Scott Miller to heading us and NATO forces in Afghanistan during that fire fighting testing yesterday his a weapon and when they got a fire

at the polls we see that the polls suggest that Americans we Americans as I called the new news media calls Americans them and say\nWell Americans say that they want not that way why they never say way than ever include themselves that Americans are what we want what we're concerned about top two things are healthcare number one health care\nAnd number two the economy because you don't have to be do too concerned about the economy right now because it's gang busters because it's going so splendid lay going so extraordinarily well thank you very much\nThank you President Trump I Know bronco

of\nAh economic activity and and ah unemployment rate for African Americans Hispanics women for all of us um but but you know he got started I read that in the Washington Post\nAnd speaking of things in the Washington Post a lot of crazy going on out there are a lot of crazy um and do one of the I I ... this is all liberal lunacy up and down the water frontier but\nA ... here here's one for ya Kleenex clinics make clean accents like Xerox that their tissues I think their tissues Kleenex brand tissues well it turns out that a Kleenex that clinics corporation has run afoul of the liberal\nPseudo feminists left because since Nineteen fifty six me for the vast majority of Americans were born the overwhelming majority of Americans were born Kleenex started marketing a I'm a product which they called Kleenex man's size confidently stronger\nComfortably soft\nThat's kind of strange I don't know what that means exactly CNN is typing up the story clean access scrapping its\nRange of man sized tissues after sixty two years following complains that the branding is sexist and says men size can't have ... they have like what are you know a man's size that ... and ... at the super size I guess\nThe hungry man dinner you can't have hungry man dinners because women are hungry to that sexist I think the company first launched its tissue aimed at men in Nineteen hundred and fifty six claiming they would stay strong\nWhen wet\nWrites your own jokes but complaints on social media about the products gender marketing is prompting the change starting later this year the tissues will be called Kleenex extra large\nI think that's kind of manly too don't you think that there isn't that what ... isn't that a reference to but they are the feminist got upset that Kleenex had man sized Kleenex so now they've done away with that because how dare you have something ... says should we have a woman size but with women size Kleenex they don't even know what to say about that that's pretty crazy\nPretty nutty I've got to say\nAnd in conjunction with that this is crazy I heard I I caught a whiff of a this shift this morning\nWatching a little bit of the television and I've got to say this morning I could not bring myself to watch MS DNC I they they just they're so insane that there are so mentally challenged they're so disturbed so suffering\nFrom paint TST President Trump stress disorder that I just can't even watch them anymore I I'd someone needs to intervene I've been saying this for many months to someone needs to help them out these people need an intervention the pigeons sisters have lost what's left of their minds they're mentally ill and someone needs to help them I couldn't watch them\nBecause it seems cruel at this point to to mock\nPeople with mental illness like this is not nice that's what my mother taught me here's a here's another one for the labs\nI didn't catch a just a quick with of this on Fox News and I went and looked it up like a local Boy Scout troop this is actually from a couple of months ago but it's coming up no local Boy Scout troop starts girls and girls only\nThen what what is this this is what the\nDemocrats have done to gender in America there are so confused by their own genitalia and their own sexual urges and once I guess see Harvey Weinstein that Dave screwed up gender and America these people are really on well Trump porno seven will have new girls only pack\nIn early September that was last September I Can't find the update\nForest park True Blood I was seven will soon add that girls only Boy Scout troop\nLast year the boy scouts of America rolled out their scouts BSA program which allows the younger Cub Scouts to offer girls only troops as a way to provide families more group options and increase membership\nWell sure I mean if it's the boy scouts then you know you can't have it the ... if it's the boys' and girls' scouts then you expand membership opportunities but they didn't do that\nIn January of two thousand nine teen scouts BSA it's called ... they're confused ... says Boy Scouts America it's redundant scouts Boy Scouts of America there\nThat this is what they've done to themselves they're all twisted around their own axle they can't\nThey can't figure out which was up any more\n[noise] scouts say well officially launched girls only troops for the older boys scouts [laughter]\nHow how does this work again people are you're not right and the head trip one of seven is an early adopter of the program and plans to start their new girls only pack in early September ... now I\nJust you're just confused you're you're very confused people you're a mess you've turned\nThe simplest of things and to a confused tortured mangled train wreck of emotional distortions disturbances because you're so confused by your own gender and sexuality that you're inflicting your unwillingness on the rest of us and I have this decided to\nStop that you just stop that his top that right now UNICEF that silliness the understand and then I found the story in the Washington Post that ah that ah ah got me going here because\nThese people are nuts Carolyn hacks ha accept the or

they have a call in there they love their Collins hanging they know boys allowed sign at a public playing ground a woman named Carolyn allegedly wrote a letter to the Washington Post's listen to this\nI have a daughter and some other moms of daughters and I have started getting together in a local playground out a set time each week recently a mom with a boy brought her son to the playground at the same time we were there I asked her nicely I thought if she wouldn't mind leaving\nBecause we had wanted it to be a girls only\nShe refused doesn't seem as seemed angry at me or they'd be angry with you but okay\nIf she comes back is there a better way I can approach sure this has been such a sweet time for moms and daughters and having a boy they're\nNaturally going to change is naturally going to change things we live in a world where boys get everything and girls are left with the crumbs that's how I knew she is a demo tears Nancy Pelosi right there\nAnd that's where the Democratic party has taken us that's that's where we are that are a vote on election day for the Democratic party is a vote for that it's ... it literally has money python Monty Python did a hilarious the old money python's flying surf circus the TV show that if I were episodes\nThat it'll areas when John Cleese was Robin Hood Robin Hood Robin Hood riding through the Glenn with his band of men\nAnd a and us emails from the rich gifts to the poor and by the time he's done he's stealing from the poor and giving to the rich because they distributed wealth to the point of absurdity and finally a John Cleese Robin Hood looks at the camera and says\nThis redistribution of wealth fingers more complicated than I thought\nIt was all the rich people are living in palaces but they have no furniture no clothes no food 'cause it's all been taken from them and they're still being accused of being riches it's comfortable it's the gender version of um of all of that also a bit of humor from the Washington Post today\nUnintentional humor naturally they don't have the sense of humor\nBut they do ridiculous things all the time so we can laugh at them which is which is welcome news I guess\nJust about here saying they ... they are a Washington Post Dr evil pose the fact checker and they had the big daddy a fact checkers Glenn Kessler come in to do this one deadline is just about everything you've read on Warren DNA test is wrong\nI mean Senator Elizabeth Warren how disrespectful there just color war and then they are in the headline here [noise]\nAnd and here's the ah it's ... he goes on and on for pages your print it out it's five pages long because these circling his own naval here again and again and letting Kessler as it tries to blame Republicans for the Washington Post and the Boston Globe getting everything wrong on the DNA tests where the lives with Warren\nBottom line is they're still defending Elizabeth Warren because they're a joke Glenn Kessler is a joke the fact checker\nOffice at the doctor even poses a complete joke it's a Democrat Party there might as well be funded by George Soros himself and and ah today but interestingly they give themselves that give the Washington Post three Pinocchios\nNow if they make great on a curve it should be for but he admits that the news reporting on the DNA test was a complete joke\nAnd in the end he circles back and says but it's still shows that she's part Indian and what she's always claimed as true so ... ... again it makes no sense they he spends four page you're saying everything we wrote about it was wrong\nEverything the Boston Globe wrote about it was wrong everything the RMC set about it was wrong although all they did was referring to a New York times article and the New York times article made a point that the Washington Post now says is wrong because they'll sacrifice to New York times when they're defending Elizabeth Warren\n[noise] he'd types on behalf of his party which is the Democratic party of the United states America it's a press release for Elizabeth Warren masquerading as a fact check at a news organization which is in fact not\nAfter being done by President Trump is

I'm going to go after college yes\nThere are ... are more who in the literature and others go\nYes completely unless there are a small number of states that have a prepaid tuition plan which is a form of a five twenty nine plan and those transfer very unfavorably to a different state but a traditional five twenty nine plan which is one that is an investment plan\nThat you put your money and it grows tax free as spent tax free\nIs usable in any of the fifty states for school and you're eligible once a year that let's say you don't end up liking your state plan you're allowed to even as he remain a resident of your state you're allowed\nTo move the money to a different state plant okay and have you seen my five twenty nine plan guide\nI have not now I have a car dot\nCom my list of the best plans in the country and I have hyper ... has a number of states have multiple plans\nAnd they may have to good plans and three bad plans or something like that so I got a link to the best plan available in each state\nOkay yeah college is one thing what are the odds that\nIn your family culture is your three year old going to college no matter what\nOr who ... or ... or ... ... ...\nThe reason I asked that he's you know with the five twenty nine and they're great last\nKid doesn't go to college and you don't have another child you can you can move the money to the tax treatment or five twenty nine money is great if it's used for eligible college expenses and his plane rotten if it's not used for college\nOkay we're going to ask it there are no [laughter]\nThat's why I asked the question because if the odds favor your child going to college then you just go ahead and do the five twenty nine because it's the best choice\nFor a kid but my preference is always for you to save the maximum you can\nIn your own name first before you look at options that might be available to put money aside for a child and my default go to is to you and your bride should be saving the maximum under the law\nIn a Roth IRA before you even consider putting money in a five twenty nine for your child\nOkay who's the raw has so much flexibility to it and it grows tax free and then you spend it tax free in retirement\nOkay and\nThen that would be that would be a choice I Would do way before I Would start looking at other things to put money aside for your son ...\nOr whatever a credit card the core college that Korea so\nSo there's an interesting twist to it the wrong if you Fifteen Years from now want to use some of that money for your son's college as long as you leave the earnings of it behind you can pull your contribution money out tax penalty free\nOkay\nSo it provides an additional level of flexibility that you don't have with the five twenty nine plan you're listening to the

down a little you'll see the phone number or an hour's bit off the air advice is available to you so I\nWant to talk to you about something that I've been getting a steady number of questions about on the air and ask Clark says well parents trying to figure out how to do allowance to school age kids\nOr how to pay school age kids for chores whatever's required in your family in order to get allowance\nAnd how to do that because how did you used to do that you gave people cash but now more and more\nThe parents of young children\nDon't carry cash themselves\nI mean why our ATM's disappearing all over the place because caches use so much less than it used to be\nParents using plastic 'cause all the kids ever see 'em do and the kids plastic is cash so that's led to a bunch of\nProducts that sort of steady stream of product introductions where\nYou have ... cards you as a parent can monitor on an app on your phone or on a website and you can even with some of these cars you can control where your kids spend money\nYou know the downside with these card programs is usually you have to pay fees to be part of these programs so you're paying money to be able to give money to your kids which I've never a fan of one in protest\nThe only though has been really intriguing to people in this green light\nWhich allows you to use green light as a way to try to encourage your kid to save you know I'm so into the daddy match on retirement plans where\nMy kids is teens as they are the two older ones are aging out of this but as they would save money from jobs I'm match it dollar for dollar\nGoing into a Ross IRA to encourage saving not spending\nBut we're talking about with the green light having one of those cards it costs you sixty bucks a year to have the card sixty\nSo that's a lot of money to pay to then have the ability to encourage you could say within the card plan\nSo this is going to be weird\nI Want you to turn back the clock\nAnd what I'd like you to do instead\nIs allowing to your kids were that archaic thing called money give 'em money you won't have to pay any fees for it kids get the finite and is with the actual money in their hands that they don't get with a plastic card\nAnd if you can afford to do a match\nLike greenlight does when you allowance a kid if they're willing to save money that they then turned over to you periodically for you to put it in a savings account or put an investment account or something like that you tell them the incentive is\nEvery dollar they don't spend you're going to match with the dollar to create that concept\nSo somebody comes up with a free card like usa\nNow my kids grew up with usa spending cards or whatever they call them where you have parental control and all that and it's all free\nI

with a couple of clicks to have it removed from the Internet in Europe across the entire European Union there is a law called the right to be forgotten\nSo if let's say somebody who's been subject to violence and they have gone into a tried to hide from the source of the violence let's say in the United states there's no procedure\nTo help you hide out from that individual so there's no war or anything like that in Europe somebody who's a a it doesn't even have to be for a reason that you fear for your wife you were allowed to put in a request\nTo have information about you suppressed and then it is\nNow there are some steps you can take it will delete some of the information out there about you\nAnd there's a wonderful well written clearly done article on seeing that have you ever

requirement or system in the United states that you'd be able to create anonymity\nK now there's lamb have there's actually positives that happen\nFrom all that information being there on anybody I was trying to find somebody I hadn't talked to in more than Twenty years band I went on the Internet and in three clicks I found a phone number for the guy\nAnd I called in to my shock it was his number and he answered the phone\nWhile there we had a grey I'm catching up and so this is this is a two sided coin but I Do feel that what the Europeans have done\nIs the right thing because of the number of instances where people faced danger is you have the ability to suppress information about themselves and we ... we just don't have any such thing\nWell you hear these ads on the radio you know where they can take it all off and then you read about it she go on line and you read about it and they're written and people are so\nVery there is no magic way to delete information that

having money in a variety of stocks not your employers and in fact ... percent I like to have an employer's on stock and a four one K. is zero percent\nThis is good advice until the part about not having any four one K. money and employers and stock\nThere is nothing wrong with having some money and ... and ... especially if you work for a stable company or a blue chip\nCompany listed on the ... the Dow Jones they're present is actually too conservative eliminating any risk when especially young workers should be taking on some limited risk\nThank you and let me respond to that so I'm really strident about not having employers stock in your retirement plan because a lot of people would\nHave um an issue with investing where if employers stock is offered\nIn a four one K. people go way too much all in with the employer stock I have to be really really stark in stride and with that\nTo get people's attention because people feel like oh I work here I Know everything's great to be wonderful to have my retirement and my employer ... too many eggs in one basket 'cause you're also getting a paycheck from that employer\nAnd you never know when a company finds it's lost its way look at one of the blue is to blue chips General Electric\nThat isn't so much financial trouble now and if people working for the very heavily put GE stuck in their retirement plan\nThey avoid too much risk involved I'll say this if you really feel a strong sense of loyalty to where you worked and\nCompany's stock has one of the options you can put in up to ten percent of your four one K. and company stock just so you feel like you're showing that loyalty but no more than that but my preference still remains zero\nYour advice was less than stellar and certainly not complete about building a home and I needed to head up wind as a result I had a great experience building a home although I hired a general contractor my brother is an architect and designer home provided excellent blueprints from just a few photos I've provided\nAsked him to act as a general contractor and he immediately declined he said it would be impossible for him to get the best subcontractors since he lives in another state\nAnd one bad subcontractor can be a huge headache for a homeowner\nHe suggested identify a locally owned an independent lumber yard and construction supplies to or not one of the chain stores that had been around for a long time\nHe said call them and ask for the general manager or even better the owner for a reference for a good Jaycee he said they will know who pays their bills on time who does good work who buy the cheap supplies for the good\nStuff who has a crew who has a good reputation etcetera I got a reference there and my general contractor did a great job that is a\nFantastic posted in thank you for sharing it it's funny when I talked to people who have actually built their own home\nUsually when I asked people if they would do it again the answer is flat out no in your case it worked out very well and I love the methodical process but you're a brother the architect recommended\nWe recently had an article on on a clock dot com called why you should be aware of sharing a bank account with an elderly parents and this is about that I share a checking account with my elderly father why I collect the S.

using software or an online service to draft a well however legal documents especially wills are not an area in which saving money is paramount getting it right is what counts\nFirst computer program is no substitute for the advice of competing attorney accompanied attorney will ask questions of the client drafted will that will meet the needs of the client and explain that will in simple terms that the climate not understand the document\nAbout computers can drop the will that includes the results of a questionnaire computers are not yet capable of doing\nOf doing for providing advice tell

done if it will is not properly executed as required by state law that document will be invalid\nThis problem is surprisingly common as many people are not very good at reading understanding or following instructions also the average person is not going to recognize their mistakes due to lack of knowledge and experience at the turn of an attorney\nAs a result the problem with the execution of computer generate document wells probably will not be discovered until the executor attempt to follow the court house after the tested or has died\nThan a clerk at the courthouse will probably catch the air and rejecting the validly executed well at this point it's impossible to ... park your advice on using software online services the giant well it's a bit stinky\nThank you very much for

airlines try and fees for everything especially for bags and you can have a bag that is a fraction of an inch larger than what an airline allows and they're gonna tear your wallet apart\nCharge you all kinds of fees so\nIs I share with you a few months ago when my daughter was headed off to college we flew on southwest 'cause bags are free huge in check to bags each person free and so we were able to car dollar stuff off to college\nAnd so I was meticulously using a tape measure to make sure we met total inches and breached dimension and all that and gosh it was\nReally kind of a pain to make sure that the bags are okay and would carry ons you have to deal with that was spirit frontier in legion if you go by just an end of an inch over suddenly they charge you a hundred bucks potentially at the gate\nFor your micro carry on being too large\nSo now kayak\nAs a new feature that will actually figure out\nIf your bag is A L K for whoever it is you're fly\nAnd it only works right now for certain iPhones know Android version yet but with it\nYou can just with your iPhone\nTake the camera or whether kayak out and it takes a digital image of the luggage calculates the dimensions and then we'll be able to tell you yes or no you're okay with that bag\nNow I Know this drives people crazy but whenever there's an issue on when I fly a legion frontier spirit\nI always take a black trash bag with me so they were jak my carry on\nI Will abandon the carry on suitcase and put my possessions and the black trash bag\nAnd that was not original with me I saw it happen and the spirit gate\nWhere somebody was prepared\nAnd put their things into the trash bag avoided the hundred dollar gate check fee and just carried their stuff\nAnd the black trash bag and so I'm always prepared you know Boy Scout motto will always be prepared right so I'm prepared and isn't it funny that that's where we are the strangest thing though\nIs it's hard to tell who's a full for airline

it go this way there are only two reasons for worrying either you're successful or you're not if you're successful there's nothing to worry about if you're not\nThere are only two things to worry about your health is going to be good are you going to get sick that your health is good there's nothing to worry about if you're sick whether only two things to worry about it you're going to get well or you're going to die\nAnd if you're going to get well there's nothing to worry about\nBut if you're going to die and then there are only two things to worry about either you're going to go to heaven or not and if you're going to go to heaven there's nothing to worry about I mean so why worry there does seem to be an obvious point in this I mean if you're a life sentence with one who made you then there's nothing to worry about\nIs there\nI'm Larry west with World Radio and I care speaking for churches of Christ we care I have a Bible study course years free write me World Radio west

Susan\nHi Claire thing you can let your taking my call my pleasure [laughter]\nI Love listening to you and I have a question on flood insurance and getting ready to purchase a home that is absolutely going to require\nThat I get flood insurance and I thought that the only option as a a little it was government flood insurance that I'm In the insurance carrier that I'm getting insurance\nAnd from gave me the option of pie that flood insurance and I didn't know how that can care and governmental insurance and the I shouldn't even consider\nSo private flood insurance is only a backstop if you're buying a very expensive dwelling ... you need a backstop beyond the federal flood insurance program the federal flood insurance program is subsidized by your fellow taxpayers\nOkay and so the first dollar loss you want to go against the federal flood insurance program and uh it's really simple to buy it there's a website that explains everything about\nThe federal program it floods smart dot Gov and homes that the structure itself or the you know native land you don't consider the land\nBut I have um\nA value of a quarter million dollars or less okay you're fully covered by the federal flood insurance policy how much is this home you're buying likely word\nAnd it will be covered for like three hundred thousand dollars\nOkay so you could I mean you got [noise] you have a situation huge stack additional private flood insurance on top of it in the in the situation where this house is that you're buying\nWould've applied to create a total loss of the houses are multi story like what's this getting like\nIt is a one story house and home at the beach\nOkay so do I have ...\nTime the saying anyway says you Susan okay I have a second home at the beach and I have a homeowner's policy\nI have a wind storm policy and those are both private [noise] I have the federal flood insurance for the two fifty and then I have private flood insurance for the access\nSo a much more complicated and with a second home I should tell you you and I don't get the same subsidy that people do with a primary residence\nAnd I think that's just as it should be I mean why should why should our fellow taxpayers be subsidizing us to the hill when it's okay uh you know and it's a second home\nBut it is generally cheaper\nTo have the first quarter million under the federal program and in your case she'd have potentially a widow supplement private policy\nAnd ... the question is there any ... from having a separate land power the from the ... versus a combined let's say or is it just\nWould generally what they do is uh is it would be from the same ensure but ... charge you a premium separate for but when storm would call when storm\nOkay All right that's great\nAnd one thing is you should know to get ready for the joys of having a place on the water which is great but I Know that there will often be a larger deductible on that policy when it's a name storm\nOK okay All right

Matthews noted her GOP opponents secretary of state Brian Kemp currently oversees the state election\nIt has always been about power she says\nIt's always been about who gets to control the life for this country and who gets to determine how we all live our lives all of that's what it is I don't see how the Democrats win what are they running on their running on I hate Trump She went on to say that's what it's all\nHe's been about and so the more people you have coming into the electorate are the more you dilute the current powers structural straw structure this is not just the right it's a birthright this is something that every American is entitled to by virtue of being here and being a citizen and frankly the\nPeople who are in power have taken an oath to uphold this constitution set themselves up and try and restrict that is really disgraceful and that's the real problem that we're seeing here as well to say that you don't want him to intimidate people is great\nBut look these laws are designed to intimidate restricting early voting is designed to intimidate voter ID laws are ... are designed to scare people away from the process\nNow they're they're designed to ensure that we actually have people voting who should be voting and in Texas and the Democrats are asking non citizens to register to vote Washington Times\nThey ask non citizens to register to vote sending out applications to immigrants would the box citizenship already checked\nSo you don't have to lie about it that was it was the way I got it checked yes according to new complaints filed yesterday after prosecutors see what laws may have been broken\nThe public interest legal foundation alerted district attorneys and the federal Justice Department to the pre check applications\nAnd also included assigning half a day but from a man who said some of his relatives who are not citizens receive the mailing according to Logan church well he's a spokesman for P.

Russian woman today\nHas been charged with interfering in American elections including next month's midterms through a vast social media effort\nAimed at trying to sway American public opinions that's according to the Associated Press it's believed to be the first federal case alleging Russian interference in this year's elections and remember what they've been saying to\nKirsten a a Nielsen VHS secretary has said that the Chinese are trying to influence the election to who do you think they're trying to into and they're trying to influence people to vote against the Republicans of course of course\nJustice Department disclose the criminal complaint soon after U.S intelligence agencies setting a joint statement that they were concerned about efforts by Russia China and Iran to influence us voters and policy this complaint says the woman Alina Alex ...\nWorks for the same Russians social media troll farm that was indicted in February by Robert Mueller\nThe complaint accuses her of helping to control the finances of a Russian effort to use fake social media postings to so anger and division among American voters now what they're doing in many cases is they're taking both sides of the issue\nSo why are they doing this I've done a lot of studying on it but I've done a lot of studying on this issue\nAnd it seems to me that the Russians are trying to\nDiminish our influence in Europe\nAnd if they can so discontent amongst us and create chaos in America it takes our eye off the ball about what they're trying to do in the European Union\nWhich is to control those folks with oil and gas and everything else they want to do and have their way with the European Union you know they've already made deals with Russia signed deals and not even supposed to be making NATO countries are not supposed to be doing that\nBut they're doing it anyway same thing with Iran we're trying to keep people from dealing with Iran and they're going to deal with Iran anyway an Iran China and Russia are trying to screw with our elections again and we'll see what happens we'll see what happens\nEarlier the AP reported that um\n[noise] but U.S intelligence officials say they're concerned about ongoing campaigns by Russia China and Iran but here's the interesting thing to their only focusing on the Russia you know why\nBecause of the Mueller investigation and the I guess the insinuation is is it that Russia is meddling is bound to be involving Trump and they're involved in meddling in the elections to its Russia it's China and its Iran\nAnd they don't say who's the bigger culprit but I can almost guarantee you're China's the biggest culprit but they don't emphasize that they mentioned it several paragraphs down\nIn a joint statement the office of the director of national intelligence the homeland security department the Justice Department or the FBI said they're worried about activities that seat to influence voter perceptions and decision making and the twenty Eighteen and twenty twenty elections\nThe Asians say the ongoing campaigns could take many forms examples include attempts to influence voters through social media sponsoring content in the English language media such as Russian outlet our team\nOr feeding this information through sympathetic spokespersons regarding political candidates and disseminating foreign propaganda\nIntelligence officials said last year that Russia sought to influence the twenty sixth in presidential election through similar means what they don't tell you is it they were going on both sides you had pro burning stuff anti Bernie stuff pro Hillary stuff\nAnti Hillary stuff pro Trump stuff anti Trump stuff\nAnytime there's black lives matter involved in something with the police there in the middle of that too on social media anytime there's a secession movement in California or Texas they're on both sides of that any when they can drive a wedge between America and that's what they're doing\nAnd the idea is to get us at each other's throats so that we take the eye off the ball on foreign matters they're trying to have their way around the world and they think that if they make us\nTotally discombobulated over here in the United states that we will be weakened so this is a concerted effort on the part of China or Iran and Russia\nTo just screw with us and if anybody doesn't see this by now this is not Trump and Russia conspiring to win an election Mrs Russia they don't care who wins what I say they don't care who wins I think they would rather not have trumping there certainly after he's gotten in\nA but they want to so this content they want us at each other's throats and his work and you look around the country we're at each other's throats about all sorts of stuff and a lot of stuff that really doesn't matter\nYou don't think that they're involved in all of these mom protests and things like this of course they are we found out during twenty sixteen there was an anti Trump rally\nThat was sponsored as we found out later by some Russian troll\nGroup on Facebook and they weren't even asked me a rally they just encourage other people to show up so people showed up anti

democracies you see the show we were just talking to the wrong shiny nose\nAnd Russia trying to influence the midterm elections usually to chat with is about Iranian oil headed for China and he's on the line with us which one of their you know Richard how are you\nDoing great how are you I'm doing very well\nIt's ironic that we have this Russian woman arrested today she's part of this trolling social media operation where they're trying to influence the midterm elections and beyond\nThe AP story of course doesn't tell you that they're trying to influence both sides are trying to get us to all of us didn't show others throats as they didn't twenty sixteen but they also mentioned later on in the article\nThat they also know that China and you're wrong\nAnd are trying to influence and you're going to tell us about Iranian oil heading for China is rather ironic in light of what we know today\nWill absolutely we know that Iran like Russia and China or one of the most threatening cyber actors out there right now trying to attack us or in the cyber\nRealm and also influence our elections a they have reason to because the sanctions that President Trump has reimpose come back a full effect on November Seth\nAnd the Iranian economy has already shrinking now the IMF says warning that we're going to look at a recession in Iran after a massive expansion during the Obama era Iran nuclear deal\nUntil the Iranian regime right now is looking for ways to evade that pressure or it's going to be hard for them to to to find ways to do that one of them are we just learned about is trying to uh send ships with their oil out to various parts of the world including China\nHoping that the after the sanctions are in fact they'll still be able to sell their oil on the black market\nSo are they not going to be selling it directly to China as we speak or or or what's going on with it I mean is this a men are they going to wait for the sanctions to be lifted are they going to go ahead and to find the sanctions\nYeah so it's important to kind of take a step back first does understand where we're at a back in may before President Trump withdrew from the Iran nuclear deal and that sanctions were going to come back and six months\nAnd the Iranians were exporting about two and a half million barrels per day of oil to the world a record high uh since well before the Iran nuclear deal it taken effect before the sanctions have come into play under the Obama stretching and so what\nWe saw over the last six months a steady decline says countries prepare for sanctions to come back\nAnd we believe that uh after November says that number of down their exports could fall too between one million and one and a half million barrels per day so taking a million or perhaps a million and a half miles per day of Iranian exports off the market a massive impact to Iran\nUnder the sanctions after November says if you're a country that has received a waiver from the United states to continue exporting ... importing rather\nIranian oil because you have significantly reduced then you can continue to do that but if you have\nNot received one of those waivers any bank to process the transaction is subject to sanctions and so what I think the Iranians are doing right now is they're preparing for a couple of scenarios one because so much of their oil is coming off the market so fast\nThey're afraid they may have to shut down production wells and they don't want to do that because of the domestic impact that would have\nAnd so they're trying to just keep flooding the market even if it's just on floating storage on big shift sitting in the middle of the Indian Ocean and second if they have oil in places that we may not know about\nA it becomes harder for us to detect when they might flip out the shipping label on some of these\nBoxes and some of these tankers and Senate suddenly you might think that you are buying oil that came from Iraq or came from Saudi Arabia or came from somewhere else even though the actual original contents were around him\nSo is it seemed to saying that some of these folks are actually getting the oil may not know where it's coming from or they they complicit in all this and they know about the label switching before it gets to them\nThere are black market actors no question whether they're in China or elsewhere that will be\nReady to make some money or just as in any other illicit trade or by trying to sell a sanctioned Iranian oil or as something else\nAnd so I'm unless we do something drastic ah to Saudi Arabia to impact their oil supply or one would think that we're we're very much in in the realm of eighty dollar a created at this point on on the brands\nAnd I hate to think of it being political but everything's political ... it would to me um unimaginable to Trump will do anything about Saudi Arabia before November six because that may have some kind of impact on the oil prices so we're probably going to see all of them is taking care of after the midterm elections are I mean\nI think that uh you know they're ... or or I'll get some sort of answers this week maybe even today or tomorrow\nI'm I think that they're on a timeline that is presumably separate from politics uh but uh you know the timing may work out that that something does happen after the terms or just because that's how the investigation holds out\nInteresting Richard Goldberg would the foundation for defense of democracies we have a Lincoln film at one time dot com on your show prep these are expert in the bay Richard

eye to it it's it's almost like saying well we can't accuse somebody because their moslem even though they're they're talking crazy stuff about jihad but then we'll be accused as being anti Islam or something so we just don't say anything you folks been watching\nFor heavy watch Jack Ryan it's good I mean it's it's typical Clancy stuff you know I'm a I mean I like that but it is a lot of high tech and you know 'cause some of the stuff is in March Julie believable\nBut in one of the things you have a Jack Ryan talking to a superior and they're talking about essentially profiling Jack Ryan is upset that he didn't that he saw something that should have been a red flag for him and he didn't say something because\nWell it would you know it would mean that he was profiling somebody\nAnd so his boss who was moslem and is now it wasn't in the original you know Clancy books but his boss is his Muslim no and so he he gives them an example he said let me tell you something let me tell you story\nHe said on nine eleven\nHe said there was an airline attendants and it wasn't the one I've always talked about 'cause that's where that's really too damning when you eat this guy saw Mohammed Ali time one of his accomplices as I saw them and I said this is not a terrorist I don't know who is but then I had the mentally slap myself because we're not allowed to profile it wasn't that story\nCases and I assume this is a true story that they're taking out of history that one of the ticket agents\nWas um the processing the tickets for two people that got on the plane and they had bought two first class tickets\nAnd he says as they walked away I noticed that their shoes were of poor quality and ... up and dirty and they didn't really comport with them and the rest of their dress and a first class tickets\nAnd so this guy asked Jack Ryan what was that guy supposed to do alert the authorities because of their shoes you just can't do that and I went\nWell hell yes you can do that if you think there's something strange about somebody's appearance or whatever and you have a reason to suspect them for whatever reason what happened all they see something say something\nAnd I'm I'm shaking my head as he is going well of course you can't say stuff about that of course you can that's what the whole see something say something about if something doesn't add up then maybe

just leave that alone\nIf there's nothing to find and then they'll find nothing now I Know what you're saying bill trumped up something bill fabricate one of the fact comes to pass then we have to deal with that as it is\nBut it would be a great thing we went through this entire process and we say look\nFrom the standpoint of the nation and this investigation we've gone through two years of exhausting investigation into whether there was collusion between Trump the Trump campaign and the Russians and we've found nothing\nAt that point you're going to watch the liberals heads expose explode they don't know what to do with it they're counting all look they\nCounted on for Hillary winning the election right\nThen they put all their eggs in the basket of all the electoral college won't seen him they won't they won't approve a new one and that didn't happen and then they moved on to impeach months and then they moved on to Russia and then they pivot it over to Stormy Daniels

of calling up in the military and we got out of the military say they're not coming into this country they might as well turned back and not coming into this kind of tourist\nAh but other than that but it's not really anything to to announce as far as the polling data not real clear politics\nIs a is advertising the day it's just I mean who knows the big wildcard is going to be turn out and I was looking at the turn out for\n'em I guess I don't know where they don't all attendance either nationally or whatever they were talking about it's only a thousand below what the turnout was on the first day of early voting in twenty sixteen I don't know what that means I mean usually in a midterm election\nYou have the turnout way lower than it was in a presidential this is right up there where it was two years ago does that mean that it's good for Trump\nDoes it mean to the Democrats are energized who knows I guess we'll find out soon enough after November six but it tells me to the Democrats are um well they're they're they're nervous and the nervous on\nSo many fronts and you see they raised all this money in a billion dollars\nOver a billion dollars when the Republicans have a candidate to raise about seven hundred million and ... you know I've seen and obviously you've seen Anne's but you haven't seen a billion dollars worth of ads yet and that's what scares me\nBecause if they're going to unload those starting probably Tuesday two weeks before the election there's no telling what they're going to say and and and if they do it a week or two or three days\nThe election they can say a lot of stuff that doesn't get checked and doesn't get countered by the Republicans because they don't have the money to counter it I mean they're looking at a deficit of you know over three hundred million dollars to combat some of the stuff so\nI don't know what to tell you other than you keep your fingers crossed and vote you get out being vote that is going to be the key and it always is and we tell people this every year every election year\nAnd then what happens is is the folks who get their folks out may win and the folks who didn't get their folks out lose it is clear is that and I don't know why people don't understand is\nBy understand this I votes\nAre a lot of you folks vote most of the people who are tuned into this radio show vote whether you're on the rider on the left because you're engaged in this kind of stuff but there are a lot of folks out there who are just not engage and they don't care and sometimes you just can't make them care\nThe Democrats thought that they had their issue with Trump and then the Kavanaugh saying came along and sort of blew them out of the water I saw a poll was it yesterday or whatever and analysis or something\nAnd they were saying that the Kavanaugh thing does not help the Democrats at all and could marginally help the Republican so if that's the case and it's that close then Kavanaugh could be the deciding factor and speaking of Kavanaugh\nWe now have ladies and gentlemen to people or one person a New Yorker who is arrested for murder threats against two senators who voted for the cabin or confirmation a and miss writing when I saw this this afternoon and they had not identified the senators who had been threatened\nBut the man is it in a fight is Seventy four year old Ronald ... of Smithtown New York he left more than ten threatening voice mails where the offices of two senators who were not identified according to the U.S attorney's office for the eastern district of New York\nThe messages were related to Kavanaugh's nomination to the Supreme Court and according to the Justice Department\nThe reef the left the voice mails with the goal of discouraging the senators from backing Kavanaugh's confirmation and one message left for the first senator on September twenty seventh ... threatened to shoot the senator if he voted for Kavanaugh\nOr the caller said it's a nine millimeter side of your ... skull you scum\nBags mother ... sounds like a nice guy knows me and at the end of the call the man said yeah Cavanaugh I don't think so\nSame send or receive a second voice mail to a district office later that day says we're tired of this guy sucking taxpayers' money getting of uh eh thing free ride the enemy real careful almost said something there [noise] how many more years

to that because they don't want anybody to know who these senators are\nBut thanks for sending us your address that does help I think you will be in touch see you soon see you soon\nThey allegedly called the senator's office multiple times more but he didn't leave messages federal law enforcement was unable was able to identify the racy in part through a phone and bank records he was arrested

called two senators and left that kind of trash on there and now there's guys and heat big trouble wonder what's gonna happen to them I couldn't tell you the Russian woman charged today\nAs we're finding out more about her her name was Alina\nA alec saved a cushy and nova\nShe worked for the same Russian social media troll farm that was indicted in February by Robert Mueller\nThe complaint accuses serve helping to control the finance is a Russian effort to use fake social media postings to so anger and division among American voters what they don't tell you until way down in the story\nIs that the Justice Department disclosed the criminal complaint soon after U.S intelligence agencies said in a joint statement that they were concerned about efforts by Russia China an Iran to influence us voters and policy in the upcoming midterm election and on into twenty twenty\nSo this is a concerted effort by our enemies out there to so chaos\nAmongst all of us and let me tell you they're doing a heck of a job aren't they now I don't know I oh I Do know it's not just the Russians and the Chinese and the Iranians sewing discontent that's causing discontent in this country\nThere is truth discontent because of Donald Trump and it's not his fault it's their fault\nYou know I didn't vote for or Morocco mama twice I didn't vote for him\nBut I didn't lose my mind over it\nYou know when he got elected the first time okay and then when he got re elected the second time and I really thought that we had a good shot at that time well okay we move on you continue to be the loyal opposition but you don't lose your mind and scream and shout how many of you\nIt would occur to you\nTo follow some congressman or some cabinet member in the Obama administration and scream at them at a restaurant and drive them out of public view\nIt never would occur to me to do that now there is a video going around that day I'm Nancy Pelosi going somewhere and she's entering through some back entrance\nAnd some of Yahoo's are out there screaming you F in trainer and all this other stuff and they supposedly right wing folks they say they're the [noise] what is that the ah\nOne of those boys that that group whatever group is any way\nI Can't remember but whenever they they claimed that they are part of that group and of course the folks at the Southern Poverty Law Center had labeled them hate speakers and hate group I don't know I mean that could be I don't know anything about these folks\nAre but just because the Southern Poverty Law Center says there hate group does that make them so they said I was a hey speaker for crying out loud because I was against illegal immigration but\nAs I said on Twitter today I said look as a conservative I'm willing to say that this is a mob these folks Ramadi was screaming profanity Nancy that's not the way to conduct yourself folks\nAnd if you're really a conservative you really wanting to influence people don't act like that\nAll that does is turn people off it it it serves no useful purpose what do you expect to accomplish by screaming Nancy you F in trainer is she's going into some entrance somewhere\nI can understand standing up there and protesting against Nancy Pelosi but then gathering around her and screaming and spending like you've lost your mind you looked like leaves left these out there that have lost their minds you look crazy\nSo I Am calling this a mob too and I can guarantee you I don't watch CNN I certainly don't watch 'em on I'm On the radio and they probably got this story cycling every five minutes talking
