George Washington university here in Washington DC and Jonathan Turley was on the television this morning on the Fox news channel now\nNot a big right winger he's not a big by go is taking the party line position that's not his thing\nBut he is a constitutional lawyer and professor I'm sure a merits us\nAnd he's been around for quite a while as gray hair\nAnd so he was on this morning talk about the fourteenth amendment on what the president said\nAt CNN or their their said oh he's an idiot and he's wrong it is a racist and this is Dina phobic just like the Washington Post says you know phobic and all that said ...\nThey just love calling everybody racist and harvesting the organs of young black children there's two things I liked very much Jonathan Turley this morning on the fourteenth amendment and or what the president said and whether it\nHolds water whether it's serious ... first of all we have to remember the purpose of the amendments the amendment was put forward because\nMany states we're trying to deny freed slaves the full rights than power of citizenship Democrats or the sentence was designed to guarantee that those Americans who are recognized the full citizens\nNow that clause is what has caused the confusion says the minute this was ratified there's been a debate about unlimited birthright citizenship\nAnd there's been confusion and debate from the very beginning and they the immediate post civil war era and he said we have to look at the purpose of the original intent was intended to get full rights to free the slaves of full rights\nOf citizenship and and he said you're from Mr glee that there were those in certain states they were Democrats in southern states that didn't want to grant full right so that's the purpose of the fact and and then later and I'm really not to a hundred years later in the Nineteen sixties did we start to expand\nThe meaning the interpretation of the language contained in the fourteenth amendment and now President Trump is causing us to take another look at the language\nAnd it will be sorted out and I would put to you that first of all legislation should be passed so you know liberals loved being in sync with European countries it would put us in sync with European countries to do away with our current\nBirthright citizenship status you know not a lot of people go to ... to take advantage of their birthright citizenship\nUh Ireland's done away with an England's on her with her friends who've done it with her journey has done or they've uh they've all done away with it all the places liberals go on vacation they've done away with birthright citizenship\nJonathan Turley well what did the authors of the fourteenth amendment in tend to what were they talking about and I was reading earlier from some of the uh the language from\nTime with I don't even know where to begin with so many things wrong with that I\nDon't even know where to begin with because it's all one hundred

run out of years\n[laughter] yeah thank you so much for taking my question and I wear a vest sorry don't be nervous were just having fun here I've been\nListening here forever so it's like it's a real honor to talk to 'em but I was wondering if you had an alternative to what we always hear that four percent role as far as that's in LA and retirement\nWell I I Love to four percent rule and let me explain what that is so that others do with that is mathematically\nYou're very likely never are the odds are very low you'd ever run out of all your money if you never spent more than four percent of what you've saved in any year and retirement now there is an alternative that I can tell you that I have\nAh been really interested in in recent years because of the fact that we don't know there's no crystal ball says exactly how long we're going to whip and the big concern is if we're blessed with exceedingly long life that our money may not\nStretch as long as our years might so there's something called longevity insurance have you ever heard that term before\nHe I've heard you talk about that\nSo longevity insurance works generally I'm most commonly where you just try to make your money lasts 'til age eighty five\nAnd then early and retirement you buy was a pretty cheap policy\nThat provides a big monthly benefit every month that you live beyond age eighty five is they're counting on the fact that most people's life spans won't go that long and they just get to keep the premiums from those who don't live that long and then if somebody does\nGet lucky in the longevity department there okay money wise because from their eighty fifth birthday forward for as long as they live\nThey get a huge check every month that will cover pretty much anything you'd want to spend money on unless you like I'm buying gold jewelry all the time are flying or whatever\n[laughter] 'cause I always you always hear about four percent role was not touching the a and I was just wondering if there are people who don't have children or don't have anyone younger than ... you know to leave the egg kill if you're not worried about that what kind of numbers should be thinking\nAll right so that's the beauty of the longevity insurance is that you spend all your money but you have\nEvery last sent you have the day you turn eighty five you got nothing basically and then the insurance they see the rest of the way but in your family tree how long do people tend to live\nUm it has has varied and it's kind of all over the place so so people haven't been into their nineties some people just tend to the early seventies\nSo are you know in my family it the ranges much wider than that\nUh how how young people die and I'm getting close to my expiration date as a male and my family tree already so who knows what I've gotten in front of me but um I play on where I'm OK moving forward and in my case I Do have\nFamily that it's going to be behind me so the question I ask often if you're worried about uh you know living to frugal life and you hit a point where you've got all this money left over is there any charitable organization that really means a lot to you\nOh yeah and I I don't think it's a matter of having too much [laughter] but having and just you know probably more like ... to for the oil and the president\nBecause there is an angle on a charitable giving where you can give money to an organization and then they in turn essentially set up the equivalent of a pension for you\nAnd as long as you're living they send you or a company that they've contracted with sends you a check every month for the rest of your life and then at the time you do pass away they're done paying you and they have the benefit of the money you donate it\nYeah okay\nAnd so that would be an alternative but I'm the four percent rule\nMakes sense in that later in life ... if you do end up with longer life like one of your family members that lives in their nineties\nBe any tend to have more medical expenses later you may need help from you know may need somebody assisting you you know I'm with living\nIn that case you've got the money and what you preserved to provide for the care you might mean later in life even if you decided not to buy a longevity insurance policy\nRyan's with us on the car coward show Hi Ryan\nHow are you doing great thank you Ryan you have an impossible question for me pretty much\nWhat I was hoping that it was not impossible hit me with it um I was wondering what the best way to get the best price on all these for vehicle\nGetting a good deal on a lease is really really hard because in a lease it so easy for a profit to be hidden in the deal and God chose to be hidden and the mice type so leases are generally\nPushed on people that are interested in what the cost is per month and that's really where they focus and it becomes so hard to know whether or not you're getting a deal the only exception to that\nAnd it's the only one I Know is if a manufacturer is promoting in their ads a specific manufacture a leaf steel and this isn't done most heavily and the luxury in near luxury vehicle markets\nWhite the price point kind of vehicle are you interested in or what brand\nOr I was thinking you know more of a truck I'm for GMC um you know nothing's super luxurious\nAll right ah that would not be a market where I'd recommend leasing okay because\nWhen people by a truck what do they tend to do they work at to death and they drive it for a long time right\nTypically but uh I I don't I don't drive every day so by the company did call it a drive to and from work\nThen you are you are absolutely not a candidate for always know because leases are calculated based on\n... says and if this is like a weekend kind of vehicle going

really nice person as a landlord but that's where it in a\nWay to think about one thing you hear no all I got like I said I Do have a great relationship with my lead or however we definitely need some air oh I'm Wondering what the best way I thought about I guess getting her out she's actually\nAnother state who and she doesn't use a property manager right so what I recommend if there are things that are nagging that need repairing she probably doesn't want to deal with them and it may even be just the hassle\nEven more than the cost she doesn't\nWant to lose a tenant so what I Would recommend is that you send her pictures of what needs repairing\nAnd say you know ... you know she's across because she's not nearby and then it's a hassle for her that you are willing to oversee the repairs and you'll even pay for them and just to duck the costs from your rent moving forward\nI think it was before so out of the fact that I guess than the fact anything because\nI'm saying that you'll go a step further and we'll pay for repairs and oversee them\nThat way she's not laying out the money you're deducting from your future rent for those repairs\nSo you're making sure you're there to watch the contractor make sure he or she does a good job you're paying for it but you're only laying out the money in advance that you're getting back with the offset of or at\nLeast you have\nAt his work so well for so many people may not every landlords gonna agree to it but if she somewhere else in the country all she wants from that place if she wants to check right\nSo if you're in a position where she can't handle the things that need to be handled the risk she faces is that you say you know I really like you but I got to move\nAnd then her rent income coming in goes to zero and before she can rent to somebody else she's going to probably have to do the repairs anyway since she's got no money coming in and she's having to lay out money for the repairs\nI share All right well I appreciate it in ...\nAnd you know what if she blows you off on doing it where you take the burden off of her what does that tell you that Israel right\nBernie is with us on the Clark Howard

clock I Love deals too so I'm hoping you going to come to the rescue\nSo boy is any and deals don't go together [noise]\nYeah that's what I've found um I'm a my wife and our five fifty five or both postal workers and we're looking to take two of our oldest grandkids to Florida and it's just\nAn average ticket\nIs anywhere from three to three fifty a person and you know and that's not even including universal and I'm just wondering do you know of any kind of budget spending I can we can do to get a two oldest grandkids to Florida\nSo the thing with Disney and universal\nIs that you can only save money on the things around your trip like where you stay where you eat but you will find it extremely frustrating trying to save money on the actual admissions\nOkay and that's just the way it is that\nThere is something that you may have heard and that's that\nDizzy and universal now we're using variable pricing or what is often referred to as dynamic demand pricing were what you pay to get into the parks is based on demand either historical demands of the day you want to go\nOr rolling demand for the day you want to go to the price is no longer necessarily the price\nDisney is now set\nRates where you can go look at a calendar and see what it costs for each day at the park and Disney isn't using a huge number of prices yet\nBut that's one way you can save a little bit of money is you take the grand kids at a time that Disney's charging its lowest prices per day\nHere we were actually looking in November ... nobody wants to go to Florida in June July and August uh we're actually looking at November or the beach you know my wife's big into the Christmas decorations and we'll figure that you know she could get a lot of satisfaction out of that it wouldn't be as hot so\nWe found that some of the price and during that time of year is the oil actually in the crowds are not as bad either for what we're here\nExactly now the cheapest two weeks historically or the year or actually in early December right after the Thanksgiving holiday and so I don't know if that's a time that you know kids\n... postal workers early December is kind of like a boom period so it's kind of\nForget that possible to get off\nYou know members you know help you also the housing should be a fair amount cheaper than have you ever heard me talk about Maus savers dot com no\nGo check

and you walk in the door and say okay we got to give him the best deal possible but how did you do that Thirteen dollars a day\nNobody nobody's giving me a special deal because I Walk out because I thought in my car rental specials ahead of time\nOkay and I do a number of things to look for deals I always start at Expedia dot com because Expedia does a great survey of all the car rental companies\nOkay and so you can see the prevailing rate that everybody has and that'll give me what I Need to know to then go to price line dot com and built on a car rental\nOkay you know most of the

date on that one other thing is that you would be wise to book a car rental early and then re shop at me and once you do a price I bet if they accept it you can't do this step for these long haven't book price I just spoke to a regular car rental from wherever\nThe week before you go ... shop your car rental and I'd say at least eighty percent of the time\nCar rental rates have dropped from when

credit it's natural kind of show we do and there's a change coming that is both potentially advantageous and at the same time confusing\nPeople are more aware now or what their credit scores are than they used to be and I say scores plural because each of us have many different stores based on what data's being crunch from what credit bureau and what scoring method is being used for the market for credit scoring\nIs dominated by a company called fight go\nUsed to be known and the marketplaces fair Isaac now just referred to his fight go\nBecause what people refer to as the psycho score\nWill fight go\nHas come up with a new scoring method that goes into effect in just a couple of months where if a lender uses it and your traditional credit score\nDoesn't have enough to what your credit report is that there's not enough and foe there to be able to make with good confidence\nA decision on whether or not you would be a worthy borrower a good customer for cell phone plan satellite service whatever\nThe lender for the company will be able to request an ultra psycho score\nThe altar psycho score is based on how you handle money outside\nOf credit so it accounts for things like how you pay regular bills how do you handle your checking account things like that and this is becoming something more common when I talk about alternatives to traditional ways of establishing credit\nThey're using new algorithms are using new formula so using new ways to crunch who you are to decide whether you're somebody who should be lent to and not being used in the United states but heavily overseas\nBelieve it or not lending decisions are being made based on your what's referred to his social media score the way you engage with other people in your life\nOutside of the traditional methods and there's a belief that based on your interactions with other people\nThese alternative scoring models\n... the people who do these believe they can predict with near certainty who's going to pay back alone and who's not based on how you engage with other people in your daily life\nTo this one goes doing doesn't go that outside the box but it will consider things about how you handle money just generally and not necessarily with loans it will be up though to each lender\nAnd each company you want to do business with if they subscribed to ultra psycho\nOr not\nMike is

involved in the transaction that there was no way they could have been selling it at that price it would be considered to be reasonable in their part to tell you they're not going to honor it on the

news and information say she told us you\n\nKnow back in his tiny oh and there was one radio\nNetwork in order to boil their water\nWater I\nGot a bunch of millennials that um\nAnd they tell me with some of their friends are saying brings alumnus socialism a\nReal fear free college education removes Freeman\nForgive their student loans on as well they don't realize it's somebody's going to pay for our next guest is Tony ... and the peace in the Weekly Standard today runs for the Weekly Standard about socialism is popular only because people don't know what\nIt is and I think is actually right into news on the line to chat with his mother Tony how are you\nI'm doing great how are you\nI'm super duper so you know I got millennials at home and they talk to their friends and their friends are always some of the ... the virtues of socialism like Bernie Sanders but as you say as we've seen anecdotally these people don't really know what socialism is do they\n[laughter] I don't think they do I mean you know I mean among younger people I think it's fairly common across the generations you know you look for in the sixties and seventies the young people tend to be an idealistic\nYou know wanting to do a you know do do well on the line that society to be better but I I think\nYou know when you look at it you know this latest um ... love affair with socialism and ... a lot of young people have if you look at it I mean I Love the piece I wrote it seems like a lot of them don't really know what they're talking about there is a new poll that came out out from Gallup\nThis month to ask people about you know what they consider socialism TBI and the overwhelming response was people consider to be equality you know which is a great concept right I guess you know ... except that's not really what are we supposed to me is you know show them traditionally is is\nA government owning the means of production so I think when we talk about socialism or a lot of people just don't know really what they're talking about\nWell what is the dichotomy to me is we have a lot of these millennials are also quite entrepreneur all I mean they they're big on start ups we got a lot of these\nThese big tech companies that are run by younger folks who have come up with green ideas what they don't realize is socialism would take that would take that money from them that they have created through this wonderful idea and redistributed to everybody else who hasn't come up with an idea\nWhat I mean that's exactly right I mean I I think you know when you look at 'em\nYou know what it is that people say they're in favor I mean they want to I mean that they're idealistic right they want a better society but part of what doesn't always get explain is that\nThe reason that we have everything that we have here is because of the system that we have now with with capitalism the profit motive entrepreneurial ah the you know I'm ... designed people wanting to like you said wanting to be entrepreneurs\nUm I mean that's all driven by our existing system that's given up a lot of things that millennial actually use you know Netflix\nIPhones me all these new technologies I mean you don't see those coming out of Venezuela or you know ah North Korea or you know the old Soviet Union I mean those those don't come out of socialist economy is\nI mean other than other things that we all um you know we we all enjoy the fruits of that that people are doing that and creating that yeah and they're trying to make a profit but they're also you know making the world a better place\nYou talking about Eugene Debs back in the day who ran for president to five times on the social studies and this is nothing new and it always is an attack on capitalism the assumption is that capitalism is nuts senior because people get left behind and they're poor people but capitalism is not perfect I don't think anybody would argue that it is\nWhat is the best system that we've got going I Can't think of anything that comes close to it because\nYou get to do reports you so and if you're out there are hustling and you know people talking about working hard it's not really working hard working smart you have to work smart I mean the ditch digger works hard but in a lot of money if you weren't smart if you if you understand how to work smart\nA ... yeah people here in the house that you're acting\nAnd hip no how conservatives are being treated by these receptors men go do things to think that it is shocking to put up support for individuals to the\nWorld is ...

heard your opponent bill brought us in the other day when they ask you about this ...\nAnd he condescending lapse into another red like anybody who thinks that the the the Fifteen to twenty thousand people storming the border might be a threat because we don't know who they are or you call them ... you know children illegal alien Mars when they were\nYeah that's right it's an invading force they have said they're kind of moved to invade the country we have had conspired to us\nFrom homeland security that you have the MS Thirteen gang members\nYou have done this from the middle east you have people that have been convicted of crimes\nThat are trying to illegally entered the country look there is a right way and a wrong way to come to the United states of America and trying to come as an

I mean the shows were British ones of bomb as far as the illegal immigration and certainly being a rubber stamp to Chuck Schumer is being the majority leader of food for God Forbid they take over the Senate I mean this is this is all hands on deck time as the Martian\nWell it is it's all hands on deck time and of course Chuck Schumer would they feel threatened them by\nThat and you wouldn't have at\nCommittee had Bernie Sanders chairing the budget committee yet have Claire McCaskill chairing the homeland security you have a list of us Warren chairing the Finance Committee\nAnd that is too with the making the decision of course we know what they want to do it can teach Donald Trump I think that is much there they want to get rid of the tax cut they won't open borders and they want to abolish shy\nAnd I can't see why anybody would look at this and go well this'll be good idea to put these folks in charge but\nI don't really understand what this what what what's at stake here especially in the state of Tennessee they look at British and say well you know he was a pretty good governor and he's a pretty nice guy and he's probably going to reach across the aisle\nI don't think any well I think it's pretty nice guy but I don't know these are reached across the aisle but that's all beside the point the guy is going to put or help towards the Democrats in the majority and that's going to be the kiss of death anything the Trump wants to do\nA cork it is they've already said they're going to rebuild the attack got\nThey're going to reopen the cabin on the ice and\nAh they're working diligently to try to find a way to uh put gun control an end to take away their Second Amendment rights I have an a rating on their door by the n._r._a. my opponent has the writing\nOn the all in All right and you know that the Democrats that give you more Supreme Court justices like Sonia Sotomayor and of\nCourse he does not believe that an individual has a fundamental right to own a firearm and that is I quote that she has together and you know you're going to get more destruction like you'd get Kavanaugh I'd like to see them doing it in my campaign but they've been doing this from the beginning\nI think now people are beginning to pay attention to a lot of this of course she had a collie\nCutting down in the Memphis area who is a\nDemocrat and he said he wanted me to go commit suicide and jump off the bridge and then later he compared to water boy and for the supporting and helping my opponent\nUm you've got to add one at the broadest sense that people have used an act or a kid in front of the word idiot as a way to describe\nTrump voters in Tennessee and then went on to say talking to him what the for your time and so that's just the mind that that they have it and I just I think during the entire rights but I'll tell you that\nI Am running that take tendencies out is to Washington to get things done that Tennessee and wanted the dye hill Brad Olson has said he is running to end the dry spell for Democrat\nIn the state of Tennessee So we have very different breed that are running and we would represent Tennessee in different way\nAnd people need to understand the early voting or the last day for them is tomorrow right\nThat's right last a day is tomorrow\nI Want to ask you one more thing because I Know you're you're on the desk of the ... Michel this was the state rep or something I'm sure you've seen the video this guy stealing your yard signs in the yard signs of judge judge going in to see them run out of the yard\nYeah I said I I Want to get him or thought red handed back to you know there are Democrats their color or something\nI wanted to know how to go to guy\nWell somebody probably ought to I maybe they try and you know you get these reports from people that they had a yard sign that\nI got up one morning I walked out of their drinking they're coughing and ... somebody can yard sign out of their yard and so we then daddy some of these are free for then why when Bob Hope we found out why\nIn them and moving [noise] well I Hope we'll look is going to be up to whoever had their signs stolen to prosecutors go into somebody does well\nI tell you we certainly have the out that that's an adult\nWay we do indeed Marsha Blackburn running for US Senate and the state of Tennessee we wish you the best of luck early voting continues only three tomorrow and then of course it was election day so everybody's gonna make it come Marcia appreciate very much\nThat they went to fail thank you Bye bye\nSmokes Marsha Blackburn congressman from Tennessee I wanted to be in the U.S Senate running and so as soon as I said she's a five points in the latest\nNBC Marist Poll and of course there's just one of many polls up here you can't take anything for granted to look at some of these other polls cinnamon girl was up by four points in Arizona overlooked Sally so but he seems to be going back and forth\nIt's going to be all about turnout folks no matter where you are across America if you're not turning out\nYou're probably not going to get your wish so just the I'll just leave it at that but it's to me despicable and we have a state representative of beer\nWho was stealing yard signs how how juvenile is that women grew up for crying out loud and they called the guy on video to someone who's prosecutors Yahoo anyway so early voting through tomorrow\nIn Tennessee at your local or early voting to find out when you get an early vote and you're saying you know being done\nGood manners are very very important when you were growing up you'll be a man and when you are you should be a gentleman do you want me to go through one more time for\nYes please put exactly always say please thank you You're welcome excuse me sit up straight hold doors related to the door shut the knock for ... don't swear to speak with a mouthful don't we trust people's place he blows up a table\nAnd don't interrupt don't fairly sound language don't call people means but I Do remember people's names always you're joining us and cover your mouth and cough or sneeze on the bus to give up your seat anyone was trouble stand behind treat others where you like to be treated you got to\nStop thinking you know it's important to make sure your family has a plan in case of an emergency we talked to his family to see if each of them knew where to me saying we're not together when something happens\nFor natural disaster how we were outside the home we would hold me that the part that's our meeting for\nMe because she and my mom we all have a means by which is a bomb is your plan any better to learn more about making an emergency plan for your family got ready you got guys getting by the by the U.S department of homeland security and the council\nHe's your news source for news and information six sixty when you actually you don't you fear home movie\nCumulus stations more borders troops will games departures by my course frozen in Trump is again raising the number of us troops there could be sent to the border with Mexico to keep a caravan of migrants from illegally entering the un\nOur military is that we have about five thousand they will go up to any wherever we see that this military personnel on top of border patrol and everybody else in the water and the\nThink so so you're going to have to get out and do what needs to be done and the state of Tennessee you have him today and tomorrow to early vote and then you have to wait till election day I'm actually taking I think all of my sons are going to be in town\nHalls are all\nThree sons in town tomorrow so we're going to try to go vote all of a four or five of us Susan including that'll be sometime tomorrow for the last day of early voting because one of my kids and colleagues as can be a little chance he won't be here on election day so I'm going to encourage them when it comes in I think it's coming in tonight\nTonight and he'll be here tomorrow it's got a job interview for some intern ship so he's going to be in town we all go out and vote as a family which is a great thing the family can do\nSee a lot of people talking about yeah I'm ... I'm not gonna take it anymore and then you end up not voting you know I Want you know I just\nDidn't it it's not hard to do so she's going to take let's just say you take an hour out of your\nTime I was making a comment to one of my sons the other day when when all of this big thing was one point six billion or whatever it was for the law to remember them I said I can\nGuarantee you far more people buy lottery tickets and vote\nAnd think about that for saying you've got virtually no chance of winning much you're going to go out and buy a lottery ticket which I don't have a problem you know to buy a lottery ticket if you've got the money I bought a lottery tickets\nBut if you can buy a lottery ticket you can go vote for crying out loud I mean it's not that hard to do Harry ...\nWho back in the nineties in Nineteen Ninety three agreed with Donald Trump and now Donald Trump has been tweeting that Harry Reid agreed with them now says he disagrees with Trump after previously accidentally agreeing with Trump\nReacting to Trump's claim about his views on birthright citizenship the president's been talking about doing this through an executive order and now he's moving towards\nJust running it through Congress and Congress the side and he I think the experts going to say is probably going to have to be a constitutional amendments you can see what happens with Congress if Congress deals with it and then it goes to the Supreme Court and Supreme Court says no then you've got a certain process all over again but I'm told you there's an easy way to solve this\nBuild the wall I mean I've talked about\nSending the parents back with their kid after they have the kid because the parents obviously you're not legal and there's nothing in the constitution says they can get this day that's one way of dealing with it but you won't even have to deal with the problem of anchor babies if they can't get across the border to have anchor babies so that's why we need\nThe wall you know no pregnant woman is going to try to scale wall\nSo you're going to do away completely with that if you just put a barrier up that they can't get across and have a baby on our side of the border\nThere all sorts of ways to deal with this I've often said about politics in general they make things so much more difficult than they have to be\nA lot of these problems are very easily solved but they tried to complicate them and the illegal immigration issue is one of them it's not a complicated issue you stay on that side of the border until you have a proper way to come through\nAnd you don't come across our border illegally and if you're going to try to do this we're gonna have to put up a barrier that keeps you from being able to do this and we've talked about a wall for Thirty years or more now they actually appropriated money\nFor the wall and they actually started building part of it we had this store this has been many years ago this was back when I think George W. Bush\nGeorge H noticed George W. Bush was in office they appropriate\nThe money to build the wall and they built the wall like a mile into Mexico\nAnd had to tear it down you know I say a wall there was a big fence a structure whatever how in the world are you not have survey years out there that don't know you're a mile and a Mexican territory when you're building a wall I think that was done on purpose and then they had to tear that bound a great experience and we've had the money allocated for this for\nI don't know decades now and they still have to build the wall you build the wall that will be no more anchor babies this I can\nTell you guarantee you're not going to have some pregnant woman trying to scale a wall it's not going to happen so\nThere are easy solutions to this and people just aren't taking them let me Graham Colby here because uh he's had something that I Want to hear about to Kobe how are you\nPray it either I'm doing well what's on your mind\nI just want to say ah I'd never voted on forty five years old or in my life didn't didn't take it mattered but er and when Trump got office so I thought oh that's funny no let's see what happens to stir the pot but uh after ... from the Democrats and really you know seeing how politics is is\nIt's inspired me to vote I sew and painter first said that uh [laughter]\nBut she did what she did and all that by come up on the last day of return I was one of those people and it wasn't the ... the\nThe way that Democrats have behaved has inspired me to vote\nMore good so you been watching from the sidelines all these e you decided to get into the game\nIs or is there\nAn hour in Tennessee so you've got today and tomorrow the early vote and then you can vote on election day which one you're going to choose\nI don't know if I get to the early voting so I'll I'll go I'm from king for us to go to ... but\nLike I said I never voted for I don't even know how to do an early\nWell there early voting places all over the place and you don't even have to be in your area just wherever you find in early voting place you can vote for him to run and Ross one I mean there you can go online and find them that's\nProbably going to be your easiest um the easiest thing but I mean even if you got to vote in Kingsport you've got to go by the kings for devote so you can't you can't vote in Nashville for Kingsport obviously so you've got to go back to where your eyes to develop\nBut I don't mind going home\nWhere he I don't I don't blame you well I'm Glad to see in the game Kobe does my heart good\nYes sir I appreciate you\nAll right thank you comb appreciate the phone call from their more colby's out there ... in Florida you're up next to Jay was up\nBut had I meant don't know\nI have a really quick thing to go back to the yard signs Neal it to me it seemed like if people steal yard signs out of people's yards that inspires the person who put it out there first to tell them more people about it to get more people to vote so it's almost\nYou understand what I'm saying no yeah it backfires on that was what you're saying sure sure\nThere's somebody saying my yard signs I'm mad as hell and making sure everybody I Know votes\nRight then they're just going to get to get more yard signs and kill other people and now the child is not that he want 'em to steal it but they're shooting yourself in the foot\nAnd water and juvenile thing to do from a state representative be driving around the middle of the night stealing people's yard signs\nAbsolutely it's it's crazy [noise] well how are they nice until I was\nGoing to ask you how things looking political wise down in Florida\nA world open for the best man [laughter]\nYeah well you got you I Know you're going to vote but everybody listening down there's got to get out and vote or this thing and you're going to happen you're going to have some and and the governor's office\nOh yeah no I uh I Am strongly for a you know I Know I'll be voting and I'm kind of spread the word but or\nWill knock on wood man\nYeah indeed yes vote and pray yeah exactly\nJust preaching to very much Tom Europe next Tom automatic\nTom\nYes I mean I can hear you now\nOkay sorry about that a quick question are you mentioned building the wall and out so they can bring in and have anchor baby\nBut when you I've heard that forty percent of illegals are overstaying on it though and and and when they have a baby how how do we combat that\nAnd you're that's well that's a big that's an interesting question I don't know how many of the anchor babies are people who just came across the border of people who overstay their visa I Would assume it's the people who just came across the border if you've got to be I don't know I I Would love to see the stance on my hands them they probably don't they probably don't cut them that way\nBut it would be interesting to see what I see going on down to the borders you have somebody who's you know six months pregnant seven months pregnant they want to get into the United states for they have the child instead of somebody who who's legitimately over here with a visa\nOr I don't think that's normally the person that you know getting getting pregnant and wanting to stay if it could be but that's another problem too and you know other countries have ways of tracking people who aren't supposed to be there I Know\nYou know when I go abroad you know I I Can't stay there indefinitely I mean you know they they check you a different checkpoints and\nIf you don't show back up big and they start looking for ... ... and by the way when you're trying to exit at some point then you're in really big trouble they arrest you if you've overstate the time you were supposed to be there so there are ways to their way to handle this\nBut ultimately I think I probably would have to have some kind of constitutional a member to settle this\nYeah I I really agree to appreciate the phone call quick time I go back in a moment one eight hundred six when he fell but it's one eight hundred six eight seven four four or five back into [noise]\n\n\n\nAttention all authors page publishing is looking for authors have you written a book and want to get
