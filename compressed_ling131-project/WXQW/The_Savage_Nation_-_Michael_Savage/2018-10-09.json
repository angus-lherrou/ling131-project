{"month": "10", "state": "AL", "station": "WXQW", "content": "What do you agree with Congress has controversial decisions you confirmed Donald Trump's nominee Christopher Columbus of Supreme Court and why do you\nHow I got an avid like like a really really long hair on an ashtray I like how long ago and about what I'm saying it's like for like five hundred years probably way right [laughter] do you\nAgree with Congress is controversial decision or you can harm Donald Trump's nominee Christopher Columbus to the Supreme Court\nI mean sometimes you just like [noise] you know and then had a hard question to like it's a hard case study and I like what are you going to do about it at home [laughter]\nYour opinion do you think the fact that Christopher Columbus South America should keep democracy for it [noise] and\nWe don't really know why I mean any any other [laughter] you or I mean we've been celebrating his arm and he is now so it really does\nSo because we celebrated for so long you think is okay for him to sit on the Supreme Court [laughter] make better Supreme Court justice Trump's nominee Christopher Columbus for Obama's nominee Margot\nHarlem [noise] probably a bottom line and widening Marco Polo it'd be a better springboard trying now and he's really man [laughter]\nGo vote ... see the thing about stupidity is that some people use it with confidence\nYou know you come to me with something of I don't know I'll go hey ah you know I got a bunch out on this but I don't know but some people just can't say they don't know so they just go with it they doubled down on the confidence of the stupidity and then they sound like you're the it's on national TV\n[noise] you know when women behave in ways that don't fit their gender stereotypes were example being assertive they're viewed as less likeable and ultimately less hire a bowl\nThat's according to Harvard Business review does the same goal for men\nAre they similarly penalize string from their strong masculine stereotype but researchers say the short answer is yes\nThat men to face backlash when they don't adhere to masculine gender stereotypes when they show vulnerability act nicer display empathy expressed sadness exhibit modesty\nAnd proclaimed to be feminist struggling they say not least because of discourages men from behaving in ways known to benefit their teams in their own careers\nWell they look at each of these behaviors\nVulnerability by the way men are socialized not the answer for help or be vulnerable and they can be penalize when they challenge this notion\nAnd informative set of studies from twenty Fifteen fines at when mail but not female leaders ask for help they're viewed as less competent capable and confidence and ...\nMake themselves more vulnerable by disclosing weakness in work they're perceived as having lower status\nBeing nicer\nGiven that many of us want more nice guys at work we might assume that men would be celebrated for being calm and I'm assuming wrong\nResearch has found that men who are more communal and agreeable I for example warm caring supportive in sympathetic main significantly less money\nThan more stereotypical mass killing men more agreeable man across multiple industries made an average of Eighteen percent less income\nAnd were of value weight is less likely to have management potential as compared to less agreeable men now I'm going to tell you something because it's funny I hadn't seen this\nWhen I'm On the way to work but I I was sitting at a stoplight today and I passed this\nGuy I was sitting in the subway and he turned and the guy that I Know that lives in our town uh who I don't know very well but I Know him\nAnd um pay is nice guy and I haven't got nothing against somebody is the typical alpha male I mean this guy is a go getter he's an international businessman you know he's just that guy that just takes charge you know\nAnd I'm going that dude has pulled down some jak\nNow\nI Do okay but I'm not that alpha male you know I'm not a big yard and I mean it's not that guy\nI mean there's not that I don't take care of business but I'm not that he I think of these folks that I see him sometimes at neighborhood parties and things like this and they just come in and they sort of um they sort of take over you know when they come in and it's not by because they intend to is just their personality\nWell normally the people who end up being CEOs of companies and leading things and make it a bunch of money\nBut I Know some women are like this too\nAnd they do the same thing they end up making the money and it's it's not a male or female thing like the Harvard Review is trying to make it out to be they're trying to make it out like women\nAre are are bitchy if they're aggressive and that's just not the case\nI'll tell you something as far as management style is concerned and this goes for a man or a woman or whatever\nI don't think it's ever appropriate for a boss to be screaming at people and I've never responded well to bosses who did\nBut rarely do I ever see like somebody higher up here just screaming and somebody I don't see that I mean I Would be shocked wouldn't you Johnny ... if you hurt somebody down the hall just screaming at some money\nWe just don't see that anymore now you used to see a long time ago and we would see it from folks who were you know just had a they were hot heads\nBut I thought and justice ban of the guy as I did have a woman doing this you think well the woman's bitchy well the guys in SOB that's what I thought so I mean there's really no difference you can call them whatever you want they were just unpleasant people\nAnd he used to be in the day back in the eighties or whatever nineties you had some of these folks who are just you know they would go off and start screaming if folks\nAnd I think that law suits of probably can't back down some I think corporate atmosphere of being afraid that somebody's going to sue or whatever but I just I don't see people and and maybe on you know maybe I'm In an unusual work situation I don't see higher ups yelling at people anymore\nWhen fact we had a higher up that worked here no longer does but he had the greatest style I've ever seen as far as getting\nMore out of people because when he would come around it was never right away jump in on what he was concerned about\nIt was more patch on the back man I'm so glad you're here and it's hey by the way that he would talk about your strong point ... man I Love the way you do this I Love the way you do that if you could do this just a little bit better light bulb is up a little bit on make this more and\nSo what are your people will do enjoy it is I mean I just thought it was fantastic the way it is that what what they're doing with this so called study from Harvard\nBusiness Review is that they're saying that man get penalize for straying from masculine norms are and the women get a better life for straying from their feminine gender stereotypes but I don't you know to me a boss has a boss\nAnd maybe I'm just I don't know maybe I'm different that way but I mean I look at somebody if somebody who's in charge that I listen to this person and I'll have a conversation with this person in the same way it doesn't matter whether they're man or woman\nI think there's just a way to ... porch or civil way to conduct yourself or when you're when you're over a bunch of folks and yelling and screaming has never work whether you're a man or woman yeah I don't I mean\nYou know they say well the women you say you're shrill no it's it's it's the pitch your voice I Know guys will hire voices shrill too you know you either shrill you're booming but neither one is pleasant [noise]\nWhen they play

true this is another study for news busters\nAnd for weeks Americans go to the polls for the midterm elections the news media are casting is a referendum on the Trump presidency\nNow of course if the Republicans when it's not going to be a referendum it's going to be a lark and it's gonna be an anomaly it's going to be something other than a referendum on Trump but if they do if the Democrats when they take over the house and or the Senate then it's going to be a referendum on Trump this works over the summer\nThe broadcast networks have continued to pound Donald Trump and his team are the most
