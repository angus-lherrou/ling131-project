you're not\nThere are only two things to worry about your health is going to be good or you're going to get sick that your health is good there's nothing to worry that if you're sick where there are

things to worry about ... you're going to go to heaven or not and if you're going to go to heaven there's nothing to worry about I mean so why worry there does seem to be an obvious point in this I

station\nRelying on acceptable Charlottesville arrest my boss President Trump says he would\nFind it disqualifying if his Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh is shown with law to Congress\nAs he headed for a speech in Philadelphia the president said things appear to be going well for Brett Kavanaugh but he edited all all depend on what comes out of the supplemental investigation being conducted by the FBI indicated it would be unacceptable if Kavanaugh is found to have lied to Congress\nI think you should lie that guy there's a lot of faith falls over the last year that have lied to Congress to me that would not be acceptable to the Trump\nSays he's hoping for a positive vote on Kavanaugh's nomination later this week every boat lender at the White House\nFor men to all white supremacist group have been charged with federal crimes during the unite the right white nationalist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia that turned deadly last year us attorney Thomas calling presented the charges\nGood great this is all they got well it's not all they got this is the whimper they're going out on\nNow they're saying that the mid ... cabin all does not have the\nJudicial temperament to be on the Supreme Court you know why because of the way have taught disrespect\nFully to the senator's well\nI saw this over the weekend ... brand Gillibrand whatever the check name and she's saying hey was disrespectful to the senators and I said senator you need to understand something you work for him you work\nFor us not the other way around\nYou or disrespect for it you accused the guy of running gang rape brain while he was in high school for crying out loud you think he's going to sit there and take it so if you're gonna accused him of this kind of stuff I Can't believe he didn't cuss every one of you folks\nOut and clothing Spartacus himself so this is where we are now how dare\nYou beat this district where senators for God's sake you're supposed to show us some respect by by showing him some respect seen other to you know in in order to garner respect you have to show would you do now to kill somebody\nAnd support allegations that he was running a gang rape bring in high school and then expect the guy to show you respect when you meet him face to face get over it you're a senator you worked for us we don't work for you he doesn't work for you you show him respect because we're the ones paying your paycheck\nYet okay to get back to me it was\nIn executing their delay delay delaying strategy and as for National Review against President Trump's nominee she'll be eminently qualified Brett Kavanaugh the Supreme Court\nOr the most blatantly political claim posted by the Democrats as their objection to his purported lack of judicial temperament but he's idea is that because judge Kavanaugh reacted with indignation ... that were that he was a gang rape is\nAnd because he observed that they ought to bash left wing smears against him were well left wing smears he's unfit to be an objective jurist as opposed or a normal human being Bennett perception perceptive wanted that\nOf course the best measure we have of how someone will perform in a government office\nIs how the person has already performed when in that office or in very similar ones\nAnd the best measure we have the seriousness of good faith of a critics claim against the nominee is whether the critic consistently levels similar charges and analogous situations on that score they saying no to the following\nAnd this is from Andrew McCarthy and the national review Brett Kavanaugh as but a judge for a dozen years on one of the most important judicial tribunals in this country\nThe United states court of appeals for the DC circuit in that office not only has he issued over three hundred opinions which have been broadly admired for their craftsmanship and heavily relied on by the Supreme Court and other federal court\nHe's also been widely praised for his judicial temperament by litigants colleagues and bar association's which by the way the a BA is now\nCanning there earlier oh we don't know about this Kavanaugh guy to where we endorse this guy he's the man [noise] very diverse group of clerks he has men toward has been in high demand for Supreme Court clerk ships and other distinguished positions of the legal profession his judicial temperament could not be more parent\nBy contrast here is Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg speaking about Donald Trump\nHe's a fake or he has no constituency about him\nA consistent signal can consistency and Russ says\nHe says whatever comes to his hand at the moment he really has any go\nHow has it gotten away with not turning over his tax returns that was Ruth Bader Ginsburg guy Benson guy Benson reminds us of some similarly\nIn judicious remarks by Justice Ginsberg and the New York times interviewed Ginsburg doesn't hold up thing back when it comes to the twenty sixteen election\nShe said quote I Can't imagine what this place would be I Can't imagine what the country would be with Donald Trump is our president\nFor the country it could be four years for the court it could be I don't even want to contemplate bed\nShe also recall something her late husband set about such matters now it's time for us to move to New Zealand I wanted to put her on the Supreme Court news even if she moved now this is somebody who is supposed to be impartial how about judicial temperament mayor uh nobody has anything to say about that on the left\nAnd then he says Andrew McCarthy if they practice consistency\nKavanaugh's critics would be calling for Ginsburg to step down or the relief to recuse himself from any case in which a component of the Trump Administration as a party before the court\nBut of course she continues to participate fully then Kavanaugh's critics are glad of it they despise Trump as much as she does their sky is falling attack on Kavanaugh's character is a reflection of Ginsburg sky is falling forecast\nOf the Trump presidency and its portends for the court is it's all political and it is\nSo what did I tell you last week when I was telling you would need to have an FBI investigation and you were all going no no this is horrible and you're just you're you're one of them now and I heard all this stuff\nI did hear from a lot of you are going well now I've heard your argument on this I think you're probably right yeah I think it's a well we'll see by the end of the week but here's how is shaping up\nYesterday we had a poll actually over the weekend that came out but it shows us that half of the voters in Missouri where Claire McCaskill is a senator\nAre less inclined to vote for her now because she's opposing Kavanaugh's confirmation half\nOf the voters and the state of Tennessee Phil Bredesen is too chicken even voice an opinion on the matter\nBecause he knows it is the proverbial third rail and politics\nIf he says he supports cap and all the ... folks go nuts if he says he opposes Kavanaugh then all of the people who were may be thinking about crossing the island voting for him as Republicans voting for a Democrat or going to vanish so he's in no man's land now\nSay the reason I wanted an FBI investigation is because these folks saw the Kavanaugh was going to withdraw his nomination he didn't\nAnd the more confirmation we get to the Senate Judiciary committee's findings on miss Ford were correct from the beginning of the stamp of approval from the FBI look better it looks for Kavanaugh but moreover the better it looks to the American people and that's what's important here especially in states\nLike West Virginia Indiana I'm Missouri some of these places North Dakota within the high camp some of these places where there are Democrats and seats\nThat are in Trump country because now they can't win and the only way that this thing ... has a happy ending for any of these folks as if they vote for Kavanaugh so here's my prediction for you and I'm not going to be I'm not going to hold tight to this and you're saying it is possible\nThat by the end of this week we may lose Jeff Flake and pick up three four or more Democrats voting for Kavanaugh at that point it looks like and will be a bipartisan confirmation of Brett Kavanaugh\nBut the folks will not forget and November who's trying to destroy this guy and now you have all these folks who were on the wrong side trying to scramble over to the right side\nAnd it's like shining the lights on the rats in the kitchen we see you we know what you are we know what you're about we know this is all politics\nAnd we're still going to vote against show so I don't see how we lose by having an FBI investigation the only thing that could up in this whole
