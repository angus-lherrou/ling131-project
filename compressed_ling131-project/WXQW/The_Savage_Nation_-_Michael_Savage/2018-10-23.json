{"month": "10", "state": "AL", "station": "WXQW", "content": "I have I pay my bills as far as it went anyway [laughter] I'm trying to pay down that debt [laughter] it's when I Would do no I got a lot of\nStuff I Would love to do some of it has to do with me someone has to do with the charities and things like this I Would give the bulk of it would be gone somewhere you know somebody else\nI'm trying to be until you this if I win you don't have a house payment\nThat's just you know that's the first thing I Do as many nights of yeah well that's it I mean don't know the answer anything more now [laughter]\nNew car down a new car you know they ... they say the successes relative the more success you're at the mall relatives you have so keep that in mind too that the truth I'm I'm going to tell you well I don't even really\n[noise] would you tell anybody if you want so you got my understanding is you can win anonymously you don't have to go up there and take the big check in the big ... that's what I Would do if I Want I wouldn't I don't think I tell anybody I mean my wife obviously I wouldn't even tell my kids you know why\nBecause they've been going well I had to work anymore you know so that's I mean you know who knows who's going to win this thing if anybody if they don't win what does it go it's going to go to two billion dollars\nIf nobody wins tonight that'll be for friday or Saturday Night or whatever they draw again\nUh and of course the ... when it gets them why they're in the last time I got to one point three billion and um that's when somebody want to get up there and everybody and their brothers buy lottery tickets and so of course the more people who buy tickets the more chance you're going to have a winner\nOr and then you get a winning resets I don't know the reefs and said you know forty five million or whatever and then starts over again but imagine that if they are able to give away one point six billion how much they pulled\nIn from this lottery around the country 'cause this is an interstate thing it's it's it's for all over the country\nAnd so all of these states are participating in an imagine how much money people are put into this thing is when you put in this kind of stupid well you know the cost two bucks I'll stop somewhere and saying you know to buy I was somewhere today and I said I'm going to make a million things man\nI mean it's two bucks I'll see 'em but here's the deal will fill you you've preached for people not to buy lottery tickets no I preach for people who can't afford it not to buy lottery tickets I couldn't afford a two dollar lottery ticket but if you're in their\nMind a carton of cigarettes a twelve pack of beer and some lottery tickets and you're on welfare you shouldn't be buying lottery ticket you shouldn't be buying any of those\nAnd that's why I have long advocated the a law and this would have to be state the state obviously but the law is is if you're on welfare and you win the lottery the lottery money goes back to the state so you ain't got a chance of winning\nYou know it's going to be hard to hide that you're on welfare once you win the saying they go do a double check no oh well you're on government assistance so thank you will take that lottery tickets remote so does you know good once you do that the poor folks out there that are on welfare will stop buying lottery tickets\nIf you win the state get your money because you're living off the state you got to pay them back first\nAnd so that's what I Would do I wonder if anybody's ever even thought about doing that as you say they don't though because they want these folks buying lottery tickets 'cause that's what gets more money into the lottery\nI Would love to see the breakdown I'm actually working on a project about this too I Would love to see the breakdown of income levels of people who buy lottery tickets\nAnd I guarantee you it's weighted towards the bottom\nBecause these are the most desperate people in society that we're trying to get out of their\nSituation so they buy lottery tickets which is the dumbest way to get out of your situation it only makes you pour the chance of winning the lottery is ... by the change she got 'em you get a better chance of getting struck by lightning wild getting eaten by a shark I mean that's you know\nI've seen people and go in for these lottery tickets in it'll be the last thing they can afford when they hear the accent that money aside for something in\nThe end they do it all the time they're in there every week several times a week buy lottery tickets thing and it's going to get me on a trip this new to me I Know that is the trip ears and I did go to work hello hello hello so I\nAm going to work I got a job I'll stop and convenience store get a cup of coffee and buy a lottery ticket and you know big bills two bucks what the what the hey fulfill what you against the lottery oh yeah I think the lottery\nOr preys on
