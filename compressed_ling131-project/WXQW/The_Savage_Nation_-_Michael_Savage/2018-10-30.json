S. N. B. C. blaming\nDonald Trump\nAnd the conservatives for the shooting of the synagogue on Saturday and makes absolutely no sense to me now this guy who went in and shot the Jewish folks in the synagogue is is crazy obviously\nAnd people try to link him to right wing this or whatever white supremacist them\nAlthough you can say that it resigns on the right some might say that it doesn't represent the rights\nAny more than crazy anarchic is completely represent the left although the anarchists are decidedly on the left and they're violent and they kill people\nAnd they and they just destroy things you know we had the story yesterday about the shooting as a matter of fact somebody was asking me about something on a show for it but it was the Hillary thing you've ever yesterday Henry cracking the they all look alike joke about Cory Booker and Eric Holder\nSays the mainstream media still not picked up on and somebody emailed me that the day instead of using the story 'cause I didn't see it on the show for it and we're going to show prep yesterday so it's all the news you needed a day early right here in the film I went to an show\nBut when you look at 'em you know yesterday we had these are the stories about all of this and you know\nThese people that are going after Trump\nOn this thing if they accusing accusing Donald Trump or being the problem because\nHe's attacking the fake news media that is a complete non ... I don't even understand how they get they would that\nHow is saying that the mainstream media are telling lies and they do every day in their examples afternoons example yesterday we had some some chick on CNN saying that a Donald Trump is radicalized more people than I is this\nI mean how crazy as that radicalized more people than ISIS\nOn a very ... Jim Acosta was telling Sarah Sanders says she didn't have the guts to name all the fake news outlets and I said look\nIf she started naming fake news outlets she'd be there all day she didn't have time to list them\nI mean look at Ninety five percent of the people in the room that are covering her and they have participated in fake news at some time or another that doesn't mean that everybody who works for CNN is fake news it just means that people like Jim Acosta and Allison camera and some of these other folks\nAre perpetrating allies and a half truths\nJust trying to make the president look man they do it all the time and everybody really know even if people on the left no it\nThey just don't want to acknowledge it they think they have themselves a talking point and especially as we go into the midterms\nThey're trying to somehow connect the president's rhetoric about fake news with pipe bombs in synagogue shootings and one has nothing to do with the other as a matter of fact I Would say that the pipe bombing has nothing to\nDo the synagogue shooting and then you get this from the folks here saying we named all come together to stop this violence like the synagogue shooting so what is it that I'm supposed to do to stop the synagogue shooting\nI mean there's nothing I could change in my life that would stop the synagogue shooting there's nothing you could change in your life\nI Would presume unless you're a rabid anti Semite that would stop the synagogue shooting the only person to stop the synagogue shooting as a synagogue shooter and when they say that we all need to come together you know they're talking about they're talking about the people in the right maybe just shut up\nThe people on the right names would just be quiet and let the liberals out their scream and holler about Kavanaugh and about me too and about everything else and have the right including Donald Trump just keep his mouth shut so they can get their message out and that he doesn't ... but it's\nRegarding the lunacy from the left is not incendiary if not inciting violence and it has nothing to do with pipe bombs or synagogue shootings so what is it we're supposed to do\nAs the people out there in general to do something we need to come together to do something about the synagogue she knew what we're supposed to do\nWell let me tell you what you're supposed to do if you're somebody who is you know regular like the rest of us and I'm Talking about people just going about ordinary lives\nThe only thing that we can do is to make sure we're vigilant and that we're packing heat and I'm not saying that you have to everybody has to carry a gun\n'cause I don't think everybody should be carrying a gun that may sound anti Second Amendment and I'm not saying that you shouldn't be allowed to but there's some folks quite frankly they can handle a gun that don't like guns and don't want to be around guns I'm not saying that you carry a gun\nBut somebody at your workplace needs to be packing meet somebody needs to be ready when a shot rings out\nAnd I've asked this question on numerous occasions or occasions on this show of everybody out there and so I Want to ask you to you in particular wherever you are across America\nAt work\nDo you have a plan for if a shot brings out\nI Know the vast stamps them coming in there with you for [laughter] yeah well and

to you that you're responsible for\nAre you doing everything you can do to make sure they're safe and don't tell me that you put a sign on the door with a gun with a slash through it\n'cause that's not good enough matter of fact that ... that makes it worse that advertisers assured gun free zone\nAre you doing if you're responsible for people under you are you doing everything you can to ensure that these people are saying for the shot brings out\nYou need to look yourself with a mere and asked that question am I doing everything I can to make sure that people enemy you're safe and if you're not you need to do something about it for what do I do\nWhat you need to get some training you need to get 'em you need to you need to have some sort of proto called you need to get it needs to be like a tornado drill or a fire drill or a nuclear bomb drill everybody needs to know what to do\nIn case something like this happens and if your\nPlace of business doesn't know you may be the next victim because I can guarantee you there's one thing in common that all of these places that have been shot up by some crazed done when all of them have one thing in common and that is this they never thought\nWhat happened to them and you're in a boat to you'd never think it's going to happen to you and then when it does you're not prepared for what to do you need to take appropriate action set

over Trump they just can't seem to handle it and I think about you know some folks are turning to alcohol and drugs to try to cope with the fact that Trump has an office\nProbably not a good idea\n[noise] now we have the rabbi and this um ah hold on let me grab a story here so that I can\nI can give you the update on this this is the Senate guy grab I'm assuming this is the same guy this

left wing media the which Trump calls the fake news and obviously you can hear from the question she's asking this rabbi\nThat not fake news and she's trying to leave this guy on into blaming Trump for what happened on Saturday Trump had nothing to do with what happened on Saturday the gunman hated Donald Trump\nThought it was a global less than a Jew lover who had Jews all in his administration and that he was the main problem I can assure you if you've gotten the chance to take a crack at Trump's he would have done it\nSo this anti Semitism certainly has nothing to do with Trump but if we have an anti Semite who's violent and killed eleven people and injured six and a synagogue\nAnd is openly hostile towards President Trump does that not exonerate the president from any of this anti Semitic rhetoric that's coming from the left\nNo they think it just it just bolsters it\nIt's bound to be his problem is bound to be because of Donald Trump when the fact of the matter is anybody who's out there killing Jews and hates Trump can certainly not blame that on Trump I'm not saying can blame it on the left\nYou have to blame it on whoever pulled the trigger\nBut this is only the
