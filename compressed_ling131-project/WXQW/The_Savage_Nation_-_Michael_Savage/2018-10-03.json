D. like symptoms that she purportedly suffered in the wake of Kavanaugh's alleged attack in the house party in Nineteen eighties or more especially she says claustrophobia panic\nAnd that type of thing and appointed no holds barred letter Tuesday evening that referenced the ex boyfriends declaration\nSenate Judiciary committee chairman Chuck Grassley demanded that attorneys for Ford turn over her therapist notes and other key materials and suggested she was intentionally less than truthful about her experience with polygraph examinations during Thursday's dramatic Senate hearing Grassley wrote\nYour continued withholding of material evidence despite multiple requests is unacceptable\nAs the Senate exercises it's constitutional responsibility of advice and consent for a judicial nomination\nUnder questioning from the experience sex crimes prosecutor Rachel Mitchell last week Ford said that she had quote never\nHad any discussions with anyone on how to take a polygraph or quote given any tips or advice to anyone who was looking to take a polygraph test she repeatedly said the process of taking her own polygraph in August\nWas stressful and and come to bloom although

Monica el which is Monica McLean\nPrepare for a potential polygraph exam and that Ford had quote explained in detail what to expect how polygraphs work and helped her become familiar and less nervous about the exam\nUsing her background and psychology McLean named appeared on the list of Ford's former high school classmates who signed a letter of support for Ford last month\nAnd Mitchell Rachel ...\nRon suddenly said Ford's case was even weaker than the typical he said she said situation pointed out numerous discrepancies in her version of events that have emerged in the past several weeks concerning everything from how many people were the purported party to win that occurred and how she found her way home\nMitchell also noted that none of the witnesses forty been applied as having attended the party could backup or version of events\nSome of the parents in consistency is according to Grassley\nCould possibly be addressed affords legal team turned over all video or audio recordings produced during her own polygraph examination she passed that Annan a handwritten state when she wrote prior to the test she indicated there were four boys and a couple of girls at the gathering now\nWe now know according to folks out there were only two questions asked for what were the two questions\nWhat's your name Christine Blasey Ford how you feel today good okay get on the plane were done you're I mean we have no idea what the question two questions are you kidding me two questions let me have you ever take a polygraph test\nBecause I have I have [noise]\nWhen I first came to Nashville many years ago I got an a or applying for a job you know it's just what you gotta do you know I've gotten blown out of a program director job in Greensboro moved to Nashville with no job\nAnd apply for a job parttime at a radio station to try to get back into the game and full time at a health club selling memberships\nAnd a prerequisite to getting the gig the health club was going to take a polygraph test and so I did and\nWhat they do is they ask you a lot of baseline questions that they know are true so they can get your reaction that way they know when you're telling the truth\nAnd then if they ask you a question that's an abnormality um you know then they they can they can claim that you were lying so they asked me a series of questions what's your name\nHow old are you uh where did you grow up\nYou know this kind of stuff and then they and and then they start flowing into stuff have you ever been arrested yes\n[laughter]\nAnd and you go through all this ... by the way I pass the test and got the gig obviously I got the gigs or pass the test so\nBut I Know it ... it wasn't just two questions I mean there are three or four or five questions just setting a baseline for a polygraph test and then they ask you some other pointed questions and then they'll they'll ask you one like you know is the sky blue yes\nHave you ever murdered me by I mean it was just goes from you know one extreme to the other just to see what you know 'cause they don't want to lead up to anything and you start they want to see how you're going to react\nSo they ask you all sorts of just\nDisassociated questions and then and then they look at the thing and see if you're lying or not and I was lying about anything so I got the gig\nBut I remember it was more than two questions more than two questions [noise] Bradley also demanded to Ford's attorney handover notes from er twenty twelve therapy sessions\nAnd what she claimed to discuss her alleged sexual assault decades ago\nHe said it was not justified any longer for for decide privacy and medical privilege given that she has relied on them extensively as a kind of corroborating evidence to implicate Kavanaugh\nA foreign claimed that she could not say definitively whether she had share those notes with the Washington Post approximately two months ago as opposed to describing them abstract but you would know if you turned over your doctor's notes to somebody and of course she lying again saying that she doesn't remember\nThe post robots reviewed a portion of her notes\nFor the Washington Post as saying they've got the notes well subpoena them we need the notes\nBradley also requires the company's of communication screen for to the media describing her allegation saying that the legal team's failure to provide for its full correspondence with the Washington Post suggested they lack of candor\n[noise] that's where we are folks\nI mean it's just hurt one lie after another lie after another lie after lie which makes you wonder whether she's telling the truth about anything [noise]\n\nMore than I thought my suit can still make an impression on video games that are still game changing my land can bring other a bright future because when I don't even my stuff too good will help line job placement and train people right in my community now\nMy second hand and we'll get someone in my

talked about farming of each of them knew where to pull him out on behalf on\nFor natural disaster happen and we were outside the home we were all me that the part that's our meeting point I mean if\nI may have seen all along the way I have a little bomb went through my mind if you are paying any better Caroline why about making an American problem for your family got rod ... book Michael ... department of homeland security council\nSays your news source of news and information six sixteen you gotta you execute W ... movie cumulus station [noise] just\nThe facts alert test Hi Mike moss the FBI report on its investigation into sexual assault charges against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh is expected to be released very soon and press secretary Sarah Sanders hopes it will clear up questions\nCertainly me some money by Dr Ford was telling me you can't make this decision based on emotion and it has to be based on fat\nThey determine what the facts are of this case that's one of the reasons that they asked for the FBI and laid a hearing noticed that they can get more facts on day care\nCenter says the president doesn't think he compromised any votes last night when he mocked accuser Christine Blasey Ford but Republican Senator Lindsey Graham is cautioning the president's\nSo President Trump went to a fashion rendition that I didn't take a little I can tell a knock it\nI was their first mark answer over right Matthews house I remember it lawyer with us today she's bombed the bottle and it turned to me and she gives me writes square on the lips ... sir I remember years later she ends up me and my brother\nAnd well you know keep it in the family and my girls we are from the south after all\nA low is married to a ...\nEnvironment who she is me either they were married in uh Manhattan marriage bureau in June\nBut she went to McGill University as an undergraduate than she received a joint law degree an MBA from your university I don't know if that means that they might know who this woman and she was apparently somebody we're supposed to know slows a full letter details an event in which a process to perform the public\nSex act and the letter to Grassley and this was a but Kuhn senator Coons making this allegation now\nSays low maintains that he was an eye witness of an event put on by became a fraternity the Kavanaugh was a part of during his use of gay or the events which she has claimed to know multiple other witnesses of included a prostitute performing a public sex act the low does not get more specific\nThan that we can imagine though Kavanaugh has not yet responded this claim leads to this writing\nWhat's more low was quick to make clear that he does not know if Kavanaugh was specifically at this event or if it was just put on by the fraternity ... associated with low road I Can't say for certain the judge Kavanaugh was present in the frat house during the event but he was at Yale during the time period\nSo [laughter] so you're on the campus when some of his goes on and then you can be on the Supreme Court\nSaid he was attending Yale Law school I suspect he might have attended what would have been a big party and the France newly purchased off\nCampus house but it doesn't have any evidence that he was and doesn't have any corroborating witnesses but it's out there and I tell you they get more and more absurd every day and they're going to keep coming in this is just what these people do every single day in the meantime\nIt ain't looking good for Christine Blasey Ford or ex boyfriend says she helped a friend prepped for a potential polygraph\nShe said under oath and was asked directly by Rachael ... have you ever help anybody prepare for a polygraph test so apparently Rachel it's gotten wind of this beforehand and she says never she says you never help anybody\nWith a polygraph test never I've never done that\nWell a third more for it and couldn't corroborate\nThis now the woman she says he says that she was helping says that didn't happen so again we've got a he said she said type thing and if you want to look at it from the standpoint of the capital thing we got to he said uh and then they said it didn't happen so who knows\nWho knows [noise]\nBut I think if we're going to take her allegations of Kavanaugh seriously that went in to take his allegation that she helped somebody with a polygraph test seriously don't wing\nI mean he says it happened she said it didn't but she hasn't turned over anything that Grassley in these folks want and Grassley losing his patients he wants the notes from her therapist and twenty twelve all of them she says she can't remember whether she gave the Washington Post her notes or just a summary\nOf the Washington Post quoted her in the article of saying that they were looking at her notes\nNot a summary of the notes from a therapist notes so the Washington Post has somebody would subpoena them too but it's this evidence\nAnd an ongoing investigation by the United States Senate and they deserve to have all the information\nSo they want to know that they also want any video and or audio and or transcripts from the polygraph test because this woman blood a Ford\nHas said that it was it was so long it was just it was I was just long prided knows gonna be this difficult in this long and we're hearing that it was only two questions so what's\nYour lying about that and winning two questions were as I've said folks I've taken a polygraph test it ain't two questions it's multiple questions I mean you take two or three questions just to get a baseline on somebody to see where\nThey are with things that you know are true are you a woman is uh is your name Christine ... Ford Yaz are you a psychology professor yes do you live in California years it Brett Kavanaugh salts you yes and then you\nCan start to see if there's any difference\nBut you can't get a polygraph test for two questions\nSo we need to know those two questions were to say you pass a polygraph test even enough itself doesn't mean a whole lot but the saves you pass the polygraph tests were two questions means absolutely nothing\nAnd then if we can find out but she actually did help somebody take a polygraph test that's just one more alive she's been calling and now I'm hearing today to things and let me check my Twitter feed to make sure that uh you know things aren't the things are happening fast and furious Bob Corker\nTold reporters today and then he expects to get the FBI report today\nToday sometime today\nSo if that comes down while we're doing the show today will tell you what we're supposed to know what's in it but you know how Washington is is like a sieve\nSo this thing is going to be a distributed to a hundred senators and their staff she's saying these things are not going to be ... by some money and what will happen is probably\nThe bending on who's licking bill league things that make one side of the other look good or bad so it's going to be hard to tell but we did hear this that the FBI is not an has not interviewed Christine Blasey Ford or cabin on\nAnd the White House said you've already got their testimony under oath you don't need to interview these folks any further and if they're saying that for both of them I don't have a problem with it [noise] because are you going to do is ask\nThem the same questions in the Senate ask them under a sworn testimony you're not going to ask him anything else unless there's something new they want to ask him and I think that they should be able to ask them something new but apparently that ship has sailed so the FBI apparently has completed its investigation and is preparing\nThe results for the Senate which we should get some time to be tonight maybe tomorrow morning\nBut I don't know flake responds to Trump's mocking of Christine forward\nNow you know I watched the so called mocking uh my wife\nActually we were the event last night and she said I had to turn it off I may start saying about this stuff she says why does he do this everything's going so swell forum and why didn't he didn't even have to bring\nIt up he doesn't even have to let the process go but I told you say there are couple of things that could derail this wonderful in this\nFor the Republicans in one of 'em is if Donald Trump does what he does a lot of times and steps on his own message is one thing for me to sit here as a paid commentator on the radio and talk about the inconsistencies of Christine ... for his testimony\nThat's what I Do but the president when he does this is only going to anger folks\nI mean the people that he's supporting already know this you don't need the gym them up with the um mocking and I think the markings a little bit too much of a an overstatement\nJeff Flake responded to Trump's mocking of Dr ... for the uh the testimony during the Tuesday night campaign stop saying a Wednesday morning appearance on today's show\nWell there's no time and no place for remarks like that flake says but to discuss something that's sensitive subject of the political Randy rally is just not right I Wish you hadn't have done it and I just say it's kind of appalling\nResponded to an extended riff by Trump on Ford's lack of memory about an alleged sexual assault by judge Kavanaugh and the summer of eighty two how did you get home Trump says I don't remember how did you get there I don't remember where is the place I don't remember how\nMany years ago was it I don't know what neighborhood I don't remember where he was a house I don't know but I had one beer\nAnd I'm just saying I Need all that is true but he doesn't need to be saying that he needs to let this thing\nWhere

therapy notes and the polygraph data whether there's video audio transcripts whatever so they can review this\nSo they have shot misled or to Grassley it's short near chairman Grassley regarding the documents you requested in your literary October second twenty Eighteen\nDr Ford is prepared to provide those documents to the FBI when she interviewed we have not yet heard from the FBI about scheduling and be with her so in other words we're not going to turn them over unless you interview her by the FBI and the FBI apparently has already concluded as their investigation it seems like it and not talk to Kavanaugh or\nTo the doctor for it and the reason being is is that the White House is saying you don't need to talk of the more you get hours of testimony you can go over that rascal all these questions are usually the bug these folks again just talk to the witnesses the corroborating stuff and see if you can go to the bottom of what's going on\nWell or what they know what I Would do is again call their bluff\nAnd the FBI over and talk to Dr Ford and get the documents and see if they come up with a ... ... we're not we didn't like the way they question or so we're not going to get the documents [noise]\nAgain this is not a delay tactic you can do this this afternoon but I mean you know the FBI still formulating it stuffs and an agent overdue Palo Alto and while you're there check and see there's a wall between those two doors secrets a duplex now and that's the case that needs to go into your report that something that should be investigated don't you think\nShe said under all she had to put in a double door because we're claustrophobia we find out that was another door for Google employees that lying under oath has never knew was posture phobia has to do with trying to make some extra money\nIn the zoning laws of Palo Alto we'll see where this ends up\nBut now they think that they run into their running the show as a matter of fact British Hume tweeted this out and dance is worth remembering that for all the talk of the FBI supplemental background check the constitution confers authority to advise and consent on the Senate and only the Senate\nRefused to provide information to the committee is striking and it is they're they're stonewalling uh every time you turn around and that's what they're doing to try to believe this thing\nBut I think we need to see the polygraph test what questions were asked was it only to as we've been told if it's not that we can correct the record let's find out what was going on in her notes\nThat she uh she was a with a therapist and all this and and Grassley contention on this is you can't you can't now argue medical privacy\nWhen you've made this public and we've now had a day of hearing was testifying about your therapy notes and then we don't get to see the notes I mean you're telling us what you said to the therapist to see what the therapist wrote down as far as what you said you have the notes\nSo you could even go back and\nAnd get your story straight as to what you told the therapy Lucy if your story that you told us matches up with a notes from the therapist I think that's the least we should be able to do here to figure out who's telling the truth\nAnd we're we're going with this as his sits right now is in facts and let me make sure 'cause it's coming fast and furious no I don't see that the FBI is turned over\nTheir report yet but they're supposed to according to Bob Corker\nHe thought it was going to happen sometime this afternoon opioid thing okay and Murkowski on

there and ask about broad band in rural America because it's a huge issue for us so that's where she is no indication of what she's going to do on the Kavanaugh saying [noise] um\nThat wouldn't I don't know how to read the tea leaves zero Murkowski I Would think as as outspoken as she is she had a problem with Kavanaugh she'd say it and here's\nSomething else you need to keep in mind too and I learned this through years of working with legislatures out\nThere on some of these issues and see how they operate they don't call for a vote if you're in the majority and you want something to pass
