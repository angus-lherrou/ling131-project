Steinem publicly defended Bill Clinton in Nineteen Ninety eight\nWith what became known as the one group Baldwin grope free pass through\nApplied only the Democrats\nOf course Republicans would continue to be crucified as usual although chancellor parted ways with ms magazines mainstream women's movement\nShe stay truer to the actual mission of feminism which was formed to help improve the lives of women into fight injustice against them this chancellor has done in the book\nAnd matter of fact book after book over her entire life most notably chancellor has been one of the few feminist willing to tackle the pitiful state of women under Islam\nOf facts studious Lee denied by mainstream feminism but in fact one of the list for example thousands of little British school girls have been cruelly raped and trafficked among Muslim men in the most sadistic manner imaginable over a period of twenty plus years\nWhile the police and Britain's social services were frozen in fear of being called races for noticing\nDiversity as our strength must taste like saw dust in their mouths but this is where a modern feminism has brought us the mainstream women's movement is guilty of pointing out the tiniest mode in any\nAnd every man's I while simultaneously ignoring the wooden beam in its own Gloria Steinem might have some spleen and to do [noise]\nYou know tell you I've been reading like the ten most important events or whatever I can remember the title of most to ten most important events so history or something like that and I was talking telling you yesterday about the crusades you know there are nine of them\nAnd then one of the ladder crusades and actually it was a ... a bunch of kids really they came from Germany\nAnd these kids we're talking\nThirty twelve Thirteen fourteen year old kids got so from the about going and taking Jerusalem back from the Muslims\nThey decided that they were going to march to Rome first to get the blessing of the pope and then it was going to be on there to Jerusalem but there was so young and naive but they thought it was like a day's hike it wasn't\nAnd the interesting one of the interesting parts of this and I don't remember the names of the people involved but they they were by the tens maybe hundreds of thousands of these kids are we're marching and they marched to Rome and the pope\nSaid look you know we can't let you know we can't let you march on you kids need to go home and so he sent them marching back across Italy and some of them ended up I think it was in France or I'm not sure exactly where it was\nAnd it may have been in ... Italy but anyway the in the long story short is this the surviving ones because many of them died on the trick to Rome and and trying to get back to wherever they're going and so\nThey stay in this town for a year or so and they said finally The Elders of the town took pity on them and said that they were going to buy ships for them to sail them back to Germany so that they can be reunited with\nTheir with their parents and so they had like three ships they commissioned and they got these are young lands all scrubbed up\nReady to go get them a new clothes got I'm healthy a lot of them had died from disease and put 'em on the ships to say oh by the Germany\nAnd it was a teen years later that the that everybody realize what was going on\nThe families of course we're word traveled very slowly in those days and they sat around waiting for these kids to show up and they never showed up\nAnd people were wondering where the ships lost at sea or what and what happened was those benevolent merchants in this town that got together these three ships had actually sold them to the Muslims into slavery\nNow one of these kids ended up going home\nSome died in old age but they are dying and slavery many of them died or on the track back to the holy land and then some of them lived their entire lives as long as they lasted being slaves to the Muslims back then\nAgain we've talked about this you know there was a lot of barbarism going on around the world\n[noise] Christianity seems to have evolved to\nPass that we talk about the um [noise] you know the\nCrusades and all this and there was a lot of blame to go around and all sides because a lot of these quote unquote crusaders or actually more all there is they were going from town to town and raping pillaging plum during doing whatever they want and that was just telling the people on the way I mean this wasn't even the Muslim ban and gotten to them yet\nAnd when they did they did the same thing to them too but we have evolved now in a situation where it seems like it's part of Islam a large part of it is stuck in the twelve hundreds 'cause you don't see\nChristians going around doing this you don't see Christians burning Jews and the steak anymore you know\nYou just don't see this any more but you still see the Muslims that are engaging in this and the part of this piece to not only about Gloria Steinem was to bring about\nAwareness of what's going on in some quarters and the Muslim religion as far as women are concerned and everybody knows that women for the most part in Islam are treated as second class citizens but the feminist tend to just turn a blind eye to it I don't understand that at all\nEither but I I really don't I mean I'm trying to make it a computer in my mind but you know why you ... your big thing is the rights of women while in Saudi Arabia women have just gotten the right to\nDrive and we have the feminine saying look at this isn't this wonderful isn't this wonderful\nSo now what we're up\nTo Nineteen ten do you mean this is wonderful so long overdue you go over\nThere and many places if you're a woman you have to cover your head with a scarf\nWhat's that all about\nNobody has any of the feminist Christian among for and the rest of these folks you know they know and they cover their heads with a scarf and they think they're so ... they're so cosmopolitan\nAnd I'm going why don't you just say screw\nYou [laughter] well yeah because you know what's going to happen to you end up in jail or worse\nBut we don't want to talk about the plight of women who won't put a scarf over their head or who might dare to get behind the wheel of an automobile we just talk about the wonderful progress they've made over there can you imagine that we're over here\nIt would never be enough and I don't blame him that's not enough I mean there needs to be full equality for everybody this is\nWhy this whole thing was dealing with Saudi Arabia you know now Saudi Arabia\nIs saying\nOkay here's it'd be a we killed the guy this Washington Post can we killed him we didn't mean to kill him it was a a a harsh interrogation by some uh Rosa interrogators but
