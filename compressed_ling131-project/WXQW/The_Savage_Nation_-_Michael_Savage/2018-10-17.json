could even imagine [noise] pray to God and we don't have to use it and they'll be nothing like what we have and there is nothing like what we have and that's why I did that I made\nDeals with the devil in order to get that done\nDeals with the devil then that would be the Democrats for same thing he repeats them so they needed says immigration remains a top priority for him and his administration says current uh laws are terrible and just go to all the picks them\nAnd see what's happening with the border where people are coming up in caravans we have to stop them even though the laws that terrible\nTerrible our laws that terrible there laughing stock all over the world and we're supposed to stop people with laws that are very good but will we doing better than anybody else could possibly I don't even think of it and\nGo and then with trained negotiates with China up you've taken a brief pause is courting do commerce secretary Wilbur Ross Trump told reporters during the campaign we'd be average continue to work at a good trade deal between the U.S and China\nIt's hard for them to do a deal because\nThey've had it so good for so long it's very hard\nThing for them to do but we have a very good relationship with China\nWe have I have a great relationship with President Xi than I think you'll see something happen to be good for both ... and then he said this about\nOur country has rebuilt it China [noise] with the hard work ingenious also [noise] but how our country is allowed itself to lose five hundred million dollars a year and much more than that [noise] it's ridiculous\nIt is ridiculous and that's where we are so we're we're doing all of these things and that's something that doesn't get a lot of press because everybody talks about you know I listen to sometimes you ever listen to market march on NPR or market place or whatever it is and it's supposed to be about\nYou know the markets and all that but it's always about how Trump is yours ruining everything with these trade tariffs and he's going to get us in a trade war and model and blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah\nAnd I'm going well we're down side here so they always have these folks they cherry pick these folks out of wherever\nAnd they say yes this is going to tell us all to go get and it's not coming to fruition none of this stuff is happening in the new things happening what we're doing is we're bringing shame man\nAnd these other trade partners to the table and were renegotiating the deal is one of the time\nOne of the time they're being renegotiated and they're being renegotiated so that they're more favorable to us as they should have been to start with\nBut we look at this\nFrom is from the standpoint of all the tariffs are horrible I don't want to see tariffs\nTariffs certainly can have an adverse effect on the American consumer is if we're the ones paying it\nBut I don't know necessarily that we're going to be the ones paying it hey what it's designed to get these other trade partners to lower their tariffs on things that they are they doing to us now that doesn't affect you and me as consumers because we're not in business but if you're in business and you're trying to sell I don't know\nJack Daniels or something like that in China and they put a big tariffs on the thing when it comes over there you go on why is that fair\nAnd and then you know what they do is they try to rip you off whether it's intellectual property or whatever they try to replicate stuff you remember when they broke into Sony\nThe north Koreans in the north Koreans broke into Sony\nAnd of course they share that with the Chinese I've always thought that there was no way that the north Koreans themselves have the technology I always thought that they either gotten to technology or were helped by the Chinese\nOr what happened was you know we won't we got from it we're all the salacious emails about everybody inside and that's what the press picked up on but the big stuff was they stole intellectual property movies and things like this and then they distributed in China North Korea they rip them off\nSome trying to stop that and Hollywood have real thing [noise] uh\nIt's hard to say too young to have a highly [noise]\n\nI Know have the same way when they all had him all like to think about which is why why am\nI needed to

who disappeared and is suspected it would have been murdered in Turkey by the Saudis secretary of state Mike Pompeo has talked with officials from turkey and Saudi Arabia of the\nOr we can begin to formulate what the appropriate response to be [noise] I Do think it's important [noise] everyone [noise]\nMore than double where bin Laden was left free to operate out cutting the blessing of the United states corrupt officials after waging jihad against the citizens are there's a book out called pain how we dismantle the FBI in Arbor dramas and it'd be\nIt was in documents the incredible American betrayal and what they're talking about in this is that um [noise] we sort of turned a blind eye to a lot of stuff\nAnd we did not do what we needed to\nDo to make sure that we were actually feeding these folks now are you if you remember we were giving aid and comfort to the mujahideen\nAnd that was Osama bin Laden and that's when they were fighting the Soviets in Afghanistan and again [noise] the enemy of my enemy is my friend as the old Russian saying goes and then the Soviet Union was defeated in the enemy of my enemy turns out to be my enemy to\nWell that's where we are\nAnybody who believes that we should spread\nIslam around the world to the point man and then again if you're Muslim you're saying well why is this any different from Christians going around and proselytizing and sending missionaries abroad and the rest of it\nI have no problem if you want to share your religion with somebody and they say hey this sounds like a great idea I Believe about tell somebody else I mean you know it's like Amway\nSo [laughter] I mean you build your little pyramid or religious scheme and it starts to spread I'm no problem with them\nWhat I have a problem with is saying uh at some point that well this is not happening fast enough so hey do you want to be a Muslim oh you don't okay I'll kill you and then it becomes a problem because Christians don't go around killing people who don't agree with them but there are some Muslims who do not all obviously\nAnd it's a problem inside the quote unquote Muslim community\nWell the question here is\nWhere was this cash Haji guy and the spectrum of\nIslam\nWas he a radical was he a moderate was the um more where was the\nIt seems to me that if he's a member of the Muslim Brotherhood which has every indication that this guy was a spy for the Muslim Brotherhood\nOr if in fact that was the case then he's a radical Muslim I'm not saying that's reason enough for the Saudis to kill him and this member him\nI mean there's going to be an investigation into this and we're going to find out\nBut it's not this cut and dried thing oh journalist walks into an embassy and then you know comes out and several part so that means it's a it's not that simple but the mainstream media folks are trying to portray this guy as some voice of freedom\nAnd he was the exact opposite if this guy got his\nWay people wouldn't be under the rule of a theocracy\nAnd from the life of me I can understand how progressive as liberal Democrats\nCozy up to all of this nonsense about we want to take over countries and make them theocracy and that's because they don't like any kind of religion most of them are religious at all and most of these journalists were the first ones that would be headed by these folks who take over these countries yet\nThey continue to defend them and they continue to a align themselves I I don't want to say on this I don't understand it at all\nUnless as in the case of ... mall Kosh Haji\nIt's a way to get the Trump and I've told you this from the get go on this thing here is going to be the end game and I don't know that they you may have seen this I don't watch a lot of BS NBC or CNN so they may already be saying this I haven't seen it but to me it's the leading up to this you know Trump was talking about how the media\nAre the enemy of the state and this is what happens when he says that\nYou've got these regimes around the world but here that and they saying well we can just kill journalist and will so this is Trump's fault and don't think for a second that they're not trying to at least insinuate if not outright saying that Trump is trying to hide something on behalf of the Saudi Government\nNow we've got bombed pale who went over there and met with a men salami and some other folks who was it yesterday and I heard a report on MPR\nAnd they said uh they said that ah Mike Pompeo walks into the meeting smiling and he has nothing he should be smiling about\nI'm going well he's you know you you what do you want to walk and they're given to people to finger you know he walks in there and he's having received a diplomat and he's going over there as you do and you got Obama\nWho was over there bowing and kissing brains and whatever you know his lip zone\nAnd nobody had a problem with that what I wasn't in the in the in the wake of this a horrible feeling of this and journalists he's\nNot a journalist he's an opinion writer and he's also as far as we can tell a spy for the Muslim Brotherhood this could very well have been a situation where they were luring this guy and so they could kill him\nIn other words execute him because he was a spy I don't know is that a good thing doesn't sound like it to me but is it the worst thing that the Saudi Arabians I've ever done I don't think so\nBut it's being blown up the for us to believe this from the same folks who didn't give a ranch Rob the for folks dying the consulate in Benghazi\nWhere was the outrage about that and where was the demand that we got to the bottom of it and we hold people responsible while the people responsible for Hillary and Obama so the mainstream media completely ignored that story\nEven worse than that when the people who were screaming for attention on it they tried to deflect it and say oh come on conspiracy theorists and everything else so far people dying and constantly being a they make up\nAnd now we got some guy who's a Muslim Brotherhood spy who died in the conflict in Turkey\nAnd we're supposed to care more about that then we cared about Benghazi I don't understand that at all unless you look at it through the prism of we're going to get Trump or we're going to blame that so that's coming in as an order to come they're going to\nTry to somehow twist is around so that is Trump's role in the meantime San Fran ... ladies and gentleman she says that she's not willing to trade anything\nFor a border wall\nIn other words there's nothing that they want but it's important enough to get a border wall\nIt'll probably be the worst way to protect the border she says and then she throws this out and you can now she's taking a cue from Stormy Daniels she says that ah it happens\nTo be like a man who is an issue for the president building a wall and I'm not interested in\nThat thing you know she can be calling them tiny ah\nBelow sea emphasized Democrats do support border security but they prefer to look at strengthening existing security measures as part of a comprehensive overhaul of immigration laws says we can't allow him to say we're not interested in protecting the border\nSays that isn't the only way to protect the border in fact it's probably the worst way to protect the border really explain that saying for a man\nHow in the world is a border the worst way to protect the border in other words it keeps everybody out and here's what I hear from the liberals when we're this is back in the nineties when they were talking about building a wall building a fence or whatever they said they'll just go around it and I said now that there's no around and go\nYou build it across the entire border where you can so there is no around it what do you tell them and they'll just go around it well then we'll build up a wall where they were going around it my\nGosh but then they'll go round that well then eventually will get across the board and there won't be any around and go\nOkay it's ridiculous to think\nA border wall will not protect the border\nAnd a car the names of those in bolted not been released one person was
