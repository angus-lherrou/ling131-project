issues of the Democrats today in many respects it seems as though it's the parties only issue of significant importance other than calling for the impeachment of Donald Trump of course\nThis phenomenon isn't limited to federal elections\nMany ... minute gubernatorial candidates are saying it's time for the ... the takeover of the health care marketplace for example in purple Florida\nTallahassee mayor Andrew Gillum by the way you folks in Florida you are you listening\nTo me how man Florida\nIf you are not getting out and voting good grave it's all hands on deck and

now so you go in there with Fifteen folks and see the doctor\nWhat's up with the what's the what's right and and get out how in the world do you think your proper king or when you're more than Fifteen

... you know that's going to work don't show oh I'm not going to tell anybody\nI can think about more bizarre and insulting way to treat patients suffering from serious and sometimes embarrassing

Akron in fact\nSays asking for money ahead of time crosses the line into vote by fact asked the Senate Ethics committee the pro fundraising email sent by miss Warren\nAnd miss Harris both Democrats of
