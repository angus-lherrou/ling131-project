wrapped an ISIS flag to ISIS bomber hash tag ISIS bummer so why is hashtags maggot bomber trending on Twitter without so much as a shred of evidence that is a good question\nAnd so they look at the finish wrapped in um\nOne of these bombs they say is wrapped in an ISIS flag so could this be ISIS who knows who it is I Would think if there were I says one of them would have gone off\nThat's why I'm this is why it's so suspicious\nTo me because it's again let me just walk us through for you if you are a craze Trump supporter and you think that George Soros\nAnd Hillary Clinton and Bill Clinton and a block Obama and Maxine Waters and Debbie what's her name show up in CNN or the devil incarnate don't you think one of the bombs were the exploded\n\nI'm just saying they all show up and not want to mix loads\nIt it sounds like to me it's somebody trying to draw sympathy for these people not somebody who's trying to kill them if they were trying to kill them and I again I'm not making a suggestion but Maxine Waters will be pretty easy to take out\nI mean she's at rallies all the time I mean somebody you know somebody can show I mean what any of these folks on the right or left\nYou show up at a rally and he started shooting from the back of the room I mean nobody's checking anything is Maxine Waters rallying for crying out loud none of people there to walk the secret service with\nMetal detectors in the rest of it she shows up at a town hall meeting somewhere in California and somebody could take I'm not look again I'd please don't anybody must understand I'm just saying if you're going to kill Maxine Waters this will be the hardest way to do it\nTo send a bomb to her office that you know is going to be looked at offsite and found before it ever gets to her office you know it's never going to get to her office you know it's never going to get the Debbie Wasserman Schultz has office you know it's never going to get to Obama or the Hillary they all have offsite\nMail

blaming it on Trump himself he was devising this in the basement of the White House you know\nGive me some more see for where's my Dempsey for [laughter]\nThat's good I mean they're all but doing that now there and stop playing with the seafood [laughter] uh\nIs give me a short fuse like me so yeah I mean you look at these things and now we got ISIS markings on these things and who knows where they came from\nBut I'm just telling you if this were a professional that\nReally wanting to kill these folks this is the least likely way to do it but it's the most likely way to get a bunch of attention and get people all upset and gender up against the president because of his rhetoric I'm just\nSaying again we'll see cause I Would ... yeah how many people wanna make bets on how long it takes the secret service the FBI to figure out who this is a here's the other question if we find out who it is are they going to tell us that would be very telling too and in developing [noise]\n\n\nI'm Joe

blah blah blah blah\nAnd then nobody to blame the Democrats for the guy the shots themes beliefs while yelling that they need to do something about health care\nNo money at all blaming the Democrats were that Michel ... this for all of those recklessly in gleefully tweeting hashtags mega bomber here's a cautionary tale of jumping to partisan conclusions and blaming conservative free speech for political murder that turned out to be a suicide\nAnd she's got a link to a piece from November of two thousand nine the census workers suicide the right guy blamed and bloggers want an apology when census\nWorker bills spark when was found a hanging from a tree with the word fed scrawled across scrawled across the street I remember this story\nSome suggested that conspiracy theorists on the right word partly to blame but investigators pronounce the census workers that the suicide and now lit up with the news of it's a exoneration the conservative bloggers fears demanding an apology from fellow pundits\nRobert say see McCain isn't about to forgive is liberal brethren anytime soon quote well you biased bastard the I have not forgotten\nOr the role you played here and you will not escape blamed for your journalistic malpractice and he's naming names yes we remember all those headlines\nA yes Mr Sullivan and Mr under we remember all your irresponsible speculation that people have clay county Kentucky oh wait you're apologies\nMichelle market at the time once an apology I'm not holding my breath she says since I raised this question eleven days ago and there's been no response but I'm not going to let go and she's looking at the Atlantic Andrew Sullivan who mark and says it's too busy nursing is pale induced psychosis to own up\nAt reason magazine Jesse Welch says it wasn't just bloggers on the left to jump to conclusions what's important was the leap to judgment\nA large number of commentators assumed apparently inaccurately the death was a murder that the murder was political and that the motive was linked to one Congress woman's crusade they made those assumptions because it fit a narrative to which they were committed when people on the left or on the right to do that\nThey are accused of paranoia or being so eager to connect the dots that they run ahead what the evidence actually says but the sad story from Kentucky be reminded that the establishment is just as capable of making this mistake\nAs the fringe [laughter] so we will find out we have a ... at this point absolutely no idea who was behind this now at first blush you can assume oh there's some craze right wing not out there who have George Soros some guy probably listening to the film Valentine show\nGot all worked up about George Soros and funding the or the caravan and everything else is George Soros has\nDone and uh and then he hates Maxine Waters Kosovo was talking about that too\nAnd hates Obama cause spills made fun of Obama\nI mean there's no telling where this ends and of course there's the Clintons naturally\nAnd then there's Debbie Wasserman Schultz is filled with on her case for a long time with the one boy so it's bound to be filled Valentine I mean there at least he's got something to do with it I mean you know this kind of stuff is coming not specifically me I'm not a\nBig enough fish to be on their radar but you know what I'm saying it's the rhetoric coming from the right in the right wing hate talkers on TALK radio and they get these people who are already halfway crazy all the way crazy and then they make bombs and they send them out of these folks\nWell it could be a right wing not there's no doubt about that at first blush it looks like a right wing nuts\nBut the fact to me that pain none of the bombs exploded\nAnd me\nThey were sent to people where they know that they would be filtered through an offsite screening facility either by the Capitol police or by the secret service\nTells me somebody who just wanted to make a statement and it still could be somebody on the right just wanting to make a statement wanting to scare these folks wanting them to look over their shoulders everywhere they go or it could be some left wing nuts\nWho wanted to get everybody ginned up right here before the midterm elections saying saying this is what Trump's rhetoric does but I Would suggest to you know with all the evidence they have an all of these bombs unexploded and still intact\nIt shouldn't take the government officials that long to figure out who did this how many of you\nPeople have access to all the bomb making material to make a bomb or you can say you can go to the hardware store but that would be an over simplification of this these were\nA crudely constructed pipe bombs and you gotta have gunpowder and you're going to have all sorts of stuff and a lot of this stuff is\nTraceable I mean you can find out where it came from they can find now we're certain black powder certain gunpowder has actually made the right back to the the exact facility and they can trace it from there where did it go from there who had access to this and this kind of stuff [noise]\nUh we have what we we don't know when they die sec these bombs that they were actually active bombs that could've exploded they may have been things that looked like bombs to scare people who knows but the fact that they're all intact and the packaging is all intact and the one at CNN came from a\nCourier now they're not seeing it came from some official career like fed ex or UPS or something like this it was just a courier if they got the video footage of this guy or gal or whoever delivered the thing it might be is as simple as tracing back and say who gave me this package or the career could be the person who made the bomb\nWho knows I'm sure the FBI is on it right now they say oh let's go to lunch and we're worried about this tomorrow now they are on at twenty four seven there you go to I can guarantee you they're going to track down who did this the question is how soon\nAnd if it comes before the midterm elections and it turns out to be some right wing mega guy with the ...\nOh my gosh the left wing is going to go nuts\nBut if it happens to be some left wing nuts who was trying to make a point this story will go away\nMark my words on this if this happens to be a left wing or once we find that out you'll never hear about this story to get in the mainstream press oh yeah Daily Caller will habit the blaze Fox News will do some stories on it\nBut it will not be on the front page of the New York times or the Washington Post it'll be all okay wait wait we need to get back to the murder investigation and Russia ah\nWe got better things to do bigger fish to fry there's nothing to see here folks if it turns
