I'm Sorry you complete pharmacy school\nI didn't come to me because like in if this happened last year um I hadn't gotten I had gotten dismissed from the program because I had a a serious problem emergency that kind of jeopardize my feeding and um I had to withdraw my application and be kicked out of the program so I have a lot\nAt home now you know how long were you in on the issue\nOf four or five to four years\nYou were in for four years four years yeah I Want you to elaborate on how much do you like ...\nUm\nI only had three questions left in completing the on campus um of course work and then I have to want to hear from patients and then after one year you graduate and they can afford and I'm a pharmacist\nWhat level of family emerge and she would keep you from going across the finish line\n[laughter] well\nUm I I have a parent that has gone on controls high blood pressure and diabetes and ah maybe suffered a stroke\nOr you know very close to a stroke and that kind of um [noise] I can take on a series care and um you know in terms of helping him down and that kind of like you don't mess with the times that I had to send for for my my my um studies\n\nOffices in Jacksonville, Florida travelers welcomes I've rented so\nHey Dave how you doing anything at all sure opposite a shell a date for my wife and I are already\nHere um we have about Seventy five thousand dollar car is going\nOn we own our home outright uh we have a vehicle writers in case and that sent me five thousand you know we make a decent money and rehab in Iran or what about you are in ... in the corporate aren't what what's decent money\nOr she makes about one twenty and I make about eighty okay\nSo the question that I that I have a good faith that we have is um her mother and father passed away last year and uh she was not an American ... and she has a certain amount of it if you want to be here for tax purposes my idea for the inheritance money I'm is to\nTake one lump sum\nPay off all of our debt and then ... hey ourselves back for that to an IRA I'm so that we don't have to worry about including repaying the uh interests game if you will her a worry about that is that she um she going to be some of that are good for Iraq for our retirement\nOn my record good at it this year forty I'm thirty eight we've come up a good amount of time to be putting into our um different calling me out so I guess my question is should we go ahead and take the distribution pale are dead so that when there longer and the\nUm you know the interest rates or should we pay the debt down and we are\nAre they won't be there for you when you want to bring your\nWe've been using for almost Thirty years a decision making paradigm a decision making structure that is based on the idea of what is the fastest way to wealth what is the shortest distance for wealth\nAnd I'm In the process what number is what gives us the register returns and what give like there was just the least risk what what has the level of wisdom to it um and it's not just one sided it's not all investing mind of it's not all that in mind that it's not anything it's just a process of financial planning process\nThat process has not been proven obviously doing it for twenty five years and many many people have become millionaires in multi millionaires gradually not get rich quick using the process\nUm then the question becomes do you guys would you agree to use that process and if you're is so by the way I Would answer that\nDuring that process um then the question becomes do you guys were you agree to use that process\nAnd if you're so that the way I Would answer the question obviously me being me is I'm going to tell you use that process and that will answer your question what to do with the money but um but you've got a first decide do you want to do that or not I mean that's that's that's the core disagreement here\nWhat the process is based on the process is called the baby steps and what it's based on is a couple of things number one year most powerful wealth building tool\nIs your income\nAnd freeing up your income and not having that not only lowers risk not only increases the peace and the quality of the relationship in the household but it also increases mathematically\nFreeze up all of your income just to make money with instead of giving it to banks and on and the second part of the things driving the process is is that personal finance is eighty percent behavior in only twenty percent hip knowledge stuff we're talking about it's not really rocket science here\nThere's not a lot to the math it's it's about fourth or fifth grade math is really all it is\nSo having said that we say baby step one side of a thousand dollars you guys are obviously done that too is to be debt free everything but your house you've not done that\nThree is to have an emergency fond of three to six months of expenses I didn't hear that you've done that and then so where do you have that for a start putting Fifteen Percent of your income in retirement so how much is in your emergency fund\nCurrently we have about whom fiber in our settings now\nIf the inheritance was not on the table what we would teach you to do struck that down to twenty four through the uh or take twenty four of the twenty five and throw it to that and then clean up this debt very very quickly it is absurd for United certainly five dollars in debt with a two hundred dollar household income it was I mean right up in\nA a couple of months ago and I'm a runoff on a knife in your life for them on a regular you\nKnow ... it's absurd that you make two hundred dollars a year and there was any five dollars in debt ...\n... ... you know you're going to make enough money to have done this the right way you chose not to do it the right way so\nIt's up to you guys but if you're going to do what we teach you know you would use this inheritance immediately to become debt free so that you take all those famous is you don't have any more and you use those to build wealth with you paid for home\nCorrectly when hired at my\n... and how much is in the inheritance in cash\nI I'm not quite a hundred by mother on the north of one Seventy five\nHundred and twenty five thousand dollars correct okay and why she taking distributions instead of just taking it\nOn ... ... or find on the ground or order the ah the makers to um [noise] I'm covered at a four eighty here in an art over but not a good way to quit hung out of it out\nIt's a bunch of crap um the\nUh okay because anytime you start making your decisions based on taxes instead of based on economics you make bad decisions so I don't know what this money's invested in but I Want to get control of this money and get it invested\nSo when I Do I catch the whole thing out pay some taxes and um get a different financial advisor and uh I Would pay off all the debt and I'm really invest the rest of it\nUh in something that I can see control and know what it is\nAnd uh I Would pay off all the debt and invest the rest of it uh in something that I can see controlling the what it is in good mutual funds or in some paid for real estate or something like that I honestly don't think that's what you all are going to do but that's what I Would do um because\nI think there's a lot of corruption is kitchen\nThere's a lot of opinions flying around here and you guys have got to get inside this into as a couple of decide what you're going to do and how you're going to handle money and then you start telling financial advisors what to do is to them telling you what to do and on and it's a different different situation so I think she inherited the financial advisor to\nI don't think he picked him and um and that's really a bad medicine as well\nNinety percent of the time are you guys need to pick 'em or you need to re pick him in hiring again and this time he works for you but\nI think he's still works for ... and it was oh grandpa was dead and that's the way their stuff works usually at that medicine Travis what I Would do just catch the whole thing out pay off all my debts and invest the money\nWas what's left that's what I Would do and I would take your wonderful two hundred thousand dollar income and become multi millionaires with it and that's what we've shown people how to do for almost three decades now\nHold on I'll send you guys are a couple a copy of the book the total money make over it'll walk you through not only what to do but why didn't do it and then you can decide intentionally whether you're going to use our system or someone else's than ... Oscar as one of those in Chicago hey Oscar welcome to that Iran's you show\nHey Dave uh we've got to stick to today they would pick my cough certainly home my question is quick a just a began to 'em or until you on ... on Fox cast it not just found them to be doing everything that\nNothing to do we talk about I Know I have to get a punishment be\nUniversity clocks I Will probably picking the right to where I can do about what about um as you point out doing everything you're seeing a lot of the big question today it's\nGot all my credit card um K. got a call the credit card company ... for the\nMovie does that count out of my name got we just don't want to remove it on the show using it you know right away\nOr absolutely absolutely need to close the accounts completely not just cut them up and they'll keep them from reporting activity on your credit bureau report and it'll keep someone from accidently fraudulent let you using them or are you from using them\nYeah I definitely would close the account officers I caught up\nIn the cards no doubt about it and talk to you Oscar I'm honored to have is a new listener hold on I'll send you a copy of the book the total moneymaker over and that'll get you started and give you the the framework from all these different pieces of information they're lying around right now [noise]\nThis is the day Ramsey [noise]\n\n\nHey Alan cranky right for years I've been a part of ...

nine plan for my daughter she has autism so I may open an ... account instead would depending on the severity of our offices and\nMy biggest concern is that I don't know what happens is the money and five twenty nine if she doesn't go to college can you tell me what happens to money not used for education\nOr it will be if you don't transfer it to a sibling um it'll be heavily taxed and penalize be taxed and heavily penalize so um\nYou know the twenty nine is not a good plan a for a child that you're not sure what's going to happen as far as their education is going to be and on where you get a special needs to Jewish and like this I Would use the able to count 'em and or I Would just use mutual fund\nJust blurted major alone and let it grow and then you can just take care of the child with that money you're just you're marking it for them for their future or they may do a trade school\nMay do or they may be able to have a full for your academic run 'em they may do a lot of things I don't know how the severity of this I don't know exactly what you're facing but are you simply going to save money\nIt's that simple invest money in your name and you're controlling it and then you can decide to help your child however you want to the only advantage of the table or the last one and it's just the tax advantage\nStill just an investment in a good mutual fund\nAnd the question is at our as it grows is gonna be taxed\nThat's the only thing so I said it's an advantage if you have a real high probability of them doing our education\nBut again where you've got a special needs situation most of the time I'm going to say just save it in a regular account shaping the mutual fund if you want to use the cable that's fine that's what it's designed for you all kinds of stuff with that it's a good plan but\nI probably would just keep it where I get my hands on it and I'm not a big deal either way the the thing the reason we push about twenty nine says those two things uh ... in a traditional ... situation\nIt teaches you a brain wash your kid to go to college which isn't a bad thing at all and the other thing is it allows that money to grow tax free and so it's a ... that's a wonderful benefits but is that ... is that the only possible way you can care for your child not\nJust in a more traditional situation it's the best way the most um you know the least taxes on the thing which is generally what we want to do\nUm we're letting grow but in this situation I I'm not the tax benefit is not worth the pension you in the corner and actually hitting you harder later I'm making you wish you just pay the taxes\nAnd and that's the way to work out open phones at triple eight eight to five five two to five ... on Twitter David I'm thinking about studying abroad next
