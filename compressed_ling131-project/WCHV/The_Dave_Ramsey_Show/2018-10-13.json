mhm\n[noise] and I've already received a lot of like settlements in the mail mhm last like I had a federal king hundred dollar and they all that there are are from David take signing hired for a friend of mine like very little that thousands of dollars that works for getting mhm\nThat I have to pay taxes on that like the end of the year and I was just wondering if true\nThat is true that is not giving us except on a mortgage on your\nMortgage on your home is a taxable income and they likely will send you a ten Ninety nine for the amount that they forgave\nOur cache of what's your household income\n[noise] um [noise] it it's very very ... about how about forty five thousand a year\nOkay so let's say let's say you're out and ... percent tax bracket as an example okay let's pretend\nIf you were in a twenty percent tax bracket and you had a thousand dollars in forgiveness that didn't cost you a thousand dollars and only costs you two hundred dollars right okay so it's still a good deal but your yeah your I have about two hundred dollars per thousand\nFor that is forgiven that'll hit your taxes if they ten Ninety nine you\nYou have no obligation to list it and I would just wait until you know they do that if they follow through on that but if and the larger the forgiveness is the more likely they will follow through with a ten Ninety nine and send you that but as you get that then you will do the taxes so\nYeah I'd I'd get ready for some taxes at tax time that I'm by April ... you know that you may have\nIn in addition to that now if you had a large

who are emotionally mature enough to handle the numbers I don't tell a four year old that you're worth ten million dollars because they will go to kindergarten and tell it\nOkay and they're not emotionally capable of handling that information our children in our case did not know\nOur wealth as a matter of fact when we finally did unveil it and they were in their early twenties it was shocking to them because they were raised\nLike regular people but I had a lot of wealth in the background and um so I didn't want to mess up their childhood by them making assumptions about things I didn't need to make assumptions about [noise]\nBut then as we presented it to them it was presented as a responsibility\nNot I will do we hit the lottery possess for me in my house we sort of more\nMeaning that you don't know anything you're just managing for God\nAnd that takes a little of the ... who all of it\nSo they need to be emotionally mature and share it with him and we do about
