people\nSo I'm not start a business or were they earn their prey selling a candle she may\nBut I also want to do it but it per se that both\nYour your phone is breaking up can you speak directly into

the regular El Al ...\nOf the above I shut up as a sole proprietorship you're over complicating a candle business with a ... year old\nOkay to shut up as a sole proprietorship you're probably not even gonna make any money you make a little bit it'll be fine pay some taxes on it and if you want to fund a Roth IRA for her or something the point here in this situation is when you have a kid running a business to the point is not the business the point is and what the kid is learning\nThey're learning work they're learning interface with customers and how to treat people or they're learning that they have to deliver on time they have to deliver quality they're learning how to put prices on something or they're learning that it's a good thing to make a profit the capitalism is not evil ... these are the lessons are what is important\nTo understand the accurate or if she make some money that's just a bonus\nRight but what what'd you about in a fight as you've identified the way this kid is wired\nAnd a lot of us that are entrepreneurial are are a lot or at least a little bit ADD [laughter] right right I mean how much you'll pass anything the shiny I run towards it you know since\nYou know one of which will be boys or to have to go off to college is shop\nAnd understand\nWhat college costs because\nIt is one of the most bizarre things to learn the\nThe distance between the less expensive schools and the most expensive schools I mean we're talking eight thousand eighty thousand a year\nSpread I mean it's it's even cheaper probably than that but it's amazing and people just assume all of color just the same cost it's just not and it's the number one mistake people make when they don't have a lot of money and the kid is going off to school it draws people in the student loan debt 'cause they simply go to school we can afford\nAnd as you know we have a student loan crisis with a half a trillion dollars\nIn student loan debt we have an entire department within our company called Ramsey education\nThat puts a curriculum and the high schools and colleges across America we're now in forty percent of the high schools teaching high schoolers this common sense stuff of staying out of bed and being on a budget and learning to save money and all of that kind of thing\nThen what happens from time to time is the schools can't afford\nThe basic resources and so someone will come a long shot in the community of business or an entity of some kind and we'll pay for that high school to have foundations in personal finance curriculum from the rams the organization is that we've got about four million students go through\nOne of the coolest things as shopping lately is the University of Wyoming\nHas decided that every high school\nOne of the coolest things has happened lately is the University of Wyoming\nHas decided that every high school in the entire state of Wyoming needs to have this curriculum and they're sponsoring it and paying for it\nDang dang touchdown baby that's how that happens the college university says we're going to take care of these high schoolers\nIn our state and make sure they learn about money and of course the University of Wyoming is the best cost alternative in the Wyoming area to go to college so this all works out really really good now Tyler Moore is with me on the line and\nTile is from the University of Wyoming he's the associate vice provost of enrollment Kyle White uh go man thank you for doing that is\nWell it's a it's a pleasure to visit with you David ... thanks for that we are certainly Saturday here in the state of Wyoming can be able to partner with a Ramsey education and provide from practical applicable\nThings for students to be able to apply that college search and uh and and be a real fatty consumer of higher education\nYeah 'cause you guys do have low tuition I mean you're you're you're you're the best deal round I wasn't getting right\nYes there we are we have the lowest resident tuition any public institution that grant doctoral degrees anywhere in the United states\nOf all fifty states of all the rooms are like so like your cheaper than my University of Tennessee you're you're cheaper than the University of dot dot dot\nThat's correct wow very cool very cool and I got to tell you when I heard what your whole promotion was\nBehind this I immediately wanted to steal it and bring it and use it somewhere in like in the University of Tennessee and I'll tell you were doing a few minutes but I Will get them to do it yeah you guys are creative I Love this tell everybody about this uh about this campaign and and the the motto for the campaign is hands down the best thing I've heard\nSo that our our our campaign is called the world needs more cowboys we're we're not talking about guys and cowboy hats that ride off into the sunset but we're talking about a state with a long heritage and a university mascot and a cowboy that can be\nAnyone from any gender any background but we're talking about that enters here we're talking about a curiosity and independence vote in this\nEffort Sudafed adventure and we're talking about someone who changes landscapes and and look for opportunities to make differences in the world we are talking about trailblazers and people exemplify the spirit of the underdog you know it's not a cowboy isn't what you are but it's who you are\nYeah well and you guys are the cowboys\nI mean so it's a play on words obviously I mean if you're a mascot right\nThat's correct your football team your basketball team whatever's the cowboys I mean like my University of Tennessee Volunteers I think they ought to steal it inside of the world needs more volunteers that makes it just as much sense right and so as good I play on words but you you guys got though that you got to the table first with this way to go man I Love it\nIt's a great motto or does it says so much in just a so few words very very cool well we're really grateful to all of our sponsors around the country that are helping us and you gotta sponsoring the high school every high school in Wyoming is going to have\nAs of coming up soon the the high school curriculum because the cowboys paid for it [laughter]\nThat's pretty cool Kyle thank you man\nGet them because the cowboys paid for it [laughter]\nThat's pretty cool Kyle thank you man\nWe're happy to be happy to be a partner we uh we are we are state that is very practical were state that is very much um applicable in terms of being smart with our money and we wanted to make sure that we were not leaving out our opportunity to educate the future generations\nAnd know that there are opportunities in higher education to be smart with your money to be smart about that investment in your future and the University of Wyoming is a way to do that and we're we're helping helping our students in our future generation in the state of Wyoming through the Ramsey education product\nWell it's one of those when when when things as far as I'm concerned because you're you know you're you're helping them by sponsoring this ... going in there we're we're blessed because you're doing it with us and we appreciate that\nI'm In the winter is is that you get to put the University of Wyoming cowboys right in front of every high school student and remind them that's where they ought to go to college\nThere's sometimes people do silly things like wander across the state line\nI've talked to a lot of Provo is around the country a mile and chancellor and vice chancellor of the ... Tennessee and it's a constant thing then ... the state is trying to woo their own residence to their own university and it's become a thing you gotta you gotta go after it don't you\nYes sir absolutely and we have a lot of great students here in the state of Wyoming and there are a lot of great students across the country who need to know that there are opportunities even out of state that you have to be\nSmart and you have to do your due diligence in that process of searching for higher education\nIn addition to being the lowest cost per resident tuition if a doctor or renting institution we are near the very lowest for non residents to come to Wyoming so we have a lot to offer not just here in the great state of Wyoming but from coast to coast north and south\nWe can be a solution that provide students an incredible opportunity for education\nAnd we're going to be very very good at making sure that we are helping\nA student be successful not just students access and part of that is not racking up a lot of debt at the end of their degree completion\nName in so many students on your campus\nWe have we had a little over or twelve thousand so twelve thousand a little over twelve thousand four hundred students here as a call themselves cowboys\nYeah that's a good size school that's not too big and small and so that's a that's just right as a Goldilocks deal just

Wayne going in my head I can't help but it's just the way it is but a bottom line is lesser mascot\nAnd so now it's ah that's very cool stuff I Love it and what a neat thing that the College of the University of the state is buying it for every single high school now if you're a business or university and you'd like to do something like that maybe you don't have to maybe don't have the money to buy the whole state or something every high school in the states\nSome states have more high schools and others can you imagine you know but uh um\nYou know maybe you just want to do it to the hospital used to go to um I went over spoke to them in the building where I used to go to high school the other day and snow middle school so I had all the forty really bright and shiny little eighth
