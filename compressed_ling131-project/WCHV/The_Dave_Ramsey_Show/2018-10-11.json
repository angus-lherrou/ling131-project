there where I put him on that situation on the PKK to to win a potentially when to draw he has to win the draw still close game at that point and he does like\nThat to me is for him really rounding out as a player and that's something that I've\nYou know I've talked to them and challenge them with and I said I'll usually in that situation if you can do that job for us and maybe add that to the coaching defense of coaching side of me but uh that's that excited me about that type of playing\nA vote in your you know a little humble about what is the only [noise]\nYeah he's a you know just [noise]\nIt's a great story you know what I mean a obviously a lot's been discussed about it you know just a different things you had to go through growing up and um you know it just has evolution and what we've been able to see here on this time as the capital and ours is game has grown and grown and um so many different ways so [noise]\nUm I mean he's a uh someone that I just enjoyed talking to you on a number of different things whether it's a\nDifferent trends he sees in the game you know different places that can work a is an extremely intelligent guy as well you can talk to him about just about anything and he's going to have an opinion on it and it's an educated opinion so use or someone that that uh I I was coaches we love working with 'cause he's trying to get better everyday\nReversal that something you guys were it was the answer was that she [noise]\nYes [noise] yeah I mean it was something that certainly when you're on the bench you can see the play develop and you're like whoa that's\nA that's pretty close you know it's I mean it's that's the benefit of having to skilled guys\nUm that we have in our I'm going on our video staff between now how she in in Leon hurt and\nThey ah you know they right away wired to us that it was a um they and their opinion it was a hundred percent challenge I was pretty certain watching with my own eyes but it's a nice to [noise]\nUm at least get confirmation from um a couple of trained professionals in that area so they're they're real good at what they do and we're fortunate to have monitor staff were real proud of our staff and and putting together um\nGuys that can help us a make a difference not that aren't even on the ice that that was a big big a turn of events worse yeah for sure yeah\nGuys or [noise]\nYes [noise] guys guys really last\nYeah so you know I think that uh both areas are are worthy of a new making a few points on because [noise]\nTalking about our power play and and I talked about it after a game one in the success we had is that we're we're looking to score goals different ways within our same structure everyone is very aware of mark layers are and and who they are that are out there for the last few years we've been obviously a top power play team but um you know continue to\nHave the uh um creativity to try different stuff to keep teams on their heels to um show different looks we have players moving to a different spots and that's something that's\nBeen an evolution the last uh probably year and a half to two years is something we've done and we had a lot of success with in the playoffs now the only kill that's something that you know we're continuing to work on and and causing pressure pressuring one we have the opportunities putting people in difficult spots\nAnd enforcing them and they play sooner than we want we we give up on a\nYou know really really good chance at the end like you said but uh you know Hopi makes himself as big as possible and get a little bit of a fortunate bouncer but um you know your your goals ... got to be your best probably kill or as as all was but I was a like a pressure and I liked her ability to to take away time and space from a fairly skilled in it\n[noise]\nYeah I mean are or were looking for a lot of different guys I'm using a lot of different players especially when you have a three and four situation I'm using guys shorter shifts of guys number of different players and um you know we have in a\nYou know settled on four guys like we did last year and I think that that really\nUm put you in a difficult spot if you ever go through injuries I think in in the beginning of the year um especially with the guys at a it's an open opportunity and I'm going to give them\nChances are to like I said to put ... in that spot at a um you know the end of the period there and um you know he's able to to win the drawn and be in that situation my Lars for sure is\nA guy that's going to be a big a component of us having success here moving forward with our our ... thanks [noise]\nElbows game thoughts from capitals head coach\nTodd Reardon and are plenty of compliments going the way up your first start tonight and if guinea ... there were a lot of compliments to be thrown around ... case if you prefer producer Mike aloe but a lot a lot of praise coming from\n... in there and for good reason after the five to win tonight over the Vegas Golden knights in regarding ... uh I like that perspective to that anecdote there from Todd Reardon\nA goal and three primary is this for a guinea cruising at solving and so much of what we're talking about with ... and that's often I think for good reason talking about his play with the puck and you'll hear from Nick Bactrim a little bit later on in the post game show he referenced earlier this hour in the gaps dressing room looks like he's dancing out there who's not stop when he has the puck but I liked the perspective\nThat Todd reared in reference strike dairy pointed to a specific situation capital shorthand data in the third period preserving one goal lead and ... and that's all goes out there for a defensive zone draw on his side and if there are number of areas the capitals are still looking for ... and that's off the sort of take that next step and is evolution\nThey're looking at improvement in the face off circle he was limited to forty four percent success\nThe fate soft dot they're looking for him to play better defensively but looking for him to take advantage of the ice time that's been given to him short handed something he has not done in his previous four years of his NHL career a whole lot he was out there\nIn shorthand situations making the most of it the penalty kill tonight very efficient once again for the capitals for for for ... whether it's with the ... whether it's away from the puck whether it's key defensive zone face off short handed Einstein penalty kill situations\nWhatever it is he continues to impress the small sample size three games in but he has been very very solid from the get go really picking up where you left off when you consider\nHe was the postseason scoring leader last year with thirty two points in twenty four games but\nCapitals that said ma call and said before the season started\nThey believe ... has another level\nAnd it involves some of those areas without the puck and we're seeing it we saw more examples of that tonight\nIn the five to win over Vegas\nGonna head inside the capitals dressing room right now before we take our final break of the evening we were going to hear from a caps forward Nick out a little bit of a unique perspective here caught up with him one on one after the caps waiting to doubt in his first season here in Washington but already impressed with with what he's out of guinea ... as well\nFirst off having played with of guinea ... for a few games right now he was something than I was in our opinion having seen them for years some of the best we've seen\nWhat impresses you what are some of the elements that really stick out in his game by I think it's just one of the best players in the game overall I mean his his composure with the ... and his ability to to move here traffic and make clear is under pressure like\nOut of this world diseases step above everyone else but\nYeah I I think it's just his ability to just move up the ice and you see these uh undercover fast and you can make plays I mean he does it all I'm just really really smart good with his uh spacing is really fun to watch\nI guess you you have haven't played with the city and brothers in Vancouver you've seen a lot of good distribution good chemistry him and Alex have been on the same paid for quite some time as well\nYeah I mean I don't know I can tell you how long they play together but I mean yeah Ovie obviously the critical score a cause he's probably been more of a pass or play maker and um you know I think it's some of the ocean back here are very very on the same page to in a condo I mean that's you can't look past the plays that he made [noise]\nYou know in the defense is on the news on that led to those schools where reasons you know are allowed to do what they do and I think people people who you know that's gotta be noticed\nThat's going on you mentioned that enforce the carpenter turned over there on on the final goal but one particular do did you notice maybe with bread that maybe the casual observer for example would\nJust say gee does a lot of little things allow those to to make plays and have the pocket possession hum you know I I think Uzi as good at turning Fox over but calling makes a lot of plays on the wall um and he he gets a lot of ... up that side so um I think he you know I think it was that the two on one gal hum what cousy and all where he\nHe made the chip off the wall passer demon in it and it kind of forgot cousy and all in and and uh you know people in their hockey understand that and um I think our teams use that to some\nSuccess on the penalty kill for all of you as a unit you're out there taking key face off as well but what is impressed with the face with a penalty kill that taught as reference and acknowledge trying to be aggressive and and apply pressure\nTwo Anaheim three you know on the season the coyotes the IRS the plus side for them tonight they scored twice first two goals of the year\nIn this third game of the campaign and they were shot out the first two games of the year Arizona still seeking that elusive first when of the season I and what other final from earlier
