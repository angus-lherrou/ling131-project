welcome to the day Ramsey show\nDay thank you so much for taking my call Charlotte was a lot of my [noise]\nMy my question is is my dad is Seventy five years old\nStill works He works in a steel plant\nMakes about four fifty to six fifty a week um about couple of years ago he got sick I found out that he hadn't paid he's behind on a lot of itself had a somehow ... that in a fifty thousand dollar loan from the bank\nAnd ah he doesn't have them attention he gets about Fifteen hundred and some of the security\nAnd I'm just wondering what what what can I Do at this stage for him um I Do provide him so I took over all the bills and I did provide him with about five hundred dollars a week on like a debit card that\nFor him to buy food and and what are you doing with the rest of that I'm Sorry what are you doing with the rest of the money\nOh I'm paying all and I'm paying all his bill he still has about a ... and K left on the equity loan ... his house and on a credit card mhm eight thousand on a car and eight thousand on the house\nAnd how much are you able to put on the debt [noise] I'm putting everything was a turning out the auto everything on on that that much money does that amount to what is it\nA month [noise]\nEverything on on that much money does that amount to what is it\nA month [noise] mhm\nI think it amounts to about a thousand a month\nAnd that's pretty good okay so he's got Fifteen and eight and two did I get that right\nIt it will have on the car eight and a half inch you on a credit card\nOkay All right and it you know if you divide that about four thousand a month\nI think you're done and the year okay and your first goal would be to get him debt free\nYou're done with a dead an ear right\nRankles get him to free 'cause he's Seventy five years old and he's still working in the steel plant to understand that right\nYeah ... there's going to come a moment and it will come suddenly that he just can't do that and I'm afraid I you know my prayer is at least that he gets through this year\nMhm and that way you that free and if he's a hundred percent debt free house and everything\nYou can probably make it on his Social Security if you had to write okay\nNot yeah not ideal not what we want but we can probably get there and uh then the next step is if we get past that that'd be wonderful let's get dead free then let's build an emergency fund a three to six months of expenses of are we get past that then let's start building some nest egg for retirement but the fastest way to build a nest egg for retirement\nIt's clear that dead and to have that emergency fund and blood and is still the baby steps in other words\nOkay that sounds good I'm asking is why a bank loan um someone at his age K animal\nYou know four and they can be paid off in twenty forty three now and that\nHe went to live that long\nWell two reasons one is they're stupid\nAnd the second reason is counting on my house I've got a lien against the house right\nNow that the care\nAnd so the house will be sold upon his death and they would get their money or they can foreclose on it upon his death and they'll get their money they've got the collateral as part of it on and so that's part of the equation the other part of the equation is\nYou know asking a bank or if you should borrow money is like asking a dog if it's hungry I mean they'll they'll loan anybody to breathe or not breathing money you know what I'm saying\nThe lending has gotten completely out of control and stupid so there's nothing you know just because someone offers you alone does not mean that you are capable of paying the loan it just means you might be breathing\nOn ... and so the industry is just stupid is what it amounts to but uh so we have to protect ourselves from them offering us things because sometimes people go oh they wouldn't have offered me this credit card if I couldn't afford it and it's like no they would have offered a dog that credit card\nSo I mean in dead people get credit card offers show is you know it doesn't mean anything doesn't even mean it doesn't mean you're not a dog and it doesn't mean you're alive\nIf you've got a credit card offer you could be a dead dog and get a credit card off it can happen so I mean you could be that low on the deal so that that's what you got to think through and just you've got to take care of him and you are you're doing a really good job congratulations Tim is with us in Dayton, Ohio I Tim how're you\nDoing I'm five days I got to require retirement okay\nI'm fifty two here about a year ... and I'm a ... inch and then I'll have a four one K. off of it but he good mhm I click here at sixty two would be better to file for Social Security in weight while before it goes on\nClick here at sixty two would be better to file for Social Security and weight while before we before we pay for the whole time and they\nYou can run the mouse out [noise] but usually your rate of return on your four O. one K. you on the mutual fund that money is growing at a faster rate than your Social Security check will grow if you delay it\nAnd that's the way you're comparing it to see if you wait from sixty three sixty five to start receiving it will you know what is the rate of return on that you know how much more do you get as a result and usually you get more in a mutual fund\nGenerally speaking um and then the other question comes of you know even if I don't need it should I take it\nUm and uh I I you know if you're willing to live on less than you make in in a sense invest some or all of it by not taking after four O. one K. or by some other things than than usually comes out better to take it earlier uh but but you know there's a lot of different\nParts to that equation and you know if you know when you're going to die sure makes it easier to do the equation oh that would definitely help\n[laughter] yeah so you got to kind of gas and you've got to say you know average death age of a male and the U.S is Seventy six averaged ... deaf I drove a female in the U.S is Seventy eight\nBut once you've lived to be sixty it's higher than that because that and those numbers include infant mortality include teenage death that kind of a thing and so you know if you're healthy sixty year old you got a real shot at Ninety\nAccording to the stat tables right now and so um that that's what you've got to walk through and think through in the process so good question man thank you for joining U.S Open phones a AAA eight to five five two to five Todd is in New Hampshire I taught how are you\nI'm doing pretty good how are you better than I deserve how can I help\nWell um I I when I spoke to the lady she said I could ask you a question and I just got the starter pack off of your website for myself for my for my daughter who's thirty one I'm fifty two and\nUm I've been a dreamer I guess for a free spirit as you would say from listening to your show addict now for the last two weeks [laughter]\nI Know who you were before that it's All right but um my wife and I sat down and we've never been able to agree on money um she used to shave or um the spender and just I don't you

more than that but [noise] she I'm she's always ran the show and I've been kind of just kind of go along with her at this point um\nWe paid off to credit cards and we paid off on the credit card my question is is\nBy doing so many things right now I'm In the one thing I'm there's concern me it's about down the road is my retirement and I've worked for a company for Fifteen Years and I've

gonna we're in agreement that we're going to work this plan together okay and once you do that then you're first gold you squeeze out of your budget as you say with thousand dollars if you've already got money saved than we would save only a thousand dollars of it stop all investing\nTemporarily temporarily and then you move on to baby step two which is your debt snowball and that's where you pay
