{"month": "10", "state": "VA", "station": "WCHV", "content": "The dressing room well here from head coach Todd Reardon highlights of this one as well ... standing by and the PG paints arena we'll get to all that in just a moment first off though as we approach the top of the hour we'll past ten seconds station identification on the capitals radio network\nThe Washington Capitals in central Virginia on she they'll one Seventy five and twelve sixteen WC ha am NFL Charlottesville\n[noise]\n\n[noise] ... it was Chris what's hang the game winning goal for ... minutes twenty ends overtime power play marker within guinea ... in the box serving assuming a minor for hooking as the Pittsburgh Penguins but he survived the\nCapitals late rally capitals coming back from down six for late in the third period peril eight goals from T. J. O. she pulling the capitals even so the caps get one point in the standings with the ... law they dropped two one oh when one on the season Pittsburgh Penguins meanwhile\nAre in the two points in their season opener is welcome you back inside the DC Studios been re be back with you for camps post game and salmon standing by for a few minutes outside the capital stress syndrome\nAnd Ken on the one hand we get to the third period capitals playing their second game in as many nights early on in the third period penguins were dictating play that a number of power play opportunities and seen very much\nCapitals didn't have anything left in the tank and then lo and behold two goals and Twenty one seconds from D. J. O. G. on the plus side they are able to leave Pittsburgh but at least one point with the overtime defeat yeah you know you look\nAt it too it it all starts it all starts I I Believe with the ... the turnover and gives OSHA a great opportunity you know it goes in there and just one little life and then it gets another one so\nUh it was really good uh you know a good come back like that but there's still a little short over time with the power point but uh uh well you know will earn points in the third period with nothing again tank I mean you could see the guys are getting a little tired\nAnd they found a way to Jay oh she lifted them all up and uh\nThey come away with something you know it's a little bit of a weird game Ben as you know and we saw a little bit of everything but uh there's a point to point\nWe did feel a little bit of everything on the plus side you know feels like a while ago now but early on in this game first second periods when the capitals still have their legs under them\nAnd they were close to full strength if you will we saw them utilizing that speed you know you and John referenced at one point and felt like the penguins couldn't keep up and I said to my fellow here in Studio I spent many years ago you would never say that just for these two teams are concerned\nThat the penguins were having a tough time keeping up with the camps but early on a perhaps some signs of that a high octane all fenced the speed from the capital's side\nOr agree with you I mean there are there are ... I'm a pretty well in the first forty minutes and they just couldn't get that extra one that cushion and make it to go again which makes the dynamic a little different but uh no you know and then it gives you that they ran are steaming Pittsburgh's hit their stride you know after that they hit their stride going into it and they played a little\nA lot faster I guess in the third period but a a capital Brasilia you know and if that's a sign that combat I like it I mean it's early on his tough the played back to back early this early or not you know your body's not ready for it uh you know after all the emotion last night you come in here you travel to get in white the whole thing but uh I like uh\nAnd I like as if they're going to play like this whole time this can be fun hockey to watch out here\nIn the jail she among the highlights and this one is two goals and the third period of course but thinking back even last night in the season opener sets the tone gets the boys going on the first shift\nBut the first school the season and tonight I thought as well ah can going back to the first period in a secondary a system the first school the game for on his goal but he won a one on one battle neutral zone TJ oh she at least to start the regular season a small sample size\nAlong with Nick Bactrim on that second line to an extent picking up where they left off from last spring\nI agree I mean yeah I Know it's it's good to see teachers didn't have a great regular season last year but it seems like he's off to a good start here and yet some jumped to you look at it you know we're talking about a third of the guys right honesty you know I mean he has he was one guy that had some job\nHe was getting in there for checking in that that's what he brings you know you just when you think the plays that he never gives up and he finds a way to\nGrind it out somehow get that talked to somebody or get a shot on that whatever it takes that's the type of player is what he was on his back on the side you know he doesn't give up on any pox and uh he's a great leader like that and uh you can see you know he's poised for a good season if he can can continue to do this\nAnd that being said as the game went along and again particularly in the third period Pittsburgh was aided by the fact that the capitals that a little bit of a parade to the penalty box early in the third period ...\nAmong those taking minor penalties and the first few minutes of the third period but\nDid you find maybe as the game went along defensively on your opinion out of the capital's do as far as trying to contain obviously Pittsburgh comes in waves and the strong for jak very high octane all events themselves or how were the capitals able to handle that because hope he was getting peppered with all kinds of rubber particularly as the game went along\nWife Vicky has the game what a law that was the key I think the capitals you know the the the uh Pittsburgh got a little more confidence got a little more steam got a little more ah a continuity and their team play on ... and then the capitals just you know they're\nA little law there and the third period you know third period or for most of the third period I'd say uh and then uh you know like you said when you take too many families I don't care if you're a fresh or not you're given a team but this much power you know offensive power that many opportunities are going to make you pay for it\nUh so not only maybe they're not in the square every time but then you're keeping your best players on the bench except for ... and that's off it gets a chance of Africans riding the fine you know what I mean so\nIt it takes a little bit of a rhythm so it's a it's a tough thing but\nUm I I still I mean I think you know they're disappointed and get the two points but you've got to be pretty happy to get through you know three or four in the first weekend of again of the season and are not ideal situation either\nMy top power play unit in the league last year the Pittsburgh Penguins to for six denied capitals come up in the old for two on the mandate vantage will leave you with this can they now have five days until they see the Vegas Golden knights are coming up next week or even six days until next Wednesday when they get Vegas\nA couple of days off but a few days back a practice areas still looking to improve season as young as we start to look ahead towards another set of back to back next week an area or two you're looking for the capitals to spill cleanup\nHere well you look at a a you know what I mean I thought there there's either way they're playing this game they're very you know there are there hunting on the Fox they're all over I like that uh I obviously ... conditioning is going to get better as a ... and moves on and if you want to play this style a game back to back games after a while back about you know eleven more\nUh you have to be in pretty good shape to do that he's got to run all four lines and it'd be able to do that you have to stay out of a box you know you have to contributions from all four lines so\nUm I think they're conditioning is the main thing game conditioning in the back to back situation will she go to New Jersey you know it'll be better yeah they have a few days off to work on some stuff here I mean but for most part I like the game I like to waste\nI liked him I liked it when it's going to shore up a little bit of defensive coverage here but this kind of game you just throw it out and anytime you two teams get together you never know what's gonna happen so it's not like you're ... and all the way that you can see it All right\nSo we'll see speed the name of the game and two more examples coming up next week Vegas at home and his Stanley Cup rematch on Wednesday and Thursday night\nAs you noted in New Jersey with a quick turnaround will speak to a Wednesday night can appreciate it or feel right there is ... on the post game
