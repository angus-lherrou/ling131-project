I might have\nThat much money now not totally again we've been here about three months already okay I'm just trying to see what our next step that we have about\nI'm a thousand dollars in credit card debt and then we have about fourteen thousand in saving and we have like they're really holding it but we're just not sure what else we can do with that I mean it could come and get rid of them and they're I'm not really sure what to do\nWell you can we can do some math and determine if you want to just ride them out or if you want to sell the car\nNow if you want to sell the car here's what you would do and you need to get the information gathered up you need to call the fleece company and ask what the early buyout is meaning if I wrote you a check did day to get my title what would it be\nThat should be less than the total love your remaining lease payments plus the residual value the buyout at the end okay and\nOh what would it be that should be less than the total of your remaining lease payments plus the residual value the buyout at the end okay and so you get that number that's like the early pay off without the interest on a car payment okay\nIt's the same thing the early buyout number that's what you're looking for and then you compare that to the value of the car have you done that on any of these cars\nYes we have on both of our vehicle\nOh wow okay so we've got the actual numbers always talk about vehicle number one then what's the early buyout\nThat early buyout is the least of the\nDollar okay and and what the value on that car the value of that car I Believe he looked at it and it's like twenty five and ... and that just Kelley Blue book private sale yeah yeah Manhattan and get that at thirty two that's how much they found ... about I'm Sorry thirty two or twenty I made\nA mistake it that that really badly thirty three ... and kept the Kelley Blue book number is thirty oh great\nOkay so you can only lose a thousand dollars by selling that car you'd only write a check for a thousand dollars it'd be sold it for thirty two but you had to give the least company thirty three to get the title you're thousand in the whole right right right now your lease payment is how much\nMy [laughter] at least ... minutes five hundred and forty two dollars a month\nAnd how many how many payments remaining we have about Eighteen marketing man okay All right I'm just putting that in here that's nine thousand five hundred Seventy six dollars mhm mhm so if you sell it today you lose a thousand if you keep it you lose ten thousand\nYeah no brainer salad okay okay you see how the analysis now let's look at the second one then right what's the value of the second one\nSo the value of the second vehicle is twenty five\nOkay in the early buyout on it\nThat early buyout on it I'm ... apologies the early five twenty five okay I haven't done the Kelley Blue book them out but I'm sure it's ... I think actually I live in town then for that one where really in the hall\nOkay and what is the lease payment on it\nBut at least payment is two hundred and thirty dollars I don't know if you are right and how many of those remaining fourteen why payment okay\nSo that um let's see here to thirty or forty and I'm thirty two hundred dollars if you keep the car till the end of the leash and hand them the case right yet must tell us to thirty times fourteen okay and that one is somewhere around fourteen thousand and the whole today\nOkay so you get to drive this car for free until the end of this lease on that one you keep it 'cause I'd rather lose thirty two hundred and fourteen thousand and I drive the car\nOkay you see what I'm doing yes comparing a total of your payments\nAgainst the amount you're in the whole\nSo that one that one I Would probably keep it for your husband's numbers are correct on their value I suspect there and\nI suspect you're going to keep it anyway because I don't think he's going to be that far off I mean we got a fourteen thousand dollar deficit right now if he if he's eleven value is right but even if he's half wrong it's still a seven thousand dollar deficit versus three thousand to keep it\nSo that one we keep\nOkay and you pay it out now is it overall miles\nNow that one way I'm dry mile\nOkay and the wear and tear you're going to keep it up so you're not going to have to write a check when you turn it in fourteen months from now\nNow they're both him that well that one's in great condition\nOkay good good yeah that one\nSo you're not going to have to write a check when you turn it in fourteen months from now\nNow they're both saying that well that one great condition\nOkay good good yeah that one or you see how did that analysis\nYeah yeah that really clear that out track we were really struggling with what you\nMean I don't know that one and you know what I Would do is move on past\nA baby step to once you've gotten rid of the the big car the more expensive one and once you've gotten rid of all your other debts except this but if you still have this one with the two thirty payments were just renting a car all the way through the end here and you might as well keep the car you get no advantage to turning it in our early\nRight right you're going to write the three thousand\nTwo hundred and twenty dollars worth of two hundred and thirty dollar payments no matter what you do so you might as well drive the dad gummed car you know and um if you want to put thirty two hundred dollars aside extra in your emergency fund just to make sure you got that plus your emergency for uncovered the call yourself in baby steps two and three then that's fine\nBut that's how you do the analysis on whether to keep a leash or not and um\nMost of the time unless you're close to ... unless you're close to the end of the lease you're going to be selling the car and that's what happened with the more expensive one there it's killing you know that one was a beach to bite you\nShow good question thank you for joining us ... ... if you've never heard the saying it's kind of a country saying you're getting ...\nWhich means it it's it's like a a a sheep getting its for removed that's where it comes from your getting ripped off as well at least means that's why I call them car fleet says because if we take the value of the original\nMarket value of that car that thirty three thousand dollar car on the expensive one there for those folks and I put that five forty two into a calculator and then I put the end of value into a financial calculator with residual value at the end in other words the residual values what you can buy the car for at the end of the lease\nYour your games up number at the end of the leash you put those numbers you know the calculator you come back out what the effect of interest rate is\nIn motion of the time it's around fourteen percent\nThey call it costs to Capitol\nAnd they don't have to disclose the interest rate da PR to you you know if you get a car loan you get this there's truth in lending sheet that the Federal Trade commission make she makes them show you the a PR the annual percentage wretched you're being charged but when you're leasing it's technically not debt\nAnd so you 'cause you're renting the car and so they are not required federally to disclose the cost of capital or the interest rate but you can figure it out with a calculator that'll make you view [noise]\nI mean it's ridiculous that's why we call it ... it's the most expensive way to operate a car the car lease\nIs a disaster [noise]\nIt's a disaster as a financial issue [laughter]\nYou could just do the math you can understand what I'm saying\nThis is that Iran should show [noise]\nA common theme around here is teaching people how to make smart choices whether it's with your money or with your business you have to be intentional with every decision you make\nA man and having such and having kids that are so young too to know that we can do whatever we want and we're not we're not tied down on you know\nWe don't care I mean you're making two forty here you've got no pay went to the world you're Thirty years\nMark ...\nGr state yeah and I don't\nKnow we had some hard times we did not happening was not easy you know wasn't it wasn't a just a cake walk the whole time but but we uh we worked hard and I think it brought us together for sure we um we always had a goal that was\nThat was right in front of us and that that was one thing we didn't fight about I mean like any other company we fight about stuff for sure but that one we were I Know that would be one of the most important ones we were not the wrong thing but I\nIt yeah that's one of my biggest thing even with telling people I mean when we're hosting are leading a few classes biggest thing is I get on the same page and he has we never fight about money mhm\nHosting a leading a few classes biggest thing is I get on the same page and he has we never fight about money mhm also really cool\nSo do they listen when you tell me\nSome of them I think we definitely had some resistance\nDefinitely you know it's um all the stuff you talk about why would you if you can get zero percent interest why would you not do it it's free money ... no you don't get it [laughter] there's a differential\nWhat is the key to getting out of that you've done at your coaches your blood classes you've done everything\nI think the key is vision I think you have to see where you're going I think uh if I have any criticism of myself and said I'm probably too long term oriented and I think that has been I Believe your strengths actually argue weaknesses run focus on so long term sometimes I forget the little short term when she helps me that\nHe's very very determined and on I was the one that that like at first started talking on the journey and I was so excited about that look like I got to read it and then there are
