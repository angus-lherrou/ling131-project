your final the devils the far better team tonight they were rubbed up it was their home opener was only the second game of the year and they had been off since last weekend but they weren't impressive in their home opener a sellout crowd\nAt the credentials center as for the capitals\nAnd very sluggish in this one and they were playing their second game in as many nights that being said\nPart of the itinerary of twelve sets the back to back over the course of the year and you got to come up with some wins better efforts we'll see if they can handle it\nMoving forward here capitals dropped to

we'll have out of town scores first off though the highlights of tonight's game and uh I used that term loosely from the capitals perspective there were not many highlights that being said\nThere was Phoenix Copley making his regular season debut tonight and early on with the game still scoreless\nGame still scoreless Copley tested early and often\n[laughter]\nOr soccer gets around fast growing up and down\nAt the center Scott weight workout twice at all here and as far as watching star oh\nLook really good there didn't dig just wait and made a nice little Walker Scott how do you want to

off\nI Want to go\n\nAnd I go online\n\nAnd goal males scramble wasn't pretty but Kyle ... able to push it passed me next Copley ... with the assist in just over seven minutes into the first period\nNew Jersey had a one nothing lead and the devils midway through the first theory they weren't out shooting the capitals into one should give you a pretty good indication of helping started and really things how when or how things went for overall on the night\nFrom a capitals perspective the devils meanwhile they would double their lead late in the first period just over two minutes remaining junk Carlson was called two minutes for cooking and the devils would convert on the ensuing power play [noise]\nArea right circle\nThat Kyle Bell marry again his second goal of the night his fourth of the season good but movement from the devils on their power play will butcher and Taylor Hall\nWith the U.S is and it was to nothing for the devils at that Point New Jersey would finish the game one for for on the power play capitals meanwhile\nOh for for with demanded band there's some New Jersey up to heading into the second period was ugly first for the capitals and we're wondering how they would respond to start the second period on just forty seven seconds in Jacob ... who actually had a pretty good game overall but forty seven seconds into the secondary Jacob Bronner\nCalled two minutes for tripping so the devils went through an early power play they would not convert but seconds after the capitals killed off the minor\nMarkets Johansson the former capital would give New Jersey a three nothing lead his first school of the season the shot from the high swat a lot of traffic in front of Phoenix Copley but Johansson able to convert in its first of the season is first since last\nDecember he dealt with the injury bug quite a bit last year but three nothing new Jersey at that point and it would stay that way into the third period and just under six minutes into the third the devils would widen their lead\nOn I'm sure some of\n\nProbably want factor golfer or nothing\nAnd that coal miner and his first of the season bend loved joy the primary a system that won five forty nine into the third period it was for nothing for New Jersey\nIt was for nothing for New Jersey and from then on that just quite a few defensive breakdowns from the capital they really had them all night but even picked up even more so\nIn the third period and the devils were able to take advantage for a couple of late tallies John Sebastian day and Brian boy with wraparound playboy all swiping the puck from the D. J. O. she below the goal line in the final minutes of regulation added up but six nothing\nThe devils take it quite a few insurance markers there in the third period and got away from the capitals but again the Knicks Copley was impressive and this one despite all the goals he allowed he did make thirty saved and really a number of high quality scoring chances from the devil's in this one the theme from the capitals perspective just too many\nDefense of breakdowns in this one odd man Russia's galore and as far as the New Jersey devils were concerns devils take six nothing we will take a timeout when we come back we'll head inside the capitals dressing room we will hear from\nLars L. or among others head coach Todd Reardon as well as ... game continues in a moment on the capitals radio network powered by WGLA\nAs the most experienced provider in us green broke ... health centers is dedicated exclusively to treating depression with T.
