I was impressed a particular with with Madison's game um uh you know he\nDidn't hadn't played meaningful hockey for quite some time so I was his first a real game and in quite a while and I taught a\nA real good job with Brooks and I and I thought a um that was a there are solid and and Christian has earned the opportunity to get more ice time and was able to take advantage of it today so I I really liked her ability to break pox out and then that's a\nI got all say it's a ... job so hard to get them to our goalie they they're part of our breakout protocol and and uh taught our board play was really good and our support underneath a really allowed us to to put Boston on their heels right from the start\n[noise] [noise]\nYeah it was it was definitely was a concern um so something that I addressed um more than one occasion and was a\nQuite Vermont actually before the game where the guys up before the start of the game and I just uh was a key point for me and I challenge the group and and I was really proud of our leaders to to be able to come out of a situation where there are so much emotional um you know or\nYou know covering the gamut of emotions from guys a worm maybe trying and guys were ecstatic happy ... to go play against the a team that so I had a lot of success in the late last couple of years with Boston so [noise]\nUm I did I challenge the leadership group about uh how they were going to respond and how they were going to set the tone for our team tonight and I said somebody is going to do it who's going to be in here and not surprised to see our leadership group step up\nI'll like they did in a throughout the the first five minutes of the game that was um they ... they sent a strong message out really proud of them\nWould you like [noise]\nThere was um you know I was aware of parts of it but the video we had not seen any of the video so the videos all new for us I had not seen it and um you know even when you're watching it there there's a lot of stuff going on I I miss most to you know parts of the video or whatever just a\nUm you know getting myself prepared for the game as well and and just to kind of taken in the whole atmosphere\nOr because there was a lot of moving parts it was a so that was the first time that the guys had seen it as well so\nIt's a something that they're looking for a copy is uncertain land or um amazing amazing night and like I said not the the players I I was fortunate enough to go through with him last year and and um go through some some difficult times the prior years lost not being able to raise that cup over our heads and\nIt's just an amazing thing to be a part of weather organization and the fans support and everyone that's been loyal\nFall through this would this organization for the last forty four years so it's a a a special special night\nIs is on how quick it seemed like the passing of course was very wrists and\nYet a you know we've got a a [noise] extremely talented group um so you didn't see a lot of ah different personnel out there from us a tonight but tell you did see\nBut tell you did see some different walks from us and I think that's something that we're able to\nUh add to our game as the playoffs for last year you know whether it's a\nDodge different players exchanging positions in different face off players from different looks against certain alignment some see saw little sneak peek at some things that are um you know we've talked about adding to our power play group to Sharon and I'm making them a little bit more unpredictable at times because uh everyone's seen that alignment and\nNow are given at some different looks and it certainly has been a\nA was was a huge part of our success tonight\n[noise]\nYeah that was a you know I'm just pointing um you know and and something that uh\nYou know I I think you know maybe it will be looked at it again it's a you know in instigator ice situation I think our role as a looked out by the league um in situations where you know um I I'd have to review it a little bit more to comment on an additionally but um [noise] you know that's a\nSomething that is unfortunate and I I feel a unjust and certainly a I'm a player that wasn't prepared for it in in large so I think there was a an early start to that fight as well um so um you know but that's a a whole let other people take care of that [noise]\n\nYeah he's he's yeah I mean he's got to get looked at I haven't talked to our trainers yet but I mean um [noise] it was a [noise] I I felt like a like I said it was a an early start by their player and on and um you know that's why the instigator but um and that's that's stuff that the officials take care of so\n[noise] [noise] yes\nIt was I remember he used to be back for more than she committed the game\nFor certain it's uh uh we talk about our tracking um being a work in Decatur for team it's something that does a standard that's a that our group is held to they're held accountable to\n'em there in the same breath or praised for when they do it and there was certainly a a really good reaction on our bench when that exactly that you referenced occurred\nUm we've got a a unique group that uh cares a lot about the guy that is right next to him\nAnd little place like that uh they don't go unnoticed and certainly uh I think I'm One of my strengths as a coach is is understanding those little players that then end up making a big difference and\nUm that was a definitely key to our game tonight to limit or a really skilled often some group\n[noise]\nI liked him um you know you see a you know neck in and to volunteer to be able to you know ... and do do a great job with that um but they'll see the energy that Walker has and\nYou know I think um you know we need to have four lines that can scorn and can add and that's something that you know when I spoke to ... when he was a signed a the day he resigned and I talk to them about coming in here and and I said I I think there's more often steer game\nAnd I've had to remind them of that during camp or also and he was here and I said I appreciate that your position we found and um I respect how you play and and you're only killing ability but we'd like to get you to\nTo add some are often ... to our team because our for lying attack last year was obviously a huge difference and why we're able to win the Stanley Cup so I was happy to see\nHappy to see 'em in ... hadn't that respect tonight [noise]\n... [noise] yeah I was still got to talk about that I'm white and um you know a talk it over with our goalie coach Scott Murray and you know just to see how he how he handled the night I'm obviously he was extremely solid and\nUm when he was tested he was he was excellent tonight but before I make a decision on that we've got to go through\nJust to cause some normal protocols of how we want to make that decision that gives us the best chance have success in Pittsburgh\nI gave you thank you [noise]\nAll right good stuff there a whole lot Tom package from head coach Todd Reardon\nFollowing tonight's seven nothing when over the Boston Bruins will follow up on some of his comments on Nick down and the capitals fourth line tonight as well as the goal tending situation moving forward will we see Britain Hopi end goal once again tomorrow night picked up the shutout in this one against the Boston Bruins", "show_name": "The Dave Ramsey Show", "year": "2018", "city": "Charlottesville", "day": "04"}
