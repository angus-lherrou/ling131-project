for the team on\nThis end up ... road just looked up at Billy Scott and ask him what he was going to do kind of shrugged his shoulders the crew was up on the wall Billy Scott course calls the shots for Kurt Busch they made their call as did their teammates on this and that would be ah the machine of Eric I'm a roller and Kevin Harvey how by Clint born in front of you Alex\n... Boyer seem they need a win win this team\nOutside looking in as far as the playoff picture go so when's huge but his team it's the same scenario they've been on the same strategy as there are other three Stewart horse racing board teammates\nSo right now there are a little concerned Mike ... he's been standing up on the pit box he just sat down sits up on the right front corner of the box up there as we were just before the ... he stood up grab hold of the top of the ... with his right hand and began to kind of shake just a bit\nThe nerves are high down here so plenty of motivation yeah they've been disciplined those for Stewart Haass cars to essentially right in line all day long\nBut there's plenty of motivation to get out there and when this race for your needs it boy one said this Tim team needs is so\nI fully expect him to do something pretty good drastic on this restart\nBut nobody's going to hand it to him you better believe that seem Vince he's back there they want it as well they're going to try to make something happen you've got the Toyotas a little bit further back\nThey would like to be players in this thing I entered cars that are still alive would like to get up there and have a shot you know this is not going to be a cakewalk they weren't on a cake walk it was a matter of which one will win which one of the stewardess forge now is like can we hang on to this and I got to drop\nThis and just because I find it so interesting rusty Wallace back a hundred and eighty nine laps ago when we took the green flag was hurt Bush and Clinton Boyer side by side and rode one\nKevin Bacon Eric killing the role of side by side and wrote to now nothing changes in fuel stays there when we go back into the green flag it will be Kurt Busch lawyer side by side and wrote one Kevin ... era killing the role of side by side and wrote to nothing has changed they have just been that\nDominant all day long and the run that fast all day long two hundred miles per hour with all the action going on\nHere to tell a leg up for this that top ... still be the top or it's unreal but you know what you know as well as I Do the everything changes with three or four laps to go in my opinion between ... Bush in ... in the Clinton Boyer\nIt's whoever gets the gear box they're gonna have to really be ready get through that year boxing get their self in a position to get to the bottom of this race track so these guys can hook up if they stay side by side race it through the corner I think that's going to let the rest of the guys catch up to them\nAnd that's what all you know what's going to break loose\nJoe I think a unofficially we've had what eight starts either start or restart they play nice up front or if you remember whoever was on the bottom allow the teammate who was starting top scientist to kind of slide down across the nose\nThen they would spread out and whoever was running second on the outside slid in top or there they go running away I don't think they're going to do that this time\nUm delegates and all his guys a horse power showed man I mean he looked in the mirror and there was nothing but a train a force behind it was pretty cool to see you know men on the other side of that watch other manufacturers have their time and it's nice to to see the Ford family have their time right now\nAnd I'm ... you know a kid's been doing a great job I'm good Family Guy proud of him he's he's been so close so many times the last couple of times it was my doing it he didn't get it so to finish second to him I'll take that really really happy for him and his family entertain\nClip lawyer solid effort today a runner up finished depot study\nHim on a fourth place Ron done any survival first off a delegate but those are cars performance and how did you stock up over the course of the day today\nYou know we're just kind of an ex best in line uh definitely the forwards would seem to have a little bit more speed than us but uh you know we say discipline we've said they didn't line there and make sure we chose right line when the right lines were coming um got a great ... finish out of it the kind of\nAlmost ...\nAlmost ... manages a smile that's Denny

those for cars able to stay up there even though you might have been second third or fourth one is that discipline like how how do you how do you establish that discipline for yourself\nWell moving around or just allows everybody to you know to ... allows the whole in there to to be a bigger and just invites everybody did that come up there and when your cars or that fast and you have\nNo

courting when did you know that he may be out a few\nWell I got a huge around when the Seventeen was coming to me\nAnd I I thought I was going to be able to make a run and get the Kurds outside and I did and as soon as I got to his outside I heard his engines butter and I heard him or her to run out of fuel on that point it was like oh God\nJust lots of Seventeen and Twenty one I'm don't give it away again and a man we're finally finally able to do it so just so thankful for this race team everybody at their house race in\nA field forward performance just everybody we did it work moving onto

last week and there was an old saying on ABC wide world of sports from the thrill of victory to the agony of defeat you did it in reverse the agony of defeat last weekend the thrill of victory today one of the emotions today after a hundred and forty nine times\nAh such just a a roller coaster of emotions man um I I kept feeling like I was letting Tony Stewart down and Jane Hodgson drugs if a deli and everybody\nIn this organization I you know so many times they're giving me cars capable winning and I wasn't I wasn't doing it we weren't winning and\nAnd Jane Hodgson Greg zip a deli and everybody\nIn this organization I you know so many times they're giving me cars capable winning and I wasn't I wasn't doing it we weren't winning and uh and finally\nWe did we did it it's a it's so gratifying I'm such a such a weight lifted off my shoulders and and now I've got so much fire I'm ready to go around debate let's go\nBut the restart seemed amazing it didn't matter whether you're on the outside of the inside you guys had an incredible amount of patience take us through that discussion with your crew chief you're spot or the decision making and how you were able to do that and then translate it to pulling away we don't see that very much\nNo it was just a fast\nRace cars first you gotta have fast race cars and we qualified up from all four of us right in a row um and we we orchestrated a plane we talked about a play on this morning a Kevin Clint courting I and we stuck to the plan there were times I didn't want to stick to the plan there are times I was like All right I Need a score stage points this time\nA ticket to go and uh we just kept sticking to playing Johnny and everybody just kept telling me just be patient stick to the planet will pay off for us\nAnd we did man we just kept sticking to the plan and nobody could touch are forced to her house cars together once a week where they could battle asked for a few laps on a restart and we would say so
