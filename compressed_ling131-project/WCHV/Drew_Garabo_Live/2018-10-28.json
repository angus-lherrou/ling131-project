Wallace\nGuys there's a whole long list of things you gotta do and things you can't do to win here at Martin's will speed white and of course every race track has its individual challenges but uh I I think you'd go on a limb here and say that uh you'd be pretty safe in saying that there's a longer list here than anyplace else you've got a just the layout of the race track\nOr trying to keep your cool uh the the curbing at the end of each a of a long straightaway is around those corners which are concrete with straight in ways that are asphalt and up and rusty Wallace you on your seven times you certainly should know I Would think tires will be a big concern here too will\nTires are really big there is no doubt no doubt about that you've got to have a good car to build a witness race but\nYou know in these long runs you get your marginal every now and then do you really start working that right front corner really really hard and nowadays the sport or on the back of these cars is much shorter so going into the corners you don't have as much to slow you down so you're really be a line a lot on the brakes\nSo my number one thing today is watch the right fund for deep until ... don't abuse it because if you do\nYou could blow that right front tire out overheated and I'll tell you what that in your day for sure\nNumber one watched that right front to our number two\nPit road is very very tight down there especially in the corners when you leave and I see all the time guys trying to pin and as they pulled out they tear the right front quarter off because they hit a car that's coming by or vice versa company and so you got to be real careful pitted in his foreigners and the other thing is have ever had a short track\nTempers flare here so don't lose your temper on the track\nOr make those dumb mistakes like speed it on the road are leaving the ... and stuff like that that whole ... road they can get you in trouble\nAnd you gotta remember one thing out of all these eight guys or go for the championship all these issues that come back that I mentioned you've got to be really really careful because if you mess up and you're one of those eight you might miss that championship it won't be part of the final four building homes desert today is a real key race\nA lot of areas to make mistakes out here we want to minimize those today\nHow about this rusty
