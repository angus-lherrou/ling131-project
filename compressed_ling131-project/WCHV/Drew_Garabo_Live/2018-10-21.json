think that uh whatever keys work on that bottle half would work on this model and a half but really when it comes to setting up a race car there's a lot of differences and all of these models have race tracks\nAnd another factor today that we're going to deal with rusty Wallace is the temperature it's cold right now it's not going to get much warmer how has that go into effect to try to win a race\nJoe you're exactly right in the track here today let's talk about ... day and not the past today it's fifty three degrees right now everybody down there is wearing coats and the reason I say

we see all the time this was the big one Jeff no mistakes\nLot on the line that is for sure and if you don't think mistakes happen go back two weeks ago and ask Kevin Hart who dominated a a race at

point their self in but the main thing everybody's thinking but I got to win this race a lot of pressure to get that done\nYou talked about some of the drivers sent Brad Keselowski outside looking in trying to make that round of a lot of guys that are in are barely in and they're hoping to not make any mistakes\nBut as a driver going into this race all I'm thinking about right now is the performance of my car I'm just thinking what do I gotta do to make it handled good throughout the day I got to have lawless pit stops I Can't make mistakes those are things that are on my mind actually I'm over it a little bit as a driver but I'm a little bit nervous too at this\nPoint I was taught in the rye and blame me this morning and of course he's the one of those who need something really good to happen because he's below the ... and and I try to pose a question to him about you know how much you're thinking about it and his answer was thanks for reminding me again because everybody's talking about it and I guess for a driver\n... ... ... there's a danger of what you said over thinking it putting too much thought into it and that's a good\nPoint because I remember way back when I was going from a championship everybody was telling me how to do it what I had to do how I had to drive the car different hot I had to go into this race with a different mindset and I'm like guy just let me do what I did do and just let me do what I did all your\nI had to drive the car different hot I had to go into this race with a different mindset and I'm like guy just let me do
