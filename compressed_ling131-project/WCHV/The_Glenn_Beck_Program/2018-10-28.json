humane society the United states and he had come\nTo see how the sausages me do you remember when we go into swallowing ... one of those seven five and ...\nWe're talking to a Ben Sasse and I have so many places I Would like to\nGo with you I'm In and talked to senator about we're going to run out of time uh I Would like to invite you to do a um an hour and a half uninterrupted podcast with me sender when you have time um because I think your voice needs to be heard and understood\nAnd parts of it challenged I'm sure but uh I I Would like to just pick up on this point\nSo the number one driver of happiness is vocation your one guy that will understand that if that's true in the next ten years we're in deep trouble\n[noise] we're headed toward a really interesting time in human history it's still scary and fascinating so somebody some people shorthand for this of the ... the economy I think the simpler way to think about it is just the average duration of people's jobs or their relationship at a farm is going to get shorter than ever before in human history\nSo let's go macro for a minute hunter gatherers throughout most of human history you don't have any conception of what your job is you pursue that buffalo right and then ten thousand years ago people settled down and started\nPlanting and harvesting and we we enter farm on a on a regular cycle and from ten thousand years ago to a hundred and fifty years ago nobody had job choice they just did with grandma and grandpa mom and dad and aunts and uncles had ever had done forever eternity past with the industrial revolution we get jobs specialization and it was really disruptive but when people took a job\nThey still kept it till death of retirement to not everybody graduated high school at the beginning of the industrial revolution by the end almost everybody does\nBut you still get one job but sometime between Fifteen and twenty two years old and you keep it for all of your life I was born in the Nineteen seventies average duration at a farm for a primary breadwinner then it was still twenty six years now it's four years and getting shorter and it's got to get shorter forever more McKenzie a farm I used to work with believes that fifty\nPercent of the American labor market\nBy three years from now this is not Twenty years in the future it's three years from now they take fifty percent of the labor market will be primarily freelancers meeting that most people will cobble together a bunch of different jobs not all of them are going to be ap enabled tech jobs like being a new driver with the right soft\nThe answers meaning that most people will cobble together a bunch of different jobs not all of them are going to be ap enabled tech jobs like being a new driver with the right software that makes you more efficient than an old school Gabby but what's really going to happen is we're going to head toward a world where people are going to get\nDisrupted out of their jobs at age forty and forty five and fifty and fifty five forever more we've never ever done that in human history and so it means all of the banks of what's often called now the quarter life crisis\nThe sort of late adolescence crisis of trying to figure out your your role in life and how do you go from just being a consumer and mom and dad's house to be in a producer that can not just put bread\nOn the table for your kids but can actually have a sense of meaning that you're serving your neighbor that disruption that most people know in late adolescence working experience that again every three to five years for our whole life and that means there's a lot of new potential for upheaval and frankly for unhappiness there's going to be more economic output\nThan it's ever been produced before in human history but it's not at all clear that it will redound\nTo the median family and the median household and the media and worker or going to have to become a civilization of lifelong workers able to get retrained when you're forty nobody's ever done that before\nOkay so there's about an hour of questions or just on on that one uh but I've got about three minutes left can you give me\nA ... your take on the first real political upheaval that we're going to see that I think by twenty twenty it could change everything could start global wars deep thanks\nYeah so one of the reasons I wrote them is because I spent a lot of time on intelligence issues and I'm In the intel community there are people who talk about the\nPerfect storm of deep facts that we have coming and the storm is these three ingredients number one new technology makes it possible to sort of narrow cast a world with fake audio and fake video where lots of people can be susceptible to being sort of um a\nSpoof or persuaded the things that are real are real there's always been enemies doing malicious actor\nYou know information warfare since the beginning of time you can find in proverbs and ugly they asked these uh to sow discord in an enemies tent but it used to require a prostitute and honey trapping a fake\nBusiness partner and a bribery scheme and more but you had to get people around people number one is now we can use technology to surround someone and give them a fake experience and ... are fake audio and fake video that are going to seem real and make that possible number to Russia is already trying this constantly against us they're just bad\nAt it the real reason we need to take the Russia\nType investigation so seriously as because China's right behind them running scout\nTeam off since I'm On them and ready to do\nBig deep fakes a hybrid war information operations against American leaders and\nBusiness officials and the public at large and number three we have so many internal divisions about geography about race about um gender about guns there are many many issues where Americans are so divided that we are susceptible\nTo these kinds of campaigns like Russia is already trying to run on social media they're just not very good at it where they try to exacerbate and inflame tensions on every side of every issue the NFL kneeling controversy majority of the stuff on line on social media and the first Seventy two hours after that flamed last fall the majority of it on both\nSides stand for the anthem and taken the NFL most of it was Russian on both sides and so we're going to have a world where you're going to have things like the cabinet hearings where all of a sudden the audio will appear of Schumer strategizing with Michael ... or video will appear it'll be fake\nBut video will appear and it'll be Kavanaugh partying hard as an undergrad at Yale it'll be fake but in our ...\nMichael ... or video will appear it'll be fake but video will appear and it'll be Kavanaugh partying art as an undergrad at Yale it'll be fake but in our echoed silo chambers of the way we consume media right now it's going to be\nA potentially much more divisive than what we know today and so one of the reasons I wanted to write to them or why we hate each other is an awareness that there's actually national security exposures for this country and how much we hate each other around politics we need communities of people that live in the same neighborhood that believe lots of stuff in common\nEven when we differ on politics\n\nHow come we can't get anybody in Washington or in the media to talk about this than\nI it took us what twenty five minutes to unpack some of it and the business model of selling soap three minutes from now is let's just say who the bad guy is you know there's there's some nut job somewhere at a McDonald's right now who probably\nSlap to an old man wearing a ... hat and or\nThat person is a weirdo and did something wrong but they don't actually stand in for all debate and that's really the way we're consuming most of our media right now is that kind of not pecking and so it's harder to do ten and twenty five year out issues but that's the that's the strategic stuff that Washington should be focused on\nHow are you going to do that when you have well we've got three I've got thirty seconds I'm not getting even ask you not even ask you I Would like to ask you to come down a band and and really unpack this uh because I think your voice needs to be heard and understood and I think in soundbites\nUm it's not a not always understood I'm so thank you very much\nOh you're a conspiracy theorists weight she just said it\nAt one point [laughter] oh there first of all the ... the press is a collection of individual ... some of what you do a good job some of which do not ... or so and it's important to make those distinctions I think um and you know look at that as a ...\nThis was just this is going on at our founding ...\nYou know people were doing it at our founding and and it at our founding but we but we ... we realize just when we were in a gauge and informed populace which shows correctly ...\nRight I mean I you know if we're not\nWell we know what the ... which we know a Republican if you can keep it right and if we if we don't choose to keep the republic well then of course it's going to fall apart we knew this was an experiment and that was the ...\nAnd I think we are seeing some some of those risks pop their heads up but I mean the whole foundation of this country is to let people come out and make their arguments and we have to make our back that does not mean\nI'm ... and I was so encourage I Hope you are too so encouraged by the ... a reaction from conservative ...\nNancy Pelosi shouted\nDown a and I did not see a peep\nOf support from conservatives ... over the actions of the people protesting ... I didn't see I was disgusted by I was disgusted by it as well and I didn't see any\nI didn't know I'm not saying there were none I'm sure people will show me a tweet if some neo nut job who was like I think they should harass Nancy pulls you had dinner but I didn't see one prominent Republican or conservative support those actions not one you could see if we can we played dozens of Democrat\nAnd you know here's here's here's one from Sean King I've said it before but I Need to say it again I'm grateful for ... it's weird that it's politically incorrect for me to say so but I'm Glad we have people in this country to stand up to a fascist and a bigotry and are willing to confront eight face to face right and you can tell you there's nothing on the left there will\nBe prominent politicians yeah I I have not seen one prominent conservative support what happened to policy and that's right and I'm Glad they mean that that shows that there's still you know even though we're divided and even though a lot of things come down to ... minute emotional politics that go minute to minute I'm Glad to see that they're still principles there\nSo here's where I think Ben was wrong when he said to deal with that to a um he was right when he said you know it's a small group ... to ... cheese right it is a very small group and they become very very loud because of social media and because of the media\nBut it is a small group where I think he's wrong is\nAnd they become very very loud because of social media and because of the media\nBut it is a small group where I think he's wrong is ignore it ...\nHe's a part of the solution is ignoring yeah and I think you know 'cause you can't get to the point where like I Would say the same would apply to the all right ... right you know the Charlottesville situation um you know\nThere's obviously a crime committed there that you can't ignore right um but generally speaking when a bunch of Nazis or KKK members that's been happening for every person go back for a broken budget ticket gay members walk through your town like ... you know largely speaking it's great to ignore them because they want attention and they weren't they\nMost that's not what we have now we have to a breaking laws you can't ignore them not can and can't ignore that I don't I don't care if it's the Nazis or ... you can't ignore\nNow thinks that's would argue nor write me I mean like I think he's saying that we get a little bit ... true wrapped up in the back and forth of viral videos and people who are not even really engaged in politics getting freaked out over things that they're never going to have to necessarily deal with\nIf you just missed a group like ads and fellow that's how they grow\nAnd or at least arguably that's how they grow their own oppose you're seeing it happen in Portland right in the mayor is largely just ignoring what they're doing and it's getting worse and worse and worse and worse that does not mean our lives have to be ruled by at a father and I think that was the generalize argument he was going\nWell the the\nThe key here is what do you do about ... and ... the solution is to not do what people did in Florida with ... you don't do that\nBecause that doesn't give you decide to run to ... yeah you don't do what the Proud Boys are doing\nI'm Sorry but it's just when you talk to Gavin about that yeah and I think Gavin is even you know looking at things going again you know look we were we were doing things because you know it's funny ...\nA media yeah he's a comedian um but you know with this this will grow out of control you just don't do that 'cause there's nowhere to go when you're watching that and you're like well I don't like\nWell Nancy Pelosi's on but I don't like what they're doing ...\nSo who do I go to and look at\nLook how the press is treating Donald Trump ...\nBecause the press treated capital ...\nEverybody kind of hard and their positions to ...\nEverybody just hardened their positions and got more outraged ...\nThe only the only thing that might have happened is independence ...\nLooked at that and said ...\nYou know what I don't want to be with those people ... left the left and\nAnd I don't want to be with the I don't want to be with the left and then looked over to the Republicans they weren't misbehaving during that ...\nBut ... what are we doing to welcome people in if you're kind of saying I don't want to be with those guys and then you see you know you ... get out get out and they're pounded on pillows you store and like okay I don't we can't\nWe can't get to a place to where people disengage because if they do completely disengaged then it just run the country is run by radicals ...\nWe need to be a safe\nHaven we need to be a place of real thought real actual tightened ...

so disgusted with some of the rhetoric on both sides we just ignore it\nAnd where you could always been independent thinkers are we are going to stay that way we also know what's wrong is wrong and what's brightest right as far as the big picture is concerned I think a lot of people are underestimating not\nWell Andrew I'm the EU if what you say is true ah than people are the ... then the Republicans will keep the house most likely\nBecause it is so close that levels we've never seen of interest in participation in the mid term election ever a and it's it's within the margin of error

thousand dollar home\n[laughter]\n\nLike five\nFive two to five Andy I'm Trish are in the lobby of Ramsey solutions just stopped\nFive cars that were in the neighborhood from Anchorage, Alaska [laughter] not really but thanks for coming by guys are you have an excellent absolutely so you guys have a question\nWe do we have a question about um insurance as it relates to a nonprofit attrition I have about two and a half years to go there we're going to retire from our jobs and laugh in Alaska relocate to Missouri and set up a law enforcement retreat camp\nFor officers that are just need a place to go in and reconnect with their family but we're wondering is\nWhat kind of insurance should we have to protect ourselves from from potential liability\nThe camp will be a\nThe the operations of the camp will be done by the nonprofit the land that it is ... own all and we'll be rented or on we currently on that property\nCurrently on that property and living living on it on time and um I Would suggest you keep that separate from the nonprofit let the nonprofit rent from you for a dollar or whatever and then you would carry law journal liability on your land\nOr in case something happened with the rent or\nWhich happens to be or non profit\nAnd then the nonprofit you would sit down and talk about what kind of a you know you need to get with an insurance broker and what kind of insurance is appropriate then\nFor a a a camp setting a liability will be the main thing I'd be concerned about uh that if somebody fell and hurt themselves or something like that\nWho are they going to say well they could sue the a landlord or they could sell the tenant good so the the nonprofit or you either one and so\nOn a structure that real carefully on the liability side I'm\nProbably more concerned about that and then ... if the structures on the property or they they would be owned by you individually or are you in a company separate from the nonprofit that company would carry or that individual would carry the insurance on the structures more like homeowners insurance or if you're on the farm or something\nAnd and you keep that because I rent or can't insure 'em\nThings that they don't own you don't have an insurer interest\nAnd I I I really would not put the land in the name of the nonprofit uh I Would keep it separate from a risk standpoint and you know in case something changes with the nonprofit you're not you know you you're not stuck with land in a non profit that can get real sticky if you want to lose\n... let's say you shut it down and you want to sell the land you know you got mess on your hands up the land is owned by the nonprofit you see what I'm saying yeah they keep that separates\nA infiltrate the you know the landlord had can only ensure the buildings the business so to speak of operating the camp would be insured by the nonprofit which would include liability associated with that\nAnd any of the things that the uh if you're a tenet for instance in a house you can get contents insurance\nYou ensure your stuff that's in that landlords house she what I'm saying is a treat these things separately\nIn it for instance in a house you can get contents insurance you ensure your stuff that's in that landlords house and see what I'm saying and it's a treat these things separately and your mind that way but an insurance broker\nCan walk you through how to do that and uh I'm not an expert on camp insurance [laughter] by any stretch but insurance brokers are the type of insurance people to shop several different companies to get you the best deal\nAnd for instance a I've got a friend that owns an airplane okay and so you don't go to State Farm and get an airplane insurance okay they don't sell it\nIn mind but you wouldn't want by there even if they did so\nYou you said you would go to an insurance broker and they shot five different companies that Ruy airplane insurance\nAnd then they come back and tell you what how that how the liability works on that and how the different\nYou know and the the if there's a crash about what happened in the same thing here they would find five different companies that ride camp insurance for for families are adult camps or retreats or whatever I'm sure there's companies out there that have specific products associated insurance products associate with this and they would\nMake a market that means an insurance where they find somebody that ride your policy\nOr two or three and then you compare him while this company covers this thing\nAnd it costs so much in this kind of a company covers the same stuff accepted doesn't have that one thing and it caused this much and\nYou start to compare and decide you know what's the best type of insurance for your nonprofit and for you individually the individual part will be a lot cleaner 'cause it's basically a insurance on a farm or or insurance on a farm plus a few cabins you know almost like a that kind of stuff so you're covering the structure that's a lot cleaner but the other stuff\nYou just get somebody that that can you know go into that little bit of a specialized type of insurance is what I'd be looking for if I were insurers isn't but the main thing you want is liability due to hold harmless agreements or carry any weight in any of this um\nNo I ... yeah they carry weight but I'm\nThe\nAre no agreements that keep someone from\nYou cannot contract away liability okay so let's say that a floor was rotten and one of the cabins okay and that's a liability that your fault regardless of if they sign to hold harmless you you are liable for that\nUh you're standing in my building if you slip and fall and uh because we didn't you know properly install the floors or there was a hole in the floor and we forgot about it or something\nThen we're liable for that regardless of if we had you sign a horrible Varmus before he walked in here you know so uh you cannot contract away certain kinds of liability so you need insurance anyway and you need to keep stuff separate an ownership like we were talking about anyway\nThose are called that's those moves or risk management moves you're you're managing your risk I but I hold harmless is\nThat what that does is it it's like a lot of contracts keeps honest people honest like do you know you are you are walking across that employee fell on your face 'cause you trip you know and you're trying to hold harmless agreement\nAnd you know then you're going to call him out just on his honor you know if he doesn't have any the insurance companies lawyers gonna call him out on his on her and the fact that he signed this and it helps them when their case\nThey're not after writing a check but you need the backup in case you were to lose that\nUh and it'd be proven that you are liable regardless of the whole harmless but I I I Would have um signed them in those cases for sure as you know when you register to you're going to be here for a week and it's a wilderness experience and have an attorney draw up a little simple one page thing\nBut you know if if you're on a four wheeler a expedition on vacation and you go and get on people's four wheelers are on their jeeps or on their snowmobiles you know you sound these\nIf you're on a four wheeler expedition on vacation and you go and get on people's four wheelers are on their jeeps or on their snowmobiles you know you sound these two page documents that are often Brenda about how if you die you're not ... they're not liable they're still wobble\n[laughter] they'll still it was so I mean it that they may not lose as easily but they'll still lose so that does that make sense to you thanks for the call and\nYou're ... you're joining U.S Open phones a AAA eight to five five two to five you jump in we'll talk about your life and your money and a\nJump in and we'll talk AAA eight to five five two to five\nAll right Lindsay is with us in Tulsa, Oklahoma Hi Lindsay how are you\nI'm Dave how are you better than I deserve what's up\nI'm okay I have a question and I'm a new nurse so I Apologize if this is something that you've touched on I'll watch um so I'm new to the baby step and I know that number one of the thousand dollar\nAn emergency find\nMy question in the you ever think gaff saving more than that and and the reason I asked her if my husband works and oil and gas industry and getting laid off isn't really an uncommon thing to happen mhm\nUm and I stay at home with a kid mhm but I'm just wondering am how you think we should prepare\nGenerally I Do not suggest more than that until you get better baby step three but here's what I Would say okay he's in an unstable environment where this job is what you're saying and I agree with you\n[laughter] okay but um\nThat's one level of quote worry\nI'm not going to raise it based on that level of Henri but what I Would do is stop the baby steps and pile up cash if we get wind that he's really going to get laid off how much notice did they usually give him if he's laid off\n[noise] um [noise] I don't it's never he's only been working for three years on or never happened I was really lucky we've never been laid off and then they get sent home pretty quick I mean within a\nCouple of weeks she'd have a couple of weeks to do something and he's going to work on something when he comes home if they did get laid off so uh you know if he looks up and five of his buddies were laid off last week I Will push paws on hold hold them want to make a little baby step thing and just pile of cash\nBut just generally worried about it you know generally worried about is what we all have and that's why we get out of that\nOne of the smartest things you can do is take good care of your teeth that will save you tons of money in the long run to help I recommend all my listeners check out one dental dot com it's not dental insurance one dental as a dental discount program that\nNot as sweet Virginia breeze end the call from G L E s victory last weekend in Kansas and what are you going to happen to think that he had in last round starting today for the renovate he's got a lot of work to do because he qualified as Chevrolet in the twenty first ... first position now\nI ... in the back so that started in the nineteenth now but still when I talked to him after qualifying he was very concerned that they were in get lap early\nBy car as being that they have such an a farce starting position\nThat easy to do here at a short track you caught up with them or earlier in the weekend and one of the interesting things I think about chased lately is how he has changed a little bit in terms of his confidence level since you got that first victory\nThis time we've been wondering when what had happened it's going to happen tonight Watkins Glen is not a nice start selling it is going to victory lie in the\nWinter season but two of the last three races you end up in ... another thing you know you win wine once you get your first one and another ... easily but from your perspective is that how it felt\nI think that's a myth personally I don't I mean you know to me the only difference is we've been in better physicians I think the last couple of months versus what we were yesterday at the beginning of the year or whatever so\nI think that's been the biggest difference is just having been in better position closing a race which all that kind of gotten just comes out to be a little faster and and being a racist at the top five if you're doing that\nThen different strategies and things can be relevant to you otherwise you're on different game plans and\nFive if you're doing that then different bureaus strategies and things can be relevant to you otherwise you're on different game plans and and what not further back in the field and doesn't really matter so I think that's the biggest differences just running better\nLooking at the next round minds all types of Phoenix is there one talking particularly that you feel more than the others like you guys could win and lock yourself into homes that\nI mean I like to think any of them I mean I think that's got to kind of be your mindset I just don't think there's really any room to to struggle a whole lot you know in this round and and um you know it's going to be ... there's a lot of the cars and everybody's going to be pretty good so yeah like I said it's a lottery here definitely not a lot of room to struggle can't make any mistakes\nYou know but yeah I think any of them you know I think Texas to me it's probably been are as of late than our biggest struggle since they repay that but I don't know is\nThere any fear that if we might get complacent because Windsor nice and obviously to in the last three of the big deal is there any fear that\nThey might just get you know comfortable with the winning the nomination and not put an effort that you guys have seen a lot someone you\nKnow I think if we're going to get complacent with him and his last around them and I was just really I'm really excited to see that we did it as a whole\nAnd then you have to like him I was writing it would be really easy to take that one and over and cruise near the next two weeks and then not bring our best effort\nYou know Talladega was was really bad I thought you know in general obviously didn't work out but you know to go to Kansas and stay on kill us all nice and I think that you know everybody kind of had that mindset so no I don't expect that the change now\nPeople talk about momentum but the fact that this is a brand new rounds guys momentum carry over that kind of a clean slate and then on top of that what is the three winning say about your team to the other teams in the championship\nAll the five points carry over 'em or Fifteen so yeah it it all matters\nFor sure and I think I think the momentum definitely doesn't hurt you know the round does reset so you know is a whole new set opportunities but yeah I don't it definitely doesn't hurt rather be in a position that we're coming off of great a great round than than not so I'm\nI'm excited and drink recently not they're going to be a shift in twenty Nineteen ... is going to work with Lee in Bahrain Kevin ... maybe not to work with Jimmy I Know that it doesn't affect your teams but typically but do you feel like it's going to pressure not things over a hindrance in general as ... whole organization\nYeah I mean I think it has the has the opportunity to you know I think that the biggest thing that it's going to do is just make all for cars stronger you know I'm I'm excited to see that you know I Know that you know obviously jak Jimmy not some great things over the years and and\nI think everybody kind of miss is that narrative and wants to write about all the problems are problems I think they have but I think it you know just one of those things time for change didn't want to do something different so I think we all need to respect that for one\nAnd give them a chance to do something different and see how it goes so yeah I think it's going to make make everybody better and if we are better as a hold and we're going to be we're also end up better and the and\nYou recently attended a Metallica concert doesn't seem like you're seeing just 'cause I Know you love country music what was it like\nYeah definitely not my thing I got kind of a\nDrug into that but it was a it was a gay I'm sure I get bash per se they metallic is okay but when I Can't hear the words that half of your ah\nHalf of your songs [laughter] I don't think that's for me but\nI don't know whatever floats your boat it was those a lot of people there that enjoyed it so I had a good time one of those things where you know they are legendary I guess in their own right so you out of the plot I got to go like I say I went one time\nAnd he had a concert on the docket coming up\nNothing nothing as uh\nYeah I guess in their own right so what I say that I got to go that way without any other concert on the docket coming up nothing nothing as of as of late so I don't know I Need to work on the off season plans because they're pretty boring right now so we're\nWe have some work to to know the I'm Oregon or they\nWill give me if I had to bet Metallica would not have made the top three top ten to twenty for chase Eliot to go see\nNo and I'm trying to picture in it at the Metallica concert and all I can kinda see it's him or maybe in the background maybe having is but I don't even know if I may that\nYeah and that hey you mentioned the change is
