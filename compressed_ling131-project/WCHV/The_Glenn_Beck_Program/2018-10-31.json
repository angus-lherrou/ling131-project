President Lincoln or any general\nWay way we can we separate these two ... because the first one is James Madison hard to take it apart and dozens James Madison right now however James Madison I think in this particular case James Madison is ... is looking at something different piece not looking at whether you came from Great Britain or not correct he's not talking about\nPeople who are coming in trying to drop off to be able to take stuff or or you know or bring the whole family in born in the colonies or were you born in Great Britain correct and they answered that two ways if you were born here you don't need naturalization however ...\n... ... you also have to be born here to be president and that's what they were worried about they were worried about these English coming\nIn at ... ... try this out for size they were worried about the English coming in and just saying hey I'm I'm\n... ... ... try this out for size they were worried about the English coming in and just saying hey I'm I'm I'm American I'm living here and I'm American so I can vote because they knew\nThat if all these English people came in they would change the country that's why they didn't want a a a foreigner as president as well you had\nTo be born here so they were trying to protect it ... at that time ... ... from the English coming in and screwing up the country with a vote which is what we're dealing with now\n... I think I agree with that although he's saying if you're born here you are you\nDo have correct because it was a it was a different time and a different problem yup\nAnd I say like as much as I Love James Madison I Love the founders I ... it's almost less important what they thought about this particular issue because it was an amendment to the constitution right we are talking about the fourteenth amendment\nYeah they do and that's why you have to separate James Madison because that's not constitutional he didn't put that in the constitution was that was put in under Lincoln and and so now go to that because that's a different argument as well\nUm so ... ... so this is now a Edward Bates is president Lincoln's attorney general ...\n... men so we're in a pretty this is again a few years right before they do the fourteenth amendment ... uh the eight incorporates the language in his uh this is a from the article from National Review properly understood of codified\n... attorney general Bates contemporary understanding this is what he says I'm quite clear in the opinion that children born in the United states of alien parents\nWho have never been naturalized are native born citizens of the United states and of course do not require the formality of naturalization to entitled them to the rights privileges of such citizenship isn't there more ... ... ... at at the end of that quote\nI thought there was something else too about or maybe it was in James Madison that they had come in the ... the proper way or something like ...\nI thought I heard that earlier today but the the the Abraham Lincoln thing is just the same remember so way on a constitutional ...\nBecause there wasn't the fourteenth amendment yet I Know I Know what he's writing and this is this is the beginning of it and so the first one is how do we know who is citizen is because it's almost all well it is at that point all immigrants except those who had come over and the Mayflower\nA or had their relatives come over before and so it's very small number it was mainly immigrants so how do you know who is an American well were you born here\nThat was it that was the question of who's in American at that time because it was mainly ...\nYou know people from England and they were worried about the English coming in so you're born here you're a citizen you can serve you can vote starting to get a pretty serious German influx too yes serious German and they were freaked by that the the second thing is uh with with Lincoln ...\n... he's trying to solve a different problem ... ... she's trying to solve at that point the Democrat literally the Democratic party\n... this is their first attempt before poll taxes\nAnd you know moving a polling place and all of the crap that they did the first thing was oh well you know you're not okay you might be you might be a citizen but your kids ...\nTo your kids weren't slaves so your kids aren't citizens ... ... he's ... they're trying to say ... Tom pit stop it ... ...\n... we're talking about the slaves slaves are free their citizens and so are there children ... that you have to look at the thirteenth fourteenth amendment for what\nThese are human beings and they are citizens\nThat'd be fascinated here and these two sides tapas out because it it they're both coming from the conservative perspective it's not like you know Chris Cuomo versus somebody you trust\nOr at least they're both sides of the argument I think a really interesting I don't because I think you're right the but sometimes that is because that is definitely what they were intending right was slavery however sometimes you know that is the also there's there on a ... unintended but intended consequences where you would you would\nAbsorb a larger group to make sure one group is is there is no way the intent is that if you come here from Mexico central and South America and you have a baby and everybody who does that is now is that it's there there's Ryan

are part is all men are created equal\nWomen can vote the same thing with blacks and the thirteenth fourteenth\nAmendment ... ... ... ... there there were specific ... where the\nWhere the amendments are very broad the first ten\nWhat is it made sense for them to think that ... in Dallas texas United States of America at Parkland Hospital Seventy five percent of the babies born there are born to illegals and now they're all citizens you know that doesn't make sense to anybody that doesn't I definitely don't you get a good idea right not not good I ...\nThis this this this is the best phrase ... and I just I Can't understand how people don't understand that the constitution was not meant to be a suicide packed\nA positive or a but that's also a very dangerous free so I guess I I I feel like that the same argument people use with the second amendment oh well they would they look I mean that the time they only have these little weapons they know that we're not ... sure they wanted freedom of guns I mean these guys are too big into the brutal and this is not meant to be a suicide\nPower what I'm Talking about suicide pack I mean on the principles on the principles it's not meant to be a suicide pacts if we follow these principles you won't have a constitution you won't have America anymore you just won't ... because what he is doing it\nFor a hundred years and we still have America where I'm at doing differently now there was not the have a baby tourism back in Nineteen hundred now I mean it's certainly being exploited at some level right I mean but that does not mean huge invent them ... like let's just say we're glad ally argument is an argument to amend the constitution\n... right yeah let's just say if it were very intent was at the beginning let's just say it was that we wanted it we want alien students\nCome in and have been dropped babies over here and then they're gonna be anchor babies and they're gonna get citizenship let's just say that with their intent I don't think it was but let's just say it was\nIf that was true and and back then people weren't exploding and now people are you are never told him ... should not be I said we now think

from it ...\nYeah I mean I thought that ah you know\nBolger finally bring being brought to trial because there's some there's such a myth about the guy there such folklore you know ...\nIn our society unfortunately we tend to glamorize euros Adam criminals Bolger probably is the greatest example of that so much folklore surrounding him so much hero worship um films that kind of\nDownplayed the

which\nIs an odd phenomenon and so the idea that he was being brought back to trial finally the face the music I thought would be a great opportunity to kind of separate fact from fiction and to really understand the crimes that that was my going in assumption\nBut sitting through that trial and witnessing it and getting to know Bolger uh in fact I was the only journalist allowed to actually

record of ... ...\n... what you thought he was he what you got out so rock solid soap points to like oh my God this guy was invaluable\nBut I think the evidence was just not there for me you know he was he was in who he was in the law books as as as being an informant but you know if you're really really into it there's very little information gave that\nTo the feds didn't already have and so then the question is why was he allowed and even if he gave the best information on the planet and he is directly responsible for the end of the mafia in New England as we know it\nWhich was not the
