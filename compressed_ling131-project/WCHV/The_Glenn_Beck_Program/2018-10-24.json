B. dot com we're even on your radio\nIf you have a watched and listen to this program and read the things that we have written you're not surprised and you are way ahead of the game of what's going on with this caravan let's give you some additional information because it's it's\n... it's very important what Mike Pence said yesterday Mike Pence came out in the oval office and said this is being funded by Venezuela now the mainstream press they're not gonna do anything but ridicule that but this makes sense\nIt makes perfect sense and it does sound crazy when you first hear about it like if you're not if you don't know the back story here like Venezuela you know like oh here we go again as they can they can't afford anything yeah there is blaming something in the country so we can get involved or whatever you know or yeah or the how do they even have the money to do this\nBut um it makes perfect sense when you hear when you put it into the context of the relationship the Honduras had with a both Venezuela in Cuba it makes absolutely perfect in particular\nThese this group that SARS started this caravan they are the group that is that backed the ousted Marxist or radical a president that was ousted in Honduras\nRight and they are they still have a populist the avenue to go to like their goals are stated goal is still to restore that President back to power and he was and they do have kind of a case there and an international case because he was democratically elected\n... so the really if they can make such a firestorm\nSuch a big media uprising over this get international support and backing they could technically eventually may try and get this guy back into power but that is their goal and that's where this started and I think that's where Honduras that this party these people in Honduras while they originally organized this but Venezuela also has other\nReasoning ear reasons to be behind this\nNow if you I mean you think about it just was a few months ago um\nVenezuelan President Maduro would just survived it an assassination attempt and he blamed the United states people in the United states for 'em or backing those people he blames nine states where the economic or her basically ... all the things that are wrong with him it's not socialism if the United states has fault that socialism is not working out the theory behind and\nUm so he blames us for all these things so if you arm adorable you want to strike back they just tried to kill you and his words how do you do it when you can't compete with the United states in a conventional manner you have to go non conventional way and\nYou have to understand too that it\nWas the ousting of the Honduran presidency the guy this caravan support when he was ousted the first thing the new government did or one of the first things\nSting of the Honduran presidency the guy this caravan support when he was ousted the first thing the new government did or one of the first things a new government did was get out of the ... agreement which was agreements of hey we're going to prop each other up\nSo as soon as Honduras pulled out a way from Venezuela that\nHurts them economically big time so he's got a double reason for doing this ... this is huge and this is huge so you really need to look at it through that lens they have a gigantic political and future economic reasoning behind all this was a very big plan it you know in place to do\nAll this I mentioned before that um Iran and Syria were big time observers of this economic union\nAnd a lot of people have been focusing on what would have ISIS gets into this uh you know to this group or whatever you mentioned the possibility of Cuban intelligence Venezuela intelligence was I think is probably Ninety percent likely that they are a part of this caravan\nUm but also a through I uh Iran Hezbollah\nHezbollah can be all in this a caravan I have no information on that note no intelligence behind it but because of all the actors because of everyone involved because of the people that are are are still ... Venezuela Iran\nRight you could be a chasm below would be my ... if I'm In the U.S intelligence operative I'm looking for Hezbollah links you know inside the Caribbean and I guarantee you the U.S intelligence agencies are all over this I'm sure we've infiltrated this that's why when when the vice president United States\nSays that oh the Honduran president told me this he's not reporting on here say\nLike that would be here say unless they seriously have something behind it\nI fully things that he knows I think I heard your interview with a gun or having a yesterday yeah he do he knew as well he knew and of course that's something he would not come out and say oh Venezuela's behind that and the governor of Texas is not going to say that and but I Do think vice president Pence tipped his hand on that I really think that they're behind us another question now is\nHow does this escalate you mentioned waves of attacks we already know there's a there's a caravan forming in El Salvador there's a carrier and forming in Guatemala and who are they\nForm who's forming them that we don't know the organizers yet but those are all they're all in the same border all with Honduras so the same people that liberty and re foundation party look that up when you're looking at these things up and doing your own homework liberty and re foundation party in Honduras I Would not be surprised if we if we hear more names in El Salvador in Guatemala forming these\nUh caravans because the ah Honduras border was a shutdown pretty heavily they crack down on that border so they can't send more people on doors anymore\nSo they probably go there those are their allies in El Salvador and Guatemala are probably just forming them in their border countries\nAnd the press won't look into this in fact the press is downplaying this now and the reason why is because they know this is a nightmare for Democrats in the election this is an absolute nightmare the build up to it what\nI Would just I just I just want the mainstream media just to check on the children yes just could you do the um reports on\nHow are they how who's taking care of the medical care young who's who is who is taking care of the food for seven thousand people the diapers ... with the infant this sanitary conditions must be strong how are they sleeping how are they moving\nWith somebody 'cause I Want to help I Want to help I just I didn't know if you're in Smith\nShow where they were sleeping they're sleeping on the pavement and it's burning hot pavement than beaming on yeah and um\nWhere where are they getting the water because you can't take Seventy five hundred people into a small town\nYou know and and and go into the seven eleven and say hey we need that\nYou know fourteen thousand bottles of water [laughter] you can't know no one for right now 'cause I'm a little Thursday we haven't we haven't had a drink and two hundred miles and so I take one for the road one for the road for everybody and one drink now yeah I just need fourteen thousand bottles of\nI'm sure the ... that they're stopping get probably has fourteen thousand bottles of water okay yeah so I'm sure it's they just stop it stop these young okay along the way ... um you keep saying something about a political stunt you keep talking you know there's the funding funding or\nEyes um you keep saying something about a political stunt you keep talking you know there's the funding funding funding and light Gene Wilder right here oh okay oh all these questions about where they got they got them from a who organized or cause the\nCaravan mhm ... or ... initially organized and in October force Facebook\nPost he shared a graphic promoting a migrant march\nThe graphic told migrants in protesters together on October twelve at a bus station in San Pedro Sula one of the most violent cities in the world quote we don't leave because we want to violence and poverty chases us out ...\nKelvin ... go ahead a Siamese negative all these negative motivations so Len go ahead ...

it's not a healthy the outlook\nUm we see the stats of people who have gender just there's more ... and the suicide rates are really bad having the sex change and everything else is not changing those suicide rates\nSo why are we taking the the gender this more for you and say hey it's totally fine when it's not it's not the suicide rates were bad\nUh I Would agree with that when we weren't taught that it's ... I Do think many people who are coming out\nIs transgender nowadays probably have some other psychiatric condition that isn't being diagnosed because clinicians aren't able to do their job properly so if someone comes into your clinic and says that they are transgender I don't work with patients anymore but\nUm if someone comes in Allen says that they are transgender a clinician really does have to take that at face value they're not really allowed to to ask deeper questions\nThey don't work with patients anymore but um if someone comes in Allen says that they're transgender a clinician really does have to take that at face value they're not really allowed to to ask deeper question because that seen as trans Celtic\nSo I think nowadays because it's seen as very trendy to trends that can be part of it until someone who has another form of psychopathology it's manifesting as something that has to do gender even ... I think that you said\nUm but with regards to why transitioning should be seen as something beneficial in research that show for some people that can help I Do think if others things happened ruled out that it\nCan be beneficial for somebody um I think ultimately adults should be free to do what they want with your body\nSo so do I don't get me wrong so do I but I I I think what uh uh I was getting to and you just answered is\nThis trans phobia of is this just hurting everybody into Ashville questions is dangerous it's just dangerous for people\nAnd we we should look in the end you're an adult you get to do what you want to do and I'm fine with that but just the silencing of thought and in this case science and medicine is is terrifying\nYes but any going back to the difference between gender disorienting say something like anorexia with people who are gender historic their brain has been partially either my school and I are sending I write and direction I got out of\nThat the gender they identify right the thing is the studies that show that in the brain ... are also conflated with sexual orientation so if you have a study on trans women say so these are people who are born out that identifies female\nThey are also attracted for the most part two men\nSo when you to his brain studies we're still not clear on\nIs the difference is we're seeing are due to then identifying female or do to them being sexually attracted to that because they are very strong neural correlate that are associated with sexual orientation so that's the other thing that people are talking about is that this has a lot to do with sexual orientation being gay\nAnd so they call it that people are talking so much about how transgender transgender is in the brain it's not really accurate because when we don't know for sure yet\nDon't you ever so thank you so much appreciate it\nOnly enlightening to talk to somebody who is not politically correct and it doesn't agree with

for so long\nAnd this isn't about impeachment investigation I don't know that I bought in on that if you're a traditional Democrat and I think they they look at the Republican who have been focused on

dismissed Juanita broad Rick's accusation against a Bill Clinton now this is coming from a columnist for the Washington Post was name is Richard Cohen he's worked at the post and tonight in sixty eight\n[noise] and he just wrote an opinion piece titled I thought one either Broderick was incredible\nI was wrong\nNot wanting to Broderick is the woman who alleges that Bill Clinton raped her when he was running for Arkansas governor in Nineteen Seventy eight but\nSince the me too movement exploded over a year ago there's been a title shift in the culture culminating in the tug of war over allegations during the Kavanaugh hearings now one of the biggest takeaways from those hearings according to those on the left is that you always must believe the victim\nDuring the hearings Anita Hill was once again in the spotlight brought up over and over again and her accusations against Clarence Thomas universally believed to other media yet somehow some of Bill Clinton's accusers still haven't been extended the same sympathy as Dr Blasey Ford and need a hill\n... that's really why is it so unusual to hear a Bill Clinton supporter admit\nThat they may have been wrong about Broderick it's Twenty years\nLater now this has been obviously influenced by the me too movement\nBut Cohen now admits to dismissing Broderick claims during the Clinton presidency is just another wild accusation made by twisted Clinton haters\nNBC's Lisa Myers recently told slate I tested Broderick story every way I could again and again and again I'm quoting and no detail ever changed it never got better it never got worse it was always the same and quote\nCohen now wonders why Monica Lewinsky is now totally characterized as a victim while Broderick is ignored\nIsn't that interesting Monica Lewinsky who has always say she says she wasn't a victim\nIs now the victim and Broderick who is always claimed it was not consensual I was raped she's ignored Cohen says\nAnd it was not consensual I was raped she's ignored Cohen says it might have something to do with Broderick bring being a Trump supporter come on I could not have anything to do with it\nThough and writes I remember refusing to deal with the Broderick allegations because I simply chose to believe Clinton was not a rapist my position has proved naive\nLet me ask you a question unlike\nBroderick who had all of the evidence had witnesses unlike Keith Ellison who the witness is very credible has nothing to gain everything to lose the evidence is overwhelming\nThose two things you can look at and then you can say there's evidence there you're shoot you chose to ignore it with Kavanaugh there was no evidence but if suddenly there was a bunch of evidence and it was presented\nI Would be fine with saying wow okay new information looks like Kavanaugh did it why is it that no one on the left is willing to do that\n\nWhether dealing with Clinton or the capital cases all political camps should tread carefully in their certainty about the truth certainty always seems to get us into trouble\nRequires a huge dose of something more elusive than the truth to be able to survive today\nAnd that is humility Cohen\nSeems to be exercising humility and for that I think the Washington Post columnist thank you for being willing to step out of the crowd\nGo against maybe some of your peers and say you know what I think we were wrong about this one thank you Richard Cohen\nIs a pretty big moment we recently went over the details that Broderick accusation like to have her on\nYeah she she would come on I think um she it was interesting to see that because I honestly the same thing had a similar reaction to it at the time or in which a lot of the accusations about affairs and stuff seem to credible but you know rapist I mean the the accusation was really brutal\nOr by the time she had five corroborating witnesses that she told at the time or she talked about seeing a I think it was a prison\nOr in the outside of the window ... um which was confirmed that prison was there she was confirmed to be at this nursing cameras that was there he was in town like I mean there was a lot of it was on like the she knew that she knew what hotel it was at\nMagazine you know what I mean you had to shame you're going to go into some you know like concrete no window building like your car would be there and be like all their egos and they're ... or like no and it's and it's not that way now now is the worst of the worst now it's degrading I knew that are easy to get up every ... everywhere and\nAnd the ... and the real shocking that Glenn is not only is that the case with technology and the prevalence but among young people where it's most prevalent Eighteen to twenty four year old men now the numbers show that they view it as a morally acceptable choice or indifferent to it a majority so so what can I tell you something\nI mean you're a guy\nYou're being told you can't look at women are sexually you can't notice what they're wearing you a rape is completely undefined I mean you know\nI asked you out you said no I asked you out a second time and now I hear rape is you know I'm a rate [laughter] I mean it's\nIt's crazy and confusing and I don't know you know as a as a twenty something boy or a Seventeen year old boy\nWouldn't want to live well it's in there that would argue with consequences for it right like it's just yeah I don't have I'm not getting real that by anybody I'm not getting in trouble with anybody I mean it's really not much for granted not consequences for it right yeah not\nAt all um I mean the the the pastors that are in the score some you may remember glad I don't know if you know Doug Wilson but he um he got famous because he was debating Christopher hits\nIn the past or is that are in the score some\nYou may remember glad I don't know if you know Doug Wilson but he um he got famous because he was debating Christopher Hitchens he went around and he was the he was the apologist apologies that went around with him and and so and so he lays that all out about how you know destructive this really is to relationships and how is the silent killer\nBecause there's a stigma with with pornography like if you go into you know your church is your testimony and there's some sort of\nYou know like a drug addiction or something like that you know there's a lot of sympathy for you and and people you know roll out the record but there's you know if you come up and you're the poor guy right now it's like you don't how many how many how many times have you seen that testimony or church I have never seen it right and so and so\nAnd actually the numbers and the studies show that even church leaders are are falling victim to to this so I Know there's a reason why they're not bringing it up there there's a fear that they're going to be found out too\nBut I Know in you know in in in my church\nAnd you know my church is a good way to to you know [laughter] I don't do we drink milk [laughter] and it it it's the number one reason families are breaking up is the number one cause of of problem is pornography and it starts out as pornography and it just spirals out of control\nPlay too if you're if you're ... you know you're having a porn addiction issue like you're probably not going to want to stand up and front you're right because the stigma is big I think it's interesting about what you've done here is like ... that the same way that\nWe the negatives of what has happened with porn which is the stigma has been taken away 'cause you could just do it online and her own right like this course that you have is kinda the same it takes away the stigma of having to admit it necessarily you can kind of go through and and hear these things without having to stand up in front of your\nChair I don't try and her neighbors about it I mean I Know you're ready you know I Know it's really a you know it's I understand the stigma\nAbout it's the same kind of stigma as you would have is a is an alcoholic twenty five years ago you have to um there's ... it is\nThis is natural as you said God gave us this sex drive and it is different between men and women and men are driven by their eyes it didn't we just are we're very visual women or not is visual is we are when it comes to sex and so there's\nIt's it's normal it is normal yeah you would have this Dr what makes us not an animal is trying to say okay some of that is good some of the too much of this is bad right\nRight and and what we're doing is like I said we're pressing the reset button and showing you where God has laid out because cultures gone so off the rails and it's that's part of that's been infused in the church I mean even the stuff you let inside\nYou know the stuff we allow ourselves to watch I mean as you can talk about pornography and say oh hard core pornography yes that's pornography but where do you watch it on Instagram which feeds are you looking at I mean as in ... I'm not like\nThe women in bikinis showing their butts right now I mean like only when I got in the rain when you're just rolling that all the way through I mean and if you didn't have to be considered part I think I think some people can make that case didn't make a strong case\nThis is an argument that you know my wife and I have all the time a because there's almost nothing that you could watch on you know Netflix or Amazon yeah\nThat unless it's an old TV series or something there's almost nothing that you can watch that doesn't have this\nYou know so you know just click click click ... go ahead and and um you know fast forward through some of that crap and that's the argument is on my wife like\nDon't stop watching we have to stop watching it honey let's just ... head of this part you know but is that right right is that right\nKnow and it's not because he is the course like how does it have our recommendations for filters is it about that type of thing\nIs that right right is that right you know it's not because he\nIs the course like how does it have work recommendations for filters is it about that type of thing with me we we mentioned those things because they're good like having Internet filters and accountability partners and you know things are good but what we do is we really just try to get\nTo the heart of it because those things are bandied they're they're\nRight the Bible says our hearts are deceitful above all out and so it's\nYour your heart's gonna find a way if you're still desiring that your heart's gonna find a way around your filter you're going to find another device you're going to know how to do this and that to get around it so we try to rewire your heart and show you what God if we give you a positive vision to shoot for you can't just say don't do it right do it right give me some of the stats\nUm while I'm you know two thirds of all Christian men have you'd porn monthly they admit that I I Would assume too that's if that's the admitted to number it's\n... it's probably not I actually just to hold on higher I think it was something like I don't have one in six\nChurch leaders have admitted to struggling with this that's church one is six and so you know nine percent of churches only ... only nine percent of churches actually have resources dedicated and I and I believe because ... is is just you know me\nSort of projecting this you know I'm guessing this but because of that and the ramp and you know numbers that are here I think that there's probably a little bit of fear and some of these leaders because they feel hypocritical\nYou know coming out in and saying let's fight this thing because they know they're struggling with with themselves but I'll give you one more um\nAh kids are being exposed to porn I mean my kids went on Syria the other day and actually said something and they miss entered Syria misunderstood and came back with like a sexual thing um and my son was like what's that all about ... so kids are accidentally or intentionally getting exposed at pornography as young as ten and eleven years old\nAnd they're getting married later so now think about that if you start getting into porn at ten eleven twelve years old and it becomes a habit for you um and then you don't get married until you're twenty eight twenty nine years old\nYou've been poisoning your brain now in how you view women for ... you know two thirds of your life to surge of your life and\nAn hour and it gets people to to really be a good husband and it takes more and more to excite you yes I mean they ... the gateway is the gateway it is you start with\nPorn and and we we look at it fairs and that's the other thing that ... where does that usually start it didn't start just one day you wake up and say I'm going to have an affair with my secretary [laughter] started in the house\nAnd your phone you know and like and we can talk about this but I guarantee our voices right now we're hitting the numbers don't lie the numbers don't lie we're hitting you were not getting your neighbor were not hitting somebody else I guarantee you there's somebody sit in their car listening to this and edits hitting home right now because it's the silent killer and you've been walking around with that\nWould that shame and guilt and so that's why we made this course set free course dot com because\nYou know God wants you to be free from this he he wants you to live it you know shame free guilt free from this and he's given you the tools to fight it and so that's what we want to\nThank you very much Dan thank you thank you for having me\nYeah I guess he's doing something with his life [laughter] after the\nSet free course dot com is the place to go get it and the Israel thing is coming up to where we got the ... documentary I was talking to Dan a little bit earlier today about some of the experiences of seeing the media as they cover the Palestinians versus the way they covered the Israel isn't an old to go over there now over the media and yet that's what this documentary became because\nThe media was if you didn't stay with the gaggle\nYou actually knew actually observe\nSomething above the gaggle yeah that they're just never aware\nOf law and and even more shocking Glen is when the ... they're they get the story wrong\nI mean it was unbelievable to me you know because we went there to watch from you know action\nAnd even more shocking Glen is when the gavel so they're they get the story wrong\nI mean it was unbelievable to me you know because we went there to watch from you know actually do what the other presidents didn't do and and open the the us embassy there in in Jerusalem and so um that's what we were therefore but then what we saw was how the media can talk to the narrative that's completely false\nUm I'll I'll tell you a quick story of you know for some some context I downloaded and a half while I was there called red alert and so you can try this at home and test it and see if I'm if I'm I'm full of it\nBut it's called red alert and what it does is it it you know you know those annoying alerts you get on your phone when they land flooded it's allowed well it does that whenever a missile or rocket is launched into Israel because we wanted to follow okay there's a rocket falling down and I rarely go we're going to go find where they are and so I downloaded this app and so I went off a few times over there\nOr I get home and you know all of a sudden it like two in the morning like my my phone's just going bananas and like all day for like three days in a row like on and off I'm getting these I had to delete the app because it was so annoying that I was that these rockets were getting shot and Israel all the time\nAnd you know and then they might be a show that the picture like there's the contacts there rockets are flying in from Gaza all the time\nThat the media shows up and it's like look at these Israeli you know evil soldiers just gunning down innocent hapless and protesters there on the on the Gaza border ... why do you think the Israelis are taking it very seriously when they're burning tires", "show_name":
