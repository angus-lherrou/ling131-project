go this is called the\nEr the search suggestion effect when you start to type a search term into the Google Search bar you are being manipulated from the very first character that you typed\nSo if you type a depending on your history and other things chances are you'll get Amazon right away they'll start slashing suggestions at you and Amazon it turns out is Google's biggest advertiser paying them three hundred million dollars a year and Google sends more traffic to Amazon than any other single source\nBut beyond that we've learned through our experiments\nThat Google can use search suggestions that their flashing asked you to turn a fifty fifty vote among a fifty fifty split among undecided voters into\nUm and it is I mean it's everything that aside fi you know a writer has envision

of the ... one of the many things that's not on that list as you shouldn't be using Google Analytics which Glenn Beck dot com is using [laughter] so that the\nIndividual level now as the as the organizational governmental level there's other things uh you know\nSo it's not what you shouldn't even be using a Google Chrome browser\nThere's other things uh you know\nSo I didn't know what you

weren't getting anywhere with trying to hope that the problem wasn't we didn't understand the politics so much although there's still a lot\nTo learn there and there was for us to a very complicated they call it a matrix of domination that you have to understand um but it was\nMore that we actually we're not trying to work their scholarship and so there are two things that are needed to to get

[noise]\n... [noise]\nNow published studies are just tremendous I mean I don't know if you guys had beers before you came up with this or how you guys came up with these are but they're fantastic oh let's go through some of them one by one let's start with the first one dog park\nBefore you came up with this or how you guys came up with these ah but they're fantastic oh let's go through some of them one by one let's start with the first one dog park the or the thesis of his dog parks are re rape condoning spaces tell me about ... tell me about it\nWas kind of funny actually I'm I'll tell ya story um when I went to we we all got together to to have this ... public as best we could so I went to Portland we all went to Portland, Oregon\nToo I'm ready for this project to come out to the public can we went to the dog park on the first day I got there almost right off the plane I took over next thing you know I'm walking\nPeter resolve that for the dog park with a filmmaker and uh we get to the dog park and there's this this dog there that's living out the paper it was crazy this dog\nWas fighting the other dogs putting them down helping them left right and center the the owner comes over swing the things the ball thrower at the dog gently I'll point out he wasn't being abusive and then says stop pumping and then we get to as a\nLean over to the filmmaker and kind of murder I guess a little too loudly and maybe we should start interrogating people about their sexuality given what is going down here and then this lady yells out to me oh no no it's okay she's the girl dog and I was like oh man this papers happening for real\n[laughter] so what is what is the thesis\nSays the thesis was all the original idea behind a thesis was that we should write a feminist paper arguing that we should train ... and the way that we train dogs to prevent rape culture\nAnd so I thought that they thought it was pretty funny when I was brainstorming ideas for papers sure to Peter Peter takes his dog the dog park every day I'm ... said let's work in some of the stuff from the dog park and as we started working and just you know absolutely absurd ideas from\nWhat might be considered the most ridiculous dog park in the world or the paper grew into that and so we made it about\nSo called queer performer pivoting in human reactions at the park and then ended up concluding things like the ... we we should be able to leash man likely least dogs X to prevent rape except if not politically feasible\nAnd uh gosh it would be great if we could could put shocked colors on men\nBut that's not okay either so we have to shock them out of you know hitting on women by screaming at them to scare them and get them to desist from their behavior we the thesis of the paper was though that that humans\nReacted differently to gauge dog hunting as opposed to stray dog hunting and men were far worse about this than women\nAnd then we concluded that this is indicative of race culture and we called the dog park rape condoning\nA St Louis and while he came to to nightclubs we said rate nightclubs are also rape condoning spaces was no evidence for that whatsoever\nI'm\nSo there was pretty out there um that one was was really out there I think it's I don't know maybe the one about the the feminist spiritual spirituality meetings and poetry it's a little more out there but it's probably close to the most\nWell LOU LOU finished the dog park this one was accepted and reviewed uh some of the reviews is a wonderful paper incredibly innovative rich and analysis extremely well written in organized\nA yadda yadda I Believe this ah intellectually and imperial being periodically exciting paper must be published and congratulated the author on the resorts\nThis ah intellectually and imperial ... exciting paper must be published and congratulated the author on the research done\nAnd in the writer and in the right yeah yeah\nThat was that low to the most disturbing parts of this I feel like because the ... again it wasn't like these ... these journals looked at this and didn't really go through it and kind of just ... it made its way through the process they're very specific comments from dozens\nOf reviewers who are on the ... who are doing peer review insane specific things that you wrote that are completely ridiculous are amazing new accomplishments in the field I mean that had to be wild funny and it proved your point had to be really disturbing as well\nOh yeah that is by far what we consider to be the most important evidence that we gathered in the process of of this project that the papers it got published or that they got awards in some cases are one case and all of this it's fine and it says a lot and it's disturbing but the reviewers comments shows that they use\n... peer reviewers which it worked out between two and four or five or paper so we ended up with something like forty five or fifty total a set of comments they they really did engage with what we did they really looked at it they ... ...\nSet our analysis was good ones are analysis was terrible they\nDidn't raise an eyebrow about the data we gather the idea that um you know the dog park paper contains\nA bit of completely irrelevant evidence about dogs go to the bathroom in unauthorized ways as we did it and it's completely irrelevant to the paper but nobody raised an eyebrow about how ridiculous that is um they were concerned however that\nWe indicates that we're human not dogs so that we can be sure that we don't\nClaim that when a dog there was a ... ... thing of another dog whether or not the dogs they go home to want it or not because how could\nWe know that as being [noise] none of them and they were really concerned as I Hope everybody's seen in our little\nVideo we've put out to announce the project they're really concerned with the fact that we respect the dog's privacy and the process of inspecting their genitals um [laughter]\nAnd laid out under NATO [laughter] so what what specifically were they concerned about I mean the ... what I mean\nYou got me man\n[laughter] than it was done in the privacy of a of a veterinary office [laughter]\nOkay um let's see you did fat body building which quickly is what\nAre the the idea that what needs to be added to the professional sport a body building as a category in which fat is displayed politically\nSo that fat as just considered another to issue a equal with muscle and to say that that's not true is to be mean to fat people pat phobic as they call it\n[laughter] and that was accepted\nYeah that was accepted that was a pretty pretty exciting acceptance um\nEspecially because uh we actually had a real scholar who let us use his identity who wrote that who claimed growth that paper and he actually is a professional body builder\nOr Mr northern hemisphere in Nineteen Seventy eight or something that I mean this guy's Seventy years old and just stack and the picture in my mind to this guy being the author of this paper for fat body building was just kind of hilarious\nBecause that's another thing to a lot of these papers you had a completely fake organizations you had completely fake scholars coming from colleges that I think didn't exist in some cases\nA lot of these papers you had a completely fake organizations you had completely fake scholars coming from colleges that I think didn't exist in some cases I mean it some of this would have been easily just provide basic checking would it would it wouldn't have had\nI think so I mean those kind of a ... those are the tricky point I don't want to get too far into the into the weeds here but honestly scholarship should stand or fall on\nInterrupted to teach them what that feels like\nNone of that was questioned\n... if this were published and they were real if this were published what what would that mean to the university system would would what does that mean\nSo all events is a really complicated I'm there will be people who try to take this out in fact we got the idea from a news article about somebody at the University of Pennsylvania who was employing a similar but less extreme version of this\nIt is out in fact we got the idea from a news article about somebody at the University of Pennsylvania who was employing a similar but less extreme version of this in her classroom got in trouble for it a late last year so they decided it didn't come to us out of the vacuum this was actually something that people are attempting\nIn classrooms and so there would have been some some uh educators primarily working and social justice\nSide or the fields topics\nCourses I guess that's the best way to to say that but also probably into some of the general ed stuff would take up some degree of the suggestions as you know experimental but but we'll just have to use in the classroom and this was being submitted to\nThe gold standard journal this wasn't some fringe of journal and education this was the gold entered feminist philosophy journal hype Asia that we were working with here\nWhich is where a lot of the literature that like this already exist\nWhich you don't mind me going on a little bit this is kind of what's happening I'm\nWe think that what's happening here is kind of in the equivalent with ideas of money laundering called idea laundry oh so they take they take these these bad idea of some of which are just\nOpinion some of them are prejudiced some of them are genuinely terrifying like this educational thing and then they launder them through the academic process and they come out with the stamp of academic approval that makes them look like they're real knowledge\nSo you'll hear people say oh well there was a study or we've base this program on studies that show well that's fine when the studies are good but when the studies\nAre coming from a place they can't tell a truth from from prejudiced an opinion it becomes a real problem\nJames one or the other ones I found um disturbing or was the uh HBO age to ...\nTo was was accepted can you explain the explain this one\nYeah that paper was accepted by high pay showed the singer and I was just mentioning that patriot\nStood for hoax on hoaxes so it was a hoax paper we wrote that was about writing academic hoaxes just code namely gave for convenience\nWhat they argue is that you can\nOnly properly criticize things that go against social justice and in particular you can only use humor\nTo make fun of or or do satire to deflate that which goes against social justice if you use humor against social justice if you criticize social justice what that means as you never really properly engaged with it therefore we don't have to consider your criticism and that's one of the huge problems going on in this this set of of\nFields is that they don't accept criticism if you tried to criticize them they say that it's a privilege preserving epidemic pushback that a scholar named Allison Bailey huge huge\nIn the education literature they say it's white fragility that's Robin to Angelo who has just had a big book published on that this year introduced the concept in twenty eleven which says that if\nI'm somebody was privilege in particular white people for her work uh is challenged so that their privileges put in question that they are fragile and don't know how to deal with it because of privilege made them weak they don't know how to psychologically deal with having that challenge and they act out in anger or grief or something like that\nAnd trying to maintain the privilege and so\nThese ideas are already getting out there who just took him to step further\nAnd didn't you know it's interesting guy because the one about hopes as it is interesting in that if ... to criticize what you guys did\nYeah it's interesting guy because the one about hopes as it is interesting and that is to to criticize what you guys did they would almost half just cite your paper as that was\nThe idea yeah and it was definitely to put them in that position and I've asked\n... to stand by the paper that they accepted and publish in our right names they haven't responded yet but we'll see what they do I'm that way indeed people who want to criticize our project from a position of interest in all salmon has some will need to cite off in order to criticize us\n[laughter] I could we could one more to Glen ... on the you talked about this on the scary front at the feminist mine comp or\nWill you also did the white man my income for you to to one and this was accepted in the white man wasn't right\nCorrect Iraq tell me about them\nSo I'll do though the white one first because it didn't get in it was much more frightening it was written in from the position of an auto West Nile graffiti where the researcher is reflecting on an effort to states her own experience\nAs a white lesbian women coming to hate her own white mass and it was rejected partly because the scholarship wasn't quite er which is the case in all of the papers but also because the position to the author as a good white\nRather than being sufficiently ... or whatever to critical race ... ... so there was there was an explicitly political reasoning behind why it was\nWas rejected and it was that the the author as a white woman was trying to make herself look good by criticizing her own white was was one of the main reason the feminist one was\nWell hold on just a second hold on just saying that took mind the parts of mine Tom where he was talking about Jews and replace the words Jews with a with whites\nYeah in that case it was either whites are white and this and then we edited the text around it and added a whole a whole bunch of literature and rewarded things get passed plagiarism check and things like that so yeah that was a bit started with scanning through mine comp\nPicking out passages about the Jews and replacing Jews with whites are white ness\nShin than editing around it or the feminist one\nDidn't do it quite the same way the funnest one was not about it didn't take Jews out and replace it with with men for example it actually has the chapter in my income where Hitler explains the need for the Nazi Party\nIs chapter twelve and what its members would be expected to a whole to and including especially the sacrifices that they have to make it could be Nazis and we replaced\nOur movement party et cetera he doesn't mention Nazis specifically in that chapter or we replace that with intersection of feminism or solidarity or ally ... something to do with with the feminist movement and criticize the idea that\nA feminist do what they called choice feminism which is the idea that if a woman is living her own life the way she wants to and considers that to be a statement of feminism than she is doing feminism the salmon is for women to have you know full agency and make their own choices in the world that's what this paper was criticizing\nSaying that no no the responsibility if they really want to consider themselves feminists is to be to make sacrifices him stand in solidarity with other oppressed people particularly of you know women of color or women of other marginalized status is\nJames [noise] couple of quick questions um they\nThis had to be one of those things that you entered into and hoped that you were wrong and when they were accepted you had to sell them\nThis had to be one of those things that you entered into and hoped that you were wrong and when they were accepted you had to celebrate and then short time later going\nGood God this is bad am I right\nThat's exactly that is exactly right so especially the ... paper I think the one that got accepted um the idea there was that we were trying to it's very different from mine cost of course still I mean as you get it it's a one to one thing uh\nBut the ... the the politics of grievance through I really am glad I get to talk to you about that I can\nBecause all it takes the grievances everywhere and it's certainly being used in the academic left as we were trying to demonstrate we called the stuffed grievance east we see it everywhere right and I think this is why we're so divided\nA politically right now I was really happy to talk to you because I mean I don't want to get in touch with you but you're a real dude and that's why I wanted to talk to you thanks you know you had this whole May of ... about\nHow things were going for you under Obama's time and I thought that was huge and I was like you know this guy Glenn Beck is is is a bridge she's looking for reconciliation it's on your on your Twitter bio we need to be talking to each other again\nSo our project was you know or people on the left were left liberal ... I'm not ashamed to say that I Know you consider yourself a classical liberal and conservative on the right\nThat's great I'm we're on the left me to take responsibility for our own lunatics and so our project was kind of that you know we're left wing people who want the left to come back from the from the edge and we hope that you know the same things happening on the right and we can all START I think you know people\nIn general I get a lot of sense that people send me emails about this now all the time especially\nUm we're all kinds of sick of all this nonsense all the fighting all the polarization and we can't get anything done I think we want to get back to production politics and as long as we're relying heavily on this ... stuff which clearly the academic left is I think we see a lot of it coming out of the right wing media is here as well from my perspective\nThink as long as we're focusing on that we can't have productive conversations we can't\n... remember you know you are an American I'm an American you're a person I'm a person\nWe have ... most of the things that we think\nBig difference if one of the parents die\nAnd that does happen their wellbeing would be destroyed\nPaying for the mortgage utilities food and other bills would be impossible let alone saving for education or retirement that's why every day I talk relentlessly about getting term life insurance just go to ... or insurance dot com or called eight hundred three five six forty two eighty two and\nSee how inexpensive it really is the the family that takes those deliberate steps to be different and responsible it really does make you the hero of your story and it puts you on course for better things ahead\nIt's like having a Fox News right there in your dashboard ...\nSeven five and am twelve sixteen [noise]\nIs Fox on justice of criminal eager or a patriotic whistle blower the federal government charges a long time Treasury Department officials with passing along secret documents to a journalist\nAccording to prosecutors Natalie Edwards admitted that he leaked investigative reports some related to former Trump campaign officials Paul Manafort and Rick Gates and some about accused Russian spy Maria Butina\nLeaking of documents like these is against the law prosecutors say Edwards described yourself as a whistle blower trying to get the word out about wrongdoing\nMeantime a former FBI special agent with just sentenced to four years for leaking classified defense information attorney general Jeff Sessions says the Justice Department is conducting perhaps the most aggressive campaign against leaks in history but some journalism organizations are raising the alarm\nJeff Sessions says the Justice Department is conducting perhaps the most aggressive campaign against leaks in history but some journalism organizations are raising the alarm the head of the freedom of press foundation Trevor Tim says the crackdown on leaks is a danger do investigative reporting\nWith Fox on justice hang winds on Fox News [noise]\nI'm a chef\nJamie Lee Curtis is back is Laurie stroke [noise]\nIn Halloween strode comes to her final confrontation with Mike Myers the mass figure who has haunted her\nSince she narrowly escaped killing spree on Halloween Night for decades ago recently found delightful sign letter Melissa McCarthy stars in the story of the Israel and can you ever forgive me the film and limited release tells the tale of how\nThe failing celebrity biographer turns her art form into deception and it's a celebrity biographer start forging letters in order\nTo make\nOf limited release is Jonah Hill's love letter to his youth hill wrote and directed the film which how Stevie a Thirteen year old in nineties era LA expenses summer navigating between his troubles home life in a group of friends that he needs a motor evidence ... child that Fox on film on Fox News\nI'm pretty handy around the house but now that I have kids I don't want to spend my Saturday installing a toilet or fixing an air conditioner but thankfully\nThere is ... home advisor helped me find them back home pros in my area to handle any kind of project\nYou can read reviews approach check their bail ability even book appointments online and when my wife love most is that homo ... is completely free to use ... dot com or download the ... to get started [noise]\nStanding by their story I'm Pam Susannah Fox News as officials from around the world continue to doubt the narrative being told by Saudi Arabia about the killing of journalists ... inside the Saudi constantly in Istanbul, Turkey\nSaudi Arabia's foreign minister is defending the kingdom and do algebra ...

good thank you so much for taking my call sure what's up [noise]\nUm I'm calling because my husband and I just started I'm really getting serious about the debt snowball we have approximately Seventy thousand dollars in debt mainly from my student loans\nAnd um we have fifty six hundred dollars in savings and my question is um we have a baby coming\nAnd yeah yeah I Wonder if maybe to a um April nineteenth the duty right\nYeah they're excited so with that I was a ... going to use you know get the thousand\nDollar emergency fund and he was forty six hundred to pay off bills yeah but not with the baby\nI didn't ... that's what I was wondering what how we should kind of attack that\nWhat I Would suggest you do is push pause on the total moneymaker over okay and pile up cash\nAs big pile as you can file between now and the time but it becomes okay and um and then whatever you are piled up and and then when mommy and baby come home from the hospital in everybody's fine and I wrote that event\nUm and then whatever you are piled up and and then when mommy and baby come home from the hospital and everybody's fine in April that event is then behind us in any worries are threats or anything we would have had about that is behind us right\nYeah um well I mean there's the whole thing of raising the baby but I you know eight eight years yeah there is now but I but basically the you know we want to make sure labor and delivery and everything goes and we don't have any hiccups and when we got money okay so let's say you save up what what's your household income\nRight now it's about a Seventy seven thousand okay\nSo let's say you save up twenty five thousand dollars between now and then I use it in twenty four thousand after you come home from the hospital and push play on your total money make over\nAnd take your account down to a thousand dollars and throw it at the at a student loan you will of lost no ground okay unless you go baby spending crazy during the next few months\nWe had a lot of stuff like this is our second child ... you had a lot of stuff the only thing that would be a little bit different and if they gave me the boy 'cause I have a lot of girls close yeah\nThe day room she\nHopes the bones of Tripoli eight to five five two to five\nBrittany is with us in Johnson City Tennessee Hi Brittany how are you I'm good how are you have better than I deserve what's up\nOkay so my husband and I got a piece for our wedding and um we didn't get to the insurance part before we purchased our life insurance only got part permanent impart term and of course we watch the insurance part last night and we just got\nOn the insurance about a week ago so I take that our financial advisor and said we immediately wanted to get rid of the term or sorry the permanent and just have term\nAnd he said Dave Ramsey is talking about whole law permanent insurance not portfolio base permanent insurance which is what you have to do is it still bad shall we still just get those terms\nI don't know he doesn't know much about Dave Ramsey [laughter] because they Ramsey does not ever invest I'm real clear on the lesson you heard me yeah when you are never show you under any circumstances to huge life insurance and investment vehicle\nOne hundred percent of the time it sucks\nSo would you say because what we told him we wanted to do it\nWhy would you say you need a new financial advisor okay that's what I Would show you you don't have a financial advisor you have a life insurance salesman\nOkay showing you insurance\nSo what we were thinking we should do is switch to four hundred thousand just of term H. and then the money we were because it was like three hundred dollars a month which are a lot um and just go ahead and open up our Ross Ross are IRA and start getting money into that\nIn bed mutual funds okay it's exactly what you learn in class was uh\nYeah so you already knew what she said yeah he just language tells me one of those things either this guy's a lawyer or a big nerd\nRight [laughter] he's a family friend who's in the\nUm actually one of our friends this apparently gave them our number ... ladies and for as well\nYeah yeah okay so I I don't know which is I mean I don't know I don't know but but I Do know that I never in my life told someone to buy life insurance as an investment under any brand heading name or description ever\nRight and the last thing it on our term policy um on your class he said you know Twenty years Thirty years whatever was on ... and our term policy was until we were AB with hand\n[laughter]\nOkay why don't you jump on land or insurance dot com and see what you can buy a twenty year level curve balls you for I think it's going to blow your mind how much is guys over charge you for everything you soldier\nOkay [laughter] okay and you're probably going to end up just canceling everything with him so this kind of really needs a good firing\nSounds like well we're going to do\nYou know I've just canceling everything with him so this kind of really needs a good firing\nHey that sounds like well Oregon that down around and and then they\nAll right thank you for calling in and when you compare the prices you'll see what I'm Talking about and you understood the lesson when we were talking about using life insurance as an investment vehicle and the reason is folks for those of you that I haven't seen the financial ... never for some reason I heard a Ramsey talk about this\nCase someone else ever brings this up because it does come up periodically um the people who sell\nInvestment based or\nWhole life or permanent live or portfolio or universal or anything where there is an investment going into insurance are not happy with me they don't like me\nAnd so they generally try to ignore me or lie about me or something else because I pretty much cost them all a bunch of business\nBecause they sell crap rap in a bag that's what it is okay it's pretty simple so here's the thing\nWhen you use life insurance as an investment vehicle hey you get a bad right of return regardless of what they quote you after they take all of their fees which usually in the first two years is one hundred per cent\nSometimes up to forty years is one hundred percent of what should have gone to the investment goes out and fees even after that you're going to make three four five percent on your money and you should have been in a good mutual fund making ten eleven twelve percent on your money\nAnd that's where you should be when you die with cash value permanent portfolio universal\nIndexed universal life insurance they pay only the face amount of the policy not the extra money that you put into the investment that money is gone\nSo you have a savings account that for the first several years I keep all your money after that they give you a better rate of return and when you die they keep it all\nThis is a bad savings account it's bad investment broker the pay the the\nLife insurance products that give you the opportunity to pay twenty times more than you would pay for term insurance in order that you create an investment inside of the policy\nAre basically the payday lender the middle class their crap\nAnd that's what Dave Ramsey has always had for twenty five years here on the air upset it for twenty five years is alive owned myself I have never\nOwned while this show was operating any kind of whole life\nInvestment based life insurance of any kind\nEver not did get a horrible northwestern mutual whole life grotesque old school one of the worst of the worst of the whole lives when I was in my early twenties and it was the same way Brittany it was a guy my wife\nKnew from college came around selling right after we got married and we bought this crap from him\nI had it for about nine months until I finally sat down with some guys who unpacked the numbers for me and I about kicked my own but when I saw how bad it was and got rid of it and since then I have never owned it and since then I've never told\nMy own but when I saw how bad it was and got rid of it and since then I have never owned it and since then I've never told anyone to buy anything other than\nFifteen to twenty year term life insurance about ten to twelve times your income on you the\nBest way to buy life insurance is through a broker the shops several companies the best way to buy insurance if any connoisseur a broker the shops several companies and get you the best possible deal or that your car insurance your homeowner's insurance your long term care insurance your life insurance or insurance of any kind\nLetter broke her shop among several companies\nAnd get you the best kinds of deal and that's why we've endorsed for about Twenty years ... insurance\nJeff sander has become a personal friend of mine during that time and I buy my personal life insurance from slander and I don't own Zander insurance on around any of it that show that while this always told about me\nI Would I Would have a whole lot more money if I did um Zander insurance goes Jeff has done rather well due to the day Ramsey endorsement but the reason he done well is he he's got a very very good system for getting you the best possible price on term life insurance and it takes about like Thirteen seconds\nAnd they don't sell your name the list of people when you go on there either so that's why I've endorsed it's real simple it takes care of you guys you the listener and you need to get term life insurance has been cost that much\nSo just jump in there and do it so Brittany thank you for calling with that question given the opportunity to clarify on that yet again yet again yet again yet again yet again\nYes you need life insurance oh by the way a broker you know like even with your car insurance jump on the air with ... with the help they usually indoors local providers for your ... what we called PNC property and casual you got your car and your homeowner's insurance\nYou can shop most people saved three to eight hundred dollars a year on their car and homeowners when you're shopping among several companies instead of using what we call a captive agent in the business a captive agent can sell for one company like a state for a major foreign nation wide in Asia\nOr Peyton Manning and Brad Paisley can sing to you agent\nWas it nationwide that's nationwide and you know but um and they're both good guys I like both of them there's nothing to do with that but you're paying for those guys when you when you use that insurance it's ... it's built in and neither one of those guys worked cheap I'll just tell you\nThis is the day Ramsey show [noise]\nIs one of my favorite times of year the kids in school football season is here and people everywhere are preparing for their new routines well while you're in preparation mode think about this when was the last time you checked on your financial plant\nHundred three three oh fourteen thirty four or visit TLC vision dot\nCom today individual results may vary\nJulian to you as much as you are tuned into us I'm at work I can put my headphones in ... we have oh I mean\nBy twelve sixty WC age me\nFrom the running of the Hollywood casino or a hundred and this is that's how I live right today they turn number or Kevin Harvey he's got to Carly some aren't sure\nTo ... and Kim [noise] life was certainly a highway rational wife Kevin Hart victories Kansas Speedway\nAs a highway he's got two victories here including that when you heard on our rejoin there but let's that down to the starting right now and meet some of the drivers in today's field Winston Kelly is standing by with a man who really gets around this track very well in addition to Kevin ...\nYeah he's got the best view of the house when we have the green black we're talking about joining the God of the last ten times we've been here seven of them top five finishes not just stopped in top five couple of wins\nBut it's all about today how good is this race car to be able to take it a victory later at a minimum be able to advance so that next round\nWin a championship right so we've got to be smart on how we get through this but I Do feel that they could possibly win I'm definitely a top five car a feel good about that and um you know which decided scores many states wants to start and then we can be really got at the other thing we see some\nIt's definitely a top five car a I feel good about that and I'm just trying to score as many states wants to start and then we can be really aggressive at the other thing\nWe see so many different lines run around his race track is there one in particular that has worked for you this weekend\nI think the majority of cars are going to migrate to the top of the racetrack the cars that can stay LAN down longer going to be the ones that are a little bit better um I don't think there's any cars that can be down a lane and says that much but I look for is very shut to go through a couple of swing says the\nSummer gets lay down and so she's Seventy cars are running the top of really a river up there and you see the second plane kind of come back to life so it'd be an interesting little right to to watch but um I've got a car that can do a little bit of both so uh\nHopefully it maintains that throughout the day and at the end of the day we can have the show puzzle for virtually\nScored his first poll of the year so you get that the all important first pitfall is well Jonah gonna set to go this afternoon a two time winner here at Kansas\nAnd starting alongside jelly on the front row is Kevin how big the one here in the spring but let's find out how we get another chance is here this afternoon he's alongside our Alex hey\nWell three times the winner here you're cleaning the one you mentioned Kim so Kevin Harvard qualified in the second spot you got the bright blue Bush colors ready to go today\nKevin this racetrack we've seen in practice we've seen over the last half full of races here\nIf you can hold the bottom you're in a lot better shape than having to go to the top early how was the race card set up for this weekend\nI haven't really ran anywhere around the top I figure if we have to do that we can but you know we've we've done everything from the middle down trying to get our card\nTurning as good as we can and still have had group I bought the corner so hopefully hopefully as good today and our Bush like Ford was a good and practice and hopefully it stays that way today\nCertainly breezy here in Kansas and that's not a surprise to anybody but how much does that move things around when you're in the race card can you really feel the way that all you can\nDefinitely build a limb here the hard the hard part about today is the opposite one hundred eighty degrees opposite direction from what it was yesterday so it'll be interesting to see where the balance goes out of the race car\nAnd what that does to the car going into turned three\nKevin ... like he's ready to go try to get when number four here it can't just speedway you'll start on the outside of the front row\nRight thank you Alex you know two of the last three playoff races were one on last lap past Steve Post is standing by with a guy who did just that if the rover\nUh yeah the drivers are getting introduced down here as far as I'm meeting the meeting the fans here along the way our Bowman getting ready to roll into a civil Dutch word with Alan Shepard jumped through her does Alex a lot of work through here today um how was the ...\nI think we're pretty decent um\nWell I have to wait and see a ... it's the weather is a little different and I'm obviously changes from practiced for the race but I think there's like ten of us that can go to the same speed up against the wall and um it can be super hard to pass\nFeel like some guys can run the middle and the the bottom longer than we can which is that something we need to work on but a ... and all the guys worked really hard and we've had a decent ...\nVision Carlos what a nice new run when this one that's Alex Bowman starts on the spot one's been telling us\nWell let's go over here and talk to Ryan blaming another one of the guys who are trying to raise this way and he's twenty two points out talking to his buddy\nUh Darryl bubble Wallace and Ron we hear when we talk to the guys in the garage Jerry we hear a number of different numbers several times the twelve is one that comes up from time to time how confident are you in this race car to be able to raise your way into the next round of layoffs\nYou know you like to have confidence that we've shown pretty decent speed really we we always show just be wherever we come here and I'm just a matter of China sees every\nEvery opportunity possible and um we've had really good ones here in the past in the first race here this year we were really fast and just didn't get the\nEvery opportunity possible and um we've had really good ones here in the past in the first race here this year we were really fast and just didn't get the job done so hopefully we can better or or a woman from last year or were strays and\nThe best way to transfer to win the race so uh we'll try to and then there's a couple of really fast cars but\nI think the best we can do is just try to put ourselves in his boss to\nCapitalize on some hair throughout the race at the end of the race and\nUh we'll just see what we can do but it's still to have wrangler with us that that's a really cool to see them back in the sport hopefully we can have a good run for them to a\nLittle different paints game with a red colors for wrangler this afternoon the rolls off for ...\nKurt Busch will start today in the eleventh ... plus thirty on the point spread but courting you guys have that good speed in race car here as of late momentum oh you're a big believer in that when it comes to racing momentum\nI Am when you have that plan going in and as far as the sequence of practice sessions and qualifying and how it all works out yeah\nI don't know sometimes luck that happens in the race that you don't expect and you end up with a really good finish and understands when things go against you and you just have to keep on trucking along so I feel like our team is doing really well I'm In the number forty one for\nEvery week with Billy Scott and her lead engineer the car as speed and now is that a good game plan forbid strategy so I was just up to me to go out there do my job and get a you know track position good good restarted in Arabic crew do their job if we do all that boom right there in the top I\nLook for them to be at the top five and perhaps in victory late at the end of the day to day Kurt Busch

that's a really big like I Know it was I got talking about how 'bout how 'bout you talk too much\nTime day or not Steve yeah I I think as far as how we approach it it it said what the answer is that we just got there and when everything takes care of itself and that's that's the the\nYou know the the beauty of this kind of format so I that's what we need to focus on is how to go out there and when and what that is going to take how good as the car [noise] pretty good this is probably one of the guards with that amount of ... this year in a way you can make that stick\nWell scored a mile

Twenty one points to the good that's a good question but done nothing to say when you come to this final transfer race how good is this race car and how do you approach today's race to the really important is being an Martin's what were you one earlier this year being in the next round\nYeah obviously for ourselves a little bit of insurance wasn't full coverage by any means last week we had a little bit of insurance on her car just got to take care of business you know the end of the day and we go out and do our jobs and execute the way we're capable of doing will be just fine I'm no

selfish reasons but\nYou know you got to manage today you got to keep it in check in in um you know the emotions and everything that comes with race in a home and just just got to go out and execute in and take care of business I really feel\nLike this is the track for us you know what I mean this is the one that we got to get through we got to get over this\nTurtle here because they are becoming raises a had a really good racetrack for me over the years and then I feel like that without a capital pulled us in a maybe a chance for a championship but it all comes with a good day here\nAnd the
