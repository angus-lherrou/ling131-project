they're just going about their lives which is kind of how I Want to be I Want my life to become a but it was interesting watching it in that\nI've never seen anything like that no this is the people who are speaking with certainty about this ... it's incredible yes she has provided no evidence whatsoever that this event has occurred\nThe standard instead of being innocent until proven guilty or innocent to the preponderance of evidence shows otherwise\nIt has become innocent until proven accused\n... we now know that she's accused this but Kavanaugh so therefore he's guilty or not a healthy standard for society and how any woman I'm a or leftist who has a son\nCould possibly support this standard because this is not just evil Republican judges that have to deal with this for the rest of their lives but it is your kid your kid if they go to a party in college\nThirty forty years later when they're advancing through their career can be accused of this with absolutely no evidence\nAnd society is deciding yes we should just believe her there's not even there's not even a five percent chance that you show like it that we're at the point now where what we're requiring in the FBI investigation whatever it is\nWell it's very easy once you're away from it emotionally and you actually look into it it's easy\nWhat was happening was African Americans were feeling that there was no justice in America it's always the black guy that gets blamed and then he goes to court and the white system puts them behind bars and so they weren't rooting for him\nThey wanted anyone to beat the system they wanted anyone to prove that a black guy who ... who could go to court and\nNot be guilty that's what they wanted they wanted a victory against the system totally understandable\nUs the African American community now same people did OJ Simpson do it yes we're all in agreement now now the the emotions are gone we're all in agreement that OJ Simpson was guilty\nSo the question is was justice done the answer is clear no it's not justice that's\nSocial justice that I Want to feel good that social justice not real justice social justice is evil when it is when it is\nPlayed the way the post modernist and the progressive or playing it now\nIt does not provide any kind of real justice that woman who was in the elevator her plight I'm sure was real I Know I could tell her feelings were real\nAnd I feel sorry for and I don't know what happened in her case I don't even know if it happened here in America or where it happened\nBut I Will tell you this in the case of Ford we cannot\nHelp as a society if you don't ask for help if you don't ask anyone in your circle of friends for help we can help you later especially thirty five years later we can't help you know I'm I'm shocked\nOh we can't help you later especially thirty five years later we can't help you\nKnow I'm I'm shocked that someone could be as traumatized as Dr Ford was and no one in her circle of friends in high school let's say she was a sophomore in high school\nWell no she can be a sophomore could she could she be a sophomore she have to be a freshman or a junior I'm trying to figure out when Kavanaugh is a Yale and they're both still in school but let's just say it was sophomore year she did this happen to her\nThis happens to her are you telling me that there is no one in her life no one her mother her sister her best friend\nThat wasn't told but now when told doesn't go oh my\nGosh I remember yes it was that summer and all of a sudden you didn't want to go to any parties anymore would you go to a party if you experienced what she experienced would you want to be by yourself at a party\nWould you change fundamentally at parties enough for your best friend to at least now be able to go I remember that you were really weird that summer\nThat didn't happen that didn't happen\nNobody remembers anything she doesn't remember the year that had happened and as the investigator has pointed out she's changed this now four or five times\n\nWe can help you you have to tell someone you have to tell the police we are not as a country of the Nineteen forties we [laughter] I Want to make sure that nobody goes to jail that is innocent\nBut you know what that requires not social justice not believing the accuser but looking at the facts you say you're for prison reform and at the same time\nYou will not look at facts you only want to do with the mob mentality you only want to do with what is politically correct and deliver social justice\nYou say you're against uh putting innocent people behind bars and that our justice system is so corrupt that it is put black man behind bars because of white society look at what your doing right now\nAnd if you were honest about the way you actually feel think of the the construct that is built by the left all police are really bad people that are going to a throat innocent black people in jail\nOr they're white people are racist against black people\nHow would how would let's say real racist cops and racist women a deal with an African American who they say has assaulted them in the past\nThink of the standard you're creating black people have been victims of this in the past where they were a unfairly accused of crimes I mean you can go back to Emmett Till right like you can go back there's a lot of these things that have happened over the years you were asking for that standard to return\nHow are you going to react when a black man is is accused unfairly about some assault they didn't commit are you going to believe the white woman then\nI I did standard they are creating is insane and I feel for the woman in the elevator you can tell she passion I don't know if it's about politics or not I don't know her story federal one thing I Do know about her story is Brett Kavanaugh wasn't responsible for it\nHe had no role in what happened to her no no ... no ...\nMove the goalposts they're using these seven days to come up with something new to move the goalpost she lied about you know how much he drank no she said oh my gosh\nRight there and now they're saying well yes you gave us the FBI investigation but it's not through enough it's not enough time the only thing here is there delay tactics and that how you can tell that this and I think we're up and I'll be honest enough to understand\nIf Kavanaugh let's just say politics failing and flaking Collins and Murkowski bail and the the vote comes down and he gets voted down\nThere won't be a soul who gives a crap about this woman story\nThey will all do they will not even she will not get a phone call returned 'cause you can still investigate this by the way\nThere is no there's no statute of limitations on felony sexual assault in Maryland they could still go after this the second Kavanaugh is not in that seat they will forget about her and she will be a non story because they don't care about her story has nothing to do that they're just trying to play this to try to get a pass the electorate\nNow here's the here's this the second point I Want to make 'em Republicans\nIf this fall through and the very next day you don't have a qualified candidate that your going to put through\nYou're out of your mind may I suggest right now that if Kavanaugh falls through\nYou don't have the spine something comes up whatever there is one guy that has already gone through all of the confirmation hearings one guy who is already at every FBI background check one\nGuy that everybody in the Senate knows and that's Mike Lee\nIf Kavanaugh goes down in flames Monday morning or Saturday\nThe president should announce his next Supreme Court justice pick of my ... and you should vote on it next week because there's no need to delay he's already had all those FBI background checks and each senator knows exactly\nWho he is he's qualified jeeze clean\nAnd quick you could get that done long before the election if I hear the ... the Republicans have this fall through the whole we're prepared we weren't prepared for the I'm going to lose my mind [noise]\nSo that I won't bring up a story about what their plan is after oh geez what

you to ask your friends that\nWelcome to the program [noise] okay here's the one question that I Want to ask every single person in this audience\nI Want you to ask your friends this let's\nImagine for a second that every single person that you want elected from from dog catcher to present in the United states that every person you want elected is elected\nAnd they are putting in all of the policies that you want it's it's your utopia\nThere remains about fifty percent of the country and I'm going to be really generous I going to make it a lot easier there's\nThirty or forty percent of the country that disagrees with your utopia they just want to go in a different direction what do you do with the forty percent of the population that does not agree with you\nWhat do you do with them\nWhat do you do to make sure that those people don't start infecting the minds of others\nSo your perfect utopia starts to fall apart\nWhat happens with the ones who won't comply with these new rules what do you do to make sure that that utopia it remains in place by keeping all of those people in power because there's going to be another election\nAnd if if history tells us anything it swings the other direction what once you have the power what are you willing to do to keep the power\nIf your answer to all of those questions isn't nothing you have gone over the cliff\nBecause in America the answer to what are you going to do to all of those people who disagree the answer in America is nothing what are you willing to do to keep your power or the answer in America is nothing\nWhat do you do to to silence those who will not comply the answer in America is nothing\n\nSo any time somebody says we should shout these people down they've taken the first step all thought is creative\n\nWhen you begin to speak things they you speak them into existence\nWhen you say we shouldn't round people up the more people that say we should round people up we shouldn't disturb them in their own homes we should we should picket and surround their houses the more that you say that the more reality is created in that direction\n\nBe very careful on what you say and what you think\n\nThe answer to these questions in America must remain\nNothing\nI Will not do anything to my neighbor who disagrees to me with me I Will not do anything and everything to hold on to power\n\nProbably in the world and beating beautiful women and I'm Seventeen thinking my God it's going to be great and I walk out with all of that go army stuff in my arms and the book covers and still in high school at the time\nHe said and as I'm walking out the marine corps workers there that's arms folded and he says a song and I talk to you\nThat you're going side he goes an army guy he promised you a lot didn't ... I said yes I Am going to be a general and like one of the world's\nGoing to be amazing the beautiful women and get a doctorate degree in three days can be awesome and he says yeah we call that the solar plan everything under the sun\nHe goes you know what am I promise you I said what\nHe said for ... years are you ready I said yes and I signed up\nWhen I look back at that and then I didn't know what I was doing what I'm saying I was just reacting but when I look back at that I Know I was desperately seek seeking positive male role models I didn't have and wrinkled gave me many of them and that was a great thing and that the marine corps the military's not everybody and not much to join\nBut for me it really helped me tremendously and I said all the time without the marine corps I Would have been a punk because\nOf everybody and not much to join but for me it really helped me tremendously and I said all the time without the marine corps I Would have been a punk because I was lost at Seventeen completely lost in the marine corps helped me tremendously\nAnd when I got an a Marine Corps about seven years later [noise] um my mom had really gone into a very bad place um she couldn't handle me leaving she couldn't handle my father's death and she was addicted first illegal drugs and eventually illegal drugs and and she was a victim of the drug war and she was a convicted felon so I pulled her out of prison\nAnd I used my whatever things that had to try to get her back up and running a reading her an apartment in the house that I mean I'm I'm a car that kind of thing and she struggled and if you if you've had a felon in your life and you know hard it can be right they have that on the record and then they feel less then and then when\nThey get a job there are a hostage to that job because they're afraid to do the job for them and it's just bad bad bad so I said you know what\nI'm going to do something I've been taken actually my whole life and take action now too and we decided to start our own business I figured if we're in charge him with a ball says you can't fire her such so we started on ... became trucker so became we had a small trucking company\nWho what did you know about but what did you know about business nothing [laughter] didn't matter God Bless America would it matter what it was with what I have a\nChoice I allow my mother to be hostage or I Do something I was my option go to business school when I when I was when I Do\nKnow right eye ...\nEye drops I don't I never I\nNever happened never will ever measure any plan I have against perfection because perfection doesn't work I measure my plan against status quo because that has caused what I have status quo was my mother as a hostage I don't accept status quo so it was our business\nIs well I my my um it did well I actually left it let ... let her and my step dad run it and she ran until she retired\nAnd when she retired she did what too many New Yorkers do and that is leaving New York state and she went to South Carolina to retire um so she did that in ... and she was fine until she passed away several years ago but after that that's when I went off and did you I don't think I had made a different jobs\nAnd then decided you know what the first visible successful let me try another one so I started my second business and that's when I actually uh that when I did not do well and that's why I say we're not that's when I first heard you back when you want your Philly station I'm In the morning show\nOut of here yes that's when I first heard you doing your ah your jokes\nUm about an hour and a stand [laughter] I remember I remember I was I was I was driving around and and I was actually listen to you I think ten am is that right yeah yeah I think so yeah I Am yes\nYou and your your morning show I remember listening to back then\nUm then I did that and I sold that business off it and not do as well as I wanted to be to do but I was called that my MBA that failure was my MBA I'm from that I didn't have one more job and\nThen started this job now that this is now that I have which I'm a trainer consultant teacher\nSo I have large clients like a ... and I say laughter and smaller clients like small law firms I teach um leadership and executive coach at each business I've been an executive in a public company twice as a a band aid\nAnd I've talked to many colleges that Bruce St John J. and I've taught as a guest instructor at the graduate level about Yale and Colombia\nAnd now what have you done with your life seriously I Want to be I'm a loser I'm Sorry I'm yeah holy has ... oh you are a guy that\nTo me seems tailor made for the times that we live in I I mean I think Morocco bomber\nWas also in in some ways tailor made for the times that we live in and I don't think he lived up to his potential um the the more division happened um we we need somebody that can speak to all sides with a with credibility somebody who can speak to\nMore division happened um we we need somebody that can speak to all sides with ah with credibility somebody who can speak to prison reform with credibility and not an axe to grind but common sense and experience\nYes I mean this is the thing that I talk about all the time you know I've dealt with and seeing the prison system from both\nYou know both sides my father's Russia's awesome my mother as as a felon and I say the same thing as I say in business and that is when you want to fix something you don't walk in and start dictating when you do that you get rebellion when you do that people say no the issue that we have particularly in New York state but throughout the country is\nWe have to start a two sided thinking right as you said before a binary I either every corrections officers a thug and every single person there is a victim or every prisoner is evil and she'd be killed and every corrections officer is perfect\nAnd neither is true the reality of it is to fix this is the situation in prison we have to have the corrections officers as part of the solution\nThat's hard for people to understand because they think they're part of system yes but they see people every day what I Know for sure in prison right now\nWe have people in jail who should probably never get out ever what bad people she never got out and there are people who made a mistake should pay that at the society and should then get a second chance and people will probably shouldn't be in jail at all\nThe issue is I don't know which one is which I never will but you know who does\nCorrections officers who deal with them every day\nThose are the people who deal with the inmates everyday\nHow do I know that to be true you look at Massachusetts right now they have the Humvee program which is a program that has CEOs corrections officers and volunteers from outside together with a specific community in this case the communities veterans but you can pick any community the community that the seals knowing that they see in prison everyday\nYou make that happen over something happens you know if people who've had that problem coming as volunteers nurse or tax money you also have corrections officers who know how to control people know which people who can get in there no those who will be scanning and will now feed those who are scanning and we'll put the people who need to have the right\nThe right to the second chat out there in his program how do we know that there were a citizen right in Massachusetts in general is about Seventy five percent when this program less than five percent holy no yes no\nNo specialized people coming in\nCorrections officer and doing here's the problem in New York say specifically for corrections officers ... the the ... the life expectancy is fifty eight years that's ... years old not just that every corrections officer I've met either know someone who's committed suicide\nAnd or a knows someone who is so ready to leave they had become completely opposite to assist them this is a problem\nAll the time the same thing Larry you know I'm\nI'm already there their therapist I'm already there that marriage callous I'm already they're legal assistant already help them out with all kinds of things I'm already trying to help them\nThere are so many CEOs who would happily ship into this world without having to change any ... ad in the body by giving them an actual contract they haven't had a contract in three years in the upstate that's how bad it is so we could actually fix things this is repair trouble if we actually use both sides and\nGo in and asked the people who are there how to fix it that's how you are in the business that's how you fix it in life\n... do you have time can I hold you for a while 'cause ... sure okay

sixteen years give or take\nSo if they were going to fix this state they would have already fixed it the Republicans they've been watching this for sixteen years so my question to any Republican is

totally completely broken we drop twenty two thousand dollars per kid and that basket mediocre results\nAnd the first thing is ending standardized testing until high school no satellite that's going to always go satellites testing is unfair way way upgrading teachers and unfair way of rewarding schools it makes kids who are ten eleven twelve who don't test will feel stupid equate to second class at students\nIn elementary school that's embarrassingly bad at it is absolutely no indication success in life for the future that has to go away but when that goes away a couple of things happen in New York state Common Core will go away good I don't have a problem that in common core go away I'm the only guy who says let teachers teach and\nThen does not administrators\nThe only that's my goal is to remove administrators to allow teachers to actually teach we have school districts in New York state where there are more diminished rather than teachers that's embarrassing so once we do that we'll find all of a sudden I be able to get rid of a lot of administrators an average teacher in New York state makes about eighty K.\nThe average administration makes over six figures you get rid of two administrators that's either two new teachers or raises Omar quitting and at what point earlier I don't decide what that is the school district does they know what they need and they can repair

unions are literally in the Fourth Amendment they are free speech sure are sort of association yo yo yo ... as long as they're not forced to join another problem at all the ... members loved me so that's why teachers always behind\nMe and I'm but I was asking you about the unions are in such control but you're paying the state is paying for teachers that have that have abused children and yet they are sitting in rubber rooms\nAnd that's my point once once most of that is happening because of both Albany and D.C control and Albany and D.C money\nFrom DC we get about four billion dollars every year and that controls a lot when that money begins to go away number one that will help but second thing is I'm not beholden to union leadership if they get mad at me\nTrolls a lot when that
