E. C. K. or with your comments or questions and maybe you have some questions like we do all this Saudi Arabia and killing I you know I don't know why we haven't Newt Riyadh yet I don't know why\nI mean a journalist was killed yeah uh that much we kinda do so usually when that happens we've destroyed the country by now usually what you do write new just willy nilly start launching missiles\nThat I I Love I Love the way the media reacts of the stuff the criticism the main criticism of Donald Trump since he's been in the public eye in politics is that he react reacts to quickly\nJumps up he just jumps into everything and he's he's constantly he's a he's a loose cannon he might knew everybody out that he knew every Friday [laughter] actually trying to gather facts yeah would you do\nI mean look it to me it sure looks\nLike something really had to leave at ... bad but again all of this\nComes from Turkish sources Turkish sources with incentives to make Saudi Arabia look as bad as possible so until we actually have the evidence or at least our intelligence services have the evidence it's hard to jump to a conclusion and do anything drastic\nAnd the criticism that it's coming a Trump is he saying well look we need a we've asked for the video we've asked for the audio that supposedly exist that's been described media reports but we don't have it yeah mhm uh we've tried we've talked to them about it we we were investigating we we sent my palm pay over there to talk to them about it\nI mean you ... I think the same people who we heard for years and years and years and years we did not do enough research to figure out if there was weapons of mass destruction in Iraq and in doing Donald Trump by the way who was who was leading ... at the time or or at least commenting publicly there are a lot on\nThat now we're hearing from the same media people that we should be jumping immediately to we absolutely know it happened and how can we haven't punish Saudi Arabia yet yeah\nI think that that's been the transformation of of the news is that everything now is seen through a Trump prism and clearly the you know the Saudis\nYour abs yeah and I think that that's been the transformation of of the news is that everything now is seen through a Trump prism\nAnd clearly you know the Saudi Arabian explanations have been suspect there's first of all they didn't know anything about it at first ... while he was gone he left a we we don't know where he went hoops while we never saw him leave out the front door or do you have another yeah he went out the back window\nAnd now there's a lot at stake here a lot at stake I mean if you if you just start willy nilly throwing on sanctions on Saudi Arabia they are going to retaliate\nAnd if it's going to cost a not us as much but the rest of the world is going to suffer in oil that's what they've already threatened or I go ahead and punish us and we'll cut off your oil supply well I think we get scanned little from them but other people get a lot Europe gets a lot of oil from Saudi Arabia\nSo yeah you want to make sure you got all your\nUh T's crossed in eyes dotted before you take any severe action I Would\nThink now and look as a global market anyway yeah so it it it all affects ah each part of it affects the other parts

... we're supposed to CNN and the it's been the named first name a news right I mean this is the big the big one right mhm then I heard\nThis show ... ... show or no ... ... ... yes cause\nShow he is the one that I think is I thought was like the main that's what I thought I thought that we've been hearing\nThat name since the eighties with al ... who was a big arms dealer yeah and he was in the he was mentioned in the Iran Contra hearings ... this is the name as ... that it was ... yeah that doesn't that's not a determining factor any more like if you\nCall it Copenhagen for five hundred years it just turns to Copenhagen one day I just started saying Copenhagen it's ... it's guitar it's guitar nope it's cut her and that was good or for a while I remember the better for a while yeah uh I don't know I'd like you I don't know how this happened Osama bin Laden than it was some uh bin Laden [noise]\nIt was a al ... al ... al\n... it was ... Q. U. I. D. A. and Q A ETA all different spellings I don't understand it so I heard ... ... ... he initially they could show ... uh and now on the way and today I heard in New York Times a person\nCould show gee are you really show gee\nIt's a whole new one and now we're like a week into the store and there's already three different pronunciations this guy's name ... can we on something\nI Would we want to call them Bob I find with that you would have I mean what does what they've Jamal I'm fine how I'm doing all which I'm all was killed at the embassy we ought to say it it was ... and what is all know Jamal\n... ... or ... ... and then whatever the pronunciation is\nTomorrow but you're right we got to get together on that because that drives me out of my mind is irritated yeah it is\n[noise] it it is I I I never understood ... Osama thing how did that happen why why did that happen in less ah explore couple\nRight the here you have a situation where it is the name is spelled the same but were pronouncing it different at least you can understand that Osama went to Osama they shouldn't be the letter and they just said no no no no it's it's a you know like I went from like mid range pay in kick ball to last pick\nI like what what has happened you ... the guy is dead\nAnd you don't mind it you know no one ever said you know Osama is wrong\nYou're endangering the ... the guy is dead and you don't mind it you know no one ever said you know Osama's wrong it's it should be Usama Osama lie no no it just started that people just started\nUsing it very strange but it is very strange uh it and like some of it I I get to understand like for example a here we say the tiny little country that James Bond goes to the casino with Monica right mhm and if you're over there they call it ...\nReally ... I've never heard that I must say here's another one year we say monster with a car ... if you live in a as a as a Canadian sports celebrity I Do quite often to Toronto blue jays games on the radio they think that yeah it\n... into that ... that really irritates me I wouldn't answer to that I Would say I mean once you get off of you out that you don't call it that that what you had a we are also noticed the jaguars are being called jak you what do you are ... and ... you are what like they like if you come up\nWith a name on your own meat you can describe to us what how how it's pronounced\nBut what is the word we already know and they were a hundred years but we eat an animal yeah and then just a car it's an animal to right now what do you ever said Jay you are the Jacksonville Jaguars or no I think that yeah I think that's jak you\nAre trying to seem refined right like this like if there's something nothing a little snooty about the way they pronounce mhm er jaguars like at the stupid animal over they're ripping up my dog and they do on earth\nThat yeah so it's a it's a unique circumstance that perhaps your lessons don't apply to [laughter] so silly so weird I even get yourself so worked up about that I Know what I Hope happens every day it every day when she brings breakfast to them they asked her well where did this come from\nMoney [laughter] they just torture her within the rest of her life [laughter] 'cause I mean you can I can understand this you know sometimes\nI I think even you know we like conservatives get made fun of when they do these types of things are like when you watch uh you know that there's a there's one cartoon the kids were watching at one point that was and it was just it was just like a nonstop commercial for recycling\nAnd it was like I was a captain planet or whatever do that that is an actual that one is actually a legitimate effort to change kids' minds about environmental is emitted yeah they you know people who created it actually talked about that\nBut I don't know what this what we might have been type of pig or something it's usually type of thing I like to pick a lot a and a pet but it was talking about you know recycling or something I don't know how important it wasn't that recycling whatever like I don't have any\nPassion for recycling I think there's some some ah there's some conflicting evidence as to what it does a there's\nBeen several studies that have shown not much not much if any clearly you work for Al Gore apparently not know but uh I don't know I Do I really need a giant a commercial about environmental is among his programming I I feel like no no but I mean he also can get a little bit worked up about that stuff\nYou know I mean you can get a little a little fire it up with trying to find the political messages and these things even if they're I mean kids\nGrow up into you know adult second thing for themselves\nAnd you know you kinda have to at some point\nI realize that you're not going to be able to control every little bit of that you can just you can do your best and I guess with her values probably the most important thing is to point out I mean she's probably doing you know a very worried about uh you know she thinks Brett Kavanaugh's are everywhere and and at any point they're going to be an assault going on and\nYou know what I mean maybe this is this is consistent with what she wants to pass along to me it's just it's a whole lot of it is and I remember when people are concerned conservatives were concerned mostly uh about some of these Disney movies because of the things that they put in the Disney movie like\nI'm In the is it the rescuers are the rescuers down under one of those uh there's a scene where the character is going down a street on I don't know some type of vehicle and there's a woman a on the ... in one of the buildings they passed that naked\nFor justice splits I remember hearing that yea so conservatives who would talk about that and it would be oh stop it you can't even see that that's a it's a blue mental you don't even know it's there and then there was the lion king a scene where\nA simple as as a grown lion\nHow to plop down on the side of a cliff and the dust shoots up informs the word sex\nHow to plop down on the side of a cliff and the dust shoots up informs the word sex\nIf you ...

I mean I Love that movie but the scene where they're just going through the tunnel and in all of a sudden like in really quick like subliminal things you see like a chicken get his head cut off\n[laughter] why isn't this children's movie it's terrifying that whole scene is terrifying\nI like I don't remember that yeah oh my God like they go through the tunnel and it's like really like psychedelic weird and like it's that I remember that being yeah ... closed at what's going on in there it's not good [laughter] I'm really sorry she gets his head cut off yeah like there's like a clear up\nOf this is why I'm bringing up and it can be think I don't know I think it's both set the scene is supposed to set the like off putting\nA like if it's supposed to give you an off putting feels like it's supposed to be like things are all everything's twisting around and like it's dimensions are almost changing and like all these strange things are happening and you see like the scary or what was the guy's name or with the with the ever left alas he wanted the everlasting God stepper and he kept harassing the poor kid in for it and\nThen he worked for the walk at the ... I don't remember a cat I Want to say Woodward but that's about ...\nI got a lot of things messing up my mind and then he's going through and it's supposed to even that weird\nLike you're almost dizzy feeling yeah and they flash like a bunch of really fast images of more like they're just cutting a chicken head off in the very strange very strange yeah so we've been tortured with this stuff for a long time and look how well we turned out the world's fine right everything's going really well\nFor a while you can see how there'd be any downside [laughter] [laughter] I I guess you can get to that\nPoint where your over your over parenting\nRight oh definitely and that's certainly are to be the way uh you know that things are going now ... years um we recently started a letting our son ... cause I listen to ... a lot she's been on the show before she started an organization called\nLet grow and a\nFree range kids and basically her mission in life is to make kids do some things like you don't need to helicopter parent over them all the time she's famous for ah she lived in New York still doesn't believe and she let her nine year old go on the New York city subway system by himself\nAnd she was called the worst parent in America and Europe ... honestly my immediate reaction when I read that story initially was she the worst parents in America right like your ... year old on the subway by themselves\nLike I Can't even imagine the amount of panic I Would have\nBut they ... you can do it I don't think I could do it either um what'd you step back and you say well wait a minute like George Washington was like I think he won the revolutionary war eight years old or something like this isn't the movie the we went through a long period of time where people were\nAre supposed to be as kids are much more self sufficient you know I Know when I was a kid like we would leave the house and we would go play at a friend's houses the all the time the time will be calling the whole day yeah and that whole thing about us coming back\nAnd um you know you come back when it gets dark or when the streetlights come on ... and I think it's\n... we use that a lot of times to signify things were safer and better than what's not even true I grew up in uh\nAnd I like it ... we use that a lot of times to signify things were safer and better than what's not even true I grew up in the nineties this is like in the eighties and nineties more the eighties but Miller object iris in America by far\nAnd dangerous than now this is a much ... I mean the crime rates were higher\nAh murders were higher kidnapping for higher everything was worse school shootings were at a rate of four times what they are now when I was in high school and I didn't have a minute of panic over school shooting in my entire life\nI think we get to that point where we are just we get so freaked out we recently had our you know we have her son like walking walking her dog with a little shore and he's doing it by himself\nOr just up the street a little bit and back and I can tell you just that\nFreaks me out like I can and everything in me not to walk to the end of my driveway and spy on them to make sure he's okay the entire time and I don't know why that is that certainly is and how it was when I was a kid yeah uh and I I I somehow live through it\nI think that the the the instinct there is to just make sure you're mentioning every little thing that you think could go wrong in their life so that if it that thing does go wrong you can't blame yourself\nYou know it's like it's almost selfish instinct where you're just like wow at least I told them I I remember telling my five hundred times not to go down a dark alley then they were dark alley and well it's really bad but at least it's not my fault that that that got a really healthy instinct for parents I I Do feel like that is that the basis of it\nBecause of course you don't want no one with anything bad happen to their kids but it's a dish of that like you don't want to be the person who let your kid\nWalk down the street and they were something terrible happened not everyone's going to look at you and say what the hell are you doing allowing them to walk down the street by were you there yeah I'm so like a double whammy\nAnd I think that leads to a lot of that over parenting stuff and ... and I'm sure this is the boat she's in her ... right like she's trying to protect me look you're not going to ... you're not going to say anything to a four year old reading Cinderella that's going to protect them from break culture that's not going to occur\nYou're never you're never going to be able to solve this problem you believe is so prevalent ... by a story you tell them after ... reading Cinderella or watching it\nOr the Little Mermaid um or any of these uh Disney movies because they're already gonna be a mess up from\nSymbol falling down and blowing the words are crying to the year from the dust ah that's going to miss a lot of teen pregnancies cause a lot of them ...

I mean I I thought John Stewart was on funny this guy is on funny too about the one million power but\nI'm Trevor Noah on Comedy Central the other night took on Hillary Clinton and you know to his credit actually said some some accurate things are about her and and whether or not she's the best person to be speaking out on sexual allegations here's what he said\nIn retrospect do you think\nThey'll have resigned and the way the Monica Lewinsky scandal excellent may not it wasn't an abuse of power now\nNow there are people who look at the incidence of the nineties and they say a president of the United states cannot have a consensual relationship with an intern the power imbalance is too high in and out but let me ask you know where's the investigation of the current income than no\n... [noise] I'm Sorry man look here's the thing that's on who made it was different in the nineties\nBut today I think we're all understanding that there's a massive power imbalance between an intern and the president of the United states right I Will get into an uprising with anyone as a power imbalance\nPersonal bomb attacks to me I have ... ah after that it was a match and then he'd be like I actually I just don't know if you're watching the game and I'll be like oh yeah I knew that I knew that it yeah [noise] I don't know someone who is Henry trying to deflect and make this about Trump\nLike you're not in a position to be throwing stones at someone Henry especially when you actually sitting in a glass house\nUm other than the power dynamic thing while he is saying there is is really amazing because nobody takes around like that on the left\nUm but I don't buy into the power dynamics that nobody can say no to the president of United States of course you could I mean don't you wouldn't you certainly tried to raise your children to grow up to the people that would say no different than the United states yes absolutely yeah you don't you don't let him do whatever he wants to because you're the he's the president and and this is a side thing may may be a longer conversation\nBut Monica Lewinsky is not a meat to victim she is not right ... ... she was a willing participant in an old fashioned affair is what she was\nAnd she would have said no could have said no she absolutely should have said no he obviously should have to do and and from his perspective you know he's the price of the United states he\nIs doing things that he should not be be doing but like it's totally different than money to prod record Paula Jones that these are totally different stories she was a ... she was in love with the guy\nShe told a literary trip she was in love with him\nThat she thought that they are actually we're going to be together and be married\nAnd this is not a situation in which she was like oh wow I'm I'm I'm scared\nShe thought that they actually like it'd be together and be married and this is in a situation in which she was like oh wow I'm I'm I'm scared for my career for example like the thing that was a power imbalance well\nThere's an implication even if the person doesn't do it there's an implication that maybe they'll ruin your career if you don't hook up with them a which first of all it's prosecuting a crime before it occurs you're just assuming the person's going to commit a crime and ruin your career over sexual stuff but that's a whole different story that's not what happened here\nShe was she was a participant in an affair she was she was into it and she was also by the way ... that is valid from Hillary there she was an adult when we should not be excusing all actions like twenty three year old women\nRight or twenty three year old men you were an absolute you were was not at all for your own actions at that time they'll question yeah ... so that would do something to be easy case we have a ... my patriots supply or I mean if you've seen the news we may have noticed some hurricanes hitting a lately\nWe've had

I mean that's amazing meet your rationale of\nOkay but you let this guy on who did much less than they are and you shouldn't you shouldn't have let this comedian perform on your stage fright and the fact that nobody cares about these other people the same people read by the way\nWho want him to shut out Louis CK didn't care about Clinton didn't care about any of these other circumstances but he's supposed to\nYeah and it you know I I Will say he he was really smart about this I mean he you know you always some great points in this interview and and the New York times reporter was just constantly trying to say well yeah but you did this thing and you allowed him to try out it personally on him is and why he made the decision which is an interesting part of the story but I mean he made the point is well of\nWhat is the line we don't allow him ... to work so what does that mean does he go in the governmental or finding work at other jobs can you work what if what we see cake hired by Walmart would that be okay\nAnd I I think it's it's a fascinating never support himself\nIn life yeah again and the idea that this guy has not been punished for their sanity yeah the Manhattan was making ten million dollars a year and he's probably now making and what are you making it a comedy cellar appearance fifty dollars maybe five hundred dollars I don't know nothing may I wouldn't be surprised if he just walked in and does it because he wants to do it\nOr he has you know paid for this in a large way\nUm and you know it it certainly affected his career in a big waste last movies he's lost jobs\nBut I mean we saw this with Charlottesville there was a guy who again we're talking about a consensual act the ... yeah I guess yeah I can touch every time he actually did it yeah\nIt was it was intangible and ... there was one case in which as we discussed the will nominate do\nAnother take on the phone or we don't know what happened another case where he started doing it and the woman left because she didn't what are you part of it will be good for her or him that's what you should do she should walk out and keep the loser and tell every all her friends that he's a loser right on but that does not mean that he should be losing jobs ten or Fifteen Years later\nCharlottesville is another great example of this\nBook we use other people we play the video and the and the audio of a you know Jews will not replace us and and all these crazy chants from the real dirt bags or in in Charlottesville carrying torches and ... you know the the deepest darkest corners of the all right and ... one of the guys\nWho attended a rally and was in some of those videos\nOr was identified as a man who worked at a hot dog stand in California\nHe was fired from his job at the hot dog stand now how is this a good outcome for anyone that look if he is saying to black customers I won't serve you because you're black\nObviously we get that into indication that the kitchen if that ever happened he did his job a seemingly right for every one he was serving hotdogs and making hotdogs and it was not like you know he was not at high levels of finance here [laughter] and so now we we we can all feel good about ourselves or power\nDynamic of a hotdog vendor though is that a still intimidated or other people that's true so so I guess that we can all feel good about ourselves\nThat a still intimidated or other people that's true so so I guess that we can all feel good about ourselves but the fact that we are instead of him having a job a hot dog stand instead we will support him with our tax dollars because he's going to be at home\nAnd all these projects and programs that liberals have created over the years to support people in need are going to go to this white supremacist who can no longer hold down his job at a hotdog stance crazy or to morally above him\nBut I ... I don't want to ever hang out with a guy who would do to that rally in ... Jews will not replace us never what I mean you do what we do is we just find every one of these guy you wanted you to replace you [laughter]\nQuestion have you ever consider you want to I Would rather not\nBy anyone [laughter]\nI never have considered but he does that include a job I guess I guess I don't like me\nOr anyone else does that does include that\nIt [laughter] I really don't want anyone um it's just a it's a weird thing we're dealing with because\nYou know finding someone a in a video and identifying them on line gives you the sort of rush of I've ousted this\nTerrible person and I can punish him who really punishing I mean I argued for certainly you're punishing the taxpayers of this area who now have to support the loser\nWho actually somehow was able to hold down a job selling hot dogs and now has to sit inside probably playing X. box while you're paying him to do it and you know what a win but don't celebrate that one I I I don't know it's a strange direction for us to be going and there's an ... ... yes\nYes it's not it's absolutely crazy\nOr so maybe the answer is um they just can't be alive anymore I mean is it almost comes down to that because if they can support themselves and certainly the state you don't want them supported by your tax dollars right so I guess all people who are accused just starve\nTo death now yeah I I guess that's when it comes after that the way it works and I I Would be nice for us to find some consistency in this world would you know the fact that like you know if you were to say the me too movement I bet to most people\nAre you sure you get hurt you get Harvey Weinstein mentioned mhm um and you might get more maybe Kevin Spacey or one of the other two you know few few big stars but what you would almost definitely get is Donald Trump\nAnd Roy Moore and Brett Kavanaugh\nAnd every conservative or anyone even supposedly leaning right that you can think of that was accused those have all had huge play in the media\nThe I mean what's the percentage Ninety five percent have been on the left it's Hollywood and news media people and I mean it's been almost everyone has been in those industries and those industries obviously an incredibly to the left\nThe idea that this is a right wing phenomenon I mean it just seems like the people who are on the right pay the price for it where people on the left you know don't necessarily see that the same way and you know I think you have to get to a point where\nSomeone like Lucy K who was I think\nAccused ... correctly of being a dirt bag right who was in ... to his own admission but\nNot not any nothing that was over this line of sexual assault at least it's not\nAs reported\nKnow you have to look at these things as they say it I mean is easing sorry is now doing shows again um and he was a he was accused of something um you know what's his face from the New York times he's back or or Glenn or what the heck is his name you know we get it wrong fresh right\nKnow what's his face from the New York times he's back\nOr Glenn or what the heck is his name you know we get it wrong frustrate you use of a of harassing you're young interns and other underlings and he he's back at work\nWe have this weird saying why I mean Mike Tyson\nIt's pretty clear the mayor was convicted of rape not accurate time convicted of rape spent time in prison and he's like the darling\nOf the media he comes on and you get the silly appearances everywhere have a problem going anywhere now doing anything and he's I mean look he served time and he's out there\nUm and so you could make the case as the left has to be forever that people who go in Fallon should be able to come back and vote you should be their programs to give felons in convicted felons and murderers jobs\nYet but when someone's accused of something much less than murder they can never work again and not even convicted just accused ... yeah it really doesn't make any sense AAA seven
