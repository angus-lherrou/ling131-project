I mean he you know looking at ... ... ... ... ... ... it it boils down to these ridiculous ... a ...\n... ... ... of what a person believes they are you telling me you can't criticize someone on the on the left that you disagree with politically because they're Jewish because then you get called an anti Semite\nThe same way like a liberal should be able to criticize without fear of being called a racist Clarence Thomas ... if you'd be able to say I think he's wrong on the on the constitution they should absolutely be able to do that without being called racist but it did this bizarre thing and this is carried out today not by the\nMother Jones in the Huffington Post read expected but every mainstream media source asking question after question after question what part of it gave me a percentage tell me please how much of this is Donald Trump's fault so here's let me let me to\nDo what the Allison just said let's make a tangible ...\n... ... is a Joe Lieberman [noise]\n... on a very frustrating interview with CNN listen to this ...\nWell it's just shocking moment I mean I we view it all through your own experience I I haven't had a life as a Jewish American ... which has been not only free of anti Semitism but I've had this opportunity to be elected\nA senator from Connecticut where the Jewish population is about to present and then\n... ... Al Gore gives me the chance to run for vice president for Jewish American on a national ticket or a ...\n... ... really the ... I fish no anti Semitism ...\n... uh and forgive me for going back to the end of the ... election we actually got five hundred thousand more votes than the other ticket which was a reflection in numbers that people were voting a ... based on religion so when something like this happens ...\n... ... and it changes that reality but I Believe the reality is that the American people are very fair minded not bigger than you saw it and the ... wholesome reaction ... ... of the neighbors who are not Jewish and spoil Pittsburgh and then the elected officials there it was very genuine ...\n... ... ... and of course this is not please ... ... ... this is not what they want it out of jail we didn't bring him on to say that he had a good experience as an American ... to bring him on the\nFake positive things they brought 'em onto to clarify exactly what portion of this is Donald Trump's fault or tell us so we don't have to say it day he's responsible so we can have plausible deniability that that that that this is exactly what we believe we don't want to come out and say at five\nThousand times we'll just have to what you say it okay and it's actually the way they lead into this next question and again he is not giving them what what they want to hear\nAnd we'll just into it you say it okay it's actually the way they lead into the next question and again he is not giving them what what they want to hear\n... believe that there are those who are perceived those to be anti Semitic dog whistles when you see the only one of the closing ad campaign George Soros a Janet Yellen point blank by from Goldman Sachs with dark ominous pictures and talking about the money and the international banker question okay if that's something that that tend to math and\nAll the first thing I Want to say that in my opinion\nThis brutal murderer in Pittsburgh really had to wear was committed by a hateful owner who was probably more stimulated by a a anti Semitism in the social media to buy anything else going around um he ... he was against\nA President Trump but it's real a real I I was glad to see that this website as big an so down\nFor a while and and all the social media people have to ask whether they're becoming vehicles for this kind of hatred but more generally I think all of us\nAnd a half to ... beginning with the president democratic and Republican leaders in Congress people in the media conventional media and the more of\nAn unconventional social media have to ask ourselves to what extent are weak contributing to the division in our society Charlie Dent that I work together in a group of No Labels and\nTrying to overcome the way the parties have become like warring tribes\nBut this goes beyond get a ... and did the one that is a what would I say\n... when the president makes a statement about unity or a bus praise them for ... an urge them to build on it and think about ways in which he can act so that no one can ever say\nA he somehow was responsible for violence or or hatred again it's a the the Joe Lieberman\nForty seven minute response ah but I mean you get the summary there I mean first of all this guy was not ... not ... I mean he was a viscerally\n... anti Trump in any way of he you know what I don't like about Donald Trump is he's too nice to Jews and that is it's actually what the guy was saying on the social network over and over and over and over again so he was not a pro Trump guy that shot up to the Senate ... uh and you know like a\n... it's important to make that distinction and how do you bring people together the exact opposite of what the un is trying to do in that clip ... I mean without that when the nicest Joe Lieberman possible way right but what do you think is what you're doing right now\nBy trying to make this into a situation where Trump is blamed what we should do is wrong what we should do instead is when he said something that we think it helps the environment we should praised in sure certainly generally speaking we have an issue with our discourse I think I think almost everybody would agree with that but when it comes to the shooting it's not related\nSo here's what the media should have done this week and the media should have said okay so what role does rhetoric ... ... ... on social media and from the president and from the press and everything else what role does media play in a in\nA in the life of a guy who as we saw this ...\nNon white male I'm ... I tried to commit with the you know with a pipe bombs ... the guy was not the guy was absolutely\nNuts he was a loner she had finally found the cause that she could you know rallied behind ... you know was not he was nuts okay ... so that one what role does\nGee you know was not he was nuts okay [noise]\nSo that one [noise] what role does politics play does the media play do politicians play in whining people [noise] [noise]\nThat's a viable asked the question on that particular topic ... and not just about Trump ... but the whole thing [noise] [noise] [noise] ... ... what role does the media play what about Twitter what about Facebook what's winding some of these people up\n... what happens in the future\n... ... ... ... ... ... valid [noise]\nThe shooting in Pittsburgh [noise] [noise]\nOh here's how they should have covered this [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] this guy was a ... anti Semite ... ... ... who this clearly had nothing to do with politics the guy he hated Donald Trump [noise]\nThis is just\nA loner just like the guy in the van and he had no friends\n[noise] he had no friends [laughter] [noise]\nShe was sick and twisted guy [noise]\nWhat is the whole in America\nAnd why are we seeing this now ... ... ... because ... ... ... it's not Donald Trump and it's not for rock Obama\n... not the right [noise] [noise] there's something fundamentally missing here what is it [noise]\nWhy are we changing a wire or kids killing themselves at a record rate ... ... ... ... ... ... there's a bigger issue here than politics but nobody in the media wants to address it because nobody in the media and nobody in politics you can win [noise]\n[noise] [noise]", "show_name": "The Glenn Beck Program", "year": "2018", "city": "Charlottesville", "day": "29"}
