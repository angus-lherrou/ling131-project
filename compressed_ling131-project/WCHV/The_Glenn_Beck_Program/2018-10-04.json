as a as a young boy I uh\nDidn't take school that seriously I uh got into fights identify ah hopefully not ... either ... or ... and ... so the\nFor many many years until I put an end to it and unfortunately Glenn no one believes me\nKnowing [noise] so you know I just kind of felt that I have to deal with this I have to get over it it's it's not easy to do that but I knew that\nBlaming my you know what happened was not going to get me anywhere in life so I understand in a way why no one you know talked up and now these days you know twenty Thirty years ago\nIt was not the way it was it was not we weren't we didn't think people were like that and we didn't want to look at it if it was it's horrible we've made good progress on that\nYes we have however we swung from one end all the way to the other with no middle ground show what I'm Upset about is that everyone believes this this doctor\nOkay just on her ... a testimony which wasn't even you know significant and ah they're they they just believe that because of the health they went through and to me I don't understand why they don't listen to the facts\nAnd and this is one of the things are so disturbing about this the obviously the me too concept is really ... really important and early ... important like it it really is it could make a real difference and instead what it's turning into is\nHere's a tool for Democrats used to destroy people's lives which is an awful outcome where what a great outcome would be out of this in my opinion is that going forward\nOr people like Phyllis\nWould it would be believed would at least be taken seriously not paying you've taken seriously believes if they have the evidence right taken seriously and and then and then would not fear coming out because if you had a evidence and you had a a real story to tell it would be believed correct\nThat's that's that is the outcome that I think rational Americans are looking for them they want this to and they think this is horrible\nBut they don't want to go the other way this has to become um a vendetta you know fill us as you said you knew that the anger wasn't going to get you anywhere in life so you had to deal with it if you deal with the is the situation\nHave a chance to grow it is much better if the person who has done it to you has\nUm has ... it's a consequences or or has has you know admitted it at least or something it's hard when people don't apologize or don't admit it and they just get away with it is really really hard\nBut that sometimes what happens but by by moving on with your life\nYou're not trying to convict every man and that's what's happening right now there are these women who have suffered this and have not healed and so they want everybody to be believed because no one would believe there's\nAnd so they don't they don't you know that they don't know if it's true or not but nobody believed to me and this woman's gonna be railroaded what no your situation is not their situation\nAnd we have to base it on facts Phyllis thanks for your call hey Jay in Oregon hello AJ you're on the Glenn Beck program\nHi Glenn how slow I'm a recovering addict of outlet [laughter] okay\nSo what have you on TALK about it I've been listening to the audio book it's great\nAnd I kind of at my wife and I kind of have like ... points\nAnd I and it really hit me when I was listening yesterday is a social media outrage\nIs what's driving this country more than anything like you say in the book you know\nTommy thirty six ... what apple right is and and it's got to the point where we just our life is so much happier by not engaging with politics on line yeah and part of that social media mob it it's it\nGot to the point where my wife and I just for like looking at each other oh my gosh I Can't handle this and I I even took on more volunteer opportunities will help with youth basketball everything like that\nAnd I feel ... now\nYou get did you end up social media or did you did you just cut down on it\nI cut down on the uh outraged the absolute engaging with some family members\nThat were progressive where you couldn't you couldn't even talk to them it's like beating your head against a brick wall him was so frustrating [noise] I mean we don't even when we go to family dinners we don't even\nTalk about politics and we're all you know a lot of us are constitutional conservatives but we don't talk about it because it's so bad right now\n... it's it is it's what's it this book is perfect it's perfect titles it's perfect for I think everybody should be reading it\nThanks a lot of Jay appreciate I'm going to send you a copy of the book or do you want to book since you were listening to it yes autographed yes absolutely\nI was like a a a hard copy and God Bless\nGotta thank you very much for it is a you know the the next step is once you have once you have calmly done this and you have backed up\nThe next step is to re engage with your relatives but on bigger principals don't talk to them about Kavanaugh because they'll immediately go to the talking points don't talk to them about that\nTalk to them about the bigger issues everything that we need our moon them is the declaration of independence and the bill of rights e pluribus unum I've spent a lot of time thinking okay so what what brings us together what is the uniting thing what can we all agree on\nWell not all of us but a grand majority of us should be able to agree on all men are created equal life liberty\nWell not all of us but a grand majority of us should be able to agree on all men are created equal life liberty and pursuit of happiness and the ... the ten amendments to the constitution\nOkay let's start there that's what brought people here\nAnd that's what's being lost in the conversation we're arguing over parties and personalities that sound with Kavanaugh is really about it's not about did he do it or did he not do it if she ... she telling the truth it is about\nAre you innocent until proven guilty do we presume innocence do we look for facts\nIs there a system in society outside of the legal standards\nWhere did the legal standards come from the legal standards came from a group of people are founders and prior to that\nHere in America they came here and said you know what I can just be taken off the streets I can be destroyed if somebody just says hey I'm I'm I'm the king or I'm a I'm a lord or I'm a Duke and this person did that they're believed and I'm not no matter what the evidence is\nThat's not right I don't want that\nThose are the big principles than those are the things that we need to slowly start to re engage our loved ones with because that's where you find unity\nSo much of the media coverage right now is just trying to give a justification to someone for destroying Kavanaugh's life\n... it's like hey well we think that there's a chance of this because of this have you seen Ronan Farrow lighting his credibility on fire over the past couple of weeks on the story yeah he first came out and said oh well none of the New York times none of the other major sources would run the story about the woman who said that Brett Kavanaugh exposed himself with a party\nAnd then Ronan Farrow who is built up all of his credibility with real reporting on things like Harvey Weinstein\nOr comes out and people take it seriously 'cause it's him\nWhen you read the story you find out about two thirds the way through that they couldn't find anybody anybody who had any recollection of this and in fact the woman who even brought it forward said she couldn't remember who it was she couldn't remember it was Brett Kavanaugh she just remembered it a couple of weeks ago but it was bright capital\nHow on earth when no one would print that and no one did right now that's in lumped into your multiple accusations and they followed up on it\nIn one of the most amazing stories I've ever seen they said Ronan Farrow again a comes out and says we found a a witness to the story to the ... exposing themselves to college party\nWhen you read the story what you find out is a it was all here say they don't have anyone who was there it was people who said they heard about it at the time\nSo it was one person comes and says I have a witness I Know this person they they'll do about it at the time listen to this quote from the story it's an incredible\nThe the the person who was in the story said he initially asked to remain anonymous because you hope to make contact first\nWith a classmate who did the best of his recollection told him about the party and was an eyewitness to the incident so the source of this person come into New Yorker he I Want to talk to that person to confirm it\nHe said that he had not been able to get any response from that person despite multiple attempts to do so okay really shady why would you put that in ... listen to the next sentence remember this article was printed\nThe New Yorker did reach the classmate and he said he had no memory of the incident\nMy gosh I mean ... ... ... they are so desperate to get this guy off the Supreme Court that they will do anything Ronan Farrow is Burt is lighting his career out of fire right now so you got to stop the here is the best thing done\nIf the Supreme Court that they will do anything Ronan Farrow is burnt is lighting his career out of fire right now so you're up here is the best thing Donald Trump has done during this whole thing\nHe has allowed to the press without blocking it up yeah speaking he's been

they are bad but this is a that\nNever say the things I Do not believe things are not as bad as you think they are are they are bad that this is a bad this is a pivot point for our country and if we fall down on our job it will change and it will go away and I think it will become very bad however\nIt's not the battle that you think it is you've been convinced by media and social media that everybody is thinking this way they're not\nDavid has a David Barton is with us he has a book out called this precarious moment or he's written it with the James Carlo was a just a great great guy and good thinker\n'em and they have the stats and the book and they have different things we've ... we were concentrating just for a second on millennials because I Know David has seen it and I've seen it because we're doing it with mercury one\nAnd when you present the facts to millennials\nIf you're not trying to when they say wait a minute what David talk about a few of the millennials that we have had in for our two week you know training course and they have actually come\nA little hostile sense right yeah we have a number of Columbus skeptics here to disapprove us and so that we're all wrong and\nAnd it's All right you know we don't we don't run from that situation would you ... them and say let's have a conversation as long as I can gauge and the Congress right and so we start asking them questions and you know they have their opinions but we just ask them questions and it's kind of like they sit back and uh I don't know\nAnd so once you ask the questions that lead them to the information\nIt's amazing to see that they didn't take those questions or go back to those that taught them and change that we literally we have a a girl that came in that you know learned all sorts of stuff she went back to her professor started asking her professor questions\nHe got all befuddled 'cause he didn't know the answers he now has asked her to meet with him once a week and teach teach him what she learned and and all these classes and it's amazing\nAnd and she said she wrote a report and he said you are either a liar and you're going to\nGet an F or this is the best paper see me in my office that's right and she he said okay I Want to talk to you about your sources and she had him nailed down 'cause he had never here's a professor they didn't know this stuff\nAnd economics professor and he found out that founding father John Witherspoon had the greatest impact of any person in American history and American economics and he didn't know that and she showed him that and then shut them the documentation\nAnd he said okay I I Want more because I clearly ... but that's the thing of asking questions with relationships and we take these these guys that come in hostile or otherwise\nAnd just because of relationships and as we tell them we have a lot of fun with them and quite frankly we tell them that sarcasm I Love language if we don't make fun of us because we don't like this so [laughter] so you know we we we kid and joke and they have a great great time\nBut they come out transform and there's some of the most mature individuals and these these guys are all\nIt's in their mind to become leaders and I tell you they are so so good and it's just amazing\nWe were at a meeting in February and we I don't think I've announced this formally uh may I David go for it um we are going to do black history month a museum here at our studios in February\nIf you don't think that's\nLittle controversial um but we have worked on this and we're working on it with the Lincoln museum and uh it's going to be a little mind blowing and really really eye opening\nDon this and we're working on it with the Lincoln museum and uh it's going to be a little mind blowing and really really eye opening to a lot of people on both sides\nUh edits black history but you know not all the black history that everybody knows let's tell the black history that really nobody knows\nI found it fascinating in the book that we have\nArgued as if these things were not settled long ago and we have argued a common language\nHow dare you insist as if this was just some idea that a bunch of racist had\nYeah Ben Franklin is a great example because Ben Franklin talked about how so many Germans are moving in Pennsylvania and they were and he said the problem is they're speaking their own language\nGreat example because Ben Franklin talked about how so many Germans are moving in Pennsylvania and they were\nAnd he said the problem is they're speaking their own language there started to create signs in German they're starting to create documents in German you can't have a nation if you don't speak the same language so Franklin was one of the first ones out that Thomas Jefferson the same thing\nHe said we have immigrants coming in which is great and by the way they were so pro immigration than in the declaration of independence one of the twenty seven grievances was were separating from Great Britain 'cause he's trying to stop immigration we won't immigration\nIt's just we wanted a simulation with immigration they were huge pro immigration\nSimulation I mean ... ... he was Thomas Jefferson they will bring with them the principles of the government they leave him by with their own early you involved in the ocean I mean ... ... he was Thomas Jefferson they will bring with them the principles of the government they leave him by with their own early you involved in the early use\nThese old principles with their language they will transmit to their children the proportion to their numbers ... among the native for a quick or assimilation\nThis goes right with with this\nIt seems to me necessary this is Franklin seems to be necessary to distribute the um the Germans the Germans\nA more equally mix them in with English established English schools that are now where they are now too sick leave settled I Am against the it I Am not against the admission of Germans in general for they have virtues their industry for galaxy blah blah blah they're great farmers\nHe's just saying we have to get them to be Americans this is the opposite of what we're doing no\nDearborn, Michigan ... I mean we we want people to simulate and we don't want them creating a parallel culture where there's almost a no go zone now for for a place\nOf Somalians in in Minnesota exactly\nAnd we've got groups in West Texas creating their own separate communities and that's not it it's assimilation you want to become an American you don't come to America to take over and move to whatever your country was\nYou come here to be an American now that's where the professors the elite groups really are into all America's really bad ... you know we need we need to be like Europe or whatever\nOne way to lose it is is not pay attention to what they did and one of the things we try to do in the book is we don't we're not into government solutions we tried to give things that every single individual can do because America gets healthy from the bottom up not the top down\nYou say that racial healing is fairly easy all we have to do is do it ... what what what is the plan for racial healing\nYou know there there are several things one is you've got to change the some of your knowledge basis or find with millennials they are taught about race from the way the professor said and we show them seven things that everyone needs to know about race and generally they don't the historical\nBut remember oh stop here and what those are oh yeah there's several things of this the first permanent ... is permanent slavery was introduced in America by black man Anthony Johnson who sued ... own other black men\nAre we show the fact that a ... forty three percent a free blacks in South Carolina on black slaves that wow one out of yeah nearly half\nA one out of eight a Native Americans on black slaves and and major tribes and that didn't stop that didn't know him as a patient proclamation winded slavery didn't name stop with\nThirteen to ... when we abolish slavery because we only bothers flavor in the United states but Indian nations that are their own nations are right now about when they stopped it was years later it was probably a decade later before slavery stopped in Indian nations\nAlthough what we do a show slavery is a human problem it is not a black white problem despite what your professor say\nIt has a problem and the way you view humankind\nSo we go through and and so for example Tim Scott and James Lankford in the U.S Senate have come up with with this thing where you ...\nIt's just to come eat a meal with you on Sunday come into your house and you know learning in touch you don't solve racism institutionally you saw that one person at a time change in a hard time seeing people different and not having this black white polarization that we often try to make today\nHow worried are you David about the\nLevel of anger now\nLevel of anger as a real problem but what it what is derived from is is the bigger problem and the stereotypes and and and all these things we really don't know each other\nAnd once you get to know each other and what you did this inter relational stuff like with millennials and like with folks of other races and other groups once you start doing individual stuff that's where it breaks down\nAnd that's where you're able to demonstrate that you know what you thought about may or what you thought about this group is not accurate where individuals were made in God's image we have equality and we can get along great if all sit down and talk so it's what you're doing to your book Len\nAddicted outraged ... that's exactly it you sit down and have conversations on bigger things\nSo real quick just one last gimme the six things that you say are these are the six urgent steps\nTo sit there actually six searching areas what we've got to do an immigration what we have to do in our relationship with Israel what we have to do with millennials what we have to do with the people of faith doing a terrible job right now is when people of faith or so we go through those six areas and\nLet me lose touch on Israel our relationship with Israel is pretty good year there's learnt now your concern in the book about Christians are starting to become anti Semitic\nThey are becoming anti Semitic what has changed since last well we don't know the scriptures well anymore and that we have the highest level of biblical literacy if any generation American history and\nSo we're ah we're seeing sixteen hundred anti Israel events a year on college campuses uh people don't know much about the Palestinians but they're told they're oppressed people in Israel is doing it\nSo we have a real individual turn against Israel and a lot of denominations are coming out against Israel the nominations that used to be very pro Israel now yes absolutely absolutely\nYeah ... is a more liberal churches though their their their water called mainstream the nomination so they're so that that you know it's kind of like the United Methodist Church yeah usa those so they had never been anti Israel before but now they are they're they're coming out and they're wondering due to BBS kind of stuff to boycott the messenger and sanctions\nSo there is a growing anti Semitic movement among people of faith in America which is certainly a problem\nNow this administration's and great job on restoring is just as if an absolutely amazed yeah\nBut that doesn't solve the individual problems we have a college campuses and at churches and people of faith\nDavid Barton and James Carlo the name of the book is this precarious moment six urgent steps that will save you your family and our country we are at the edge of the cliff\nAnd as a as the the righteous among the nations of the woman that I met a in Poland\nA told me where you there David\nYou weren't there were I don't think on that trip I was uh and uh she said

know how dangerous that is for him but if you were on the Glenn Beck program strike one you talk to them about Kavanaugh's strike to you\nAnd Ford did you know how dangerous that is for him but if you were on the Glenn Beck program strike one you talk to them about Kavanaugh strike too you didn't say an opinion on Capitol strike three\nYou're out yeah I mean any weather ... regardless of his personal politics a lot of his listeners would be from the left\nUm and so you know but that like but he doesn't care the ... well he he doesn't care it's something that we need it is it something that we need people just being willing to be honest and and just talking about just about what we can talk about things without making everything about politics\nEven though this story the reason why I had him on\nIs because it's very ... today but that's heated the podcast before cabinet yeah nothing to do have nothing to do with it and so when we talk now in light of this can we just talk about what you found on memory right because it's important and it's a reason why I honestly I Would listen\nTo him on Brian Williams yes because he's credible if Rachel Maddow came out and so this is John Ritter did that I Would I wouldn't you know you never but like Malcolm so credible because he's not doing he actually looking for an answer right yeah and that's what I think it is so absent\nIn so many places right now I mean is it you know\nIt's it you don't oh wait you're not always right um but\nIt it's okay to keep your principles and and maintain your arguments and and believe things are morally correct the way you do but there's no reason why you can't\nEntertain and be challenged by someone who has a different opinion I feel like that's what you know one of the things that's been interesting about the cabinet thing is because the those on the left here and you know the prominent ones in the left have been so\nI mean I Want to use the technical term bonkers [laughter] on the story so over the top so ridiculous in so many ways\nBut this guy comes out and goes against Kavanaugh would this is my other ridiculous of an of a nonsensical situation surrounding it\nHow can you let this guy go back to the Senate\nOr thanks gave I mean I I just made a book out to eat I'm gonna send it to you addicted outrage will a pop it in the mail today real quickly let me go to Eddie in South Carolina then pappy your pets here from the path gray radio round up otherwise known as ... great unleash\nA which you can even Everytime find on a who'd you could find a podcast on iTunes or

letter\n[laughter] yes the pretty thorough agent they're All right\nOkay so did he know that a letter to\nYeah I I mean eddy it is really clear I thank you for your phone call um and it's kinda like talking to Lindsey Graham is I'm a ... you know it's obvious that this leak came from somebody I personally think the the you know the the authorities should who should look into the leak I think it's\nReally rotten what ah what happened to forward pat welcome to the program thank you good you know you hear it\nReally it it it it really is you and you can just say that now and you can't think of any other place could you know that I'd rather be you know so your experience with Kavanaugh because we went into this last night on the news and why it matters if you if you miss last night's broadcast the news and why it matters you should listen to it because\nA player was quite an expose a really nice here I Believe ... regulations or less yeah and I before last it was starting startling ... and you notice the press never picked up on it you know you know I Know I went to yeah they don't they don't care yeah a when this happened to\nParticularly men riding can than men on the right right they don't care they don't care and uh\nCare yeah a when this happened now\nParticularly men writing can then men on the right right they don't care they don't care and ah I'm not going to go into it here but you were there\nAnd we were there I was you know it I was there so well we live very near a Yale for three years\nAnd I went to ... you went to Yale yeah so um so and so the cabinet and I distinctly\nRemember yeah oh I don't even want to bring it yeah don't even I wouldn't have to lie I have a a a fan in my uh bathrooms you know when you turn on the light of my bathrooms I have a fan there yeah every every but because of of that memory but anyway\nSo [laughter] so what are you delete 'em K. I. so uh so it was just code so [laughter] so [laughter] so I'm pat what's\nOn your mind today a well of course Kavanaugh is on my mind he's always on my mind yet never far from my thought is ah and ah\nI it's it's fascinating to see how are you know just kind of outlined how the Democrats\nWanted investigation got one wanted it expanded still got a a wanted it delayed so it was and now now that it's all been done and we're wrapping up and they found nothing now they want even more investigation and when would this ever end\nI think in two thousand twenty is when it when if you if you are yeah I let him continue this process but ah the\nLatest thing from the roommate who knows who knows for a fact that cabinet was lying about his drinking habits\nThose words in his year book in high school ...\nDo bring them up uh I don't do ... do bring up the word no do booth do self it's by and devil's triangle don't do it 'cause you know what those are about obviously ...\nThey're a well at least his roommate knows that they were a sexually charged words mhm which would make a huge difference in whether he should be a Supreme Court justice forty years later\nIf he was heading terms that were about ... he asked the Supreme Court has developed ... then it's OK yeah as a teenager right as a teenager because ... they'll do that\nNow than there was reckless heinous serial killers they're usually start to show signs of serial killing around sixty yeah that's usually what happens most serial\nKillers are and I think we talked about this the other day do you guys are you familiar with the word moved\n'cause yeah I've heard in the middle ear with that and it's yeah it's pretty widely understood to be flatulence it's interesting ... three of us off is a different thing yeah off three of us had enough uh recollections of what that word meant India might actually was the sexual use I remember was that both yea or boss\nBoth buff I think both sides both would be really a kind of OJ\nOr does enjoy but like Glenn how to a drug reference yeah and I thought maybe I'm wrong but I looked it up and they are big area and it is it's also a drug reference and then pat doing OK bought yeah was the farting thing yeah which is amazing I mean I honestly when I read that I was like ... he's probably trying to cover for himself because in my thought that is actually what it was it was like a sexual term\nBut then ... I mean we all three of people have different recollection of a different area yet right different schools where a different backgrounds different you know I mean like that so it could mean anything they really could not get triangle I never heard of I don't know what that it yeah I don't know what that is well let me explain [laughter] ah but\nThe way the way everybody cares about this stuff when and I think you guys mentioned this early in the show when there was a president who admitted to far worse than this stuff\nNor worse than we don't have it on tape and if we did have it on tape gonna lay it\nPresident who admitted to far worse than this stuff\nNo nor worse then we don't have it on tape and if we did have it on tape gonna lay it right now\nI think I was a thug [laughter] for a for a big part of my\nGrowing up I I I Would I think I was a very\nTypical uh uh a gang rape is areas [noise] a mischievous child as a as a young for how do you think um by the time I was an adolescent and then moving back from Indonesia and was struggling with these issues of a\nRacial identity and the father not being in a way what straw racially tendency I think\nThat a ... you know I reacted by a by engaging and a lot of a a\n... that's not a typical of mhm\nWhite males are across the country ... with that I played a lot of basketball ... black male or I or\nDidn't take school that's serious like Watchmen them that's what I Want to [laughter] got into fights why why does play a black on black male rank drag rank or he drank totally different than white who are consumed substances to foods that are where we were legal\nYeah not a legal um uh and I think generally pretty ... ah yeah acting out now I think out in a way as a way to the ... when I look back on it I understand a lot\nOf things to what got me through those years was was um [noise] or a natural aptitude for ... as a matter of fact I didn't have to pay attention too much to be able to my grades and running as\nIt goes on to say I think you know it takes too long [laughter] he goes on to say that he would drink a six pack in the hour before class yeah and in and out on a soapbox but I don't go to the last drunk yeah I mean nobody cared about that stuff no no and you know more about it\nAnd by the way where was that stuff when he was running where was that right where what we have to we have to have an ... calendars uh-huh\nBut uh this guy has that the press never did it and no one in the press and they would be a right\nTo not do it would would hear that and say oh well he ... he's looking at you look at his temperament I mean he was right he admitted to fights he admitted to fights he admitted to chugging beers or humidity and illegal activity his\nTemperament they would've never said that and which is more important he's there's only one executive cabinet I was going for a ... a position where he's won nine of the court far more important for the one guy you know to be able to have that disposition to be able to have that temperament and be able to have that job you're like here's why\nHere's why mhm because he's not white and he's fighting the patriarchy\nIs the real reason why it does matter yeah if you're fighting the patriarchy and it was all white and the history of colonialism and I know this sounds ridiculous but read the book it's post modernism\nYou are doing that did you see the did you see the the um the the bogus studies they were just published the guys read that amazing how incredible we haven't even talked about we have to talk about it tomorrow um these studies where they where these these\nYeah amazing ... incredible we haven't even talked about we have talked about it tomorrow um these studies where they where these these three I'm a scientist", "show_name": "The Glenn Beck Program", "year": "2018", "city": "Charlottesville", "day": "04"}
