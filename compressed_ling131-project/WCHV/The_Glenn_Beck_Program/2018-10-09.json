I I responded ah ah to that as a growing member of the fat community\nI find the real problem is when I look at myself in the mirror and I define myself by my body I Am more than my body you can define me any way you wish it's your last what you say after I Am\nIs much more important than what others say about you\nSo which are we going to be America because the choice is here and the choices so much more than Donald Trump or Kavanaugh heat is so much bigger than this who are we\nI mean look at ... directing traffic they are so convinced that they are right they will bludgeon you if you disagree with them there's no freedom there where there is no doubt there is freedom where there is humility there is freedom\n... absolutely and you know when when you you know intellectual expiration when when curiosity I'm going against the grain in any way when that when that becomes punishable\nUm view I think I think they really risk a you know driving good people I'm Down some some unsavory roads and there there's no good and that\nBrings a tradition and oh yeah absolutely absolutely\nThank you so much for reading the book and I'm going to send you the assigned to copy but thank you for reading and calling in\nDaryl in Kentucky you're on the Glenn Beck program Hi Darryl\nGlenn how's it going I'm good how are you\nDoing great I just wanted to say that I really love the book and I think that my my favorite part of it is that even though we can't you can't surrender like you said several times we have to remain civil because maybe I'm not even thinking this but\nI think that eventually the blast will realize they have gone too far it will step back from the ledge and if for civil if for their standing strong in our principles will be able to bring them back into the fold and\nI'm bringing the country back together but if we get in we do the same thing we're doing we're just healthcare the country apart\nYou were on the left as well at one point\nI was a I was raised in southern West Virginia or my family were very deep blue Democrats and um we believe that Republicans were just people who took money away from the poor to give it to the rich and um\nYou know I I was pretty progressive guy in college and um I didn't really start looking at the other side until after twenty fourteen uh I went to war um I was ...\nAnd um I didn't really start looking at the other side until after twenty fourteen I I went to war um I was a soldier in the military a\nSpin off two thousand fourteen and Afghanistan are leading some of the best men and women I've ever met in my life when I came back to my country was completely different\nI couldn't figure out what happened my I was no longer welcomed the left as a straight white male a veteran so I had to figure out\nWhat happened and I started looking at people that I hadn't mark including yourself in the past and are actually started reading our ... Williams and Mike or jury spaniel and which you noted in the ... and uh\nThat really you know maybe I'm buying into their theory a little bit too much but I've I've seen firsthand and uh I Do believe that you have another five years of of this getting worse before it gets better but I still believe the Don his coming\nSort of why it's whether or not um [noise] we can pull enough people away from the cliff before letting the years twenty twenty five where it starts to come back the other direction um that's right so\nHow can we help people like you because I\nI I I think we need to start defining um Democrats when we say the Democrats I think we need to start saying the people in the leadership of the party um because I don't think like you there are Democrats who are good love the country and are finding themselves going wait a minute I don't have any place to go\nAnd uh and we have\nTo in and I'm not saying it's in the Republican Party [laughter] I'm just saying people need to start being more welcoming to people who are finding themselves on the outs what should we be aware of that you went through\n[noise] I think you should be aware that even though the policy and is is an area that we may never agree on that principle is something that we can agree on that things like\nIndividual freedom things like um you know not just a having a government that and control you from you know several hundred miles away that control every little aspect of your life\nOr something I talk to my wife and my niece about all the time is that you know before before President Obama even though I voted for the guy I kind of like what he was selling um the president's name didn't get mentioned at the dinner table every single night at my home when I was growing up\nThe the power that we have given to Washington\nOver the past ten Twenty years it's too much and\nNot really sure what the end state what the solution for that is but I think just talking about the things you talked about in the book the principles that make us all United are are you know the bill of rights of the things that they make us all American are are what we can can unify behind\nSo the the section of because I I mean I've really struggled with what it is that brought us together and it's really or can bring us back together and it's really so simple when you finally get down to it\nIt is the bill of rights don't you think\nI agree um I think that you will never find in any other country that I've been in I've been in several Africa Germany Afghanistan um Romania you'll never find a country that that beats itself up over its past as much as America does we\nWe realize that we've done some horrible things like you said in your region\nAmerica does we we realized that we've done some horrible things like you said in your region along but we've also\nYou know I think it's something that didn't actually sued a said by recognizing our falls by it and then as you are false you have to kind of in a way to America's moral superiority because we realize that we made mistakes and we're trying to fix them\n\nDarryl thank you so much for your phone call appreciate it God Bless\nHe brought up a great point about how before Obama the president's name didn't come up every day at the dinner table\nObviously that's getting even worse now with Trump I mean people are obsessed about talking about um all the time the story to the and actually it was about how they are the networks have recognized this and they're out they're doubling down a they've enjoyed high ratings engagement from Trump coverage and\nFor the networks at a relatively low cost now that a precedent has been set around these high returns it's unlikely news outlets will cut back meaning the barrage of political content being created an absorbed during the Trump presidency will likely outlive this administration\nThey want to they want to make I mean like Trump is a celebrity ... and he's a polarizing guideline people love and hate him but they want to change they want this to be the norm they want you to be obsessed with this all the time at the expense of the rest of your life\nIt is and it took ... regime\nIt is the norm you have to know what they're fewer or the leader is saying and doing and wants you to do it is the norm ... anything that normalize as as any intention of saying you know what that's good for America is mistaken it's wrong\nAnd this is you know this is a it's driven I think at this point by clicks and viewers and you know it's it's one of those things that just because it's going to continue it can be hard to reverse that addiction is well they you know when when they can get you know the Rachel Maddow audience\nOr is addicted to outrage maybe more than any other right their ratings have gone through the roof because of it and you think MSNBC is return you know he's going to reverse that path now no they're not going to say oh well you know what

because of that moment I read doubled my\nEfforts to read there are many times that I'll hear people say well you'll find that in the times actually yes that's exactly where I found out I guess you\nKnow what I mean and so when we talk about the problem we we have those in common\nThat whether it's keeping our children face whether it's drugs whether it's the weaponization of information and

to go in and remove the guns\nAnd the response from a ... a teacher in the room who had literally just been talking about kids exhibiting red flags had this to say about the idea\nI had never heard

moments in connection with the moments of disconnect that controlled the mood of the room [noise]\nWe already have the laws that we do not me not there are only five thousand of them who run again let all of those going just over ...\nThe moment I had been fearing we reached it\nNow are you willing to summarize no doubt that last yeah see that her that path because you're not even willing to let them know redeemed\nSoon after an summed up how a lot of us were feeling\nWould no longer on versus them and ...\nThey were on the same side just two people trying to figure something out [noise] they connected\nCan be done [laughter]\nThis is Anna coached by Denise do her first shot at it a little higher than\nAnd for the record for ... was ... and afterwards they started talking specifics again but there was a willingness to work together and limit the number of opinions to their own\nSo it's like OK rather than you and I like meeting in the parking lot in purchasing the gutter wherever but it's got a little I think they were running a background check on me to make sure you know that I'm not sell in Idaho injured or violence and then just handed down on\nThe eight nine ...\nOr\nOr or guilty until proven innocent you know what I mean I'm not a hundred percent against it because I pretty much hide anything now I'm just saying [noise]\nI'm like eighty percent of their their hat makes sense\nTo repeat Denise says I'm eighty percent there and I'm excited Lee respond by saying oh bring you over but it's what the ... says next that got me\nFor a committee I Khamenei let's say you're out somewhere [laughter]\nI Love that you come eighty a community college sticky around somewhere in the middle one on one there was a personal connection now who jumped the other night so still in school [noise]\nYou know I see why would we are where we are today and it's just that sort of you know\nDown not even forty eight hours later had just did that\nFor me I Know it's like eighty percent of it for all and the thing I like heavy issue may be seeking a different language there's a new one\nAnd how do we understand someone's different language a new one like spending time with them in person loses out and I felt when I spoke with her a few weeks later\nI'm back in ... farm from server bond with the you know and are someone who works for an hour and a half a trainer and I think that with a refreshing [noise] uprising back door to thank God for that\nCan that sort of gave me a glimmer of hope that okay we we can come to some sort of in agreement the problem\nAnd that sort of gave me a glimmer of hope that okay we we can come to an agreement\nThe problem isn't always the other person the problem isn't always the other side Denise explain how the shifted\nA repeat of come out to the ranch on than just putting your toes in the world of another person and and understanding it actually getting to see it we're not a problem then\nWeeks later Denise in I spoke about her perspective on America after our time\nTogether just a very combative [noise] uh you know very argumentative environment doesn't ... doesn't have to be in a can agree to disagree on things but you know like what you're trying to find some things things you're three on and I don't think that it is a hard\nThere isn't that hard so the question remains ...\nHow did we get to this point of connection and optimism\nWant it happened in the room during the conversation with the seven that it prompted Denise to want to reach out to enter an invite her to the gun range and the first place\nOn me okay [noise]\nWhy I appreciated thank you I Know there were others who were not to see the side and it was just I Know what it is a major turning on the right way to do you feel and I mean that's why I started sending her own\nThe moment [noise]\nAre you willing to put some words no doubt that can't be that accurate anti because you're not even willing to let them know [noise]\nRemember when I said there was more in that moment than I had realized there's Denise defending and I'm like saying you can't\nDo that to her that after they had some what happened in that moment I asked Denise later\nI just felt very angry that someone that was supposed to be sharing my point of view and my perspective was named blatantly disrespectful I'm completely shut off in human mean sitting next to me\nI honestly just like I needed to defend her um whether she was on my side their side and it doesn't matter\nIn that moment that moment of impact the enemy lines that actually shifted someone on the complete opposite end of the issue became an ally to Denise when there was a greater obstacle to overcome [noise]\nWant greater optical so we went back to the audio around\nAnd listen to the tanks shot him fake don't improv I drink at any apply rivalry reasonable ... or ... and there was one\nAgain and again the obstacles to consent to so many of the times with the same person written\nNow are you willing to put some words into the [noise]\nHe wasn't you know the the majority of the room shared his ideas I'm pretty much everything it was his approached\nThe conversation\nShe became the greater optical many times we\nWould all agree to an idea but in going around the room for consensus we should the blonde hair for everyone around but the problem is oh I Can't smoke here I Am an hour to anticipating his block to a new idea a rule I think he knew he was playing\nBefore [laughter] you know we're three here I Am again at MSU specifically because you're the you're in your mind is right now and then this happened\nNow are you willing to put some words no\nIt wasn't the content\nYou're in your mind is right now and then this happened\nNow are you willing to put cameras no\nIt wasn't the content of what he was saying\nIt was the way she was saying the intention behind it and that was because of his number the number he had\nA four six three ten to ... or what\nWas I remember those numbers and the sound guy was setting up as people who are sitting down and sipping their water nervously I Wonder how can I measure the degree of hope that they were bringing to this round table how can I can gauge their commitments to finding my list so Johnson's audio started recording you hear me asked\nThem how do you think is likely one to ten on finding some sort of some sort of Tom ... [noise] what do you honestly believe in them and then to me the\nNumbers were privately pass to me at the beginning of the conversation and never referred to again until it was time to leave three hours and forty six minutes later he was the actual moment the conversation ended and the numbers are revealed you'll hear Rick at the end\nIt's tough it's a tough one\nCan't wait to see where our numbers come out of\n[noise]\nAh it was [noise]\nSix three\nTen to ... or why why why why they were already know there was a race fires aren't on the one interesting\nRick was the one\nWe never had a chance\nIn fact the next day he sent me an email saying quote re on I think this was a good cause but the impact is far too high to catch them to be crossed and cooked\nA one will always diminished hope in any given room just the way that negativity lately overwhelms whatever true hope\nThere is out there we will be no Rick for whatever reason or whatever mood we've all been that person but a new one is a very powerful thing especially in a very divided America [noise]\nSo to me the answer for how do we move forward and work together to keep our children safer [noise]\nUsed to be any number greater than one\nThis is Denise at the end of all round table\nDenise who went on to open up her world to show a fellow American that she is an aide them\nDenise AS number is eight\n... sitting here like my heart and going out to each one and have for a day or you know your your viewpoints and I understand that it may not be one that that I you know get on board but I Believe you I Know where you're coming from that and I appreciate that [noise]\nWhat's interesting is Denise has been invited by Anna to attend a progressive groups and and I was taking progressive moms to the shooting range that the n._r._a. to learn more love it so the bridge is they are the British start with just sitting in the same room\nSo we as the one I think about coming to a solution in Washington I'm a zero [noise] when I think about the American people\n[noise] ... eight nine\nIt's funny because the only thing I think we never got my list I didn't say there was nothing we didn't agree on the only thing we all agreed on was that we had no faith in the government system that exists that was the only thing the seven of us all agreed on so\nSo from insistent that exist back with the only thing the seven of us all it can be done so I think that is part of the problem and I think the bats progress that we have the best shot we have is one on one banks rats that much [noise]", "show_name": "The Glenn Beck Program", "year": "2018", "city": "Charlottesville", "day": "09"}
