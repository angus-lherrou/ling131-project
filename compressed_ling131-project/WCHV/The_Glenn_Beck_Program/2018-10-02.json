tonight sprays of Brett Kavanaugh with respect\nHe's a fifth vote to the hard right turn on voting rights and so much more that will harm the Democratic process and prevent a more equal society\nOkay so in July she came out and she let everybody know I'm against him\nI think he's dangerous that that was just three months ago she exercise durability as we all do to to share with the world what our

could be worse than attempted rape Glenn well gang rape yeah but what could be worse than gang rape well\nHere we go\nEmily in the New York times reported that in September of Nineteen eighty five Brett Kavanaugh\n\nThrough glass of ice it somebody yes yes I'm\nSorry if this was a triggering event for you if you're all of a sudden like you remember somebody coming at you Jack Ross trying to stab you with the icicles I get it I get it I'm Sorry I had to bring this\nThat are on the list ts so so you've got you've got Mike ... you could select him let's just say Brett Kavanaugh's hit by a plane tomorrow which I wouldn't\nChange accident but it could happen and it happened in Indiana Jones a and and and ... one of them are the guy with their fighting on the ... yeah I was trying to run if that happens to Kevin\nWell this one they won't be delivering the arc in that plane there'll be delivering ah [noise] the New York times by plane but anyway so let's just say\nAnd it makes him and his opposite ... uh you need to announce that Mike Lee is the candidate\nWe're going to have this done by the election there of course going to go crazy because Mike Lee is ... pro life uh and he would vote\nFor him in the bottom line if he cares about the constitution anything I mean who will vote he will vote the constitution and he will also vote for a ride of life he's not going to go in there with an agenda but he is a right to life guy so Kevin I wasn't good enough here's Mike Lee\nThere's not going to be there is no drinking parties would likely there's just no drinking part maybe and it'll be like Mike is like\nAll right I Confess I I tasted beer in Nineteen eighty three I didn't really like it when I tried it wasn't root beer have you lived in a so anyway he's the only one that you could push through\nBecause if you don't if you don't have a plan immediately\nThen the Democratic plan works of delay\nThat and that's the most important point their strategy is not to say that Kavanaugh is a sexual abuse or their strategy is not to say anything about Kavanaugh specifically their strategies to delayed this thing so they can get to the election and if they get past the

before they seat the Senate\nBut I mean it's going to be really close and you might not make it really is the only thing you'd have that you have be able to get that through fascinating also is the guy that everybody in the Senate has to look at after they voted against\nI mean they will vote against it but Democrats will still do it but we'll we'll Jeff Flake vote against you know a highly I don't think so would a I think so you know I mean you know I don't know have good relationships with Lee even though they know they think he's gas service for for them and remember it's advice and

times laid them out\nAnd ridiculous detail yeah and we should go through each one of them because I I Would like because there is an idea that if there is let's say he perjured himself which is one of the things a lot of people are starting to throw around now they're starting to say well he perjured himself he lie is the thing he was trying to paint himself in the best possible\nIt was he perjured himself that maybe he did I don't know I mean I haven't seen any perjury about sex doesn't matter we forgot about that yeah um but ... ...\n... if he perjured himself look if we perjured himself for me it's a problem yeah I mean that to me it would it would matter on the context of it I guess I I I mean if what you mean like the booth thing like one of the things we're talking about it ... the ...\nYeah like a founding document of the word moved yeah this is like if you go back to the federalist papers out yet very Urban Dictionary [laughter]\nOkay the business or the Urban Dictionary right to abuse any list sits or illicit substance via insertion into one's rectum\nThat the number one meaning but that's the number one I have never heard of that\nBut to funneling oh now I don't get ... technical terms I don't know who says you know what I'm Bad it's better if we drink beer through our but\nBut apparently that's been done\nA [laughter] I didn't I didn't know you kind of I Know you could do that either is it and I don't recommend and it's not called really drinking if you do it that way now is really not learning here nothing no I don't know if you're\nIf you have bought blackouts if you know of a sudden your blood falls on an asteroid or not or okay okay so there's a there's the there's the the number one a ... or the next one is something that is whack dumb\nOr F up used to describe objects people or stuff you don't want to do so that\nUh you know that guy's a booth yeah that I feel like that's maybe also how I heard it now that you're saying it that way because this is kind of like an insult yeah\nRight I just know I I remember the words but I don't remember and connected to you know sticking things in [laughter] anyway ah here's one that kind of makes me feel a little better a synonym for weed okay yeah\nSo how does their sentences smelled use it in a sentence place smells that booth [laughter] now I assume that da da is what you're saying yeah smells that boom yeah yeah yeah it makes me feel uncomfortable fifth V. active lifting the ah the power out of a white ...\nThe uh the bow out of a whitewater kayak well going over rocks waves are waterfalls white\nUh in order to launch over hydraulics or rocks this entry sponsored by ... yeah is that what I never heard that before I Move the low tones noise a dog may okay typically when they are suspicious or unsure of whether they should actually bark or not\nI haven't heard a flatulence one but I have heard many things related to the ... uh which I think some ... another term for having sex that'd be in the bud Bob\n[laughter] okay so again [laughter] I think this is the interesting point here they're trying to say this is essentially perjury\nThere is no way that's perjury to me that is a bonkers claim the idea that did that word probably meant different things to different schools as as mine and yours did right as there are seven different definitions on Urban Dictionary for it now not just because flatulence didn't make it there does not mean that low locally that was not the way people used it but you do have the\nProblem of people in Georgetown Prep now starting to come out and saying look I I was for him and I don't think he did this for a good thing but now that he was saying that this is what these words mean come on man and and that he was never really fall down drunk yeah\nOkay well do you have that one too you want to go into this building acts as a\nAgain the lists of potential perjury or from for judge Kavanaugh um the next one is excessive drinking judge Kavanaugh portrayed himself in his testimony is enjoying a beer or two in in high school and as a college student but not as someone who often drink to excess during those years I drink beer with my friends and quote\nUm then this is disputed as what they say and the times his\nStatements are at odds with some of his classmates and how they remembered him nearly a dozen college classmates of judge Kavanaugh said they recalled a him indulging in heavy drinking some saying\nSo now it's not it's less than a dozen because someone was that during some saying a it was a beyond normal consumption ... parent parents had to go here to be sure a smaller number of classmates that his drinking was unacceptable\nSo again this is like\nJudging yourself and how much you drink is notoriously difficult as I Would assume Mr alcoholic over here will be able to tell you\nOr I mean the whole point is the toughest thing to do is it ... you're an alcoholic right yeah it's very possible and I would say likely that most people who drink to excess and these periods would not necessarily say that they're doing something abnormal even if they are\nHere's what I hear so I take this I took that testimony what I watched him talk about drinking it was very clear that he was getting drunk and and he said\nLook we drank drank ... drink\nTo excess we all did have you done that I mean I ... the on the drinking thing I don't consider this a problem because I\nI Believe that he was in effect saying yeah so there's a difference between a blackout mhm gay\nAnd maybe he had blackouts and didn't remember them I don't believe that at all you have a blackout you remember it you don't you don't remember what happened do you remember the ... I remember you were like oh crap I don't even remember now maybe at Seventeen you know your local ... I don't remember or maybe you're\nSeventeen and doing that but you have to consume a lot of alcohol I I you know I got to\nThat man is gay or ... expert witness yet in a Glenn Beck please come to the sort of a\nYou know to me\nGlenn Beck please come to that sort of a\nYou know to me\nI don't I make a generalization but with a specific accusation Ninety five percent of people who say they drank to the point of blacking out our line\nI Believe it's Ninety five percent I Believe that blackouts do exist but is extraordinarily rare I spend a week and France which I Can't believe my liver returned with me for sure it was going to be like you know what I'm saying on the beach here I\nI drink a lot of other I'd say I got to get back on dry out\nMy point though is that I had a lot to drink in my life you know certain times I've never even been remotely\nThe mountains and other than alcohol but you have to consume\nIn a very short period of yeah I Know I've done I I've I've done my homework on it uh and it's not exactly the way I have experienced it um apparently you can have blackouts if you drink a an enormous amount of alcohol if you if you were ...\nOr maybe um even if an enormous amount of alcohol gets into your bloodstream quickly you can blackout\n... I I have read places where they say it's rare someplace to say it's common I'm Sorry but I Do not believe I Believe it's a movie trick that most people you know they're like\nOh we do in ... we are six new right shut up\nNinety five percent of the Ninety five percent that's a lot I had a friend who had drank a lot in a very short period of time and blacked out a blackout fell off the stage and had to go to the hospital\nUm and that was a legit this was in college yeah and that was a legitimate like he drank way too much nothing he didn't do anything wrong he just fell off the stage and almost killed himself and didn't remember any of it but and and just remember being there but did not remember the falling or anything okay um and so I'm not saying it never happens but\nLike the idea that you would say to someone oh this guy's lying he did a blackout is completely absurd you can't you cannot you cannot accuse someone of lying about that\nOnly they would know if it occurred you can say that in this is what they are saying that he lied because he said you know he he gave the impression that uh he wasn't ever out of control falling down drunk\nWell okay I don't believe that but I also don't I wasn't left with that impression\nNo he said I mean the quote busy I drank beer with my friends almost everyone did sometimes I had too many beers sometimes others that I like beer I still like beer but they're not drink beer to the point of blacking out he just said I didn't blackout in and say to drink to excess and back he said I have a drink to excess\nAnd you know I mean I Am not a big drinker and my life but I drink to excess several times but never I mean the idea of the goodness of black blackout drunk and you're a maybe a different story like our trunk is I mean you've told me some of the levels of alcohol you've had in your life\nThe levels are almost in human [laughter] like I Would definitely be dead they near you I mean you're dumping poison into your system of it\nYour body can handle it a blackout is shutting your body down ... saying I Can't keep you alive and to run all of these\nOther systems right I mean that's that's you know that's intense so we have a couple of more of these and go through yeah if we need to but I mean I think you get the point this is the level of almost every one of these accusations so I don't think that are in the right thing I don't think the ...\nUm what about\nThe well let me take a break come back there's two things that could pose a problem for him\nYou know some people are asking like why are you given up on cabinet I'm not not all I thought it was a fifty percent chance maybe higher then you get through the issue here is if he doesn't I mean because if you have\nI'm not not all I Know there's a fifty percent chance maybe hire that you get through the issue here is if he doesn't I mean 'cause if you have faith here you're having the non Kavanaugh Collins and Murkowski and ... if you have faith in them then fine don't worry about it but if you don't like I don't\nThen you better have planned be set up by the way I just want to make that really clear I'm not giving up on him at all\nI'm just playing this out scene where the Democrats are headed than we do and how will that affect those three senators [noise]\nBy July twenty Seventeen bitcoin was down forty percent taken tore came in and said Palm Beach in the Palm Beach letter a ... there's going to be some activity it's going to bring enormous amounts of money into bits going\nOrder quickly on line right now at sea veil dollar saver dot com\nMay be formulated ... when you have activists\nQuickly on line right now at sea veil dollar saver dot com\nWhich may be formulated ... when you go back to work formula why not keep ... most days I don't even have time for the lines and there's no place to pomp without imposing on my co workers you just need free me cops they slipped into your profit you can pump with your current your desk and make it easy for me I think\nThat lactation consultant at the hospital mentioned as go to ... dot com slash radio for deals starting adjust sixty dollars that F.

house to the Democrats\nThe Democrats than are going to demand testimony from Donald Trump because they're going to try to impeach him they're going to demand is tax records because they're going to impeach him and the White House response by going to the Supreme Court and says that the president of the time to do this yadda yadda\nUm and the Democrats then em wants a Kavanaugh to recuse himself she won't do and you won't do it doesn't happen a and the the house then moved to impeach Kavanaugh guy so we've got a\nYear or ... or like originally plausible ... okay uh let's say he's not confirmed because flake or Collins or Murkowski or Heller guy they just don't believe him and the Republicans dropped the ball they have NO PLAN\nAnd they just like whoa you know and where do you need your vote because we're a repeal Obamacare do they lose the house and possibly the Senate worst case scenario is that don't get they don't get them through down because the Republicans and because of this week with Jeff Flake\nPeople are just like okay the Republicans are worthless and they don't come out with a huge plant yeah I think you're right they'll try to turn that into a reason to get to the polls but if if the Republicans that cause it I don't know that it was going to work I don't think it'll work\nOK mothers scenario he is confirmed\nIt was a house in beaches Trump\nThe house or impeach is Kavanaugh on perjury\n[laughter] think that is if they win the house you know they're gonna at least attempt and they will attempt Trump and probably Kavanaugh to correct if we lose the

Trump OK mhm\nThe only one that seems good to me is I'm a ... if Kavanaugh loses the vote\nThe only one that I think works out is Kavanaugh loses the vote which could be really bad because it will be

who you just know oh my gosh that's a skill Leah\nRight now Brett Kavanaugh has not been a lot of people's favorites\nBut about guy somebody who you just know oh my gosh that's a skill Leah\nRight now Brett Kavanaugh has not been a lot of people's favorites I mean they're okay with him but no I was willing to die of the sword for I mean remember remember Kavanaugh was not on the initial list of judge right from Trump and there's lots of them the item leader I personally think the best course of action\nIs to nominate let's say let's say flake and Collins come out and go you know what I Can't do it I'm not going to vote on friday I Can't vote for him great\nDonald Trump with in ten minutes should be on television and say in my opinion Mike Lee is the next the nominee and you know what he's

just thought abortion right there at the time and place they'd have about everybody correct and that's not going to hurt conservatives getting to the polls\nAnd your own family so that's I think when I started turning towards you know they're having a curiosity about what it was about and then when I moved to Denver and lived in Colorado and other places I saw what it was really about and um and how people treated it and how like an NRA members of the most responsible person on her\nYou know when it comes to gun so uh yeah and I don't know if that people\nKnow they don't they don't understand that at all hum it take me through some of the stories that you you talk about because I Would I like about this this is not a gun is not a book about um you know necessarily the laws and everything else this is a story about America and how\nWe we do have I mean we're unlike any other nation on earth when it comes to guns in our history take me through like a either Sam colder or buffalo bill who am I ...\n... ... one of the most amazing Americans that ever lived I mean not only was he an engineer and and just created this incredible innovation where\nA person one from firing one you know must get shot once a minute or maybe twice a minute to shooting five times in mere seconds he was also just an innovator and in in marketing in selling himself in\nAnd using the press to to to sell sell to other people and using\nAnd using engineering to to create something that he can make cheaper so their normal American than normal man the normal woman can get their hands on it and um changed the west\nIt changed the way that the relationship a person has with with a weapon and I'm ... you know he was before Henry Ford he was using interchangeable parts it was like first industrial revolution so he was just amazing man and almost it was my favorite chapter to right I think she needs you know more when it ...\nIt on him yeah so I'm here we are at the the one year anniversary of a Las Vegas shooting of Las Vegas [noise] um did you and you're looking through history did you ever find another time in American history and I shouldn't say\nYou know a pre progressive uh where guns had been viewed in America as anything but good\nNo I I sort of actually you know in in the in the nineteenth century guns were sort of idealized and romance books and things of that nature it wasn't until the thirty is really when I started to think about [noise] um and and and\nFor some good reason people running around with machine guns shooting up places you can go now swear so I mean there was a legitimate fear that some people had [noise]\nUm but before that time no one even thought to limit gun ownership in any way I mean certain places in the west maybe they have certain areas where you couldn't have a gun because everyone was drunk and fighting but generally no one had to go and ask the government the state\nUh for a gun I think in fact that when you think about the second amendment how you think about the ideal is behind it tells us a lot about how do you think about freedom in general I think you're pretty authoritarian if you think that the individual shouldn't be able to defend themselves in a rather should rely solely on the state\n'cause you could have um you could have had a gambling and I think you can still buy a gambling I'm legally ah but you could buy a gambling gun but we didn't have those you know the mass shootings\nOr one it's a little harder to conceal of gambling gun in a violin case but also because the government's prohibition of alcohol led to the formation of these huge terrible and powerful mobs\n[noise] yeah and you know they used Tommy guns and you see them in a movie or movies and um you know it's kind of fix it's fictitious only and that that the gun has ... you know big blow back and it's not that easy to shoot\nAnd um you know it's kind of fix it's fictitious only in that but the gun has come you know big blow back and it's not that easy to shoot and it was almost never really used in criminal activity it was more scare mongering by people who want it to ban I'm not I'm not saying people should have Tommy guns and driving around in their cars but I'm just\nSaying I I Am yeah I'm okay with that if you're responsible citizen I'm fine with that that's true that's very well so it's so I'm David I'm when we were together how long does ten years ago\nSo I I don't know if it yeah almost\nYeah so ten years ago if I Would have said to you in your lifetime do you think there will be a serious move\n'em that either comes close or does take away America's right to guns you would have thought that was a crazy question if I'm not mistaken do you think\n[noise] ten you actually yeah I Do but I Do feel better about the second amendment than I Do the first for the fifth and others because there were four hundred\nMillion guns out there and I think that the people who who are part of the culture that I'm writing about and talking about will not hand them over that easily so I'm I'm less worried about them than I Am a [noise] a certainly a First Amendment I think for most but others as well\nWill you lose the second to and you definitely lose the first ... I Wonder I Wonder uh you know I Wonder what it's going to take before people wake up to the road that we're we're sadly on\nUh the name of the book is first freedom a ride through America's enduring history of the gun is a great read David harsh sunny first freedom it's out today you can get it as Amazon or wherever books are sold David thanks so much\nFor having gone\n[noise]\nSo our sponsor this half hour his ex chair now I Love it when a a client is the also somebody that I use that I Love\nI'm an ex chair in my office and I love it it is I'm I'm kind of a week or two ways on this one still mhm\n[noise] I'm a visual guy yes and uh I like the visual a window\nEspecially in our studios here I like things to be visual I've never noticed but yeah I haven't noticed that yes uh and so I remember we bought these chairs um I I Can't remember what they're called everybody knows what they are those really expensive chairs some big designer made\nTheir ...

I don't want to just take one site 'cause I'm not God so I don't know what happened\nI happen to believe Kavanaugh or a on forward and most of that is because Ford has changed her testimony several times a day you just did it or to there is nothing support it but I maybe she's telling the truth I don't know I'm not God\nSo if I have to put them in a room and choose one or the other I'm going to choose him because I don't think she has enough evidence for me to credibly say\nYeah he's a bad guy and even if I kind of believe her I still would ... there's a ... there that it's not an him yeah he's not if not proven negative correct so I I Hope he didn't do it um and I don't think she has proven that he did by any stretch it out I don't mean beyond a shadow of a doubt I mean just\nA preponderance of evidence that inclination I mean I honestly at this point I Do not believe you did it I ... I don't need to not believe I don't either I'm now that's not to say I'm as you point out we're not God even though a pretty cool um so it's possible okay but I I don't I don't believe that he\nDid right so we've plowed this field over and over and over again you know how come nobody is plowing the field on how much they've destroyed her life Senator Feinstein has destroyed her life\nThey lied to her several times lied to her she requested anonymity they released a letter anyway causing a chain of events that would obviously reveal who she was um\nLied to obviously they lied to her about the Democrats are the Republicans not willing to come out and take her testimony in California yeah she was surprised by that\nIn real tired real time and had several people she told about it at the moment and again we have no one that forward told about it at the moment in fact in any moment of until at least two thousand twelve where it does not appear she actually he had like who Kavanaugh said the name Kavanaugh even at that time yeah\nBut but but ... and I mean you I mean you don't have videotape\nWell there you go to your tape now we haven't seen it yet though are now there is allegedly videotape that exist some one of these physical altercation we ... we have not seen it yet I'm of course there's no video of the Kavanaugh thing because you know that wouldn't be the thing\nThat we have to take her word that there is video with the\n... and we don't have that evidence yeah we have a a ton of evidence and in fact I don't know hundreds of times more there's really no evidence in the forties so we I mean like we have them out more I was like we have a preponderance of evidence in in the Alice in case the however um\nWhat's interesting about this is that fifty six percent of Democrats believe Christine Blasey Ford's allegations fifty six percent only eight percent say they ... they believe Kavanaugh fifty six to eight\nIs a split there so you assume\nThat if you ask people and it wasn't a partisan situation what do you think about the Alison situation do what do you believe from her 'cause she's got a more recent allegation\nShe'd actually brought it to the attention in real time to multiple people people around her have seen evidence of this there's text messages there is a there are medical notes all the evidence that we just talked about there's an infinity amount times more evidence in the elephant case yet\nThere's a there are medical notes all the evidence that we just talked about there's an infinity amount times more evidence in the elephant case\nGet only five percent of Democrats believe Allison's accuser we're told over and over again that women are to be believed it only five percent of Democrats believe the allegations against Keith Ellison and here's\nWhy this is really important I'm just like I don't want an abuser and the Supreme Court if if there was the amount of evidence on Kavanaugh that there is on a Keith Ellison\nI Would not be for Kavanaugh would you\nIf there was a ... on ... no I wouldn't yeah I Would if if if the evidence was the same thing yeah I was\n[noise]\nWe still have a standard here in this country um called innocent until proven guilty and preponderance of evidence is a slower is a lower level than that\nAnd I understand that um my issue here would be\nYou can once there isn't the legal standards because people will say well this is just a job interview or this is just that this isn't a legal proceeding once you have the absence of a legal standard you have to choose the standard you apply\nI Choose to apply a very high standard because people who are in relationships many many times when he relationships and breakup or someone feels jolted say things that are not true I\nHaving all that I agree with all the way we are in this case\nI'm Keith Ellison should have the right to defend himself and\nHe should we should assume his innocence unless I agree point in which he is and if especially with the case like this where it's very recent that should just go through the legal system\nAnd when he comes out of he's guilty then he should get thrown out of that job and you can factor that in in your vote if you wish but I don't think he should lose any job because of this at this point he needs to you need to be able to see\nWhether this case goes through and and claims are proven someone had said they have video we need to see the video we see everyone or ... in investigated we need to see an actual police\nAh investigation and go through and and and the weather the evidence leads us to a belief that he actually committed these acts if we do not get that\nYou do not ruin people's lives over it I mean think about the amount of tons of evidence\nThat there is a with Keith Ellison overall anymore\nWhich everyone I mean even at a lot of people on the right where like look ... really looked like he did these things his answers are really bad ...\nYou know there's much more evidence for ... much more of those people you can interview right now yeah children who went through traumatic moments where they had to read about their mom being abused or you know sure her telling other friends at the time\nThat being said however you get did you you went through this process where the presumption of innocence agree\nSo but what I Know about she fell assumes the evidence against him okay\nAssuming this was not current day and it was thirty five years ago if Ford would come with that evidence I have letters I have a photo of the bruises on my arm\nHave um ah I can tell you where it happened I told my friends\nHere they are they verify that I told them after the party ... would you not\nWould you not go okay I think that's good yeah I mean I think that would be enough and it was the only way we can judge this situation wrecked right correct here it is with Alison and again this is why it's important just like I don't want to have a Supreme Court justice\nCorrect here it is with Alison and again this is why it's important just like I don't want to have a Supreme Court justice that is an abuser or a liar or whatever\nI also think it's extraordinarily dangerous\nTo have a guy who may have beaten his girlfriend may have mentally abused his girlfriend assuming the evidence is real and checks out\nYou can't have him as the as the the the chief law enforcement of the state\nRight and does anybody care no this shows you that nobody in the media cares\nAnd iota for this woman and her story they don't care if she was abused and they don't care about any of it what they care about is stopping Brett Kavanaugh\nIf they care they would be just as passionate as a guy let's not just thrown out of the Minnesota attorney general this is a guy who was second in charge of the deep what the the DNC ... this is not a a a ... a peripheral figure in politics he's one of the most powerful Democrats in America and it's now going to be a chief law enforcement officer for state\nAnd you could say oh well it's all you're what you're doing is what about is um\nNo no it's not it's not what about his him I apply the same standard to Allison that I applied to Kavanaugh you weren't doing this to Kevin I Would still be saying this about I'm I'm a about Alice yeah and look at\nGo back to why it's bracket why was Brock Obama president right brought about was president because he won a presidential election in two thousand eight\nPreviously he made a heck of a speech\nAnd what two thousand four and a two thousand four ... election he won a Senate seat a Senate seat that would have been incredibly close if he was going against not Alan Keyes who they flew in the last week to to start a campaign\nBut it was a Jack Jack Ryan but it might be thinking of John ... at this point I'm [laughter] I think too many Amazon commercials but a Ryan was his last name and he was a legitimate challenger\nTo Brock Obama in that Senate race it was a close election and he may have won it as a Republican in Illinois wow\nAnd what they did is they went through his divorce is sealed divorce ah um hearings and his and paperwork or out of it to the public and in there there are accusations by his wife the actress who had said they went to a swingers clubs and all this sort of shady stuff\nDo we know if that was true in added horse proceeding and the divorce proceeding people make all sorts of claims yeah and that's why you don't just believe them that's why they're already old because they went and got them unsealed in a democratic state\nThey they they ... Brian eventually dropped out there was no real opposition for Rocco bomb and you've got eight years of him\nThat sort of thing should be always viewed skeptically\nEvery claim of a crime should be viewed skeptically by people on that side you're supposed to give the presumption of innocence and they're all close to start with skepticism of a claim on any side on any side on any side of all people who are accused and here we are in a situation where Democrats overwhelmingly believe the accusations against Kavanaugh with almost no evidence\nAnd they only five percent of them believe the woman who is a Democrat who does not want someone of a ideologically opposed to ... to ... ... email us into have that job she's a Democrat\nAnd only five percent of people believe her the the platitudes you hear from the media and the left mean nothing on the story they do not care about whether Ford was abused or not they don't [noise]\nAnd the story they do not care about whether Ford with abused or not they don't [noise]\nAnd this shows you how fast that standard is applied and how [noise]\nAnd how your life could be destroyed [noise]\nYou are on the wrong side of an issue and by the way\nI think you've seen\nThe issues to change\nAnd positions what's politically correct changes and if you don't abide one hundred percent and you're not on the right side will destroy your life [noise]\nWhile they'll let somebody else be fine [noise]\nThis is why we must have a standard we must have a standard [noise] getting dangerous to be an American [noise]\nThat's the frightening thing to say [noise]\nI've been telling about gold mines do silver maple flex bar that to the maple flex\nBar here still can you open this up and and uh and break some people's pieces off what it is it's it's a it's a it's a bar of silver", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Glenn Beck Program", "city": "Charlottesville", "day": "02"}
