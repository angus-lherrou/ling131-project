Univision just reported this morning that there were people with terrorists ties ah from Malaysia involved in emitted in this\nAnd and I've heard the same thing with ... with regard to a terrorist coming from countries other than Malaysia and I'm thinking about this if these people really were trying to escape by horrific life on whatever country they're coming\nFrom why is it that they are marching with the flag of the country that they're coming from ... you know that\nThey they are not coming to the United states of America to make the United states of America a better place they're not coming to the United states to ... a ... from the dangerous they have in fact there were multiple reports on TV last night and he channeled would have shown at\nUh the interviews with these people in the Caribbean and they were talking about what was their strategy or when they get us and they said it's very simple and those are numbers are overwhelm the United states ability or to uh go

something if we lose control of our border they released lose control of our sovereignty\nWe're no longer a sovereign nation and we must step up and use every tool that we can to make sure that we put an end to this care and because I understand this clean also when that has this maybe two or three or five thousand people but they make it in right behind\nThem in Europe at of twenty thousand people behind that will be a caravan of fifty thousand people and the United states of America as we know it will be forever altered who don't do something to stop this\nYou know the press is going to treat us like the Israelis and the caravan like the Palestinians um is the president leaning on the president of Mexico and\nThreatening to cut off all I mean if I mean I think this is the time to really lean hard and say this is not our problem turn them around or we'll cut off all aid with with Mexico is there a chance of this or\nWhether the president has been outspoken about cutting off aid to Honduras and brought them out right now that the the United States is working collaboratively in in in this might be hard to believe\nAbout cutting off aid\nTo Honduras and brought 'em out right now that the the United States is working collaboratively in in in this might be hard to believe so I Want to emphasize that\nAh the u._s. is working collaboratively with Mexico Mexico has made a decision that they have not made in the past Mexico is working with the United nations or to try to work on a temporary settlement of these care band members\nIn Mexico elm in so many Mexico's is is actually\nPlaying a ... a very beneficial role in this whole process with us right now and we applaud Mexico for what they're doing or at least as of\nThis moment in time\nOr they headed towards taxes no no invasion plans of the United states with the former Soviet Union every included taxes because they knew Texans would not take kindly to the invasion force are they headed towards a Lexus or California\nI Will tell you what are what was reported publicly last night and I will not disputed and and that is a early on before yesterday on there was great concern that they were headed for Texas and it was reported last night that they are headed toward California\nNow that makes sense because as you know California is a ... state yeah and and they ... they would welcome this caravan and Tim or caravans like it and and and these care by members and the leaders of this caravan\nThey understand one thing and that is a if they try to breach the gates in Texas or we're not going to tolerate it and we're going to be very uh you know protective of our sovereignty here and so uh I Can't tell you for certain to right now where they're going ah I can tell you what was said and what makes sense and that is they may be headed to California\nLast question that one is the way the same as you know what was\nThere in the United states there in the United states' rights and once they're here they they can migrate anywhere\nRight um the your campaign is going really well you're a great governor and um and I don't think your election is a is a going to be um a in jeopardy at all\nHow is how is a Ted Cruz how how is Ken Paxton how has Dan Patrick\nWell listen all these all these races are closer than what people will realize and it is because uh we we need to understand\nA

know in the in the lantern\nThere's an opening right there right at and I I think I Would make the same point whiz with the cloth device first of all cloth does not seem difficult to penetrate but secondly there is an opening for the eyes I mean the the genie could just go\nAhead go right through there to get into the head of the person right now they do I mean just from a pragmatic now they do perspective you just go right through there as long as you're wearing gloves\nA full body you know are covering and then your head is wrapped and you're just have the eyes\nNow your eyes can be used

right this is virtually if she's been possessed by a gym I mean you know this is the\nThing we were talking about this off the air a little bit because you know Donald Trump used the word nationalist yesterday when we're talking about nationalism and what the definition of nationalism in its history is is at times very disturbingly um however you know I don't know I'm sure that's not obviously no one is citing\nThe really bad examples of nationalism as it as where we're trying to go if you're Donald Trump you're not saying all we want to be like those terrible countries he seems to be referring to it as like look we're the best country and we were routed and we have a great the best you know culture and went and we should be\nA you know patriotic and and and be ... up you know sure excited about that but when you talk like this that when you\nWhen you play a clip like that it's hard to kind of argue that we don't have a superior culture and a lot of ways\nYou know like I can only say that because you've probably been possessed by Jim ... this is the gym tolerated\nAnd now it's a different kind of June ... threat was times I've had lasagna\nOf of ... they are in my life I got to say it's trouble yeah it it gets you into believing in the bottle adds up ...\nWhat do you think is is worse for America to have thousands of people come in that shouldn't be here and you have to chase them around and process in order to kill a bunch of people on the border who were coming in wanting passwords for America can\nYeah you're you're going to extremes here and I want to adopt something you said earlier which is the national guard approach National Guard troops are trained to deal with riots I expect to see military\nAnd National Guard and border patrol in riot gear that's how I expect this to be handled at the border if they're not coming in at entry points and to turn them away right there it's an invasion treated as an invasion turn way\nYou see this as an invading force these people they're not only legally\n\nNow the media is trying to say wait a minute wait a minute this is an invasion invasion force and how can we turn these poor people away\nAnd I want you to listen to all of the people on television that are now saying\nWe are a country that has always had open arms to migrants we're always the country that I mean our our values or have always our greatest strength is our tolerance and are welcoming spirit\nReally is coming from the left because I've always\nFelt that way but you've always told me that we have a rape culture not a tolerance culture\n... ... well I've always thought we welcomed immigrants in but you'll always told us that we have anything that is foreign\nI've always believed that our our laws reflected a nation of immigrants but you'll have always said that our laws are racist and a half from the beginning bend a system of oppression so which is it which is it\nHow can you tell me that we've always been a country that is welcoming immigrants\nAnd our laws are set up as a nation of immigrants\nAnd yet tell me that we are the most depressive monstrous society ever that only embraces a rape culture\nYou can't have it both ways which are we are we a are we a country that is that embraces a a rape culture or as or\nAs any rational\nNon Marxist post modernist might say or are we a little of both\nAre we are we a country that tries to be this way and sometimes we fail to see you can't really say that because then you can throw the baby and the bath water out\nWhich is why we've been saying hey baby is a good thing the bath water may need to be changed but let's not throw the baby\nWhich is why we've been saying hey baby is a good thing the bath water may need to be changed but let's not throw the baby out too but that's not in your argument the radicals\nThose who don't believe in any kind of border security at all your the one leading the charge that we do all this land\nThis land doesn't belong to us\nThat were all afraid because we're white people and white people are bad\nAnd now you're on TV saying that we've always had this culture that welcomes immigrants wealthy [noise] um it is\nTrue we've always had a culture that has welcomed immigrants we are a nation of immigrants but we have also felt that you've always needed to come here and not want to dismantle us\nThat you came here because [noise] because you saw the American dream and most immigrants do most immigrants seeing the American dream and they've come from someplace else you notice these guys are coming from Honduras they're\nNot stopping in Mexico why they would probably have an easier life in Mexico just blending in they speak the language why why would you come to America and why not just walk through America up to Canada they've got free health care\nThinking that\nThey have all kinds of his anti hate laws and speech laws there a progressive utopia they have free universal healthcare why not just marched through us it and go to Canada\nBecause\nOne of two things either Canada is not\nThe beacon\nAmerica is for all those who are the poor and the tired in the huddled masses\n\nOr this is a political move\nBecause you're not going to Canada because it's not about you your life the job\nIt's a political move it to destabilize\nTo help push a country over the edge now I don't know which one it is but I Do know this\nSeventy five hundred people coming across our border in mass\nIs not helpful and shouldn't happen you lose control of your borders let me ask you this if all of a sudden

Tac the tower is saying hey guys guys guys wait a minute wait a minute what are you doing can't land here can land here would you be okay with that\n\nOr would you think that might cause chaos and might be dangerous would you think that if Sea Tac airport cannot control the skies if they lose control of their airport they're not really an airport\n\nWhy does that work for an airport but it doesn't work for a country we lose control of our borders and people are just coming whenever they want and they can just get a big huge mass of people because they're Seventy five hundred people can do it surely they can get twenty thousand\nAnd they will try to win\nAnd they can just get a big huge mass of people because if Seventy five hundred people can do it surely they could get twenty

somebody who's pretty well versed in media circles about this and and about ... a few weeks ago and he's saying that like the the media knows this guy is a nut job ... they know he's in a job they know he's crazy really they know he is not a real player and they actually don't like him\nThey were just waiting for that moment to be able to charge them get rid of him and here it is we are here they've just now they're all reporting on how all of his finances are terrible there from all the background on his on his his uh you know\nSettlements in court that all could've been done months ago you know they're they're just they're all set with him now they're serving interesting didn't work out yeah so they moved down to something which is an intriguing he'll be at the Planned Parenthood setting up his office I'm sure so\nI'm sure I'm sure he's got to go someplace listen to this and this is the way the media does these things right listen to this now George Soros reportedly had an explosive device in his mailbox a over overnight mhm which needless to say but we should say in any way is a horrific idea if\nIn his mailbox a over overnight mhm which needless to say but we should say in any way is a horrific idea if anyone were ever to do that and you are an awful person in every respect or if you were to be responsible for such\nAnd other days for the rest of my entire life up until last five or six years\nI Would say it it goes beyond saying that this shouldn't happen\nBut now you have to use as if you don't say that well what does he looked he was condoning it\nYeah and and beyond that just goes to what we were talking about yesterday with Nancy Pelosi harassing Nancy Pelosi while she's out in the streets these are terrible terrible ideas heroin and the the left\nDon't do the things they're doing we've seen that the left has been violent or ask people who were playing baseball this congressional baseball game\nOr you know we've seen that before we've seen uh the harassment of officials in places I Would much rather have the on our argument or as as in our repertoire of argument that we're not we're not the ones doing that they are so don't plan to that\nI you know I Know no one in this audience would and we have no idea by the way who did this I mean certainly the speculation is is that George Soros opponent um you know someone on the on the right but I mean could be his wife I'm just saying we have no idea who it is right\n[laughter] um but listen to this coverage from the New York times now look I get that they are liberal I get it\nAnd I understand that they're not going to look at George Soros may be the same way that I Do and\nThis is just to the point of like you've checked out mentally know write up a\nPiece of a story that says this come on\nThough Mr ... name has become a trigger for a subset of Republicans and conservatives but right off the bat you're just condescending right it's not that he's done anything you could possibly disagree might trigger a name and forget there several countries\nHave named him an enemy of freedom not like I've been room put people but like a leaf pass\nLaws again [laughter] yeah it is a subset you know just just about six countries\nHave named him in it you know a a a danger to their freedom in a band any of his money you know from coming into the country\nBut that's just a small subset so how do you have any country [laughter] there's a ... you know\n... and the word trigger I think that's normal use conservative and say like some uh students here's a word they don't like and they go hide in a safe space that they were triggered right and like it's a condescending term again for a talk show hosts for a ... for Huffington Post blogger in line to use then sort of like for the New York times\nDid they uh the Mr sources name as a as a trigger a U.S\nForce subset of Republicans conservatives visited the airport who he is a\nHe has said that his main goal is a political activist was to see a return of bipartisanship\n[laughter] of the ... world do you have to believe that she reports that everybody says they want bipartisanship\nGeorge Soros is that a bipartisan figure\nHe is one of the largest donors in the history of the Democratic party and he ... he launched a foundation that is funneled money to every crazy left wing calls on the planet well we're supposed to without question there is not like an argument the only thing we hear from conservatives are triggered by his name\nWhat's his name George so sorry it's it's so it's just happens sometimes\nSaid if you know it's a crazy is you know who's more bipartisan the Koch brothers totally further yeah\nIt's just happens sometimes\nHe said you know it's a crazy is you know who's more bipartisan the Koch brothers totally\nFurther yeah they're they're they're not conservatives they're libertarian which means they give to both sides sometimes they're on this side sometimes they're on that site foreign socialist on social issues almost exclusively with them or they're not conservative and yet they're not bipartisan they're evil\nIt's actually it's in comprehensive some of the coverage listen to this one this is from uh New York times as well this is their story about how anatomy does not determine gender experts say that's a headline\nLet me just say that again would you say that again anatomy does not determine gender experts say God and now this is a force to push back on Trump's policy to use biological sex as a as an actor and and I guess you don't get to just make it up anymore\nI'm ... I mean listen to this and I read this several times ... and it's actually changed and meaning as I've read it but listen to this\nHow do you define identity researchers say gender identity comes from the brain not the body some put it more bluntly it originates between your ears not between your legs now\nWhat they seem to be describing there is something different than we're describing what they're describing is a feeling\nRight like I feel like I'm a woman now you can feel like you're a woman\nI Believe ... at one point felt like a woman and I'm actually still ...\nFluid but it's ... who knows a put like to say that you feel that way is almost in a in a in a in a roundabout sort of way a criticism\nOf transgender ism right we're a conservative would say you're not transgendered you just feel like you're transgendered that's a different thing would have that is what it is that would be in the feeling\nWhich used to be called if I'm not mistaken gender ...\nAnd any that feeling it was a was categorized by medical scientists as something that was harmful\nTo your mental health right but I was there and and and certainly there are cases like that or where at least there used to be that there were admitted as a as a you know a real problem with in in mental health however there are other cases to wear like for example we used to use the term tomboy right for a girl who\nSeemed to like to do a lot of the things that voice it may be acted like a boy a little bit and you call that person a tomboy you didn't call them a an actual boy it was it was a nickname for someone who was a girl what acted like a boy and I guess my question here would be if it's true\nGender comes from the brain not the body or a originates between your ears not between your legs why do they have surgery\nWhy do why did they change what is between their legs if it had nothing to do with what's between their legs why these two things associated all they seem to be talking about a collection of personality attributes right like\nI like I like sports I like you know I like action movies I like you know giant and prime rib eye have generally issues at our interests that are with the males therefore I'm male they're talking about male interests or something you know who will\nBe able to explain this who's going to be able to make sense one way or another explain both sides is a doctor Deborah so yes she'd be great let's call her up have her own tomorrow because I'd like an explanation of\nWhy bother getting your genitals changed if it's got nothing to derive genitals and isn't that just gender this for a\nLike an explanation of that\nWhy bother getting your gender those changed if it's got nothing to derive gentle\nAnd isn't that just gender this for a a and haven't we at times said that's bad what research has shown us\nThat it's not bad because suicide rate remains the same\nSo we we've ... you know we've said this was this was bad because the genders four year leads all kinds of different things and general unhappiness\nOkay so what research said that if we say that it's not bad and we go through with surgeries and everything that it will lead to a different outcome\nAnd I think that's an important piece of it I mean I think the outcomes are not all that positive but beyond that whether the outcome is good or bad there is truth\nI don't know like I don't understand like the word gender meant sex organs\nForever mhm okay and if you want it instead of changing the word gender ... to mean something new\nThen instead say okay actually this is an interesting a personality trait they see they seem to see themselves as a man and and isn't that interesting and they can do what they what they want I have no interest in what they're doing to themselves\nOr from a perspective from a libertarian perspective and whatever that they ... but like there is also a fact her\nSo let's get into this tomorrow because the fact on gender when you say well it used to be sex well yeah it used to being sex but it doesn't now and the guy who changed it was a psychopath yeah oh yeah and uh we'll we'll start with that and let's see if we can get a doctor so on tomorrow's", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Glenn Beck Program", "city": "Charlottesville", "day": "23"}
