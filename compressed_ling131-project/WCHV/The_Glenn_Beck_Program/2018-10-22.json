you to do a um an hour and a half uninterrupted podcast with me sender when you have time um because I think your voice needs to be hurt and understood\nAnd parts of it challenged I'm sure but uh I I Would like to just pick up on this point so the number one driver of happiness is vocation\nYour one guy that will understand this if that's true in the next ten years we're in deep trouble\nWe're headed toward a really interesting time in human history it's scary and fascinating so somebody some people's shorthand for this of the ... the economy I think the simpler way to think about it is just um the average duration of people's jobs or their relationship at a firm is going to get shorter than ever before in human history\nSo let's go macro for a minute hunter gatherers throughout most of human history\nYou don't have any conception of what your job is you pursue that buffalo right and then ten thousand years ago people settled down and started planting and harvesting and we we into farm on a on a regular cycle and from ten thousand years ago ... hundred and fifty years ago nobody had job choice they just did with grandma and grandpa and mom and dad and aunts and uncles had ever had done forever eternity past\nWith the industrial revolution we get job specialization and it was really disruptive but when people took a job\nThey still kept it till death of retirement not everybody graduated high school at the beginning of the industrial revolution\nBy the end almost everybody does but you still get one job at some time between Fifteen and twenty two years old and you keep it for all of your life I was born in the Nineteen seventies average duration at a farm for a primary breadwinner then was still twenty six years now it's four years and getting shorter\nAnd it's got to get shorter forever more McKenzie a farm I used to work with believes that fifty percent of the American labor market by three years from now this is not Twenty years in the future\nThree years from now they take fifty percent of the labor market will be primarily freelancers\nMeaning that most people will cobble together a bunch of different jobs not all of them are going to be ap enabled tech jobs like being a new driver with the right software that makes you more efficient than an old school Gabby but\nWhat's really going to happen is we're going to head toward a world where people are going to get disrupted out of their jobs at aged forty and forty five and fifty and fifty five\nDebbie but what's really going to happen is we're going to head toward a world where people are going to get disrupted out of their jobs at aged forty and forty five and fifty and fifty five forever more we've never ever done that in human history and so it means all of the banks of what's often called now the quarter life crisis\nThe sort of late adolescence crisis of trying to figure out your your role in life and how do you go from just being a consumer and mom and dad's house to be in a producer\nThat cannot just put bread on the table for your kids but can actually have a sense of meaning that you're serving your neighbor that disruption that most people know in late adolescence working experience that again every three to five years for our whole life and that means there's a lot of new potential for upheaval and frankly for unhappiness\nThere's going to be more economic output than it's ever been produced before in human history but it's not at all clear that it will redound to the median family in the median household and the media and worker or going to have to become a civilization of lifelong workers able to get retrained when you're forty nobody's ever done that before\nOkay so there's about an hour of questions on on that one uh but I've got about three minutes left can you give me\nA ... your take on the first real political upheaval that we're going to see that I think by twenty twenty you could change everything could start global wars deep fakes\nYeah so one of the reasons I wrote them is because I spent a lot of time on intelligence issues and I'm In the intel community there are people who talk about the perfect storm of deep fakes that we have coming\nAnd the storm is these three ingredients number one new technology makes it possible to sort of narrow cast a world with fake audio and fake video where lots of people can be susceptible to being sort of um a\nSpoof or persuaded the things that aren't real are real\nThere's always been enemies doing malicious act or you know information warfare since the beginning of time you can find it in proverbs in college he asked these uh to sow discord in an enemies tent\nBut it used to require a prostitute and honey trapping effect\nBusiness partner in a bribery scheme and more right you had to get people around people number one is now we can use technology to surround someone and give them a fake experience and ... are fake audio and fake video that are going to seem real to make that possible number to Russia is already trying this constantly against us they're just bad at it\nThe real reason we need to take the Russia type investigation so seriously us because China's right behind them\nRunning scout team off since I'm On them and ready to do\nBig deep fakes a hybrid war information operations against American leaders and business officials and the public at large and number three we have so many internal divisions about geography about race about gender about guns there are many many issues where Americans are so divided\nThat we are susceptible to these kind of campaigns like Russia is already trying to run on social media they're just not very good at it\nWhere they try to exacerbate and inflame tensions on every side of every issue the NFL dealing controversy majority of the stuff on line on social media in the first Seventy two hours after that flamed last fall the majority of it on both sides stand for the anthem and taking the NFL\nMost of it was Russian on both sides and so we're going to have a world where you're going to have things like the Kavanaugh hearings were all of a sudden the audio will appear of Schumer's strategizing with Michael ...\nOr video will appear it'll be fake but video well up here and it will be having a party and hard as an undergrad at Yale it'll be fake\nBut in our echoed silo chambers of the way we consume media right now it's going to be a potentially much more divisive than what we know today and so one of the reasons I wanted to write them a why we hate each other\nGoing to be a potentially much more divisive than what we know today and so one of the reasons I wanted to write that the\nAh why we hate each other is an awareness that there's actually a national security exposures for this country and how much we hate each other around politics we need communities of people that live in the same neighborhood that believe lots of stuff in common even when we differ on politics\n[noise]\n[noise] how come we can't get anybody in Washington or in the media to talk about this than\nAh it took us what twenty five minutes to unpack some of it and the business model of selling soap three minutes from now is let's just say who the bad guy is you know there's there's some nut job somewhere at a McDonald's right now who probably slap to an old man ... hat and or that\nPerson is a weirdo and did something wrong but they don't actually stand in for all debate and that's really the way we're consuming most of our media right now is that kind of ... pecking and so it's harder to do ten and twenty five year out issues but that's the that's the strategic stuff that Washington should be focused on\nHow are you going to do that when you have well we've got thirties I've got thirty seconds I'm not getting even ask you [laughter] I'm not even ask you I Would like to ask you to come down a band and and really unpack this uh because I think your voice needs to be heard and understood and I think in soundbites\nUm it's not to not always understood I'm so thank you very much\nOh you're a conspiracy theorist weight she just said it at one point [laughter]\nOh I mean first of all the ... you know the press is a collection of individuals\nSome of which do a good job some of which do not\nAh so it's important to make those distinctions I think um and you know look at that is a this was just this is going on at our founding you know people were doing it at our founding an event and it at our founding but we but we we realize is when we were in a gauge and informed populace we chose correctly\nI mean I you know if we're not\nWell we know what the ... we know a Republican you can keep it right and if we if we don't choose to keep the republic well then of course it's going to fall apart we knew this was an experiment and that was the risk of it\nAnd I think we are seeing some some of those risks pop their heads up but I mean the whole foundation of this country is to let people come out and make their arguments\nAnd we have to make our back that does not mean I'm ... and I was so encouraged I Hope you are too so encouraged by the ... ... a reaction from conservatives\nShe Nancy Pelosi shouted down a and I did not see a peep\nOf support from conservatives over the actions of the people protesting hurting I didn't see I was disgusted by I was disgusted by it as well and I didn't see any I didn't now I'm not saying there were none I'm sure people will show me a tweet if some you know not job who was like I think they should harass Nancy Pelosi at dinner\nBut I didn't see one prominent Republican or conservative support those actions not one you could see if we can we played dozens of Democrat\nAnd you know here's here's here's one from Sean King I've said it before but I Need to say it again I'm grateful for ... it's weird that it's politically incorrect for me to say so but I'm Glad we have people in this country who stand up to a fascist and bigotry and are willing to confront ape face to face right and you know\nThere's nothing on the left there will be prominent politicians yeah I I have not seen one prominent conservative support what happened to policy and that's right and I'm Glad they mean that that shows that there's still you know even though we're divided and even though a lot of things come down to ... minute emotional politics that go minute to minute I'm Glad to see that they're still principles there\nSo here's where I think Ben was wrong when he said to deal with anti ... um he was right when he said you know it's a small group to small groom he's right it is a very small group and they become very very loud because of social media and because of the media\nBut it is a small group where I think he's wrong is ignore it\nHe said part of the solution is ignoring yeah and I think you know because you can't get to the point where like I Would say the same would apply to the alt right right you know the Charlottesville situation um you know\nThere is\nYou can't get to the point where like I Would say the same would apply to the alt right right you know the Charlottesville situation um you know\nThere's obviously a crime committed there that um you can't ignore right um but generally speaking when well bunch of Nazis or KKK members that's been having forever these ... bunch of KKK members walk through your town like ... you know largely speaking it's great to ignore them because they want attention and they run they\nBut that's not what we have now we have NASA FAA breaking laws you can't ignore the night came and they can't ignore that I don't I don't care if it's the Nazis or ... you can't ignore\nAnd I don't think south would argue nor that right I mean like I think he's saying that we get a little bit too wrapped up in the back and forth and viral videos and people who are not even really engaged in politics [noise] getting freaked out over things that they're never going to have to necessarily deal with\nA few ... a group like address although that's how they grow\nOr and or at least arguably that's how they grow their own oppose you're seeing it happen in Portland right in the mayor is largely just ignoring what they're doing and it's getting worse and worse and worse and worse that does not mean our lives have to be ruled by anti though and I think that as the generalize argument he was going for\nWell the the the key here is what do you do about it\nAnd the solution is to not do what people did in Florida with Nancy Pelosi you don't do that\nBecause that doesn't give you decide to run to\nYeah you don't do what the Proud Boys are doing I'm Sorry but it's just when you talk to gabbing about that yeah and I think Gavin is even you know looking at things going again you know look we were we were doing things because you know it's funny\nA media yeah he's a comedian um but\nYou know this this will grow out of control you just don't do that 'cause there's nowhere to go when you're watching that you're like well I don't like Well Nancy Pelosi is doing but I Do I was there doing so\nWho do I go to and look at look how the press is treating Donald Trump because the press treated Kavanaugh everybody kind of hard and their positions didn't they everybody just hardened their positions and got more outraged\n\nThe only the only thing that might have happened is independence\nLooked at that and said you know what I don't want to be with those people left the left and I don't want to be with the I don't want to be with the left and then look over to the Republicans they weren't misbehaving during that\nBut\nWhat are we doing to welcome people in if you're kind of saying I don't want to be with those guys and then you see [noise] you know you ... get out get out there pounding on ... and like okay I don't\nWe can't we can't get to a place to where people disengage because if they do completely disengage then it's just run the country is run by radicals\nWe need to be a safe haven we need to be a place of real thought real actual timed this um and real principals\nAnd we have to present a rational logical alternative I mean that that is one of the reasons I'm a conservative Frank writes I saw the left you know early in my life as a group of people who made decisions emotionally yeah and that's not something I Want to be part of\nSaw the left you know early in my life as a group of people who made decisions emotionally yeah and that's not something I Want to be part of snow\nAnd we can't be a part of that we can't do that ourselves let me go to Andrew in Florida hello Andrew you're on the Glenn Beck program\nGoing good morning first time caller longtime listener I all during the day very good All right yeah and you know I I just wanted to let you know I mean I'm here from Florida of an independent or most of my adult life and I'm exactly what you guys just said a victory\nAll on both sides it's so ridiculous I think a lot of the independence just stay out of it because it's so immature and it makes everyone on both sides both bad because they just can't talk to each other mhm anymore it's just at far gone now that being said\nEvery one that I Know it's an independent and the state of four will be showing up for the conservatives\nNovember really a and a ...\nA simple reason you've got people in the office ... officers right now out there that are fighting for lower taxes I myself I'm bringing home over three thousand more dollars this year than I did last year which is a huge\nFor me I've got two little girls and I've got one more finally I got my first uncommon in April\n[laughter] yeah I mean yes and\n... there's there's things like that are going on and on and I'm a conservative Christian showed up at you when you're when you're talking about\nWhat these people represent and how they force themselves into a restaurant that can hurt people when they're eating with their family or most dependent and then think exactly the way I Do they just so disgusted with some of the rhetoric on both sides\nWe just ignore it and we've always been independent thinkers or we're going to stay that way but we also know what's wrong is wrong and what's right is right as far as the big picture is concerned I think a lot of people are underestimating that\nWell Andrew I'm you if what you say is true ah than people are um the then the Republicans will keep the house most likely\nA because it is so close and levels we've never seen of interest in participation in the mid term election ever a and it's it's within the margin of error between the two\nThat if the independents come out and they are that they could be the ones that make all the difference on which direction we go next so much Andrew\n[noise] so filter mine is our sponsor and I I brought this in a last week because doing I'd been joking about when's the last time you changed

that I had it over the like oh my God yeah right so um so how does somebody like you get elected\nLook at it is that Bush meant with establishment right the the established the establishment media stage with the establishment candidates right\nThat's what winds up happening when it comes to debate is that they do that so look if you mentioned the idea that I have a copy of Cortez right literally she's going to be my Congress person she's she's my district yes in Queens absolutely and I said this is a good thing and it's a good thing because it shows one\nRight literally she's going to be my Congress person she's she's my district yes in Queens absolutely and I said this is a good thing and this is a good thing because it shows one thing it shows this is an anti establishment world right now she didn't win because she was amazing and smart and knew everything she wouldn't because she said I'm not the establishment and people ran to her\nThat's one of the reasons why Trump one that's one of the reasons why even Obama ones I was an eight I mean anti establishment is a thing that people tend to like now the advantage I have is I met his abolition\nHere saying how am I going to win if I Can't get the mainstream media by doing what I'm doing now doing pot and cash\nDoing Facebook look Trump one of the reasons why Trump won was Twitter right that wasn't the reason but

about one third name recognition and with that I pulled that Thirteen percent\nSo you can do the math on that one three times to get to a hundred percent equals thirty nine percent right through time Thirteen or ... percent this is a five way race thirty percent when this thing\nSo I'm nine points above victory\nAssuming I get a hundred percent there is the hard part writes a math equation cannot get two hundred percent\nAnd sadly that's not my message I've got that down it's the media can I get my name out to enough people to where I cross over that barrier which gets to be over thirty percent can't believe that there's I mean it's like libertarians don't want to win yes what I hear ya yeah it's really is as well get any member as third party in general the system is stacked against you\nAnd some of the day was telling me they said you know only someone who has like a marine mentality could do this\nBecause every day I'm up against failure but the marine corps taught me take the hill the captain shot\nTake the hill the machine guns broken take the hill radios don't work take the hell are stopped giving excuses take the hill I get it and that's what I Do I take the hill as a matter I get I literally sell your everyday this woman every day and when I say that that's not an exaggeration\nThat's every single day as I mentioned earlier there's going to be a debate coming up here tomorrow WCBS and they're only going to include the Democrat Republican even though I'm On the ballot even do thirty one thousand New Yorkers signed a petition to get me on that ballot\nWCBS and it got him Kim Shelley thing is his name he decided nope lottery shop dozens of beyond their he's decided that the establishment is all that matters this is what I'm up against it's not going to stop me I'm Still taking the hill but it's yet another obstacle to get over\nSo if you're a libertarian or you're hearing something that um that to you think should be heard than you should probably um maybe tweet storm\nWhat's his name again at CBS WCBS radio eight eighty radio uh it's I think that Tim shelled so this is a radio debate yes well it can be televised also now okay or are we both televised on radio ... okay so yeah again and they're just deciding no we don't want\nThem don't me wrong there are three other people should be made should also be the Green Party and also the same party they should all be there\nBut this is the norm and we put up against this\nUp against is constantly and here's the the worst part\nWith all of this we're still roaming and they're still going down that's that's the sad part they don't they don't\nThey don't realize that when a sinking ship mhm or maybe they don't care\nIf people want to donate hopefully doing Larry shop dot com slash donate and to be clear if some of you want to give forty five thousand dollars you can't the maximum forty four thousand [laughter] by New York state law so if you I Know what I Want to get like forty five thousand dollars sorry you can't do it forty four you only can get forty four thousand it's all you can get\nIf I lost a hundred thousand customers every single year for eight years I should be fired mhm that's what he's done we've lost over ... million since he's descended thrown\nOver a million ... problem leaving leaving New York state over a million over a hundred thousand every year for eight years the total was over a million look they're voting with their feet right in it yes it is so bad it is so bad that Rick Scott the governor of Florida was teasing and said thank you Cuomo because older retirees we have\nAre going to Florida and they are pensions that New York state residents are paying for still and these pensions now aren't being spent in New York state they being spent in Florida we're ... we're literally writing checks to Florida every single month horrible that's how bad it is yes\nSo let's take pensions though true pensions are ... it's a ticking time bomb yes there's no way to pay for it yeah you've you're going to break all of the promises to people who work their whole life and were promised ally\nYep what do you do you see it here in Texas was your place for oh yeah you see it right here in Dallas Dallas you ate already already happening and they have all the time you're in New York state we are the most unionized state\nUnless you're there in Dallas you said already already happening I may have all the time in New York state we are the most unionized state in the entire nation mhm so pensions are critical right now pending or about Fifteen sixteen percent of our budget and a budget as a hundred and Seventy billion dollars it's double Florida in Florida has more people than us\nWow yes for an eighty five billion and they have more people than us and we have a hundred and Seventy billion dollar budget how about just massive\nAnd it's getting bigger the budget getting bigger and so the percentages of the other pensions but on top of that a New York state has about a three hundred billion dollar debt and about a fortified deficit\nSo it's a bad bad bad and then you add that people I was telling me but Lowry the pension fund is good they write the fund itself is doing relatively well some of the ups they ... up and you're doing very well some of the city wants or disaster but overall it's er and well they don't realize it's being also funded by our tax base our budget that keeps putting money into it the problem is and the fun right now that's\nGreat the problem is the actual budget at one point it gets so big that we simply can't pay me more as you're seeing in Dallas and my response to the times but Larry's in the constitution yeah and I get that asked Detroit right ass and Puerto Rico\nRight ask Venezuela ... it was all legal for them to one there's no money it doesn't get funded when it doesn't get funded that eventually will collapse if that collapses if our pension fund collapsed near state we become Somalia overnight\nI don't want to become a Somali overnight I Want to stop that I'm the only guy talking about negotiating our pensions into the right which is some type of four one K. for three be something like that and I'm going to go she with every single union that will take forever I Know\nThat's why I say it's a four year plan\nIt's a four year plan to make us away from New York state is paying either a flat fee and or a flat percentage that sustainable because the issue we have a lot of people are pensions who no longer paying it any more mhm so we just simply have to keep paying them until they don't even use anymore so we have to do that also\nUsed to be like ten firefighters supporting one now it's one supporting tend to Iraq I think she was opening for ... I think that's right I'm not sure but I was making them I think it's something I think are supporting three or four\nOr so yeah it's bad so now we have to make that change and the funny thing is people are attacking me saying lie wants to get rid of our pensions I'm like I'm the only guy trying to keep them I'm the only one talking about reality I'm Talking I was actually happening if you have a ... if you're ready for a pension now it's ten or Fifteen Years from now it's probably not going to be there for you\nBut why deal with that I mean it's human nature why deal with that if the two on the other side GOP and the Democrats are saying oh he's an extremist he's he's trying to spook you your pensions are fine it's human nature to follow them\nAgreed but I have a problem Glenn I care\nI have a problem I'm human I have a problem I Want people to stay in my state\nI Want people to stay in my state because if they don't say it's going to collapse and I have to move and I don't wanna move I'm born and raised in New York state my family and friends who are in New York state I Love my state ... ... people love New York the heat in the U.S government\nNew York state is very special it has served the largest city in the entire nation it has an amazing waterfall negra falls it as mountains as\nCool as Colorado and has farmland and will as yes I'm In New York you know Colorado Laurie yeah no farmland as cool as a mid\nWest it has amazing rivers and lakes and everything you can imagine in New York state is there it's a beautiful diverse state and with destroying it because wedding one city run the entire state\nMost of my my ideas about happiness but the other part is decentralization it's about letting counties ... counties in regions be regions in towns beach towns right people upstate tend to get upset with people in New York City saying well they're running it and there are bad and cut them off if you rent\nRight people upstate tend to get upset with people in the city saying well they're running it and they are bad and cut them off if\nYou ran your own county you wouldn't care and that's what I Want to let people in the city be New York city isn't by um W ... Rochester isn't that\nThough what we're we're debating now over the electoral college the only reason why we're debating the electoral college is because it's the original debate I don't want New York city yeah so tell me in the middle of the country\nHow to live my life yes don't let San Francisco bay San Francisco ... poop on the streets that's fine yes but we're different here\nYes and maybe you want to visit them once in a while right then ... look at the poop refine whatever whatever your thing is and they should be allowed to\nDo to their city their county what they want to do\nA hundred percent true and it's not happening and the issue is we are getting more and more centralized control it happens in any large organization as I told you I'm a business guy right and I'm the guy who I Will come in sometimes and try to help businesses to fix them make things better and the last thing I say as iron fist\nIt's the last thing I say I hear all the time I go to a business owner and he goes my my leaders aren't doing with them what they should do I can't get to innovate I Can't ... to take that you're taking your all your things and the last thing I say it's iron fist\nI say give them actually more freedom here's what I Know it's it's literally an equation\nPersonal freedom plus transparency plus accountability equals innovation that happens all the time you give the people more freedom let the leaders take charge some will make mistakes but ... as long as you try and ... you learn from them you become humbled by them which is fine we all make mistakes\nBut then which ones who simply want to make a mistake blame someone else\nNow you see that these leaders you don't need which are the ones who will not make any mistakes there doing nothing those elite as you don't need you need the ones to get up try do well hit a couple of home runs strike out sometimes get better become humbled become better leaders in the long run that how you make a better organization we don't have that\nLeary is uh going to join me for a a pod cast you'll hear a about Ninety minutes uninterrupted a and we'll put that out on Saturday um Larry sharp is his name and ah you you need to be a need to listen to him I have a feeling\nIf he doesn't win New York we're going to be seeing him a again a perhaps the elsewhere but he is um\nHe's worth your time to listen to and if you're in New York consider voting for can't imagine\nCan't imagine what would stop you because it's not working as it is but that's just me Larry sharp a S.
