usually concealed inside the pipe I don't know goes through an x-ray machine just see a big metal pipe probably is not gonna make it to whoever it is you're sending unless you're sending it to their

'em some of these bombs to home offices and and residences where there wouldn't be the screening rather than sending them through like the congressional uh mail service which would have definitely be

sent back to her office they said was one that would maybe not have screening I don't I didn't I didn't fact check their claim but that was\nWhat they were attempting to ah to pass office sophistication I I've never built a bomb no one don't intend to in my life\nUm but it\nWould you say it or that you would make it plastic to get past screening because if you put a big metal pipe it's going to be more obvious right if you did it if you did it to get\nPast screening that's good but that shows that you have no idea what you're even do you're not even but you're you're there you have a very low IQ\nOr your uh or your ... you know a a a young kid that just thought it was funny uh I I don't even know but the shows that you do not understand why a pipe bomb is strong\nBut the answer is no a plastic PVC pipe bomb it will ... it'll still be detected because and that's why he had to in my opinion that's why I had the wires and the big ridiculous basically equivalent alarm clock tasted a stupid thing because like you you you've seen like at the airport like sometimes you're like hey maybe I can slip in this bottle of water you know like ...\nYou know like there is no slipping

[laughter] unless you think he's actually responsible irresponsible for your own actions we know that\nBut beyond that if you're gonna ... you have to look at this in some ... with some level of skepticism to try to understand we're a week before an election right or less than two weeks at least\n... you know the idea that that the the left would be victimized by this hatred of Donald Trump there's obvious incentive to make America ill that way right now\nThat does not mean that this was someone trying to frame the right absolutely could be there are no jobs on the right that could do that and probably many of them stupid enough to get none of the bombs go off\nIt's certainly possible but they are acting as if you have to be Alex Jones to not believe this is Donald Trump's fault you do not have to be Alex Jones to look at this with some skeptical lie\nYou not to say that you know\nThat that that it's a it's a ... since we're proving anything but you have to at least keep your

controversy on the real housewives of New York with land\nAs she got Diana Ross and she made her skin look darker than it really is and people said that that was racist\nAnd I felt like she wants to look like a an around for one day I I don't know how like that got race on Halloween\n... amazing ... and is it is that is that such a question that you should be drummed out of all society right\nThat that's what's amazing about this first of all we should point out that there's a lot of people in the side of NBC that one in her out for other reasons oh my gosh ... this has nothing to do if she could have said that easily and been applauded\nHad she not come from Fox had she'd come from CNN or she was on the left or whatever that that crowd would have plotted her saying that and I think they know there's a lot of people that would be to didn't appreciate her coming out against NBC\nOn the sexual assault stuff ... as well but just just talking specifically about let's forget all that exists and talk about the fact that actual conversation her point is what is important when you're trying to decipher someone doing something that is racist for example is the motivation\nThe motivation is what is important the words themselves can be bad or good but the motivation is what is important let's go further than black face for a second the N. word\nRight the N. word when said by someone carrying a torch in Charlottesville we all understand really bad mhm when Chris Rock says it\nNot so bad why because we know Chris Rock motivation is not because he says terrible racist we know in Charlottesville the case is that they are terrible racist or in this been sorry for the city of Charlottesville who now if they're named just sit on to this with racism but I mean we don't we are talking about here\nThe the if you have an All right figure you have Richard Spencer you have some hardcore racist saying the N word it means something different and the motivation is different and that is important\nLike it but I Will say this it is still I\nI don't care who says the N word I think it's a disgusting word I Do too I don't I don't like that word used by anybody but you don't get drummed out of society if you if you're if you're a Chris Rock because everybody knows that your motivation is not this deep hatred of racism and another example it's always sunny in Philadelphia\nIs a is the longest running a live action sitcom in us history fourteen season it's going I signed up for the fourteenth season\nAt least once and I think twice they've done entire episode where they're white characters were in blackface\nK now their motivation as liberals right their motivation is to show that racism is really dumb and their characters are really dumb and their dressing up this way and they're showing how stupid they are and making the point that\nRacism is really dumb and their characters are really dumb and their dressing up this way and they're showing how stupid they are and making the point that they think it's okay to dress up in blackface but they actually did it on camera multiple episodes this is a a liberal icon of our program\nOK totally okay for them to do it\nBut for her to question it and say if it's a positive motivation is that okay well I don't remember\nI don't remember a lot of an outcry from the left over it's always sunny and Philadelphia doing it multiple times they did an entire episode ... which is one of the greatest television episodes of any series of all time called the gang turns black\nAnd they have a situation where they all wake up after like getting the electric or getting struck by lightning and they're all black and they have to live as black people for the day and they walk around ten minutes\nOrderly amazing but beyond that it is something that there's been no pushback on look at things like family guy you'll see the you know the animation but it's still the same types of things happen because they believe and we all kind of like well the motivation there is\nThat he's that they're not trying to be racist an upstarting trying to say black people are inferior or anything like that they're doing this to make a point on the other side we think their motivation is good so that's okay\nWhat she's saying here is if the motivation is good let's say a child for example who thinks they want to dress up as a hero of there's a happens to be black\nHe was doing exactly what Hugo Chavez did he came in and then he was going to change the constitution exactly the way Hugo Chavez has changed the constitution and made it into a a a dictatorship so the Supreme Court\nSaid the president is acting unconstitutionally talk to the other branch you need to arrest him an exile him the other branch did so two branches of the government ousted him\nSaid that's not what we do\nWe don't want to be a Hugo Chavez Venezuela okay\nHe said ever since then we Hondurans have lived in chaos many things try to buy a ... and his party to liberate which translates to Freedom Party to destabilize our country\nThis is just the latest stunned and it's all a a a blames America and has also made America is now reaping what its own type statements\nHe has said that America must take in the migrants because America has supported the current administration that he now claims has caused all of the misery that we as Hondurans are living through\nThis is why they're marching with a Honduran flag because they blame us for their misery\nThis is nothing more she writes than a strong arm tactics to embarrass both Honduras and America sadly the migrants were lied to and had been told that America must accept them in\nIn one news report a lady who was interviewed told the Honduran reporter that they were promised buses to travel once they got to Guatemala but there were no buses waiting on them that I could tell from the report some of the migrants have returned home\nOne twenty two year old man died in Mexico for reasons unknown as of yet\nThis is really sad and frustrating because many migrants are have been a had been told that they will get in and they will get jobs once they arrive in America and therefore many are good with the hopes of a better life\nHowever these are types of situations that criminals\nAre a might have been the organizers of the march will take advantage of\nPlease keep spreading the truth about this situation I enjoy all of your content and you're a podcast thanks for being a truth teller in a world of lies God Bless you and the family at the blaze for all that you do\nFrom someone who lives and was born and raised in Honduras that is verifying exactly what we were we're being told what we had can do you know just as\n[noise] [noise] [noise] [noise]\nKnow I was gonna say you know as reporters and then I was going to say no we're not really reporters\n[noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] you know I was going to say\nYou know as reporters and then I was going to say no we're not really reporters and then thought of journalists 'cause they're not really a journalist but then I thought of ...\nHe's a he's a journalist with the Washington Post you know and it's that everyone keeps saying I ... I think columnist would be more accurate uh well he wrote five\nFive five columns for the Washington Post that of course makes you a journalist does it ... five\n... I mean you probably written five ... columns here to have places like that I was on a ... I I did something for the Washington Post at one point to the yeah now you're a journalist or journalists aren't doing their jobs\nThe ... news organizations\nDon't want to tell you what's really going on but this is what's really going on with that care of and um we hope to have Michael Yon before the end of the program today to talk a little bit about what they're doing about this in the Congress and the Senate and what the president can do\nA and how we can hold\nMexico accountable and these other countries accountable if they just passed their problem on to us I feel for on doors because these guys are the guys who are causing trouble in their own country and they're having to deal with these guys all the time\nAnd\nOur press is not duped by them\nThis is why it's hard to defend the press when they say we're not an enemy of the people yeah yeah I agree you're not an enemy of the people but you are definitely an enemy of\nThe truth\nAnd whether that is intentional or you are just\nUnbelievably\nA\nLacking all curiosity all natural curiosity you just start unbelievable\nIn how a daddy inside you are on trying to find anything other than what people are just telling

you put metal not glass you put metal in these things\nPlus\nThe wires are on the outside and they go to a timer a tie him or why would you have a timer for something you have delivered through the mail\nWould you expect somebody to open it up and then like I guess I should set this for two minutes ... that doesn't make any sense\nThat kind of seems like that's what happened with um with the George Soros one someone else picked it up from his mailbox opened it up saw that it was some device\nWalked it over to the woods and put it down then called the police and the police came and blow it up right but I mean that's like the the this was a a bomb that was supposed to be triggered by being opened\nDoesn't seem that to be that there's a timer on it you think it's a it's a time bomb but you don't set a time through the mail adult attendance is ridiculous very strange ridiculous\nUh let me go to Kim in Virginia who's a US mail carrier or hello Kim\nHey Ryan I'm actually from outside

it there as a symbol that no one scares us no one is going to push us into a revolution no one is going to scare us leave it there don't try to hide or cover up those pockmarked\n\nNow I don't know how many people in the media today even know that story\n\nI can guarantee you nobody is telling you that story they're saying this is unprecedented and it has to be the right historically speaking it's almost always the left\nNow this might be the right those might be actually Republican because Republicans are known for not getting anything done uh and\nSo this guy built these bombs and built him in such a way that they were never\nGoing to explode I don't know who built these bombs could be somebody from the left could be somebody from the right\n\nBut it's unusual that you could build this these this number of bombs and none of them\nWent off remember Nineteen Nineteen twelve bombs were delivered twelve bombs went off\nSeventeen were not delivered Seventeen were stopped before they could go off\nThis time not a single bomb went off\nUm if the idea is to facilitate that journey specifically the journey from somewhere else in Central America to the United states that could become more of a problem\nAgain you you you nailed it quite a few minutes ago and saying that the humanitarian crisis that we have to be focusing on here really is the crisis with the refugees themselves\nHaving to make this long dangerous journey\nAnd then knowing that when they get here the odds are pretty high that they're not going to be deemed eligible for asylum in any event\nAnd it just creates a whole lot of headaches for them\nIn the process so Mike I gotta I got an um an email in yesterday from a listener in Honduras Honduras resident and then a born and raised native ah in Honduras said\nBeen following the news ah on the caravan here locally or been also a fan of your show watch your show and I have to applaud you and your intel um the origins of this migrant march this all wrapped it in in two thousand nine when the president of Honduras Manuel ... men well a ... a\nA lackey of Hugo Chavez and Fidel Castro was ousted constitutional\nNine when the president of Honduras Manuel ... men well a ... a a lackey of Hugo Chavez and Fidel Castro was ousted constitutionally by the other two branches of government\nEver since then we Hondurans have lived in chaos many of the things are have been tried by ... and his party ... which translates to Freedom Party to destabilize our country\nLatest sons of ... blames America and has made America is now reaping what its own type statements he says that America must take into migrants because America has supported the current administration\nThat he claims is caused all the misery that we uh Hondurans are living through\nSadly the migrants had been lied to and have been told that America must accept them in one news report a lady was interviewed a and she told the Honduran reporter that they were promised buses to travel on once they got to Guatemala but there were no buses waiting for them\nSome of the migrants have returned home one twenty two year old man died in Mexico for reasons unknown as of yet what's really sad and frustrating is many of these migrants have been a toll that they will get in and they'll have jobs waiting for them when they arrive in America\nThere for many or good with hopes of a better life\nBut this is the type of situation that these criminals are who are the originator of this march will take advantage of\n[noise] somebody's messing with them and we have to remember that most members of the Caribbean or ineligible for asylum or earlier this year or the department of justice clarified that you cannot claim asylum\nSimply because your home country is unsafe by definition by law aside least face\nIn individual in particular I danger in their home countries\nAnd because there's no legal basis for the vast majority of those in the caravan to remain in the United states or we end up doing what we can what we can to prevent people from making the journey at all that but this this statement you just read is part of it is\nA narrative is false rhetoric that is perpetuating the problem\nAnd I think it needs to be called out as such just because they have a country that is a mess of the government that has made light unpleasant for everyone there is not mean that any particular person necessarily has a valid claim for asylum in the United states\n[noise] Mike have you heard have you heard anything talking to Senator Mike Lee have you heard anything about what Mike Pence revealed I think it was not yesterday day before I'm On a that Venezuela is behind the funding of of this\n[noise] um I had not heard that but ah we're hearing all the time different theories about who might be fun to get ... that is interesting it's an interesting theory that Venezuela might be doing it begins Venezuela is broke Venezuela's perhaps a as broke as any country in the region right now\nAnd so that would really be something if they were doing it\n[noise] what do we do if they make it to the border Mike I mean they'll the Univision I think it's Univision is reporting that that number has no fourteen thousand I think that's hard to believe but you know even have five thousand people at the border what do we do\n[noise] it's um difficult to say I hope and pray that it doesn't come to that because first of all think about what that would do it or already overwhelmed immigration courts or immigration courts are nowhere\nIt comes to that because first of all think about what that would do it or already overwhelmed immigration courts or immigration courts are nowhere near being ready to handle that kind of volume but nowhere near ready to be handling that kind of volume that they've already got\nA so I I suspect that we will need to\nUm bring out a whole lot of additional human resources let's just say in order to make sure\nThat our border isn't completely overrun and that it doesn't just become a free for all for people to enter the country unlawfully we have no idea no ability to control who comes in once there is um [noise] ah that kind of stampede coming in all at once so we've got to protect the border\nSenator Mike Lee last questions any any comments on um the the multiple pipe bombs that were delivered\nBut tragic it's frightening I can damn anyone who uh who did it and I condemn anyone who says anything ah to applaud or encourage your support that kind of action\nA basis I'm not something we can tolerate in American political discourse and I look forward to the day where we find that perpetrators responsible and I think they should be punished to the maximum extent possible under the law\nYou would classify them a lifetime limit rephrase that I Would classify whoever did this as terrorists would you classify them as terrorists\nWithout question\nWithout question and they need to be punished the such\nSaying thank you Mike appreciated Senator Mike Lee ... author of written out of history a great book or if you were looking to learn about the great people in our uh in our country that have passed the people who have been written out of history it's a book is out now Senator Mike Lee\nAlways Raymond on his or her\nThinking we're not too that are breaking news that you know ... back to to approve a request for eight hundred US troops to travel to the U.S Mexico border to provide logistical support for border agents or as the\nCaravan approaches that are just happening now expect that to come down at least later on today ... eight hundred troops who you think that's\nThe first the first wave that was the what the department of homeland security mask or question okay good good\nBye to want to talk to a little bit about liberty safe [noise] um I was um [noise]\nUh watching a video sent to me by a friend last night of a good friend of mine could affect the guy I just adore um who was really truly an amazing mentor of mine Michael O'Shea ... when I was a kid um he owns a group of ah the stations now in Santa Rosa California\nAnd there's this documentary that they they made and ... you know the fire started at like eleven o'clock at night\nBy three o'clock in the morning everything was on fire\nWhen you watch this it's really\nWe're not getting a sense outside of California you're not really getting a sense of how destructive and how fast this thing was spreading\nUm and um they showed the footage from inside one of the fire trucks that were called from the outside and they weren't familiar with the area and um they said as they were pulling into this area which was supposed to supposed to be safe when they left the firehouse\nThey said go meet us here when they got there it was at Kmart it was the whole k-mart was on fire everything was burned down so they started\nThey said go meet us here when they got there it was at Kmart it was the whole k-mart was on fire everything was burned down so they started driving away looking for a safe place like thirty forty minutes into it they're looking in this in the dark and they're seeing for miles what they think are fields\nThat have little fires burning around mhm then they realize that was a ... those were homes or are they were holding complexes and they've been burnt entirely to the ground and those little fires are just what's still left burning\nIt's in radical and\nUm [noise] the things that you you see what was amazing to me is again if you um\nIf you have any valuables I'm a fan of liberty safe and here's one of the reasons\nFire destroys everything and if you have a safe and it's not a fire rated safe\nIt's three thousand degrees fires of your house three thousand degrees that your car when that when your if your cars parked in the garage the the aluminum wheels melt\nThe aluminum is running down or like it was water it's crazy liberty safe\nFire rated you can trust it in a hurricane is a trusted in a flood you can trust that when you open it up and we've seen this in California there's nothing left in these homes except the chimney and the liberty safe and they open it up and the things are fine it's", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Glenn Beck Program", "city": "Charlottesville", "day": "25"}
