[noise]\n\nThe name of the book is Christians in the age of outrage and it is very Frank it talks about ah what Christians can and should do and also have not done and how we're actually hurting ourselves\nUm you talk about our God really kind of being identity NOW News that at\nThe open we we've kind of as a nation moved ourselves into factions and what I don't want is Christians to be a faction in a world of factions [noise]\nUm I think that's the part of the problem but but I think you know people identify themselves as you know I'm I'm this or that I've got a social media community and\nAnd and then that faction sort of becomes identity becomes a faction the facts and becomes an echo chamber and then ultimately are we the volume just goes up up up up in the anger just goes up up up up and and we can't survive I think as a nation\nFactional ... at this level eventually you'll Balkan eyes to use the term from history where what kind of break apart and so I think the ultimate thing is I I Can't you know I Can't solve all the political things you're you're got much bigger platform talk about politics than I Do I'm just trying to help Christians to say All right how do we react to how do we\nRespond and the answer is is not to take our identity from anything other than king Jesus and and and again I Know that's overtly spiritual but we're talking here in this\nThis focus I mean so it's to take out any for Jesus Jesus is not coming back on air force one he's not riding a donkey or an elephant when he does and\nTo acknowledge that I'm only all in as a Christian in following Christ and everything else is shaped around that my identity is more to Christ in his kingdom that's kind of our motto here we can college my identity is more to Christ in his kingdom than anything else\nSo I explain this yesterday that um you know the the so called Christians of the Westboro Baptist church you know they they hold up signs you know God hates this Scott hates that blah blah blah they're just despicable you don't win by\nBy holding up signs no God hates view and shouting things back you win by listening by understanding by him racing them as a soul or a brother and sister not doing what they're doing\nStanding up but people have been changes one woman in particular that actually left her own family in the Westboro Baptist church because somebody spoke to her with civil who is civility and said let's just reason here for a minute\nYeah that's okay I I on my desk actually right every front of me a name plates and costs are they actually protested at my church we went out and serve them coffee and doughnuts and they called me and the national news I Can't use one of the words probably on the radio but I'll lying the false prophet\nAnd so it's actually one of my staff made it into a name played it says it says lined Blanco false prophet Westboro Baptist church which by the way as either wrap does your does either Baptist church\nBut but in doing so I mean the question is how do we respond well somebody reached out actually interviewed one of members of the family as well a Christian Today so somebody reached out and I will tell you I think that's what we can do right now with people who deeply disagree with us and the\nBook is filled with examples of Christians who actually built relationships with people who radically disagreed and in the process we're able to come to maybe a better understanding of what examples for example is a is the president by all university which is a Christian university in California\nUh met with the kind of the leader of the uh the party in the state legislature there in California that was trying to change the laws that would make it illegal for ... to live their Christian beliefs about marriage sexuality and more well he ended up getting to understand\nAnd to change laws that would make it illegal for ... to live their Christian beliefs about marriage sexuality and more well he ended up getting to understand each other better the will the bill was ultimately not moved forward but dropped and and and now we're at a very different place now I'm not saying you can always do that but I Am saying that Christians need to\nTry to do that and I do think that in doing so well act a lot more like Jesus or even this how about a lot more like Christians\nHistorically because at the moment we're in is not time for us to join in ratcheting up the outrage and and as you said earlier to your caller I'm calling people to arms\nYet that's not I mean ... that's not an uncommon view and I know some of the some of the worst things I see on social media I I click on a link and I find go to the bio and its first think listen the thing is Christian and I'm like that's not what it's supposed to look like\nAnd I think that's what we need is a change in a lot of hearts\nI Will tell you this the ones who can teach us this right now or the the victims of ISIS and the ones who were were literally chained or as slaves\nOr you know story after story after story of these Christians\nWho I mean I Know one family that actually wrote to ISIS after they said you're all dead were coming Saturday to kill you I'm a I think it was on I think it was on Sunday we're going to come on Sunday and kill you\nOr if you don't submit and we're gonna crucify you the family sat down kids at all and wrote a letter and said\nUnderstand we forgive you for that we're not we're not going to leave we'll be here you can come at three o'clock we only ask that you do not crucify us it it it is we're not worthy of that kind of a death\nAnd they lived because they stood up with pita yeah unbelievable what's happening\nAnd we can learn from global Christians are also historically there was this emperor fascinating ever called Julian the apostate I write about this in the book and he he actually he's called the apostate 'cause you know Victor is right the history and the Christians eventually became more prominent and and here's what he writes 'cause he's so angry about trying to hold back the events of course that he's a pagan\nYes and they're they're reporting on our moods our tastes all the things we like all the things we want the things we need and our fears and they just report all of that back to a Amazon headquarters\nOr they just gobbled up whole foods right now and when they did kroger's stock went from thirty one dollars a share to twenty two [laughter] that's how big this company is wow they're going to be a the largest clothing retailer by twenty twenty\nUh they're already so more books than anybody on earth they've driven how many uh book retailers out of business um and there there are about to spend more on original programming than even Netflix or they're going to be the biggest Hollywood producer [laughter] to so many things is it time to\nI mean I don't know what you do about it do you favor as the capital is breaking up a company that's what they did to

you're not going to be able to compete on if they taught there are other options you know there are other options are just people you know the problem is Amazon does everything better than everybody else yeah there's a real problem where we've been talking about this whole week is\nI don't I don't want you to change Amazon I like Amazon I like Amazon Prime I like the fact and yesterday we were
