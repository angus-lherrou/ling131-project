and these bombs were clearly Donald Trump's fault [noise] okay here's the New York times\nUh none of their devices harmed anyone and it was not immediately clear whether any of them\nCould have ...\nThese are pipe bombs are very dangerous yeah I mean in fact uh shows the level of sophisticated I that's what I heard from CNN these pipe bomb show a level of sophistication\n... what's the New York times saying no one law enforcement officials said investigators we're examining the possibility that they were hoax devices to hug struck there to look like bomb would not have exploded wow now you may uh\nYou may have read the story from the New York times you know that well they never gave us really any details on ...\n... well you probably didn't get the paragraph thirty for uh uh\nThat's what I like ... you know you know how you know how like Jewish people read from a right to left we read left or right okay I with the New York times it's like reading a foreign language I like to read the bottom up\nA lot of good stuff toward the ... yeah when you get to the bottom you start with the bottom it it it's funny because usually the headline doesn't matter I mean uh some bomb technicians who studied photos of the device that circulated on social media suggested the bomb sent to CNN had the hallmarks of fake\nExplosives ha kind more typically depicted on television and movies rather than devices capable of detonated almost like a Wylie coyote kind of bomb almost a digital clock would tape to the middle of the plane of feature that experts\nWe'll have detonated almost like a Wylie coyote kind of bomb almost a digital clock was taped to the middle of the ... feature that experts say it's typically shown on fictional\nBombs in an attempt to ratchet up dramatic tension or but on the theory in real life\nI'm ... in fact in\nFact they go on the New York times in fact\nBomb makers generally avoid attaching visible clock their devices really keep\nFrom tipping off they're targeting no about when the bombs are set to explain it was just like a nice little clock because they were sending to these people for their death [laughter] that's what I thought oh look at that and you're like that's not a bomb years ... years a bonus if you survive\nAll it it got an ... an alarm you know what one hundred percent survive abilities so far on these bombs one hundred percent survive ability\nWe're it is weird now look it could it be a I think here's a plausible scenario that someone on the right to\nSomeone on the right who really does not like all these figures ... decided that they wanted to send a message to all these figures but aren't actually or murder they want to scare the hell out of them but they didn't actually want to kill\nThey want to do that if they pull you want to know what you could be doing to this country ... let me show yet and they're crazy they were wrong only horror despicable and everyone they weren't murderers and so they built this to look like bomb\nIf you look on I mean you get this example if is on social media all the time I mean if we counted all of the death threats and horrible things that you get on social media as real all the time ... you'd have to have a staff of\nSalads and checking them all out ... instead you know most of the time people said crap on social media that goes way too far and that they don't actually intend on doing they don't intend on a you know you start to happen to for example Dana lash right like has to take all those things seriously when she was on TV uh she got all sorts of threats on her family\nAnd they did take them seriously but like ... as far as I Know at least no one actually\nActed on those things thank God right you have these serious threats that come into public figures often and and sometimes they don't want a pending out most of the ... the right thing even ego to look a terrorist I mean the the amount of people in the middle east who said that they would uh execute a terrorist attack\nOn on people who are on you know people from another country for example you and I know the state is so high it incredibly disturbing you almost would never walk outside if you really how many millions of people will tell pollsters that yes I Would kill American citizen however obviously they're not doing it\nRight whether it's because they're not capable of doing it or whether they're a in reality they just want to send a message or they really don't like them but I'm not going to go kill someone whatever the reason is\nCut again at the end the Jimmy Fallon one more cars Jimmy Fallon is not a political enemies Kimball has put himself in as a political commentator so it's really agree just for him but Fallon who is I think there is no ill intent by Jimmy Fallon doing that he's friends with Chris Rock ... but the issue here is on the\nFreaking NBC or you can spirit is a wire legally for mentioning it but you know let Jimmy you're going to give Jimmy Fallon the top but placing your network so what she said was\nA weight but if you are\nIf you are holding somebody up if you're if you're making fun of them okay but if you're holding somebody up like this woman who you know with Diana Ross she liked Diana Ross you unlike Diana Ross for the night and she's not making money and she's not making fun of Diana Ross well isn't that what ... Fallon did\nActually didn't ask the question teaches ...\nOr ... you brought up a great point yesterday and I thought about that that we're getting close to getting close to Halloween\n... ... the biggest deal in the world was made of finally\nAfrican Americans have a superhero Black Panther finally\nThey have one finally after all this time we have in them super hero and one that actually people want to be ... be yeah the white kids and like you want to be so if you're white done decides he wants to be Black Panther a hum and thinks that it's now of course as\nA father I Would be like sorry dude I or to be surprised to hear the good news you could not do that like we have no awareness of race but I mean if it what he's trying to do is to ... you know a ...\nBe one of his heroes who happens to be African American and he obviously notice is the difference in characteristics that I mean is that a a horrible horrible thing for a child to consider and of course not to be horrible up a black person dressed up as ...\nAnd what not but way if they put on white face as Superman no I mean it seems that seems ridiculous you wouldn't do it because you don't ... I don't see a silver medal white or black\nHe's just a Superman it doesn't matter but because of the name of the show was white Superman right black lab tried this game I just got this from a an African American a friend of mine who I Am not going to name because I'm afraid that they will be targeted Jay ...\nWhat about white face ... or ... literally this morning my son in eleventh grade said he and his friends want to be white chicks from the movie white chicks\nI thought it was funny but I don't know especially at an and people will take what's supposed to be funny or and there'll be overly offended by it and start this back and forth drama that none of us need\nUh we live in a white community ah and I literally said I think this is going to come back to bite you later\nI never thought I'd have to tell my kid that\nFrom an African American [laughter] ... amazing\nAnd you know it may not they're not may not be a backlash we're going the other way for blacks dressing and white face that movie\nCame out depends on the ends on the political climate now yeah there would have never been before everybody thought it was funny yeah there would have never been but because of the political climate because people are you know you can't even talk about it this is ... so what did we learn from Megan Kelly ...\nThe only reason even ask a question exactly ... chair even asked the question here is a woman who is one of the smartest people on TV she is as sharp as the sharpest razor we all worked with her we all know\nIf you screw with Megan Kelly and she will continue to ribbons she is wicked wicked smart agree all American guy yeah so here's this woman\nWho is working at a place that higher and her and then my theory is they hired her because they thought oh she's great investigative reporter she's great as an interviewer said get at the time they were getting more yeah she was a huge get as soon as the end they all thought this was going to be great if\nThey put her in and then the social justice warriors all in the network it outside of the network to my goodness how could you possibly she worked at Fox News and then they realized oh crap\nWe're ... we're in trouble now with all of the fringe but we thought would be cool with anything that we do now all the social justice warriors and so they needed a way out they have persecuted her persecuted her\nAll the way through\nSo what happens they see this opportunity she's asked\nA question that's it she just says well wait a minute is this wrong so here's what we learn that even one of the most powerful celebrities one of the most powerful educated women\nIs so frightened by the social justice mob inside NBC but the very next day this\nVery bright woman who knows who she is she goes on television\nCrying literally you can see it in her face crying she so frightened by these people that she says I'm Sorry I I I've learned a lot well what did America learn America didn't look at I mean this sincerely mean this absolutely\nSincerely ... ... ... do can either of you give\nDidn't look at I mean this sincerely mean this absolutely\nSincerely ... a pat stew can either of you give me a note on politically correct to reason why this is so offensive to wear black\nFace like Diana Ross if you are not ... making fun of her you're not you're not you're you're an inspiring to be someone you admire right you can either of you give me a non politically correct answer\nIn other words you can use political correctness well because people will be upset nope nope no tell me why\nWell the only reason I have is is the one from our ochre and uh which is which was that this was used to sort of as a battering ram against blacks in the twenties and\nThirties okay okay they will hang on on of right sure apps and it really ... the top impersonated exactly right exactly right and that's the twenties thirties ask any millennial ask anyone under thirty\nWho's Mr Bo jingles they're not going to they don't you know who Mr Bo jingles is ... from the song\nFrom ... from you know oh yeah dancing with early handle the other guy that you always see with Shirley\nTemple is doing the dance up the stairs that's Mr Bo jangle okay one of the greatest dancers of all time now you know Mr Bo jingles that's just short for some reason politically incorrect we\nYou ask people who've Mr Bo jingles if they don't have any idea in may have been in the twenties and thirties but it's not today\nAnd again that your\nBroker still inserting er an older the top impression basically we're knocking it by making ... wait a minute like an over the top impersonation like Sarah Silverman did with giant cartoon lips ...\nUh you mean like ... like what uh what's his name just humid and let me kill or Jimmy Fallon\nRegardless study in Philadelphia a Robert\nDowney junior or in a in a Tropic Thunder [laughter] I mean the blackface is not a it's\nBeen used particularly in comedic circumstances usually vote to make a point that black faces ridiculous not the case with Jimmy came right anyway you're just like I didn't but you know lack face changed about somebody ... unbelievably bad\nIf you are trying to

twelve sixteen ...\nWell the FBI may have um arrested while they have arrested a suspect\nIn Florida it broke about an hour ago that they were bringing somebody in for questioning now it is a rest of a suspect\nUh his um is a van is covered in stickers I mean the guy's nuts if I were to ask you before this can you sketch out what you think this guy's bed looked like you would have picked the yeah uh it covered and\nThe cows and seemingly political messages it yet I Can't quite zoom in to the exactly what they say\nAnd they've covered the van there now covering it so with blue tarp so no one can see it\nYup uh but uh it the you we've had a blurry picture of it and it looks like it may be a guy on the right\nUh but uh it you we've had a\nBlurry picture of it and it looks like it may be\nA guy on the right there at least ... you know it's hard to tell exactly there's certainly political messages all over and flags all over it does appear to be the ... picture of a Trump and the presidential seal and they could it be\nA it could be either to be I don't like this guy's president right I mean I Know you know again this is what people are speculating at this point it's hard to see honestly from the pictures\nYou'll get a picture pretty soon though that's clear I'm sure I'm you know ... we're going to find this out\nRelatively quickly yeah where this guy goes I mean this is a really quick arrest it does support the idea that he was a ... as does the fact that zero of the bombs went off completely incompetent and crazy I mean the fact that you you mail bombs and they're finding this quickly is you know shows a lack\nOf level of sophisticated on it really does a ... so we'll see how we're gonna know fairly quickly I think oh this guy may be just a really bad incompetent version of the Bernie Sanders\nGuy uh that ... was competent when he was trying to kill all the ... the Republicans are about a year ago looks like this may be a ... hour version of that guy fortunately our rivers and if you will is a completely inept and incompetent and no one was hurt\nYeah I mean if if if that's true what the van ... ... ... and should be noted of course he is absolutely not my guy\n[laughter] you know I Know that it was but there were going to say he's not my guy either yeah but you know they're going to assign him as you know this is what a Trump supporter is like and blah blah blah and you know there are those people on both sides and this is why it is so\n... ... ... ... a\nTerrifying it's not going to be a rational person that causes these things they're not gonna be rational\nYou're going to be not they're going to be absolutely nuts ...\n... a and a\nAnd that's what's frightening is the media just put all of the nut jobs on the right in as the regular person right when it comes to the left they don't even reports some ... ... but they certainly say well that's not\nThat's not you know that's not who Bernie Sanders is that's not a Bernie Sanders follower well I agree with you I agree with you ... why is this guy all of a sudden any less than the guy from burning that that was a Bernie Sanders volunteer\nAgain as we said at the time and Bernie Sanders is not responsible for shooting Colorado baseball fields endures Donald Trump responsible for this as any logical person that's ever seen anything to do with our legal system would be able to do um but you know again this is we were not going to know enough about this ... this is but this is a product\n... but even a couple of maybe not to write three you're pushing it ...\nUs three hundred bumper stickers covering all of your windows you are not convincing anyone to your viewpoint I think you know those people because of it\nOh no if you have a nature way you're ... you're going to be kicked out yeah you're going to they're going to tell you to move because you're a spoof to death all of the neighbors ...\nEven the name you could be living in the most anti ... you could be living in a neighborhood with the holy family ... and the whole\nAnd all of the pro life activists from all the time right and you could drive one of those crazy anti abortion bans into your driveway and\nThose people are going to say you know we have standards yeah you're not\n... I just really hope if Jesus comes back he's not in the van\nAnd you know when it comes in a white van with the budget bumper stickers people are not going to buy it but it's true like I don't believe this guy there's no way back like that and again you're not supposed to know what's coming right or maybe that's how he does how does he comes back maybe that's how the anti Christ comes with that I Would I Do [laughter] well no no no because I wouldn't be slick enough you would have you know ... ... ...\n... ... oh my gosh ... or\nPlug years to broker a he'd be the guy who would try to say we should round up all the people in the anti Christ would be the first one to go you know these people are nuts and\nWill be a good suspects I don't know why it's such an irrelevant pretty ... why do we care to live out do not even ... what a what I Will show that while I didn't see that one coming that's like ... like\nReally bad like lifetime movies where they're trying to give you the big the big switch through and like it's like a it's a you know it's a rape case and you know the whole time they purchased\nMovies where they're trying to give you the big ... the big switch through ... and like it's like a it's a you know it's a rape case and\nYou know the whole time they put you to this one person and at the very last second you know a guy she walked by for three seconds in the grocery stores the guy who did it and you're like come on of course we didn't see that coming it's a nobody [laughter] well You're welcome on the track there you go wow same plot twist ...\n... I don't know if I feel comfortable employing the anti Christ so I'm just going to concentrate on the mail bombs us back and it's just been arrested in Florida [laughter] yeah I I I cannot believe there's not a journalist who was taking the high quality photo of ... how is this possible they're all zoomed out from you know the helicopters\nAnd you can't quite see exactly what it said I Will say you know by all appearances it does appear to be a pro Trump propaganda and now it's it's sort of difficult to see ... ... ... like for example a there's a shirt that was around in the elections are a lot that looked like a a Hillary\n... a presidential shirt and then it said a message under that said something like a lock her up twenty twenty or twenty sixteen\nThey get could theoretically be alive anti Trump stuff but I don't think you I think yeah I'm just reading the fish and pretty deep picture I Do this all the time for the uh for the level after I you know like you got to find okay what is the one\nCircumstance that we can be missing here and maybe that's it but it does seem to be a ... in his face in a presidential seal pretty clearly on one of the windows but again you know that the media going to try to make this out to be\nWell from ... or you know evil bombers\n... you know and and again we didn't do that with all Bernie Sanders supporter known say all people who are who we didn't say that I was ... going to shoot someone on a on a on a field ... and that guy was successful ... that guy actually almost\nKilled people ... ... this one didn't assume didn't and we didn't say that when we could have ... with the Bernie Sanders guy ...\nAnd you know there's a couple of reasons why number one this stuff happens right right wing people do crazy things to there's there's plenty of them on the right as well there are plenty of crazy does not go to one party when you get these fringe levels there are people on both sides who do it um there's a there's an ideology and we've talked a lot about this that affects\nMany on uh the very harsh left ... going back to you know samples like ... and the one the weather underground and we saw this\nWith the Occupy Wall Street but there's some ID ideological reasons why certain types of violence come from the left more often but still there's crazy people all over the spectrum\nYou just hey you don't want to do it because your size probably need some dumb leader and you're gonna get blamed for it but beyond that it's just a correct when people people are responsible for their own actions when you were an individual you act as an individual and the person who says something that you listen to is not responsible\nFor how you take that information and how you deal with it not to mention it may or not may have nothing to do with that at all ... you know just because\nYou happen to be a he happens to be a a a Trump supporter does that make ... make Trump's\nMaking Trump's fault that he's doing these terrible thing no and the same thing would apply as it did apply to a Bernie Sanders by the way that just\nA a fan but campaign volunteer ... was actually working to get the guy elected who then went and tried to shoot twenty five Republicans on a baseball field but again not Bernie Sanders fault at all not his fault at fault zero percent ... and the same thing would be would apply here if this is how this thing turns out\nA little more to find them I I Will tell you this I think how fortunate we are ...\nIn a couple of things and I'm a\nGo back to the a bombing of the bridge in Cleveland ...\nYou remember about that you remember that name remember anybody\nRemember when Occupy Wall street was caught by the FBI\nYou remember about that you remember that name remember anybody\nYou remember when Occupy Wall street was caught by the FBI or on their way to the bridge I think they had part of it even why or did they have any of it wired\nBut they were going to blow up a bridge in Cleveland ah and they had the capability of doing it and thank God the FBI caught them but that never made any news you know it would have made huge news of the Tea Party would have been doing at rice for they didn't they you know occupy\nWall Street all those are just crazy kids you know they're just they're in the Scooby Doo van there just\nRaising kids um\nLet's see how fortunate we are that that didn't happen how they could have torn apart\nOr think about the blessings that not a single bomb went off a that this guy may have been so damn crazy\nThat he really thought\nWell I don't have any gunpowder by I'm pretty sure ... sand gets hot uh you know this guy is I mean you want to talk about incompetent\nOr um or how fortunate we are\n... that none of these bombs went off if any of these bombs would have gone off and hurt\nOr killed or maimed people from the other side of the world would be a different place today ... ... the media would be going\nCrazy because look and how they're going crazy now\nGood news looks like we may have caught the guy yeah it's interesting and now they're starting at ... ... we're getting to that point where people are starting to share pictures of what appears to be the van which does appear to be very pro Trump also very pro soccer\nIf [laughter] if it odd odd combination of\nThings to be I Would find out I Would not assume on the big soccer fan but who knows but will or I Will tell you these things checkout again everyone roasted soccer people we said how long have we said that I think we blame 'em I think we blame the world were up up\n[laughter] [noise] oh my gosh the world cup boating 'cause there it is over there it is all going back to the Trump Tower and a meeting with pollutants allies yet this is the mother immediately get it right away or I\nMight be hard to find good craftsmanship but people who actually care about their jobs but simply say they do man they care about a day care so much about making a beautiful and functional\nDevice that will keep your family safe they want to go find a way to make it really really super small so it ... you know you barely even see it uh they wanted to make something that wasn't hard wired something that you could afford that would be a lot cheaper than what you're paying for if you go to\nYou know one of these other places um and it would work even if
