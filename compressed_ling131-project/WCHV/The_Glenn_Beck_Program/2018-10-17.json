sure um because we don't have the evidence now maybe the United states has the evidence the president has the evidence I don't know it's all coming from turkey\nAnd turkey is motivated to destroy Saudi Arabia possibly to destroy the west if you want to look at that they're looking to build a caliphate but\nThey also may be playing another game to get closer to the United states\nYeah I mean there's an argument to be made a they've releases a pastor recently and they want to\nMaybe send the signal hey these guys you're dealing with in Saudi Arabia there there are bad you should be dealing with us from orange sauce arms you should be working with us more closely and they're trying to encourage shoot themselves to the United states at at the expense more specifically at the expense of Saudi Arabia or because they they don't like that the closeness of that relationship\nOr there's an argument to be made there I mean I think a lot of this is\nYou have to take when you have to countries that really disagree with each other and don't like each other you have to take the reports coming out of turkey with some level of a grain of SALT I mean you have to we we need more evident than there we there's a tape if there's a tape\nThat at least are we don't need to hear it necessarily publicly but at least our intelligence sources maybe a a high level reporter or somewhere with some credibility needs to hear them and confirmed that they exist as we've heard a lot of details\nAbout what is out in the state but we have not obvious to see if I were here to one I Would not release the tape if I had it I wouldn't release it yet I Would let Saudi Arabia\nPlay this all out because remember last week it was no this is crazy this conspiracy nuts mhm now it seems that they are a saying\nThose things happen so now let's see Saudi Arabia again we still we that's all sources to well I Know they do not know 'em out and say I know this was a rope thing that went wrong or an interrogation that went wrong there are reports through CNN\nThat they're going to say that right but they haven't actually set it and we don't know where that is coming from yeah yeah I Will say that there's no there's no need for us to rush to judgment here and then I Know that people are bashing Trump because he kind of said oh well it's a\nYou know it's it's a guilty until proven innocent well first of all we should get evidence is there any everything over international relations with the past Twenty years and he should make sure we have these things right yes there's also it's not an imminent it's not like okay it's weapons of mass destruction for example to use one that works in this context\nWhere where we could be facing an imminent threat\nOf you know a bomb going off in a place that kills a lot of people that you know we may be able to stop this is the if this is this is a prosecution of a crime right in our eyes and if if they have actually killed this person they need to be held responsible however\nThey have actually killed this person they need to be held responsible\nHowever we don't need to make that decision tomorrow nope we need to make sure that we get it right we need to actually figure out all the dynamics going on just because this is a media the non today does not mean we need to make a decision today man that's the older we actually take it seriously and look at the facts only a media feed them because it involved a reporter\nAnd yeah and and the stories so dramatic as you point out what was it wasn't at first Hitchcock movie yeah rather window right we're window I mean you know it's such a dramatic\nHollywood type crazy twenty four ah you know Jack Ryan story that you wonder I mean it it it capturing our attention which is it okay it's just that\nWe have to make sure we're looking at where this stuff is coming from right now it's coming from people with incentive to make Cody Arabia look bad my guess is\nBecause I think Saudi Arabia they're not our friends they've done a lot of really bad things um this ... I mean get remember this prince\nTook his own family members other princes hostage in a hotel and likely stole tons of their wealth including planes and these specific planes are the ones accused of flying in and taking the remains out in suitcases so these are the\nPlanes the prince confiscated from other family members [laughter] I mean as he held them you know and they you know rich Carlton\nPrison so it's a legitimate worry that this guy is an absolute Kim Jong ... style maniac\nAnd if that's happening with Saudi Arabia is a lot worse than it's happening you know in North Korea and a lot of ways I mean we already have a relationship with Saudi Arabia they're very influential in that region we know they do this but we know this stuff goes on in this region already and we'll end with all these countries that that do it right but we just have to make sure that\nThere's no reason to feel pressure did not go through and intelligence you know full look at this before you start making public proclamation\nAnd you better take this tape seriously because if I were holding the tape I Would hold it until I see exactly how the United states and Saudi Arabia kinda finagle around and calmed everybody down\nAnd then when everybody says okay this is over and they are not such bad guys and this was a mistake that's what I read the tape if they don't do what you want them to do if you're turkey that's when you ... it was it that that destroys\nThe what credibility Saudi Arabia has ever had and with me they've had very little they're not friends of ours they are not friends of ours they are selling us crap the quite honestly I live in Texas we don't need it\nChanged or or use the named tad a ... to you know to to be more I guess American in the middle and also I think to separate himself from his father ... I'm ... that came that came really early and here's an Irish guy\nChanges in the rye and notify us Hispanic yet trying to be more Hispanic it he he crazy he\nAlso went so far as back in twenty twelve try he tried to uh joined the Hispanic caucus in Congress and then you know and she didn't know he did he tried to get into the Hispanic caucus because some of the El Paso residents his district is Seventy seven percent Hispanic\nSo some of the residents were upset that still does to re as was no longer going to be in the pretty powerful Hispanic ... so he tried to join it and like Mm no the nicknames not enough\n[laughter] really I mean if we go through the intersection analogy of a Beto uh nobody's intersecting him no nobody's intersecting him he is still at the top of the hierarchy in the patriarchy pyramid\nI think one of my favorite parts of the debate last night was when Beto tried to make this case that every decision Ted Cruz makes is about money so like he supports the second amendment and that's because of the n._r._a. and heat and horse there's ...\nIt's like you're you've brought in thirty eight million dollars of nations wrangler out raising cruised by what four\nTo one five to one night and of course as Cruz pointed out he's had plenty of special interest money come in and it just coming in through other names is coming in through a pack the heat quote unquote doesn't control which we all know how that game goes\nI mean the idea that you're going to come out and making ... an argument about how Ted Cruz is about money when the entire story arc of Beto is based on the fact that he can raise money well he's not competitive in this race he he has never accomplish anything yeah\nShe is only in the race to run for twenty twenty\nI bet if he loses how is he has to run for tried I don't know but they're still talking about an hour you know Robert De Niro was talking about him you know he is he is that he's there John F. Kennedy Democrat hope right now and then I may I say the great\nWhite hope yeah yeah yeah it's a it's been fascinating to watch this um he also tried to a pin\nA ... it's been fascinating to watch this um\nHe also tried to a pin head up against Donald Trump says they have the big rally coming up what his next\nWednesday or Thursday in Houston and given by calling him lay in bed like like Trump did and he said that's why the president called him lying dead and it's why his nickname stuck because it's true uh\nWhich has never it's never stuck in it ever ever suck it's never been true and what prompted him to say that about a battle was that he had voted for Bill\nThat would raise the price of oil twenty four cents a gallon to put a ten dollar surcharge on every barrel of oil which would raise the price about twenties for sense\nOf gas in the press or yeah yes so a ... that was a true but he voted against the bill that would have stopped that bill so it really is true that he did he put the book and they can both kind of claim that they have the truth on their side in that particular case\nUm but it was interesting to me because the CNN fact checked Beto on some things that he's been lying about during the campaign one being that his mother is a lifelong Republican loves this life long Republican right now you know because he's so wonderful and use\nSo uniting yeah she's going to vote for him for the first time or the first time he's a life that in law and first of all your\nMom is going to vote for you was [laughter] at one level lenient how your your mom never\nRight and then it helped me out of hand because I think C. N. N. even looked into this way you did yeah yeah they fighting\nFor a hardcore Republican named uh Brock Obama in two thousand eight primary Obama yeah yeah\nNow here in Barry can Marietta [laughter] okay so here's the interesting thing I Love this part of the expos aid from CNN\nAnd she can't remember who tries to she voted for him to ... you remember ten years ago but not to [laughter] we're really you don't know who you voted for you know in order\nFor Hillary and just didn't want to say it\nWant to say it\nShe couldn't if she voted for if she voted for Trump it wouldn't work to his advantage yeah\nShe was she was there it was part of the Trump saying yeah you know she wanted change she wanted to write it is they would have worked right oh but you can't go to that she voted for Obama in a way this lifelong Republican and then she cat remember in sixty and\nThe other interesting aspect is that this lifelong Republican has voted in every single Democratic primary in Texas since two thousand\n[laughter] not at all and even went so far is donating money to do about it [laughter] I I ... a\nA federalist on this to a ... I don't know I Know a lot about better but at the same time I don't know much about Senator Kennedy Josh Hawley who is thirty eight years old meaning you know around eight years younger than rising star Beto the attorney general Missouri and the Republican nominee for the U.S Senate\nWhen I Do know is Holly is slightly leading McCaskill a two time incumbent in the in the ... average poll in a race that could decide which party controls the Senate\nO'Rourke who was up against Ted Cruz and incumbent is down seven points and falling it wouldn't be completely surprising if cruise ended up winning Texas by nearly the same margin he did in two thousand twelve I think as as with Holly I didn't know much about Arizona's GOP sending a nominee Martha McSally either um ...\nThe ...

it perhaps [noise] good [noise]\nOkay my hand might need it\nGets hot in mind blowing in your\nI write in the great [noise]\nBill yeah um look [noise]\nThe good news is they are in many of these people are much like Germany where the essay and I have a a or the same ... just saying the same people yesterday were Hitler is a street dogs who went out and beat up anybody who oppose not to use them and all\nThat and they were a little uniforms with brown shirts they ran around and the authorities did the same thing they're doing in Portland, Oregon or they step back and let these actually a a bully boys a\nBeat up innocent people and sold them like that exactly the same yeah no difference\nIs this happening everybody to get that yeah this this happened I mean it happened with the black church as well in Italy this is a missile leaves guy and then there's what they do it\nThat's a good blueprint right okay so here's the story I used to work in Portland, Oregon I worked a channel to there\nAnd a beautiful place beautiful state but ... county where Portland is located a is a far left hip replaced and has been that for many many years where they are permissive or they want the father's last politician\nAnd has been that for many many years where they are permissive uh they want the father's left politicians they can get and they have it so now you had a guy will or the mayor of the town who runs the police bureau that's what they call it there\nAre basically says I'm not going to force the law not going to do it and that poor woman uh is going to be assaulted verbally and not allowed to walk where she wants and that's okay with me mayor Ted Wheeler that's fine\nAnd I'm going to tell my officers don't help that women don't interfere in the air\nAnd also I'm going to lead antifa a surround the ice it waters\nAnd I'm going to let them do pretty much whatever they want to do including fighting on the street using masks over their faces carrying weapons they can do whatever they want to do now\nThis is America you would think the people Portland, Oregon would rise up right\nThat they would go out in the rose city which signs condemning the mayor\nAnd antifa and mass tens of thousands of them they gather by that while I'm at river with their signs this is not the city we want to get anybody out there doing that nobody so this is the problem the problem is that we all are the problems are antifa the\nPaddle them is the people in Portland, Oregon and that's why I wrote killing the ss cause I'm saying we better wake up here in America we better wake up and confront evil antifa is evil\nSo I get told me when I was yeah I think you did and I've got a lot to ask you about on this but let me let me start with this\n[noise] [noise] why do you suppose\nThat there isn't a an uprising\nOr in Portland or the or the\nBlind to it for some reason or do they actually supported are they afraid to come out what is the what's real readership\nIn in in Montgomery County so you if I were still working on channel two I'd be doing commentary going okay I'm going to be out uh on the banks of the ... river\nI'm going to be there at the ten in the morning on a Saturday I Want y'all come out and support what I'm doing okay nobody's going to do that there's nobody in town going to do that with any visibility at all then went to\nUm unfortunately because there are many many many good people in Portland I'm old DOMA county and I have friends there most people are selfish\nAll right they're into their own pursuits they're doing whatever they want to do and you know what this is the ...\nReally want to spend time on this and then maybe they're not like me and maybe and people hit me or am I going to do it\nIf the selfish thing and it's not just in Portland, Oregon I mean we have to really as as a people we really have to start to rise up and say hey you know what we want to process\nWe want a presumption of innocence we don't want thoughts on the streets in mass beating people up and telling women that there has been should rotten a grave it we don't want that\nOkay so important when do we have any democratic 'cause it's all Democrats a hundred percent got any politicians they're the governor of Oregon doing anything about this saying anything about it no no no no ... and that's how far we've come that's how far we've declined\nSo bill I Want to talk to a little bit more about this and just do\nSo far we've come that's how far we've declined\nSo bill I Want to talk to a little bit more about this and just one thing on and when you say we've got to stand up and fight this I I'd like to hear your opinion on what exactly that means\nTrump into basically dismissing Saudi Arabia All right well they want to not trade with them they want to crush\nThat nation because of the nation is quote unquote bad\nOkay I'm not going to stick up for Saudi Arabia is bad\nBut Saudi Arabia is the bulwark against Iran in the middle east and it's the leader of Jordan and Egypt in that movement to blunt Iran is terrorism\nAnd destruction of Israel Saudi Arabia is leading the charge so why on earth is the American left wanna destroy that nation\nWhen in history we allied herself with style and it was killing millions of people why we were allied with him because we had to defeat Hitler All right and you can just give a thousand other examples of countries that we had to do business\nSet the world on fire it's different\nAnd any new sanctions Saudi Arabia in a way that hurts them but doesn't destroy the kingdom\nThat's what you have to do so I'm at but look\nTrump doesn't have the heart for this he doesn't want to cancel the arms deals that are rich America doesn't want to do it and the reason that we're we have a relationship with Saudi Arabia anyways because they headed OPEC we needed that oil and the in the sixties and seventies and eighties\nDead on any more but now Silicon Valley takes a lot of their money\nRight so I have I say punish them you know when when it comes out and I believe firmly they did it\nI don't think there's any doubt that they did it this guy walked into the counseling and assemble Saudi council it and he was butchered or whatever okay they did it and I believe that salt and the guy running the place he ordered\nIt right to the top so when that comes out than Trump has to say we're going to do this and figure out a way to punish them um but not destroy them that's what has to happen for the good of America\nAnd do you think they'll take that punishment they've said that if we run off and on and they have to right\nYeah yeah I mean it's just like turkey when a letting the pastor out ... let them out while he's out I mean Saudi Arabia can't exist without the United states they can't exist without the United states because Iran will go in there and\nCause so much trouble yeah that'd be the place will collapse and so they need the United states can say whatever they want to say they need us and they've got to pay a price for this they absolutely have to pay a price for it\nDo you think turkey has the tape or is this last I\nHow can I possibly know back in the turkey\nOr three times All right ah I don't know what tape they have what channel I watch I don't know anything\nWhat I I I Would think the leading national link user outages in politics or at least have some ideas I'm a little and the gas on it I mean I Would think so too a lot I mean\nIn the Saudi a counseling is Saudi Arabian territory the Turks have no access they did go in by the way which is interesting and they say yeah we found some chemical agents of and then somebody painted jumping but let's just wait but I don't think anybody listening to us right now I should have any doubt\nThat this guy was assassinated by the Saudi Government it's amazing how close to this is to rear window\nOr the Hitchcock movie I mean it's it's really I mean it's you know if the Muslim Brotherhood and try and swords were involved\nUm a bill always good to talk to you the book a killing the ss absolutely worth or read it applies to today shows real heroes and real real villains that got away for a way with it for quite some time\nYeah and I want to tell everybody I had back on the nose venues on Bill O'Reilly dot com yesterday for a rollicking twenty minute interview which we posted now so anybody can see it you know and if you remember to watch\nAnd you were pretty ... you were pretty tame I thought maybe they were you know what I\nMean you and I are

educated\nUh and uh it's frightening frightening what is happening and the world is not standing up and and more importantly Melissa just look up just looked up at CNN\nTrump says he's not to blame if GOP loses but who cares I mean CNN ... can you just get over it for ten seconds is there nothing\nElse important going on in the world they're not the only ones guilty of this but there is CNN in particular a treat\nLike Donald Trump\nLike almost the reverse of a teenager and a boy band it's like the obsession level is he's incredibly high now they're looking at it as a negative instead of a positive\nBut like they just are obsessed with this person yeah I mean it's seemingly there ... all that matters are dominated by him yeah all that matters the whole thing about living rent free inside someone else's head I mean is so on display with CNN right now they can't talk about anything else even when they're talking about other things\nSaudi Arabia from Saudi Arabia now\nSaudi Arabia he's in trouble you know two or does Trump have ties to Saudi Arabia he's talked about his ties to Saudi Arabia\nThey can they caught somebody up alive alive the butchered him alive caught him up and

people that was wrong with\nThe like legitimately like a sickness for some of that might be an end but I mean it is it as a network as a whole they can't\nFigure out a way to discuss any other topic is really incredible I mean he really does dominates their lives every aspect or at least there's at least they're public life I don't know maybe they go home and don't talk about it I don't know but when they're on TV they're talking about all the time it's like there's got to be something else interesting in the world there's got to be\nWell just looked at the headline at Fox they're talking about Elizabeth Warren and you know are Cherokee heritage\n... you think of it break bread country right in Texas ... however uh the poll shows that fifty percent of adult disapprove of Donald Trump's of um job performance and only forty one percent approve that gets closer among likely voters words or forty nine forty eight\nBut still it's surprising I Would think that that would be more in the positive\nThat gets closer among likely voters words or forty nine forty eight but still it's surprising I Would think that that would be more in the positive in a state like Texas it this way try this on for size or a Donald\nTrump is everywhere and he is either blamed or excused for everything right\nAnd it's dominating your life just like Iraq Obama was dominating everybody's life um and Donald Trump has a really good side and a really bad side and it depends on what day\nYou're like ... you know if you support Donald Trump is some days you're like yeah other days you're like oh can we not talking about today and I don't want to talk about the ...\nYou know so she is such a big figure in everybody's life\nTed Cruz was a very big picture or big big force in everybody's life two years ago but he's just kind of falling off the map and he's just\nDoing a good job okay mhm I'm Greg Abbott is just doing a good job and nobody's talking about\nNobody's talking about because the state's running great everything's going really well he's a great governor he's not controversial so I think the poll numbers are just how much is this person impacted my life\nIn a kind of in a bad way of oh I got to deal with this again today I got to talk about this again you can get you get you get into the ... yeah yeah yeah and it's not a bad thing about any of them it's just like\nOh I'm so tired of this ... you know it's like the closer you get to Washington Greg Abbott is here Ted Cruz's in Washington but you know really the epicenter now and with the last\nPresident is the White House and so the closer you get the more you're like oh enough\nYeah I it's it's a it's an interesting thing I mean I it's nice to see I think you know especially if cruises hold on to this race would it seems like he will at the moment ah it going to help a lot of other candidates in really close races there six tossup races right now or Arizona Florida Indiana Missouri Montana and Nevada\nAll of them are are very tight\nYou know the fact that this thirty eight million dollars is not flowing into a race in that group is a real positive for Republicans I did Democrats are very excited about better but I mean his chances of winning are very low\nAnd they've just thrown money at a candidate who has essentially I mean a very small chance of winning I Would say it's no chance but a very small chance of winning and you know that's only benefiting Republican chances of of keeping the Senate but they are\nHere's what's happening they've made him into a national figure ... you know they're already by putting him on Ellen y y and Z on Alan\nHuh I Wonder if he doesn't get done he's he's responsible for absolutely nothing right he's not he's not something like up and coming outsider right like he's a guy who's been in Congress for a long time or he has been in politics for very long time his whole life has basically been politics outside of his early ... I Swear it's just because they think he's good looking\nGuy and he can he can give a good speech I think he's I think it's it's the\nBronco bomb a syndrome of two thousand for what is this guy done he will he gave a good speech in two thousand four well you should be president what is this guy done well he's been on Allen\nI mean it's it's it's not just that he's good looking I think that there is a\nPart of the Democratic party that does not want to go the Democratic socialism anti capitalist sort of way and Beto doesn't look like that\nLike his ... his power is ... is Alexandra ... court correct I mean they went ... went through them and the ...\nOf way and Beto doesn't look like\nThat you don't like his ... his power game as Alexandria Ocasio Cortez correct I mean they went ... went through them and the debate last night\nI'm sure some of these young yet but first of all let's start with a hit a Beddoes opening and how you may know\nBeto is a a Hispanic\nNo Hispanic close name is Robert actually brands to hear from a Central America I Know a very recently Irish and he uh and he came out and make sure you knew how Hispanic he was in Iraq last Hispanic than war than Elizabeth Warren is Cherokee I don't know what you're talking about here's a here's the battles open\nFirst case let me thank you and Sarah from moderating tonight's debate Ken's five for hosting us the people of San Antonio for being here and the people in Texas for watching this and participating in one most important decisions of our lifetimes ... says all of a sucking in San Antonio\nYes the powerful see how Hispanic he is he can't even stop himself from speaking Spanish he was trying to speak in English that entire time and just slipped into it because it's so natural for him coming from his deep Hispanic groups and that's something I Want you to make sure you understand unlike this old white guy\nOr she have gone through no he's not white or who is basically I mean it's so ridiculous Ted Cruz's old a white guy that they can choose a year and a half to two years older than a ... ... or Robert Francis Oregon or he's not my income\n... um anyway so uh this is it was interesting to watch just because you know like as you pointed out crews runs for president he doesn't win a and he's been you\nKnow you don't hear from him as often as you did and but he's been doing a great journeys his voting record is very solid I think you know anybody whether you like Trump branded like going to like the stuff he he votes for\nThe stuff he's doing behind the scenes with the judiciary and I don't mean just the Supreme Court I mean the ah the ah the federal courts is remarkable and we'll change the course of court decisions for very\nLong time yeah he's been very involved the very involved um however Beto I don't I don't know I mean I get the idea that maybe he's a younger and\nGood looking and can speak coherently I think that's the only thing you can as attractive to a lot of neck muscles yeah a lotta neck muscles a very shiny new well very shiny but he um talked about\nAbout Cruz and his motivations remember this is a guy who's brought in the only story about better off of any note if he's raised a lot of money that is his entire the entire reason anyone ever discussed him because he has raised a fortune but of course he goes after Cruz over money listen\nSpeaking of balancing budgets I'm only one of us has with good friends in El Paso started a small business\nOr met the payroll every week balance the books made sure that we deliver for our clients only one of us has served at the local government level every single year balancing the budget seeing each other not as Republicans and Democrats but at the council members entrusted with a ... a share of responsibility to deliver for the taxpayers will pass every single year\nWe did and for Senator Cruz to say that this isn't going to bust the budget at a time of Twenty one trillion dollars in debt when we're on track to deficit spend to the tune of a trillion dollars a year he voted to add two trillion dollars\nAnd those tax cuts disproportionately will flow to corporations who are already sitting on record piles of cash for and the already wealthy in a country that has ribbon with income inequality unseen last gilded age why\nIn the days just before and just after that vote Sen Cruz accepted one hundred and twenty thousand dollars from the political action committees who\nAfter that vote Sen Cruz except that one hundred and twenty thousand dollars\nFrom the political action committees who represent the corporate interests that benefited from this sucks 'cause that's why does single for this why does he vote for Internet companies to sell your private browsing data to the highest bidder without ... why does he not vote for universal background checks in a country that loses\nThirty thousand people to gun violence every year follow the money in each of these cases if you look at the political action committee contributions to Senator Cruz it helps to explain the reasons for his vote and how corrupt Congress has become\nNow again unbelievable hundred and twenty thousand dollars really is Ted Cruz changing and opinion over a hundred and twenty thousand dollars\nIt's ridiculous if cruise dropped out of the Senate right now he'd get a lobbying job at some from and make millions without even thinking about it he was ... I mean he's highly educated his wife worked at Goldman Sachs if we remember this is not there's not a money issue a for crews\nAre beyond that of course Beto O'Rourke has accepted or as had many ads run on his behalf ... from ... from PACs and superPACs and he's got that\nLittle a little light of all you know I'm not telling them to do it so therefore I'm not responsible more in\nBut again he's raised thirty eight million dollars he's complaining about one hundred and twenty thousand dollar donation to cruise that make some changes opinion worth thirty eight million dollars do what does that make you\nI'll tell you what it does I think thirty eight million dollars uh for some uh makes you in to a national candidate for another race not this one mhm for others who have given part of that thirty eight million dollars or in large a chunks\nThat just pissed says them off\nBecause\nI Want results results I gave you told me that this guy had a chance this guy was going to do it I saw him everywhere and you still got beat and a and a beaten by how much wasn't even close\nWhere's my money where's my money\nAnd I you know I think that's how people would react to that but\nI I Know people on the Democratic side who have given money who are absolutely that they have given given given and they're like you know I have to tell you you're you're off the deep end with crazy radicals and you're putting up people who have who do you have this", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Glenn Beck Program", "city": "Charlottesville", "day": "17"}
