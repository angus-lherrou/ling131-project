got to the ... give us two minutes on on killing the ss\nI look at the book is about evil and and my contention is that most Americans don't understand the evil my mother didn't she lived a very\nAnd re your life yeah she's on me which is obviously but she loves\nAnd she lived a very\nReal life yeah she's on would obviously but she loved me and thought I was good so you didn't understand evil right right\nSo we're seeing so much evil in America are we know what I'm you know people walking into schools gunning do kids clerics abusing children um Chicago where thousands of people are shot by drug gangs and nothing's done opioid epidemic through the roof\nThe ... in American history this is a pivot point to ... what does this mean the bill for history as your case either direction\n[noise] it was a cat um\nI don't know yet I mean I Can't speculate on that I can just I Know I'm pretty good at at a value waiting the mood of the country\nYou may remember that five days before the election of two thousand sixteen I predicted Trump would win and I predict it because people didn't like Hillary Clinton would stay home I mean a that was my best\nAddicted Trump would whether I predict it because people didn't like Hillary Clinton would stay home I mean a that was my best that I ever did in ... right now I Am feeling it everywhere I go I Know a lot of people that I'm Around okay\nThat the regular folks know this was a sham and they know that cabin on his family were damaged very badly by people who didn't care to seek the truth they know that\nThat I think will play out at all politics but you got to remember is a powerful powerful corrupt lobby that is driving me to thing\nAnd the media is like what ... what was like\nThis is still a brand new but then the second sorry go on a grand\nFor Grassley his\nHair was that I I Believe okay also to miss half and\nUm you have to understand that the media in conjunction with the fanatics Israel it powerful powerful to drive say\nCan I only have a hold on to stop hold on\nJust er Heller she's now\n... now yes being is the big one\nMrs Hyde Smith\nMurkowski coming in ...\n... and\nThat's your Johnson\nIs there Jim\nKennedy\nHow's he was a big one is ...\nMr Lankford\nHe's certainly\nMr mansion\nMr marking the ... what did I mention this is McCaskill was Murkowski\n\nInstrument into almost there\nBy the time this summer and okay come Iran is Murkowski\nSilence so we do not Murphy will know soon wouldn't\nYou know we didn't know on a mansion or Murkowski those are the two very interesting\nOne is is strange I'm watching all of the networks and none of them are catching the vote so no one is yeah north of New York times or we're looking at all the sites right now to see what the nobody knows we don't know yeah\nYeah yeah have you on this kind of has a\nYou know they're going to the closed debate and I'm Benno both moral and I do believe a cabin all be confirmed [noise] um nobody wants to be on the wrong side of this and the winds are blowing against the Democrats now the winds have shifted\nA listener emailed me out of the wind is shifting don't you think I mean this the first time I've ever seen this tactic by the Democrats backfire on them\nI don't know the Clarence Thomas stuff was pretty rough [noise] um and I think that a African Americans at the time were pretty angry about it\nBut it that of course a dissipated once he got on a court the question is if Kavanaugh is confirmed more let's all go away we'll people just say okay the good guys one and then we're not\nDissipated once he got on a court the question is if Kavanaugh is confirmed Willis all go away we'll people just say okay\nThe good guys one and then we're not real are interested\nIn punishing the Democrats I don't think so anymore I don't think I just think people are so furious I think they're gonna they're gonna take it out on\nThe ... I think the Democrats think that they control the these um activist they really think that they can you know ... you know turn 'em on and turn them off no I Know they do but I think there are approaching a time when they're not going to be able to turn them off\nMa a ... I don't see it that way is ... is very well organized you're going to get individuals\nThat confront people in restaurants a ... like that you're going to have that and somebody might get hurt but on the organized front these people are very discipline and there's about a dozen organizations now where money is flooding in to disrupt the process on the part of the far left\nThan by some um some news Iraq\nYet with um one thing a couple of things here a Collins one of the big ones are yes ... I'm like so yeah and in the ass so\nI'm I'm sure Murkowski was a yes and mentioned I don't know that that's an interesting\nOr in the middle of looking at that right now ah and bill do you think that they just overplayed their hand oh yeah and I really feel like they could have had it they could have had Murkowski they could have had calling if they really played the seriously but instead they overplay their hand to an incredibly worldly\nAbsolutely and they didn't have what they didn't have 'em look I went through this and and and all the all of a sudden I every time I turned around there was somebody else saying ...\n... it wasn't true mhm All right so what they thought would that more people were going to come out\nAnd and point a finger at him and and or somebody was going to bolster Ford's party statement going all yeah I was at that party and I saw this happen what do they have the loop they threw it out there the less\nAccepted it as fact and made it easier for people to come through and then you add Avon body at all these other crazy people\nPiling on and and the and the left said look this is what usually happens but here um you know with the FBI involvement and you know pretty strong statement by Kavanaugh\nKavanaugh saved himself ... to ... you know one of the things that I couldn't do in a way to save myself because they didn't want they being far need to address it just\nA minute I couldn't say myself cabin or did\nYou uh we had a ... turned it it does look like a rock Joe Manchin has voted yes on Kavanaugh\nSays that means that having a a the mansions going to vote to confirm him ... and the reason mansions doing that is because if he voted\nAgainst Kavanaugh that he might lose the\nElection I went to the west Virginia how stupid we do have one no vote from Lisa Murkowski Murkowski's out a mansion in in playing in Collins is in a this was just should be enough for him to get confirmed\nYeah because if it's a tie with tens breaks it correct or Murkowski if Murkowski votes against Kavanaugh she's through in the Republican Party\nShe's finished yeah we'll get a nickel I'm from any Republican and I believe that she her Senate career will be over I think the people of Alaska very conservative state will throw her out\nDo you think Joe or do you think a bill that we have with a um with Murkowski the situation where she\nWe'll throw her out do you think Joe uh do you think a bill that we have with a um with Murkowski the situation where she knew it was going to go through we wanted to vote no was able to vote no because she knew they had the fifty votes\n[noise] doesn't matter just a no vote going he goes to every single one of her colleagues\nMhm\nIsolates her and puts her as a poli a word of the day where I Am\nA and the Republican Party game that that's an amazing situation I didn't think Murkowski was put her entire career risk ... over this but um or at least you\nKnow she could vote yes tomorrow\nHow how though if she's voting not to advance the nomination to the floor\nWell now she voted yes I Want to confirm it\nBecause I didn't think that it should go forward but now it's gone forward and so now I'm going to because a lot of people are calling my office and I'm afraid I'm afraid for my career I Do I'm going to vote yes\nMaybe but I see a that's a pretty tough line on yeah I don't\nThink is going to do it but it is interesting point him in that one of the most shocking vote result of that I can remember my entire lifetime was Lisa Murkowski beating Joe Miller on a write in ballots\nAre in that Senate campaign in several years ago does Alaska reward Murkowski after this with another election I mean I don't think so I don't think so\nThey are very independent they are conservative but they're very independent or and we'll wait and see Bill thanks so much Bill O'Reilly dot of a good weekend ... ... talk to you next week alright [noise] let me tell you about the greatest chair of all time it

and\nSo I mean I'm married in Montana and it'd be really frustrating though if you lost that Supreme Court justice huh a critic of a wedding [laughter] no way that that was my first I Would I mean like that it would be really if you lost that in a good Supreme Court justice over a wedding that would\nBe for us that wedding changes would you want your wedding to be the thing that changed the course of American history I wouldn't do do you almost want to delay your wedding yeah you'd be like dad go vote I don't want that responsibility on my back over our heads for the rest of our lives\nI think it was an friends where they say that I you know it's just basically just a party and the the the bride to be said if you say it's a party one more time you will not be invited right like it's not a party in ... really important and if you're a daughter and you're going through this you gotta have your dad there he wants a Walker down the aisle and I mean there's nothing more you could say about we always talk\nAlready in really important and if your daughter and you're going through this you gotta have your data he wants to walk her down the aisle and I mean there's nothing more you could say about we always talk about how these\nPeople are just like political robots like this is a real person\nWith a real daughter with a real priority and in a way I really feel like wow that's amazing that he's willing to take that stand in his motives\nBut here's the but here's the thing though also looking again from the daughter standpoint would you want your marriage to start\n[noise] no it's the calving off in one way or another known in this country she'd probably get death threats\nOh she probably would yeah it really ugly for for the whole family that I don't think Montana has police ... your from your from Montana ... athletes yes of Helena I've been to the mainstream oh my gosh\nSo the last few got out they had like a scapegoat do they have the the uh\nUh oxycontin problems they have the heroin problem up and it's mostly math math ... mostly men\nCrack and math\nYou know in in Helena ... have you actually seen it change your town the crack in math yeah well as seriously yeah seriously yeah I'm Serious\nI mean those are some of the town yeah towns in the middle of the country are the ones that are getting hit the hardest and people who are in those towns are like they're watching him just decay because it's just spreading like no I don't I don't\nPut it in reality I don't think he'll it has a correct math problem the main street so that means for ... million mostly just drive by shootings [laughter]\nIt is hitting them you know a a good chunk of the country though I Know that we saw the other day of a major\nYou know quote unquote bipartisan agreement on opioids the pool was Ninety eight to one in the Senate and the one vote was Mike Lee he was the no on the\nBill in and mad if that doesn't make me hesitate and wonder what\nThe hell is in and out of their own you know I mean I Know I mean the nervous I mean if Michael is voting no on ... it's not like Mike Lee doesn't drug victims right and I\nCan I just say I'm Sorry pat\nAs a guy who lives in excruciating pain his whole life as me a guy who has woken up on the operating table they cannot keep me down my body doesn't process that stuff\nLike other people and I've woken up in the middle of surgery scared the hell out of the anesthesiologist but but woken up they can't keep they take it takes ... to keep me down\nSo ah I sure do appreciate those drugs so yeah I just did an interview with um [noise]\nOh shoot from the five he's a friend of ours are volunteering hauling did the first interview with him about his son and opioids and everything else it's a ... hour full powerful interview\nBut his stance now is those all should be banned they should not make them at all the old opioid any opioids should be banned should not be even a veil a little to anybody I disagree with that is so wrong\nYeah it was ... or ... it may have ... to live in it it makes life\nMiserable yeah you can you can handle getting through your daily activities otherwise you'd be curled up in a ball and pain somewhere and you don't you'd you'd end up killing your ah usually would her ... you are if you if you don't have that I mean it doesn't even it doesn't even negate all the pain it just may not care yeah\nYou just don't carry your skill in pain you just don't care as\nManaging and there does seem to be a legitimate medical use for a lot of people to use opioids in\nThat if you do get a different than you you can get addicted to enjoy it and you can do\nIn a coal use for a lot of people to use opioids in that if you do get a different than you you can get addicted to oil they can't hit and\nYou can do your body it's only normal your body gets addicted and it helps to get off\nOf it I don't know about you but my doctors are really ... vigilant about their ... oh my gosh they are and they've gotten acts absolutely not see ask about it\nAnd I know you're a doctor because we we have the same back Dr and we were talking about it and I I always bring you up 'cause he's always when I bring you up easily because I'll always say patties in so much and he's like I think he's one of the worst\nPain patients that I have he's like I I don't know how he does it um and so we always talk about it and he's told me that his his the government is coming down on opioids hard you know it's like I don't know how people like pat are going to really I mean yeah it's going to be hard it's going to be hard\nAnd they're you know you got to do drug testing in almost every time now\nAlmost every time you know the only way to make sure you're not doctor shopping I guess in getting drugs from somebody else and you don't have anything in your system but what's supposed to be there almost every time I go I get a drug test\nSeriously ha ha ... and ... interesting allegation right yeah the idea that different doctors would have different approaches to a particular medical ailment is not surprising right like\nYou would go to a doctor because you think they're treating it better than maybe somebody else no there's no doctor shopping I well that's what the what I'm saying is the search for doctor shopping allegations can sometimes encompass some people were you at Yahoo or yeah\nOr young something legitimate yeah yeah but there are a lot of people who will go and try to get you know whatever they can from somebody or their their pernicious drugs but it's like anything is the Internet bad no right it can be it can be\nAre are these opioids bad and you know be it can be ... I mean it's it's like anything with real power\nAnd in the hands of each human you have the choice you can use them to alleviate pain or you can use them the way they're not supposed to be used and it's a very hard thing but you just got to be rock solid and it it it is hard it's really hard\nYeah but banning them is a it just is not a good idea it's just it's again prohibition\nYeah the drug war that's not the way you deal with it [noise]\nWhy am I doing over you and some show\nHave rent has set out to that working out we're going to have a lot of beer that functional really\nYeah I felt like I don't know what I'm saying anymore really clear I mean it was totally done any he seems totally clear would not do it all down by the hour\nWe'll I can drink more on the air which makes me question I've ever ... drink a lot on the show and the drunk every day's a functional I don't see the different I think that's what an hour I thought\nAll right ah wanted to share some feedback\nFrom uh our partners at Palm Beach letter taking tours crypto course now this of course that is just trying to teach you what crypto currency is what block chain is how it works why it's part of our future whether you like it or not\nFour or five star ratings everybody here's the comments very simple course very informative preventer a presenter ... is excellent uh I knew little about um oh I knew a little from various sources but the how to pieces were missing now I understand what it is and how to buy crypto\nUh I was less than a novice when this course started the lessons we're clear and concise although still a I'm a bit apprehensive I Believe this courses give me the confidence to get into crypto currency ... thank you\nWe're clear and concise although still a bit apprehensive I Believe this courses give me the confidence to get into crypto currency so thank you very much\nI read a lot about crypto currency bloc chain but this course explains a lot in an easy way suitable for a a a person like me thank you uh ...
