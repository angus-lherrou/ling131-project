term into the Google Search bar you are being manipulated from the very first character that you typed\nSo if you type a depending on your history and other things chances are you'll get Amazon right away they'll start slashing suggestion that you and Amazon it turns out is Google's biggest advertiser paying them three hundred million dollars a year and Google\nSends more traffic to Amazon than any other single source but beyond that we've learned through our experiments\nThat Google can use search suggestions that they are flashing asked you to turn a fifty fifty vote among a fifty fifty
