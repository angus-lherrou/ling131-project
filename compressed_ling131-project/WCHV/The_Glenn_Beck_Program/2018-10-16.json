I I think there's a section in here that in the book that really came before as an alcoholic I had to decide is life worth living\nAnd\nIn the book there's a chapter of are we good or are we bad is this republic is the American experiment\nWorth saving\nAnd we're not talking about that we're seeing people tear it down but nobody who's talking about is it worth saving so how do we answer that question\nAnd the book goes through that and I I think the road to recovery of of our ills in this nation start there\nYou know you you can say Hillary Clinton can say well I Can't compromise with people you know I Can't even talk to those people because they want to destroy everything I Believe in what what is that you believe in\nAnd and really believe in don't tell me the trait little things tell me about America tell me who you are now she can't do that because I don't I just don't think that she's\nA she's honest enough to tell me she's this is a politician sees of calculating\nAnd and so are most politicians right and left it's up to us we have to say that to our neighbors\nAnd she's a calculating and and so are most politicians right and left it's up to us we have to say that to our neighbors that we think we disagree with can we just can we not talk about politics for a second\nIs America worth saving is it a good place or a bad place and the book shows you how to have that conversation and gives you some some facts both on good and bad\nBecause both sides have to have to step to the plate both sides Republicans generally see rah rah all the good things red white and blue and were patriotic because we believe\nAnd we don't want to hear the bad things because usually the bad things are being told to us by people who have the country we have to go out and learn the bad things about the country and those people who just know the bad things about the country you have to go and honestly look for the good things\nBecause\nIt was discovered in Saudi consulate in east
