I suppose that would also apply in Arizona right now or ...\nYeah any any I mean he didn't he limited it to I Would say Texas border area but I Would be interested to see if this is a widespread phenomenon yeah is it possible cannot ... mother\nNamed their kid Gilbert and not have them referred to as best show their entire life is that a possibility I don't know I Am just not in tune\nTo the cultural development as much as I should be and you know please come and and and whites plane this to us because we are just ... that's not a role here that we're just two white and understand things like that to to let ... let me let me the oddest admitted to me\nA ... referring to himself as best hope feels\nLike a guy who wants to take advantage of the Hispanic community for votes I Know that can't be true because but it's just because I'm too white to understand it I Can't quite get their cat clear that hurdle to understand why someone would do that and we will soon find out to see if we can find any any Roberts\nWho are actually Robert so it looks like we have a a Joel Robert ... no doubt is Beto are calling from El Paso I'm Joel Robert\nYes fear or is it is it more preferred for us to refer to you is Beto\nOr you know you can host their so called meals that you\nKnow [laughter] okay what is your actual given name\nMy birthday is J.\nO. E. first name Robert R O B e Archie and I'd already was that he called me and you know what so when someone calls you up how do they refer to\nAs well they don't say my middle ... most of it 'cause I don't give it out unless it's you know almost but just do it\nSo when someone calls you up how did they refer to as well they don't say my middle ... most of that 'cause I don't give it out unless it's you know for formal stuff but just go to you know in my life and it's not better on this little town outside of either I'm not job are you there [laughter]\nLet me ask you this and this is ... uh but why did you call national radio and lie because we know every morning in the area that had Robert [laughter] better why would you lie now all those names\nMentioned I I it it does it does depend on if they want it because that though it is and they think it's I don't know what it is but I Know and all those people and I've always called them either out there to go you know ... and the other ... I didn't even know where it was about those but [laughter] that's new to me\nThat when do they do a lot of white guys call themselves better or do other people call them better\nActually he's the first one that I Know a\nYoung guy [laughter] don't\nJudge Joe ... what is your background do you what's your ethnic background\nOr Hispanic or you know but the Latin descent um a lot of people I get are largely just because they say and let's get American but I recruit that are not getting it because I'm the shows that\nI Do have Mexican background but my surname which of course I'm not going to give out is a pretty state my spring last name\n... so this this is fascinating you are in the in the Hispanic community\nYou have Robert in your name your not called ... and you know ... the people that you referred to in the Hispanic community with the names Robert Albert Gilbert in Umberto you refer to buy their actual making [laughter] yes they do this is an interesting piece of evidence we found a unicorn ... you really only one or\nTwo we'll know the one we should send if the metro so he doesn't make this mistake next time on CNN\nI don't want him to go down a road where he's making mistakes and saying things that blatantly aren't true on national television ... that would be terrible for now we're just trying to help we're trying to healthier and also as Joe thank you Joe for calling in and and I would love to hear from more people if you happen to be Robert Albert Gilbert or\nUmberto for having to live in a in a Hispanic community where you know or some one of these names that we always how you refer to it because that is the standard set up by ...\nAnd I'm curious to see if that if there are more unicorns out there and we've discovered something to look at work we've done this is our one incredible we've already uncovered something that people have told us did not exist\n[laughter] it's a miracle and all this hard research we put into this today uh-huh by giving up the phone number you know once or twice and shockingly we were able to uncover somebody so we'll see if there's more out there I don't know if there is I Am new he's the only we've\nDone a lot of digging so far so maybe it'll produce more fruit I don't know a Richard in Texas you're on the Glenn Beck program Hi\nHey guys my name is Richard I'm Out here in El Paso okay uh the first thing I like to say that there's really not that many Latino is named Francis\n[laughter]\nMy first point okay your second point that you were mentioning I Would say that Ninety five percent of the people that are named in the names that you mentioned to go buy it at all\nMhm that's a high percentage I mean that's one of them are a lot\nAnd I am on the no and I am an American citizen\nAll right well thank you very much like\nThat's what we're that's what happens here in our community\nOkay so you do in El Paso you do know a lot of guys go a lot of white guys that go by that oh\nNo no [laughter] okay so the guy you're talking about here the Ninety five white guys hero clothing goes right for you [laughter] okay\nSo I I convince is an interesting distinction\nWe're talking about here the Ninety five zero clothing goes\nRight for you [laughter] okay so I I convince is an interesting distinction you're saying in the Hispanic community people of Hispanic descent with some of these names are like that show but the people who are white Robert Francis\nDo not go by that show no yeah okay that makes it okay what are they going to help better that much I don't think it does but thanks thanks for the call I got lost but there's a couple of points out there we're going to always when\nYou're ... you're searching for horses you're going to find a couple with horns on their head that one of the things some of them are going to be able to fly it part of the it's just part of the experience when you were looking to find a horse hey look at that one has got it happens to be rainbow colored and his flying through this guy\nEveryone has to do and you say huh how about that I'm just cure I just concerned yeah because you know look CNN is the place where they're gonna they're gonna dig deep and get the facts object is he's going to get a massive fact check at some point today because apparently we're hearing\nFrom El Paso that people that are white named Robert Francis are not typically called ... business I mean\nWe don't do it at all that if you have Hispanic background and your name is Robert or some better told them that you're called Beto and that doesn't I I'm not surprised by that at all what would surprise me as if a lot of Roberts who were just white guys that usually go by Bob in this culture and ... are are going by Beto\nNow can you know one interesting thing we could do with Robert Francis 'cause you could call them Bob Frank over to right we can go with\nBob Frank O'Rourke you could yes you could Bob Franklin work as it's not it doesn't connect as deeply to the Hispanic community I wouldn't say by printing are but I'm sure he I that had nothing to do with his consideration by putting federal knows the science that we of course know that he was calling himself Bob on television when he was in a band\nYeah in that band performed on television in El Paso on their morning show and he brought his incredible guitar style links to the show and it was getting late in the show and the host of the show was concerned that they got to start playing 'cause the show was about\n[noise]\nWhen he called the near\nGoing to be over before you man [noise]\nSo he's talking to a better way believe at that time [noise] and then you hear the guitar styling Bedouins self\nCredibly talented and allow you to listen to this guy is [noise]\nReally heavy but yeah this is actually better playing guitar [noise]\nAnd then they kick it into gear man\nA A R styling [noise]\nOf federal friends is from Bob Bob Franco roar\nWow that is talented but\nHe's called Bob ...\nWas a carefully\nDad's embarrassing or just the one giant in Paris it is of a campaign and they yeah they I mean the fact that this\nGuy's caught on with the left it I mean they'll man of they want to run for president in twenty twenty he's raised more money than any Senate candidate in history for quarter that's how much they love this guy he raised more in this quarter than Brock Obama did back in two thousand eight\nIt's incredible that amazing because why he made a speech about the NFL where he said it was okay to Neal\nThey are I guess that there isn't more American than that I can I can think of ... American than that a lot I I\nThey are I guess that there is that where the Ira or American than that I can I can think of that law or American than that a lot I I don't uh I don't think I understand it\nBut maybe we'll get more evidence from El Paso and this will show us that there's only two there's only two people wouldn't possibly disagree with the story from Beto O'Rourke in these communities I'm Glad we've heard from a couple a because it proves that unicorns do exist but we'll we'll figure it out and we'll we'll look down here coming up AAA seven twenty seven back is the phone number\nOr Glenn of courses or reverse thing the Mediterranean Sea then coming back across the Atlantic ocean in a canoe and when it gets back he will join a traveling circus this weekend if you want to check out the dates you can find those out\nOr I don't know if they're gonna be up by Glenn Beck dot com slash tour he will if you go there you can find the dates to our tour where we're going out around the country\nAre but I don't know if the this weekend's traveling circus that Glenn will be hosting is going to be listed there but you look for it in your community as well or he'll be back on Monday\nA ... was talking about they caught a little bit here bitcoin was down forty percent ... it was only over just a just a year ago it was down to Eighteen fifty a coin\nAnd uh you know you forget what the huge run it hadn't leap year that anyone who invested back before the giant spike of bitcoin is still up a whole lot three and four times their money from just a little over a year ago\nDollar saver dot com\nWhich is building a better bank look like it starts with building\nCapital one cafes warm inviting places that feel nothing like a typical bank where you can open an account with no fees are minimum in five minutes and you'll always find people ready to help you not sell you welcome the banking reimagining\nFor consumers only offered by capital one and a member FDIC copies available in select locations copyright twenty Eighteen capital one [noise]\n[noise] it's like having a Fox News right there in your dashboard ... seven five and am twelve sixteen\nOf junk Peterson was UC HBU local news first being brought to you by dominion custom homes\nYour top story hundreds of thousands of Virginians will soon be getting Medicaid benefits after the Virginia general assembly included expansion and this year's budget now the effort to inform the public is gearing up after Virginia governor Ralph Northam announced eligible Virginians can begin signing up for coverage beginning November first\nBeginning January first about four hundred thousand to Virginia is working poor will be eligible for benefits the state's department of medical assistance services is also rolling out a new advertising campaign to make sure that people know what to do\nInformation on signing up can be found on line the W.

yeah\nI'm so we'll have to get him and now we're out of three thousand people though so I mean I wasn't that bad out I was looking for I think the average person money for him\nYeah because a shape it was one of a rough terrain which is a specialty\nYou know a lot of a pill a lot of mountain climbing in the middle of it which is not usually in the middle of a triathlon no but he wanted to go through\nThe toughest conditions you could find yeah and so I think that's admirable it is it is it really drink so hard for you can tell a\nLie to them [laughter] [noise]\nRight I tell you I had nothing to do with how he pulled off that training while at the same time learning to uh to train Alison for the circus\nWas an incredible to me I mean you know really brothers has gone away now they

that'll be cool we'll we'll be watching for that the only learning\nA little bit today and I I like this ... eat sometimes talk shows you can kind of be\nToo sure of yourself to a certain ... and today we're really learning from the Hispanic community of nothing wrong with that Robert Frank who do work I I was not aware that every white person in El Paso\nThat was named uh Robert Francis will be referred to as that was not something that I knew until very recently the last night on CNN even\nBecause he's been talking about the battle thing but I didn't know I thought maybe it was just him but maybe there's some quirky thing about him now but no everybody and I thought\nAll right let's let's remind people of of what he told us because we all want to learn together\nA at everybody has his nickname here's what he said\nThe campaign do you have been attacked for being what Don junior has called an Irish guy pretending to be Hispanic\nSo what does the Hispanic community mean to you in what relationship you have with that community\nSo to to clarify the question about my name was born Robert Francis or work on a pat France has to work with the son of John practice or father to you lift these Francis or work or who will go as UFO\nUm for for my wife and you know ... ... if you were born Robert\nAlbert Albert will go from there folks Iran's interests hold you though that's the one that I've gone by or my entire life and the entire like born and raised and I mean that's what happens\nYeah that's just what happens when you're Robert Albert Gilbert or embarrassed do and just go by that I don't know there is to it wider not not so where did you\nHe's working on it though it's dry and these these dry and I mean battle is better Fitzgerald Kennedy was an incredible person will [laughter]\nAnd it was more into the tragedy and yeah I mean it really was an amazing turn of events there and it's good to see it's good to see\nA that this is going on I I I just I don't\nI don't see how people don't see through this\nYou know I and I think maybe on the left they don't want to because they think have a chance you know every few years these this the last ... this terrible tease where they get to get close in for a few polls I mean Wendy Murphy is going to change Texas who's the mayor refused and that was going to change Texas a oh\nA number you were to use them and when you were down there yeah ah yeah sort\nOf a moderate leaning a Democrat he was also going to change Texas\nEvery time they were on somebody there's somebody who's going to just change it and it's going to it no longer and we'll have to deal with these darn Republicans down their return the state blue we've won forever and by the way that part of it is true if they ... they ... they do yeah that's true they will run they will run the country for a very long time if they're capable of doing that just from an electoral vote standard\nBut still it's a it's not ... it's it's a way to suck the money out of small donors who are throwing it away you know we keep hearing how bad people have it\nAnd I think that's true in a lot of cases ... but it's like if you have it really bad because Donald Trump is ruins your life or whatever it is is it really the best expenditure of your mind\nIs ... but it's like if you have it really bad because Donald Trump is ruins your life or whatever it is is it really are the best expenditure of your money to send it to somebody out of state in Texas who's going to lose by eight or ten or twelve\nI Can't imagine that that's the thing that you should

Jack in Pennsylvania a Jack you're on the Glenn Beck or\nHey pat and Steve Love you guys have a I I think\nYou're missing a very important point and that is that over ... identifies as Hispanic\nUh therefore you must be bullied\nWow there's a great point here is again we're learning today yeah I forgot that was the standard how insensitive of\nUs mhm how hateful and dumber and that is that we haven't spoken about how he does identify yeah and it must\nHispanic jak interesting with a lot of talk like you know the Elizabeth Warren eventually identifying as Native American without ...\nMust be a Hispanic jak interesting with that sort of talk like you know the Elizabeth Warren of essentially identifying as Native American without real evidence that she is she's getting beat up I mean this has been one of the biggest political disasters of all time\nHer coming out and trying to say that she actually is Hispanic or lend Native American short approved it by going back ... generations trying to prove it one one thousand twenty four yeah that's what made the left hates it they're like this is this is playing into the worst of our\nUh beliefs about the blood being the determining factor and these things and they they hate it they're\nThey have destroyed or over the she handled it terribly like one of those things I don't know maybe they should have leaked it through another source of the fact that she's associating herself with coming out and doing this this is amazing\nUh but the identify there's two parts of\nThat like I said\nAs a you know say that you know libertarian side of me right I don't care what people say they are right like no difference to me she says she Native American or not I don't care but beyond that there was an actual truth you know if it does all what's to come out and say she's black or Sean\nKing wants to come out of state he's black when they're not black it doesn't matter to me I don't care what they're doing there I think they're lying right and they're doing this for a reason but that doesn't mean it effects me in any way however we have to be able to stand\nAnd it's a fascinating thing from the left who thinks that\nYou know we one of the biggest reasons Beto is you know in the public eye in in the United states and not just a Texas figure is because of this video he made about it's ... it's a great idea to Neal or for the national anthem\nAnd what's behind that story people like Colin Kaepernick saying that black people are being unfairly accused without evidence and being shot in the streets for no reason because ah for for crimes they didn't commit\nAt the same time we're supposed to get on board if you're on the left are supposed to get on board with\n... with the with a new standard in which any white woman can accuse the man of rape and we're just supposed to believer\nThat is not going to work out well for African Americans or any ... any race if a male but this is the type of thing that makes no sense when they're on real cases of this this isn't a fake thing go back to you know we talked about till town because like the Emmett Till I mean this goes back a long way where black people were accused of doing terrible things to white people when they didn't\nAnd entire communities went and attacked the black person\nThis is obviously going back quite a ways but it is something that legitimately as part of our history\nAnd it's surprising at least if\nLiberals actually cared about black people and black men like they say that they do that they would want to embrace a standard like this\nTo the point behind the at I think is is relatively fair and it's something that should be communicated I think to the the African American community that ... that the criticism is perhaps a over done little over done potentially that the criticism here [laughter] interesting 'cause I don't think it's a it's not it does not I don't know the\nThe uh for sure on this but what I ... my understanding is that these are the people who are recorded this are African American that there is not like a white person doing a black voice quote unquote is you're African Americans are talking\nA and I guess the idea is that they have picked the stereotypical\nAfrican Americans to do the commercial it's very uncomfortable\nOr I don't think that this is something that French she'll necessarily is bracing or by any means but it is a something that's making a lot of uh\nA lot of waves in the media because they're trying to make it seem like well this is just this Republican and who is a racist\nI mean he didn't have anything to do with the ad but besides that or is it it's an interesting\nDouble standards that we find ourselves dealing with the always yeah and and we get that double standard in\nUh to the tenth power and you know I guess we get kind of used to it by now I'm the sort of used to the double standard in to the point where you almost feel silly bringing out the double standard it happens so much\nIt is and it but it's so obvious sometimes you have to for example does anyone I mean if you don't live in French hills district you know French Hill is is that a major I actually don't yeah he's not a major national figure as a Congress a person\nUm so you know like I I think this wouldn't be a big national story it is a big national story today what is not a big national story is a name that almost everyone does Louis Farrakhan\nLouis Farrakhan is not a big national story today he's making no waves at all for his\nA big national story is a name that almost everyone does Louis ...\nLouis Farrakhan is not a big national story today he's making no waves at all for his comments\nOr yet again about Jews now this is a person who has met with you know people like a Keith Ellison he has met with several congressman he's been embraced many times but even you know fairly recently\nUh people meeting with him we know that for Rocco bomber at one point apparently had met with him we didn't find that out until like you out of office you know how the how that happens it's amazing but here's the latest from Louis Farrakhan\nRear Dava ... book\nIs a boost [noise]\nSo when they talk about ... Khan\nCall me I have\nTo call me an anti Semite\nFed 'em into term I [noise]\nI don't know nothing about taking some body because of their religious preference\nOkay right yeah you know anything about hating somebody because of their religion really really you just ... you seemingly just called Jewish people termites yeah you don't do nothing about\nSaid more clearly than that the best what he's talking about another speeches wow a for pretty amazing it to the other thing that ... that's interesting about Louis Farrakhan is nobody loves the Louis Farrakhan more than Louis Irish or maybe this guy thinks he's really clever yeah every every arriving line he's got this gigantic\nSmile on his face like he's uncovered some deep historical truth\nOr or or or solved you know a perpetual motion machine and the guy is like put\nEverybody in their place just now white slamming them down I don't know nothing about hate no religious group [laughter] to tell you something light I met her mind\nIt like he thinks that's a yeah he does he's really excited about himself but he ... both of those words and in ... but he [laughter] doesn't matter what is it really should do it [laughter] he's hanging around and he's like I don't\nI don't have any speech is scheduled schedule one we need a speech just for this long [laughter] time how excited he loves when he delivers that [laughter] things are really up about it and I don't think he got\nThe requisite reaction from the crowd and I think he wanted to do more of a you know a gas or I laugh or something you just got a got a weight I don't know how to respond to that those kind of\nA bad state yeah I don't think I think he's going to be in trouble for that I Will be a given this though that the words do ended in similar fashion they'd do that is something that he was able to do uh-huh yeah my semi [laughter] so that's why that's why says that way our full powerful [laughter] that's really funny man I think he just keeps so happy\nHe looks so happy ... delivers the I Can't wait to deliver genocide above and Jews as just big smiles [laughter] as long as he could come up with something\nThat rhymes you know people have simple pleasures and I think then you know he got a couple of things he's asking for rhyming words and killing the Jews other than that yeah it does come on you know maybe a ... a good cup of ice tea [laughter] you know something something simple pleasures beyond that\nI mean he's he's he's said some pretty outrageous things that get very little coverage and this is another one um people just they seem to kind of ignore him and act like a he's not there supporting Democrats he's kind of not there you know at the very edge of the left\nA but if anybody on the right\nA few kind of not there you know at the very edge of the left\nA but\nIf anybody on the right again this was the double standard hadn't said anything approaching that ... uh about any ... can you imagine if somebody on the right had said something like that about Muslims would that be everywhere it would be everywhere\nAre on the mainstream media um but he for some reason kind of flies under the radar and gets away with all this stuff uh I mean he's still haven't really suffered any consequences from talking about killing ...\nEven ... um she pretty much it meant you pretty much admitted with this yeah\nAnd I do mama than no city if you can give you\nA yesterday the day and tomorrow [noise]\n...

they don't want to hold out and they constantly are out raising a Republicans in these big high profile races you know presidency and things like that ... famously\nI'm outraged everybody in the universe and you know Donald Trump spent like nothing on his campaign twenty sixteen yeah it's a it's an under told story of that election Hillary the if the idea if it's true that you can buy elections Hillary Clinton absolutely would have won\nWhen she had way more money far more resources or because you know Donald Trump didn't\nThrow us a lot of his own money into the race it they just ran it on a shoestring for most much of the time and they were still able to win it kind of disproves every liberal theory about money in politics\n'cause he was going to go on the theory that he didn't need anybody else's money so he didn't he sort of didn't try to fund raise much no I mean he ... he even raise some money and a little bit yeah and he used some of his own money but it wasn't
