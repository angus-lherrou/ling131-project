beautiful so tasteful nothing you know\nNot a major issue obviously per se as compared to others but what I honestly believe me it is the most pure example we had a media bias it is in my book that's the McDonald's French fry\nI remember when I say you don't remember that part I said if everybody says they hate McDonalds okay that's fine\nBut if you can't or that you like their French fries or that they make the French fries and if they do then you have no credibility millennia Trump is the McDonald's French for I'm shocked you brought up the fast food yeah we got to talk about 'cause it's a good soggy uh\nTell me about this guy this Saudi citizens been disappeared I'm always I'm always amazed how the media does all the stops doing any kind of journalism like like I see the stories are riding and I'm like this is not what I Would be writing about at all\nFor one yes this is like a ... style movie today isn't really is yeah I absolutely think the Saudis are guilty on this I think turkey is probably over playing what they do have probably a little bit in the valley\nBut um but everyone's framing this this this uh this journalist ... as this great guy Nobel\nAnd he as this great guy Nobel Prize winning oh yeah he's got to be he'll be a Nobel Peace prize winner soon\nHe came out so surprise surprise he really came to prominence or the media loves him the west loved him during the Obama administration\nOr why was that because well he was one of these one's advocating for democracy and the kingdom of Saudi Arabia and other places when the Arab Spring was breaking ... now that lines of exactly what the Obama administration was wanting to do and also who were they in bed with the Muslim Brotherhood and places like Egypt will surprise surprise ... is Muslim Brotherhood\nHe's actually that's the reason why he's not in the people in the media have said oh well he spoke out against\nYou know the uh the kingdom the Saudi kingdom and that's probably why they don't like him\nNo kidding but it goes way beyond that like he they support a political Islam group that wants to overthrow the monarchy it's a lot goes a lot further than ... spoke out against them yet he is a Republican I Would say public enemy number one but he's right up in that group with them um and then he was friends with the crown prince though was he not um\nI don't know how they're framing it he was friends he was he was he loved the crown prince they got along and and he said a lot of great things about the crown prince now he disagrees with some of the crown princes policies and that's where they've\nWants to take the Saudi out of Saudi Arabia basically that's the best way to put it for this guy but he's a he's not a good guy he wants political Islam he wants political Islam to invade countries all over the world and take it over and he was living here for quite a while before he went to work in Washington Post yeah no no issues there whatsoever\nI'm I'm On the other hand you have this one guy that it's not that great of a guy on the other hand you have a Mohammed bin Salman the crown prince who ever want to send this is this great reformer he he he's a great guy is a great leader is going to modernize Saudi Arabia women can drive now all these social is all these tackling\nHe they dug plain and simple he is eight Doug they go after he's doing this uh tons and tons of people thousands of people in his own country people just disappear they go to jail for the rest of their lives he has a thug and the only reason he's tackling social issues is because they have a lot of young people in Saudi Arabia and social on the rest of the doubt that hit the street\nIf you want to see the place where the next ah Arab Spring might happen Saudi Arabia\nThe the demographics point to it I Would not be surprised right oh so how do you keep Saudi Arabia under control though without a thug you can't I mean it's like Russia really either right groups like other countries like that you really can't here's a disturbing part\n... most likely most likely this guy was killed by Saudi Arabia yeah um it just it just feels like a man and maybe all of a sudden he pops up and I'm like\nNo I was a chick fillet and nobody in the news media wants to look at chick fillet so I was invisible for\nA while maybe doubtful here's the problem we are we are pushing through a major arms deal\nWith Saudi Arabia we should not be doing that now we should not be doing that that should it be canceled today I can tell you however what is being what is happening is\nYou know the United states was supporting the Muslim Brotherhood now we have some people who know exactly what's going on in that part of the world and they're probably being talked to by Saudi Arabia go and look look guys guys\nYeah I Know you don't like what we're doing here but uh it's the Muslim Brotherhood and its a caliphate you what you want the whole region to be in the Muslim Brotherhood caliphate have at\nIt you know and that's the decision our president is is having to make it's why we should stay out of other people's businesses and stay out of their business\nJust

like it's like a a a a bloody house horror movie all the time really oh my gosh it's so frightening because you know\nKids when they go into their teenage years their bodies are changing and everything else and they you know they start not listening to mom and dad and ... out of all the\nUsual stuff okay but now it's like you know ... ... you could lose them overnight and I didn't even lose them with depression rates the way they're going with all of this influence that they can get I'm just so freaked\nOut all the time and I can't believe that I'm Alone oh you ... I'm sure you're not alone and like I was ... you know basically the perfect child as my mom would Fouche uh for for\nMy mother hadn't died she would say the same I figure I'm sure I'm a you know but it's it's ... you're right it gets dark fats I think that stuff can swear a lot of control really fast with with social media and stuff\nOr you know I I don't know how I don't know how to even contemplate dealing with that but yeah I mean I you know your your kids seem like they're pretty pretty good shape I mean they want you to believe upstanding young people\nYeah but you know that I mean my son is now going he's got testosterone you know pumping through his body and you know I just it's it's frightening I guess because I remember what I was like I remember how I felt ally was moody and everything else and\nAnd now you know what's real what's not what's it's just so hard and I you know I said to my son I said to my son last night we were having a conversation and I said so what are what are the two words 'cause he was talking himself down and I said\nStop stop listened to yourself\nAnd he said what and I said listen to what you're creating listen to what you're saying and I gave him the dad I Am speech that I've said\nHow many times have you here at one more time my gosh you're going to kill yourself yeah hundred times on the air you say that the\nI started in this and I said you know this and he said\nI don't I said I I've ...\nOh my gosh am I not told you this if you haven't told your own kids but you're told the national radio over and over and over again and I realized that\nThere are some things that we just think our kids here and\nBecause there are around us they just know they're going to pick up I mean he's in American history right now and you know she probably knows more than some kids are most kids on a lot of things but things are big gaping holes and I realized\nHow much of my time with my son do I think he gets it through us most is somehow or another you know just because he's living here and blah blah blah and he hears me give speeches and he hears me on the radio and here's a blah blah blah\nHe's there we it's maybe it's just me I don't know if if I'm just going through this\nBut my gosh you have to be very very specific and watch what you're saying to your kids and and be with them all the time and what's frightening is the influence is so strong and so sexy on the outside\nThat it's the draw that they're just you're just black and white that everything else\nIs color yeah yeah\nYeah I ... a ... I mean one suggestion is a he was the Jodie Foster movie panic room and she what she did is she was able to lock herself in the room and have no outside influences at all\nAnd I think like the kind of like the editor I ...

that nightmare looks like the poll numbers are are switching dramatically at least in the Senate and Senate bills have been a really good for Republicans since the Kavanaugh saying which I don't know if that's a huge surprise anybody but\nI mean you know Beto is now down by it looks like eight to Ted Cruz which has about doubled the lead he had before then and then as bill mentioned Taylor Swift comes out of talks about how bad Marsha Blackburn in his\nLatest poll has her up by fourteen him which was thought to be a toss up race yeah I mean it's I I don't think the Democrats are learning their lesson and yet they're doubling down built I'd like to hear your thoughts on on what Eric Holder said this weekend Hillary Clinton\nYeah and um I I pay more attention to what a kind of a Russian Taylor Swift\nAnd a good question and right now\nI'm Dennis Miller thanks that Eric Holder is really a steadman uh Oprah's\nBoyfriend and and they look alike you should put that up on the blaze ... side by side\nAnyway um there's a few interesting things in play here Beto has raised thirty eight million dollars in the last six months or so which is breaks every work in the world where's that money coming from it's coming from ... ... as soon as guys in the Hollywood people and all of that\nSo he'll stay competitive I didn't you lose 'em\nI'd hang on let me stop there go ahead what I've met people who have given to both sides millions of dollars they're not happy with the party that loses\nWhen you give a lot of money and the party says no this is the one this is going to change everything and then you lose especially if they lose by eight points\nBut those are normal people are talking about the real shadowy guys that's what's Beddoes getting I'm getting a big Soros money coming in I guess maybe I'm a native and the although they just want you know search and destroy\nSo I think they you know I I agree with you back and that always hurts my toes\nWhen I say that um that\nThere is a backlash and that the Kavanaugh spectacle alienated decent and when I say decent I mean fair minded people\nYeah both Democrat and Republican\nYou know when you have and and I bring this up a lot [noise] um no one working for you and no one working for me I could have tweeted out well Kavanaugh was confirmed but at least we destroyed his life\nMember that tweet yes who did it come from came from Letterman's a writer's cold there ... sorry okay ... Letterman for ... both said\nOne of the writers are cold there tweeted that out okay ... one of those hateful things I've ever seen so if that happened to your organization my organization and that person wouldn't be working\nFor us if we would have if we would've tweeted out but at least we got a Ford lease we at least we rally destroyed her it would have been all horror show but I Would not be working today\nAnd they probably couldn't go out of the house free so people know this um even if you like cold there which I don't I'm not even if you are sympathetic to a doctor for it and and all of that me too\nOr got me to stuff even if you're buying into it you've got to know All right that the rhetoric and the plan to destroy human beings is not what America is all about\nYes it's not and and you know when you think in history Stalin and Hitler and and what they did by destroying their opposition\nOr you know later on I was physically but in the beginning they couldn't murder people but\nThey did it other ways and that's exactly what we're seeing here\nAmerica the hate is rising the fear is rising all of this is in play and guys like you and I unfortunately we have to fight against us and then that puts us in the kill zone but to get back to the politics I Do think there's going to be a backlash I'm not sure about the house of representatives but\nThe Senate I Believe will be even more Republican than it is now\nSo let me let me ask you this if if they\nDo have they they lose the Senate where just a few weeks ago\nThe the person who was in the best position to win for the Republicans\nWas Ted Cruz and he was only one or two points ahead of of Beto so he was in the best position now it looks like they could if I mean if it's a good day they could end up with the majority of fifty four fifty five yeah that's significant\nIf especially with you know Donald Trump is president do the most hated man of all time if if\nThey do lose do you think they will say okay wait a minute this democratic socialism this\nAnger or know that never got to do that they're going to go they're going to go murder don't you think\n... of course I mean these people are really really deranged\nAnd and there are some on the on the right like that as well yes but not nearly a the numbers on the left and of course a media promotes that um but if they win the Democrats win the house then you're ... that's why are you going to hear you know you're hearing about Senate yes I'm\nIn the house you know that's a little shaky because as everybody knows uh the first term in Clinton first turning Obama um they lost\nYour um and and the opposition party you only have one the house right and if you're the way Americans do usually vote yeah so bill how do you feel about the use of the N word\nThe M. F. word ... you yeah you know the more you're not going to use the murder you there I don't know what it is back your guy wearing with me oh I Am\nNot bill uh uh two two anchors on CNN this week freaked out because a guest was saying the N word when he was talking about these protesters about Kavanaugh's mob ... don't say mom how\nCan you believe that you know and how would you know highly mom it but the party\nWas labeled a mob and soda you yet and they uh they had around the said going there's the month of all look at the mob but now you can't do that of course it's a mop\nUm that that Kavanaugh thing was a there was no better example in modern ... political history than than a mob in that no better example\nAnd went to work and came home and had a ... or whatever you do in

so they formed an organization called Odessa you may remember the movie the Odessa file mhm they have some money\nAnd they spread out all over Europe and they designed escape routes for the ss in the concentration\nAs in the concentration camps Eichmann mango a Barbie the butcher of Leone all participated and a\nThousands of other ss and while gentle pat was occupying southern Germany or he was focused on style and and the Soviet union's expansion so the United states was in track and these people at all\nAnd they just got out and mass most of them went to South America where they had to be tracked down and how they were tracked down is just an amazing read\nIt really is it really is great great job on this one was what was the research like on this\nBill while we got caught a break because when we rode killing Jesus we establish a very strong relationship with the Israeli government they helped us a lot and we went back and so now we're going to do a book on edge a tracking the

[noise]\nWelcome to the program so glad that your hair returning with us Steve days pat gray a stew a steeper gear or executive\nProducer and of course my charming self um we're talking about uh the Democrats in what they have done this week just with Hillary Clinton coming out and saying you can't have a civil conversation with these people I don't know who these people are that these people used to be a sign of racism\nUh but you can't talk about these people are and then Eric Holder in the week that we have a video of somebody actually kicking a protester ... um we have ever called her saying a kick 'em when they're down\nIs is the is this the\nOr is this the beginning of the end for the Democrats or is this the end of the beginning\nCar um\nI I Hope it's the beginning of the end because um I I think most Americans with the ... with the any sensibility left in them\nOr are being turned off by the Democrats right now I I think they've you know we talked about this many times I think maybe now they have overplay their hand we thought maybe that would have happened a year or two or three or four a goal but um I think after the Kavanaugh hearings and all that's going on now with this civility thing\nThat they're completely uh uh issuing I think I think people have had enough of them\nSo is it important for us to change let's say I think people have had enough of the Democrats because of that blanket people who vote Democrat think wait I'm a Democrat or is it better to say I think people have enough of this\nLeftist movement\nI I think it's the latter mhm and I think that um you're you're watching I Know it's a popular term in another context these days but you're watching a transition happen\nAnd you know we kind of pretended as if on the right\nThat just surrendering I'm America's youth ministry known as our education system to cultural Marxist for forty years um wasn't going to have any repercussions whatsoever and now you're watching the first fruits of that harvest are coming home to roost at the moment\nNothing new under the sun you know when when St Paul is looking back on the time period who himself a Jew so he grew up in the Jewish schools he knows this history very well when he's looking back at that time period is when he writes forward thinking in a New Testament world and Romans one\nWhere he's when he's when he talks about the wrath of God revealed on the world anybody I used to think when I was a baby believer that if if cultures did bad stuff it would cause God to act\nThe more you study Romans one I think it's actually the other way around I I think we do bad stuff because we deny that God is acting meaning it's a it's a self reinforcing mechanism the natural law uh it it kind of enforces itself\nSo you're dealing with people that with the wind and the and the New Testament there when you exchange the truth for a ally so there's one big macro truth in in the universe\nAnd there's a lot but there's lots of eyes writes about supply so when you exchange that truth for ally you're given over to a database to mine and that's what you're talking about and I go back you know one of my favorite movie ranch when I was a kid and it's probably a terribly placed analogy\nBut Donald presence rant and the first Halloween movie about Michael Meyers can be killed it can't be stopped they can't be reason with right when he's going off about him and when he was like in the insane asylum\nThat's what you're dealing with here there is no talking look\nAt the guy who ... who kicked drop kick the woman in Canada when he's wearing a ... around his neck you to go look at his picture closely okay I mean that's just self awareness is dead in your face\nThis is dead in your face kind of stuff look at the way he talks to her piece really polite he's asking her what she thinks\nHe's totally Lou city's not craze he's not raving roving mob okay and then when she said when she when she refuses to about the same idol that he is all he is worshipping the total countenance changes and he dropped ... look at this her own a woman from Hawaii that's on TV all the time now\nI mean her account the way she looks she looks like when you take your ... to Hawaii for a vacation or a honeymoon and you get off the plane she there with a plate a sweet rolls ready to welcome you to the island she just looks like the sweetest oh woman doesn't she\nThen she starts talking about politics mad and she opens her mouth and it's brutal ... comes out yeah it does I this is this is a nuisance sanity that culture produce with I ...\nI like I ... I feel like you know when you discover new band and you get excited like the next ... gonna be amazing and like you're in on it early that's how I feel with her own All right now yeah she's just starting to say these crazy things she's going to be a legend\nIn conservative talk radio yeah she is she can't help herself she doesn't seem to know what the lines are what you got to be our next Maxine Waters yeah and I'm excited about it yes\nI thought you were going to say you know and you think you're really early on a band blah blah blah and and you know you're you may not be but you discover it and you're like\nBoston is great [laughter] I think there's probably a lot of people that are feeling that way about Steve days uh and he begins on Monday right after this program as pat moves in\nA on a on mornings on Monday it's gonna be cool you're gonna hear words you never heard in my time slot\nBeing [laughter] just in the government and I might even know what I mean I'm you know I saw you know it's still there and it sounds really\nWhat's really amazing there are two kinds of people that use those kinds of words they're the people who\nUse them because they want to sound smart and they're you know they're they're they're just positioning themselves\nAnd then there are people who just assume that everyone is as well read is they are and uh those people piss me off because they're real and they're really smart and that happens to be you Steve days are joining us a from a C.
