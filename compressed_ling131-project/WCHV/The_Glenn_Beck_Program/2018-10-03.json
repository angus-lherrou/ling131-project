yes here okay ah accuser accuser a person who claims oh wait this is starting to sound accurate it is a person who claims that someone has committed in a fence or done something wrong okay so in at all sure either her\nAn accuser so he wasn't mocking he was stating the facts of the trial or the or the hearing\nAnd a A N\nCondensing the ridiculous ... of the accusers claim\nWe must stop using the word victim they are accusers they may end up being a victim that we can call them but if we're going to presume innocence and I know this is an old fashioned idea if you're going to presume innocence you must\nPresume innocence which means this is the accuser your honor this is not the victim because one she's a victim\nWhat happens well we're supposed to believe could you look up the word believe uh yes I I can we are now being taught believe the victim\nOkay ah two definitions of the word belief didn't finish number one except something as true feels shore of the truth of okay I'll just share or something is true\nOkay just your or something is true so people now are saying believe the victim which is translating\nFeel sure that this person has been harmed or injured\nIn a in an event of some sort okay and and in this area and his response ... yes okay do you are being told\nWhen someone says something I have to believe\nAnd assume that we give me the definition again except something is true I have to accept this as true field sure it can feel sure that it's true that this person has been harmed or went through an act caused by this person\nWow that's a that's quite a statement that doesn't seem logical at all\nBut should only happen after ... ... you know that was beyond a reasonable doubt write like that for the standard is there what's the second version of believe um hold something as an opinion\n... sink or suppose\nThat seems like the one they're applying here is they're just trying to make it seem like I Believe you I'm sure the truth when in reality it's just their opinion there supposing it's true\nMhm they think it's true now do you want to be judged or have your dad your brother your son your sister your mother your friend have so world assume that if something is true because someone stated it with out\nThe answer is no but\nWe are being taught the next generation is being taught to believe the victim here's the thing\nWhen you present evidence and I see preponderance of evidence I Will believe the victim now that's not even through a court of law I just want a preponderance of evidence I Want to see it now you'll notice that\nLast week he was looking pretty dicey for cabinet\nThis week it looks like there's been some things that the press is reporting on some people coming to the table saying okay I flew with her in a small plane in Hawaii and a small plane a single engine plane it only had one exit it was cramped it\nWas just us she didn't have a fear of flying she didn't have a ... we went out to go circle the volcano what are you talking about a fear of flying she didn't have a fear of flying\nThe people coming out now saying the reason why she had the second door I was there ... all you have to do is go look at the permits she was building an office in her house it wasn't for escape it was because she was having clients come to that door and not\nTo the front door I have two front doors 'cause I'm afraid not according to the permits not according to why wait you put a front door because you were afraid why did you put the office there what'd you put several after him there\nOf all things would you want to be random clients coming over your house all the time when I Want to separate that from your business as much as ...\nOkay so I don't know what's true I don't know it's true but I certainly do not supposed to believe her I don't think she's I don't know if she's a victim or not I don't know she may be a victim but he may not be\nThe perpetrator right I mean ... the only person who should be calling her a victim is herself if she let let's just say this did happen to her she can fairly call herself a victim because she knows that happened to her if if it's true right but even if it\nBut even if it's true none of us should be calling or a victim at this point the victimhood from society identifying you as a victim is when other people have some confirmation of the trial going through there are enough information to prove that\nThere is one proven victim between the two of them right now one proven victim\nThat is Brett Kavanaugh who now can't teach up at Harvard because all of the graduate students are saying we're not having a rapist to teach\nWho can't you can't build a coaches basketball games anymore because they can have a rapist ... he is now a victim now that I've noticed assumes that he's innocent\nUm no no no wait negative ... victim even if he's guilty he's a very dim of mob justice right because they have not perfectly correct he's a victim of mob justice\nI'm not saying that he is he is not rightfully victim this point it sure doesn't look like it this is mob justice so far mhm um she also is a victim she's a victim of the Democratic party and leadership she has been victimized\nShe has been dragged out when she said she didn't want to be dragged out she was lied to when they when the Republicans said\nWe'll go out and meet with you you don't have to fly they didn't tell her that\nShe's a victim by the Democratic party and they don't care they do not care that is the real tragedy of this to people's lives are for ever changed one if she is making this up\nIts on her\nAnd quite fun frankly so it was the victim mode of him it's on her\n\nLook at what's happened for political purposes only and if you think the Democrats and I think there are people who vote Democrat I think there are people who vote for the Republican I think there are people who vote for Kavanaugh\nActually feel bad for Christine forward I think they actually feel bad for because they don't know she may be something happened I was willing to say last week that I think something happened and I don't know\nHow it is becoming less and less clear to me that even something happened because of all of the other testimony now that it's coming out that saying no I I was her boyfriend for ten years nine years\nNone of this none of this happened\nI I don't know\nBy the way I frankly do not believe her by either one of those definitions I don't suppose is and I don't know it's true\nI'm now look I could be wrong on this but she had ... like you know it can be a hundred percent sure that just didn't occur we weren't there but that's why we have a system to try to figure out those situations and were never there for crimes case for almost never there for them so you'll notice that you are presumed innocent look up two words assume and presume\nIn our standard you are presumed innocent until proven guilty you're not assumed you are presumed\nWhat's the difference presume is usually used to when you suppose something based on probability so\nThe odds are based on what we know she doesn't know the house she doesn't know the time she doesn't know the months you know nobody here\nThe people that she said here they'll testified that they were there all of them disagree all of them say I don't have any recollection of this at all so she has no witnesses she ... the the documents from her doctor conflict with her report she has changed the time four times in the last\nTimes in the last four month or two months so and that is sketchy because it it appears as though she kept moving closer because Brett Kavanaugh would have been out of state if it would have been where she originally claimed mhm so all of those changes so what's the preponderance of evidence\nWhat are the odds based on the evidence the odds are he didn't do it that's the presumption of innocence what is assumed innocence assume is used when you suppose something without any evidence so no one is asking you to assume he's innocent\nWe're asking you to look at the facts\nAnd then play the odds\nBased on those facts what are the odds that she has it right\nSo let's stop using the word victim and let's stop saying we're going to believe every victim we're not we're going to take seriously the accusation from\nRight now we encourage you to take advantage of

like a purchase at a bookstore a digital media transaction is continuous linking buyer and seller and giving the seller post transaction power impossible and physical markets why is that important so\nI I think is it important for a an a number of reasons leads to the scenarios that we were talking about earlier where the settler of the good as the ability not only to reclaim or or recall the good but they also have some ability to control\nHow and when and under what circumstances you make use of that product after the sale\nThat's just not something that you could do a tangible\nWorld right you or your local bookstore put aside the publisher your local bookstore cats you what country you're allowed to read a book and\nThey can't tell you um you know how many times you get to read it they can't tell you who you get to lend that book too and they certainly can't keep records of all of those interactions and the digital world allows for\nThat that form of control [noise]\nAnd unfortunately it's not limited just to digital media or we have all these smart devices in our homes on our bodies um you know we've got our voice assistants and hour fitness trackers and ...\nYou know even our home appliances and cars they all have software\nThey all have network connections and all these sort of uh problems that as I've been describing are going to play out in that space is well ... where device makers are not only going to be able to track your behavior but they're also going to be able to limit the ways in which you can use the products\nThat you think ah you have to\nPurchase oh I'm so let me let me interrupt hearing and just ask you this icy when I go to iTunes I see a movie I Want to watch it says rent or own I'm not owning it I'm just renting it in a different way isn't is false advertising\nI so I think there is a really good case to be made here that companies like Amazon and apple they use language like owner and by words that have real meaning for people in their everyday lives\nAre missed stating that the nature of those transaction so uh my coauthor Christos ... go and I wrote a paper a few years ago a couple of years ago now I'm called what we buy when we buy now\nThat did a survey of about Fifteen hundred consumers to figure out what people think this language new and it turns out that a significant percentage of consumers\nIncorrectly beliefs\nThat they do have true ownership rights they get to keep these goods they can lend them they can give them away and we think that there is an opportunity here to a correct this misinformation in the marketplace but\nThink about the company that we're talking about you know apple and Amazon are to the biggest corporations that the world has ever seen\nAnd getting them to\nA\nConvincing them to not going to be in a more career and fair way as it is a real challenge\nClass action lawsuit\n[noise] so I think there is a possibility for class action litigation here they're they're a bunch of\nA legal and practical hurdles to making that happen I think it's something worth pursuing I think the Federal Trade commission has a role to play here this is a squarely within their um\n[noise] uh within their areas of of expertise and obligation to police market to make sure that consumers have accurate information\nAaron I'm go ahead yeah I I just want to go ahead\nBut the the way the market works that hands on consumer as being foreign people can't make rational choices people can't decide where to spend their money if they're being misled about the products that they're getting so I think it's crucial story for the function of the market or two who have that information be correct\nHave you done any look into what a society with out real ownership I mean we're down to you know renting clothes and everything else\nUh and that's only going to get stronger as as as we move forward have you looked into what that means for a capitalist society and for America in particular that has always been about ownership\nSo remind me his concern here is the way this change is kind of our conception of ourselves in the way we think about ourselves as individuals in society\nAnd doesn't that also doesn't also stop innovation I mean sometimes the guy who take something and then tinkers with it comes up with a better system but if I'm if I'm locked out of tinkering\nOn my own property or it it ... it it almost creates this uh this feeling of oh well that's just the way it is and that's the way it always is going to be just runs that way and it stops innovation doesn't it\nI I think it has the real risk of doing that it it discourages people from being created it discourages people from um from as you say ... with the same as if they are and we have a lot of ah incredible innovations that have been made a over the centuries in this country\nThat didn't come from giant ... departments they came from individuals messing around with things that they own in their garage and there is a risk that were for closing those kinds of opportunities\nBut even even more broadly at\n'em if we're discouraged from thinking of ourselves as independent actors in the world you know I worry that that creates a sort of complacency in\nUh in our in our population in our country and you know not not to zoom out a ... of a level here but for democracy to function people have to steal and they have to be in charge of their own lives she asked to be invested in making informed decisions\nAnd I ... that that you know this\nThis lack of control over the every day this is my play too much broader set of problems when it comes to people feeling like active participant in society in democracy\nI couldn't agree with you um I couldn't agree with you more um I I just don't think this is the way society is thinking anymore everything is about the collective and very little is about the individual and you know I think you understood you are under state of the case\nOf tankers I mean if you look at the inventions in America that a lot of them a lot of our progress came from what used to be called tankers people who just did things in their own garage and and uh\nAnd now with the weather so the government or these corporations every one is being told that the way it is sit down shut up you can't do anything about it and I think that's extraordinary I mean that that that\nYou know in in decades that's what created China in many ways that's what they\nDon't think of things the same way that we do they don't have that that um spirit of invention that America has always been known for\nSo I I agree with you that um that the history of innovation in this country has um benefited greatly from individual creators and we we need to keep an environment in which people have that ability to experiment\nUm to innovate and ultimately it to just share a that progress a with a with the rest of the country and the rest\nOf the world I worry that we're moving in that direction where um people aren't able to build those skill sets because they live in a world of sort of lock down digital life\nSo let me ask you one more question and I'll let you go I Know you've spent twice the amount of time here that you you probably planned on um the last one more question I Am really concerned about copyrights patents trademarks we seem to be entering a world where\nPeople don't take somebody's intellectual property seriously on the on the other side of this\nUm they just feel that too well I can download it I can just take it\nA an itch and we shouldn't have intellectual property rights that that is frightening because again that was the second piece of the American experiment was\nYou have a right to that intellectual property for a period of time so you can make money on it which encourages other people to come up with their own ideas\nDo you see this why do you see this fading and is this trouble on the horizon as well\nSo I I write in each about intellectual property and it's something that I take 'em very seriously and one of the things that I always try to communicate to my students\nIs that you know actual property system functions best when there is a balance between the interests of the public and the interests of creators and the history of intellectual property copyright in particular is it is a history of a struggle\nTo find and and and that appropriate about [noise] um\nAnd I think we're we're going through and have been going through a kind of ... the last for adoption of the Internet for a period where we're struggling with how to answer some of those questions\nAre there are certainly areas in which I'm caught right holders have legitimate concerns about\nUh about air work's been exploited without compensation and on the other hand we live in a culture in which um copyrighted works a sort of um\nIncreasingly among a distributed with within these environments like apple and Amazon for example where consumers can't do the same way that they think they're entitled or should be ranked Jewish\nSo I think that part of the solution here is providing consumers a strong incentive to pay for these works\nOn that one of the things that streaming services I shouldn't have gotten writes a which is that they offer a really attractive deal to consumers so people learn that if they're going to access the world's libraries is it they have to pay for the privilege of hearing that how that money gets distributed\nAnd what the price point is I think this is one of the sticking point so it it's an important set of questions and I'm One that I probably can't do justice to um\nYou know a couple of minutes yeah All right Aaron thank you so much I appreciate it and I

line the creepy line dot com um we're talking about Google and\nLarry I've never I've never believed in you know those dystopian movies I've always made fun of them and said yeah this is this is crazy the you know the corporations out to get you because of their algorithms because they are so all encompassing\nThat is the world were headed towards what do they tell you when they say\nAlgorithms that we have to keep that top secret because yeah they\nSecret because yeah they what they argue is is is for reasons of of a state secret\nUm and and you know that they need to protect their trade secrets they need to be a a you know making sure that nobody gets access to it there's some truth to that but there are a lot of things that they could do to demonstrate um that they're offering a fair product in service to people and here's the thing that they have lied about this before\nYou know ten years ago or so you had other companies like trip advisor and Yelp\nWho are saying that Google was artificially suppressing their rankings in Google in favor of Google owned companies which okay you know Google has the right to do that but here's the thing\nGoogle flat outlined said absolutely not we don't do that our algorithm is pure it's true the best results or ... or our organically at the top well here's the problem the Federal Trade commission the European Union\nProfessors at Harvard University looked at this and said yes you are fiddling with the algorithm you are screwing these other competitors and you're lying to the point is when Google says you can trust the algorithm you can trust us they've lied before and they're lying now and I think the only question that remains really is how are we going to deal with is\nUm you know there's old story that Henry Kissinger said when he was on the national Security Council\nYou give a president three choices do nothing\nTake my solution or thermonuclear war those are your three choices are in this case it's kind of like that we can do nothing\nWe can try to deal with some sort of the regulatory issues related with Google or we can break up these companies those are the three options that we have it I think we're really at the point of point number three 'cause this is not a monopoly like standard oil\nStandard oil that's going to dominate the all marketing business controlling the news flow in the United states is\nIn the end this is in the end petered controlling everything yes Google is ... the most likely company in the America in the American world\nOr to come up with a guy yes who ever who ever gets to a I first controls everything there's no way to beat it once you have a guy yes this company is the most likely in the free world to come up with it\nIf we don't have them\n... contained in some way or another when they get to AI we're toast\nYes yes that's exactly right and here's the thing it's not just\nGoogle the company a lot of people don't realize is I didn't realize this if you use safari on your apple product you're actually using the Google algorithm and that is Google information on if you're using if you are using um Yahoo\nYou're using Google the point being Firefox is Google the all these entities are using the Google algorithm so even if you say I Am not going to use Google dot com you're using unless you are making very specific choices for other options if you using any of those others\nGoogle is the one that's dominated by the way Google pays apple\nNine billion dollars a year Google actually pays apple\nTo be the algorithm of choice for safari that's how much they value this information and want to dominate the space\nSo I Want to talk to 'em a little bit about um what can be done um with the algorithm or I'm concerned about some things that I think are really dangerous and the platform ing and be racing voices right because Google thinks\nThat's exactly right you you are the product yeah we say what is Google's product you are the product because they are selling information on Glenn Beck or on Peter Schweitzer or on whoever\nAnd more importantly I think they are analyzing all of it look\nThere's the this is just at the beginning let me tell you is bouquet story mhm you go to Beijing there are three concentric circles of security in Beijing okay the center is the main city of aging how many people that used to look it up for me what are you still how many millions of people are living in Beijing\nIn the city proper that is the inner circle\nThere is so much monitoring going on they just did a test they release the guy they they uh took a guy [laughter] pick somebody said go into the center of the city just go hide K [laughter] they had a picture of the guy and the the Chinese tested this new brand new system and then\nLike an hour or two they gave the leaves system the picture of the guy and said find him\nIn eight minutes he was in the back of a squad car unbelievable in ... minutes yes city of twenty two million yeah twenty two million amazing in eight minutes yeah so and this is with out AI right this is the kind of stuff that is coming that people really need to pay attention to\nRight and and Google or is that the forefront of that they they take a position of pride that they are the forefront of exploiting future technologies real quick though on Gmail this is very important for people to realize that\nOh this is very important for people to realize that just shows you how far Google goes I used to have a Gmail account now what ... does is they scan every email that comes into your Gmail accounts and every email you send out you know what else they scan\nIf you've ever written a draft email let's say you're mad at your cousin you know I'm sick of you know cousin Chris and all the crazy stuff he does and you write in late one night you write a draft and you say you know what\nI don't think I'm going to send that to Chris that's just me\nBeing on just a second I Want to make sure this is writing a draft but that's not saving it as a draft correct It's just you ... it counts the delete delete delete delete delete delete it's not even saving it as a draft\nRight correct that's correct if scanned by Google\nSo Google knows more about you than you know you can have a very open and completely transparent relationship with anybody in your life your spouse\nYour best friend or whatever and Google knows more about you than they do\nAnd they are very aggressively going to retain that information\nBut they're using it against you here's the key thing it's not just privacy it's manipulation because they want to take that information and not just sell information advertisers they as part of their mission want to steer and move your life in a certain direction that they deem is the way the direction your life should go\nThere to be your choice or the ... documentary as the creepy line a cup let me push back in a couple of sure or at least problems I have 'cause I'm with you on Ninety percent of this\nOne issue I have is Google is awesome it's all of the products that they make are better than everybody else's product at a similar ... it would eat ... incredibly inconvenience me\nTo give up Google because all of their products work better than everybody else's ... doesn't know [laughter] what do you do because I mean yes they're everywhere they also do a really good job or when it comes to designing an easy to use product right how do you break away\nThat's that's a great question and it's not easy I mean there are alternatives search a systems out there um but none of them are as good as Google\nAnd it's not really I don't know I think that's a a a road that people will go down that you shouldn't go down that what we should go down is we should be talking to the people in ... no no no\nWe should be sending people who understand this right to Washington because by the time we talked to Washington it's already over we need people who understand the ethics of what's going on with high tech\nIn Washington because they need to have this conversation right now it's not about us changing our behavior right it's to the point we must corral Google\nAnd break them up or corral them in some way not just little litigation because I'm a ... litigation but not with just little simple laws of what we're going to cut because they'll go around that\nThat fire and right okay let me have one other one yeah you said this earlier and it made me very uncomfortable and my suspicion is it makes you very uncomfortable to which is your solution we see we're leaning towards breaking up these companies and as a capitalist as a person who does not want the government involved right or in private business\nI mean how do you how do you have a\nGuy no I mean I I think that's a great point and I came reluctantly tennis as I looked at all the possible things to do with Google here's the problem in this case the way that technology is moving how Google exerts market dominance it really we really do not have a free market in search\nI it's really impossible in fact one of the guys we we interview the vice president of Yelp or in in our in our a film a and the founder of Yelp said he wouldn't start you all today because it'd be impossible\n'cause it'd be impossible Google would smother them the only reason that Yelping these other entities have survived as they have built up enough brand equity when they were founded what Fifteen Twenty years ago to where they can exist so we have a situation where there are truly is not a functioning\nA monopoly and by the way Google's market dominance it's partly related\nTo its political science in Washington they pass laws and rules all the time to squelch competition a veteran in Santa Fe\nAnd to do things like the platform ing yes we are not a publisher we're a platform right then they go in and they edit will now Europe publisher you're not a platform so they play it both ways and they're they have the money to do it\nYes and that's a hugely important point because when they first one it or it set up the regulation for the Internet it was if your publisher you're treated as a media company if you are a neutral platform which is what Google and Facebook claim they are they said we're not going to any content they even use the analogy were like a telegraph\nWe're just taking a telegraph message from Peter and we're sending it to Glenn\nNothing else is happening well we all know that's not true now they're editing a they're censoring so they are acting as publishers but unlike other publishers they don't face the legal or regulatory burns that they do so it's right here in competition\nOr even the public scrutiny even the ... you sound like you're crazy if you talk against Google editing I Know that they are frightened the when one solution be to make their algorithms transparent\n[noise] Ah yes that would help but the algorithm is changing constantly and and I do get I Am sympathetic to the argument that this is a trade secret that they work very very hard to develop and they have\nUm I think by breaking them up into pieces and by the way I don't think it's just two companies I think it's several different smell so bad [laughter] um I think it would be would be extremely helpful in the way to go on this because otherwise they're going to continue to read certain market dominance ...\nThe other thing I hear conservative talk about and I find this terrifying is to make them a utility\nOh no no no I don't know what the utilities are like here in Dallas oh no [laughter] we don't really have we have to open energy yeah oh that's all we have five different Internet company ... and yeah we don't pay anything yeah ...\n... of making Google a public utility ... which really means you're making it a government utility now means you've got the government controlling search no ... no interest in that whatsoever\nAnd what you are seeing is this merging of Google which used to be generally out of politics and very little lobbying very little interaction when Barack Obama was elected in two thousand eight\nYou saw this enormous influx of Google people into Washington DC and they stayed so it is now one of the most plugged in if not the most plugged in corporation in America so this notion that there are kind of these wild cat or out in Silicon valley that are like independent from government is just totally ridiculous I could\nSpend two days with you um I really enjoyed this I'm going to take a hard pass on that show where you know by all our [laughter]\nFeeders wiser he is the president of government accountability Institute the documentary is called the creepy line how to use it\nUh it's going to be available shortly on Amazon I tunes there is a trailer on the Web page and we love to get feedback\nFrom him and it will be it will be on a YouTube\n[laughter] I'm not I mean I think is so much to say All right uh [noise]\nOur sponsor this half hour is ...\nYou know as we look at as we look at technology\nAnd uh how people are into everything life lock in here let me give you this on Facebook Facebook approximately fifty million accounts were accidentally exposed\nWhoops somebody went in and took fifty million a cow names and all of the information I Do know is that even you do you have any idea\nPersonal information from a data breach criminals use it to open accounts file tax returns by property there are so many threats to your identity right now I remember I've been thinking about this for a week I remember when everyone's life lucky\nEnough to put my security guard on buses you remember the security guard yeah okay\nI remember at that time thinking well that stupid [laughter] yeah but that's not going to happen it's going to", "show_name": "The Glenn Beck Program", "year": "2018", "city": "Charlottesville", "day": "03"}
