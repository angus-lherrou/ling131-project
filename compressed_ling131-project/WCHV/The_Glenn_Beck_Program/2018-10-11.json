specifically be rushing linked a hundred and five that sort of had a question mark as to where they could be originating from that are jumping on line when the last jet I comes out and people are starting to debate about the movie\nAnd then they start throwing in the tweets about the Nazi admiral admiral hold though and then they start throwing in tweets about how a masculinity is under assault because ... and was unable\nTo lead the ship and then they started rowing in tweets about as jade Wu droid than the fact that there was a droid in the ... remember those\nYeah and and so and but the important thing blended that that comes from real people too and you can't really distinguish what comes first the chicken or the egg did the did the Russian you know bought or troll on line plant the thought in a conservative or you know activist or Star Wars fan on line and then they sort of echo it\nOr did it go the other way around um because it is reasonable to look at Star Wars and see some sort of like you know progressive fingers in the pot\nBut there's also this discourse on line that happens where you sort of amplify other opinion is that you see you see someone upset about a seminar is now taking over Star Wars Kathleen Kennedy or you know the uh the Asian girl in the new Star Wars movie and\nIf you get amplified about that and feel like oh well someone else's angry about that too but I can now feel a little bit more angry than the discourse just rapidly um gets more radical and it's pretty reasonable to think that there are foreign actors who engage in this malicious activity\nIt even if it's interesting I think in this part of the crime against journalism that's happened making every effort of what Russia has tried to do in America about Donald Trump you know it's like look at the look at the scope of this the\nFact that they are trying to go\nDo in America about Donald Trump\nYou know it's like look at the look at the scope of this the fact that they are trying to go in there and ... people up over ... culture and in in Star Wars and all of these kind of separate things Kaepernick all this stuff and not just separated us do I think also\nA ... in pushing us into a place I hear this all the time I Know I Am like this ... when did everything becomes political they're pushing everything all pop culture everything into politics\nYeah there is a great book out right now called addicted to outraged by going back towards the towards the end part wine in at least in the audio book it's chapter Nineteen talking\nA lot about the role that foreign actors and particularly Russians might play and trying to sow discord and what we do know about Russians wet were able to do in the ... election we don't know if they actually were able to impact the results and how people voted\nBut we are able to determine that they they get their fingers into the way that we talk\nUm and what's most important I think about American politics and culture\nNot that we are able to agree on everything political but that were actually able to go to a movie theater and sit next to our neighbors in the dark and smile at a star wars movie but then when you go in and you've sort of been reading these things on line and\nYou've had people tell you that now it's like liberal propaganda and that it's not the star wars you grew up with\nThen you can't even do that and think about what that does to a culture not in the course of one year but in the course of ten years we have will will have nothing in common if we allow people to manipulate us like this and get us hooked on outrage on a constant basis about anything whether it's politics or media\nStephen ... thank you for I'm writing about this this is in the Washington Examiner thank you for a while to go to the writing about this is it is it because it was Star Wars that this popped up on your radar or why is it that no one else is is catching this Steven\nWhile I Would say that there was a pretty good deal of writing done about this and for me I had to catch this because I've got Google alert set up for Star Wars and I have a lot about him but you know I\nI live in Star Wars Twitter as well as conservative and libertarian Twitter the these are kind of ... different ecosystems and the dialogue and Star Wars Twitter is is toxic it was so me and when these movies came out particularly around so low in the last ...\nThe last jet I really sort of agitated right wing Twitter and solo really add a agitated left wing Twitter everybody was arguing about these different things and just using language that you just don't see or you didn't see a couple of years ago\nIn Star Wars and then you turn on\nFavorite conservative podcast right and I have a couple\nAnd their sort of been echoing those sentiments and then their actual fans are going out and engaging in Star Wars discourse but there's it's not really clear like who is genuine and who is not and who is coming to it as a really interested fan and who's coming to the political activists\nWho just really wants to make people angry and that's what we have to remember when we get on line is there is no guarantee that the person even if they have a real name and a photo associated with their count as a genuine human being who wants to you to leave this conversation happy I don't know if you've ever\nWind and argue about on Twitter I have not found\nQuiver words of a foreign city you need to be getting off the airplane\nIn this new city and just assume that you're not safe anywhere you go

I'm a big fan of Donald Trump I helped write the tax plan with my buddy lyric I thought so but I I just disagree with this policy I don't see the wisdom and steal an auto and aluminum tariffs or auto terrorists but especially not steel and aluminum because you know we have something like a hundred thousand Americans who are employed and steal an auto\nBut we've got six million other manufacturers who use steel and aluminum and what they produce I was over it and how is your Bush a couple of weeks ago they you know when they make a you know Budweiser is they're using a lot of aluminum for those cans\nAnd they showed their prices are going up and judge that's going on around the country our auto producers are autos are more expensive because the steel towers so my point to Trump is this isn't even creating factory jobs were going to lose the factory jobs as a result of this so I disagree very strongly with the steel and aluminum tariffs I think they do more harm than good\nDoes he look

daughter you know\nSo did you think did you can gain hope or did you gain perspective\nIs [laughter] a both again but\nI just I I had hoped because I Want I Want a better world for my daughter yeah no\nUh uh the the great ... drum thank you for sharing that and thank you for um\nThanks for your honesty of emotion there um the the good thing is this what I tried to um impressing or color yesterday after um he hung up unfortunately was\nWe're weaning we're winning commonsense is winning it doesn't feel like it but that's just because the power structure that you're used to\nIt's possible first of all I Would say Kavanaugh if if the last two years have been any indication Kavanaugh will be ancient history by the time this election happens it's like three weeks from now I have like these things go away for example ah the the Access Hollywood tape\nHappened right about this time in two thousand sixteen right about now you have to ... eighth or ninth in September eleventh that I\nUh and that by the time the election came as we saw had basically no impact on news ... him and this stuff goes away fast and I think there will I don't think this is because because it's not just Kavanaugh if they would've yeah left\nIt alone leclaire Williams\nBut they're not they're doubling down Hillary Clinton yesterday we can't live with these people I'm a Eric Holder comes out that the news today that he says when when they go low we kick them and the crowd cheers and this and he follows it with this is who the new Democratic Party\nAmazing amazing Michelle Obama pushed back on that today by the way of kind of an interesting way\nUm but you know what you see I think it's if you are under control you can make these stories go away their craziness in the cabin up thing could probably be forgotten by a lot of voters if you look at it from the time that Donald Trump came down to the escalator to today probably his cleanest month\nWas October two thousand sixteen after that that a tape came out\nHe was buttoned up for the rest of that time and made very few statements and wound up winning the election um because people were able to kind of forget about you know sort of this crazy innocence scandals that were going on and looked more Hillary Clinton in hers craziness and scandals\nUm so if you look at this ... they ... they could get it to go away doing things like we're going to kick them when they're when they go low a and a few people saying that's not a mob what are you talking about that sort of stuff is not going to help them no ... and so far since the cabinet\nBelow a and a few people saying it's not a mob what are you talking about that sort of stuff is not going to help them no ... and so far since the capital than what we've seen is really encouraging numbers for the ... particularly in the Senate the Senate has a you know we had a lot of reasons we talked about the um\nRobert Francis overwork versus a Ted Cruz situation where Cruz a ... that poll came out of fifty two forty three and a nine point lead now Cruz had been\nThere was one poll I think that had them tied a few ... most of them settled around three or four points with cruise leading\nUm that's expanded in multiple polls now to a nine to ten points I think it would be more than nine or ten point yeah but pat gray who are who are not in here with us today but he was talking on his show it was yesterday the day before believes that it's going to be over ten points you know I think it'll be I think it will be between fourteen and Eighteen points to another interesting poll that came out yesterday again from the New York times\nAnd this is the other during his life pulling thing I mentioned uh last hour\nHow many calls as it takes to get seven hundred and Seventy eight responses in Texas how many calls you have to make to get seven hundred and Seventy eight people to talk on the phone to you the number\nFifty one thousand one hundred and Ninety to ... they had to call fifty one thousand people to get seven hundred and Seventy eight to actually participate in the poll which is incredibly well you're calling Texas a and if it's marked with a New York a number of orange but New York times I understand that\nUh I mean it's this is ... over all the like for example York they do they also pull the eastern Long Island district New York one\nAre and what they found a five hundred and two responses they had to make twenty seven thousand one hundred and Seventy ... or you answer seriously do you know anybody that would take the time to answer that nobody does and that it wouldn't you know again if you take into account that factor which is totally changed over the last Twenty years with cell phones and\nAnd uh telemarketers and all those things\nIt's amazing these guys get even close to accurate results from polls because your self selecting a group of people who want to participate him and it's a you know who knows if they're represented why Google Home should include some sort of an F MRI\nSo they can just read our brains you that that would make it a lot of you who would make it a lot easier to stay home to your door that yeah I wanted to\nUm another interesting poll that came out of there are times though however was a protest of the Taylor Swift effect\nRemember Taylor Swift after all these are all the time being silent on on politics decided to dive into it inexplicably they ridiculously ... you know again like you almost feel like with her PR team if you're going to come out and do this at least have like sensible observations and don't be just bumper sticker you know a ... you know\nQuote tweeting Huffington Post write like that was the level of analysis she provided in her little post but again she's one of the biggest celebrities in the world how does this happen\nI she's from Tennessee she came out in Tennessee race the biggest thing that she talked about was Marsha Blackburn saying how anti women she was and and how she didn't care about this she wanted to keep gaze at of stores and all these ridiculous things that aren't true um well the first of all it's come out since that um and\n... the most of the ... calls were uh after that uh fifty four to forty Blackburn leads fourteen points this was a race that was in a toss up category wow now that polling holds I think we could fit a safely or understand that more people care about what Kanye West things about politics than Taylor Swift\nA but we'll see if that holds or not so we could look at\nSenate possibly a red wave in the Senate yeah I think you know so we talked about this a little while ago to which makes sense people know that's where the Supreme Court is happening and also people are in red states right and they're going to become more excited to vote more\nAnd people know that's where the Supreme\nCourt is happening and also people who are in red states right and they're going to become more excited to vote more passionate about voting the the the house we're seeing sort of a a slight turned to the opposite effect wear purple districts um sometimes it has been around a little bit lose a little more blue\nNot much to tell from it I think already the houses in real real danger I mean I it would be a surprise at this point if the Republicans were able to pull out the house not impossible it would be a surprise um uh but for the Senate real quick\nWe had ten tossup races that we were talking about before um and I believe it was three or four that they are the Republicans had to win to control the Senate I think it was three they'd with three of the tent at the time we talked about it but Ted Cruz race which in which he was favored by only three points was the best\nCase after case right now that's changed dramatically since we talked about that a couple of weeks ago now I'm a Ted Cruz seems to be on solid ground\nOr any more than a three point lead\nA Heidi Heitkamp seems to be in massive danger I Would say it looks like two races were decided with the Kavanaugh hearings barring some other may major development ah Heidi Heitkamp voted against him she looks like she's toast and Arthur in North Dakota now up Joe mansion voted for having all he looks like he's safe\nSo those two races are not even in the tossup category anymore in my mind a deadly and need to really use the cruise one which gets you down to about seven toss ups\nWhich the Republicans need to win one one of the seven will keep the Senate in Republican hands this is much improved situation from even when it was just a couple of weeks ago the cabinet I think I think is a big part of it\nOr we don't know that for sure yet I think it will play out in the next week or so when we really have a lot of results but it looks very promising in the Senate better than it's looked probably all year\nOr so that's a that's a good thing if you care about that so they asked the let me let me explain something or this election\nCould be in that\nI Know ... I Know technically we have three branches of government but I Believe we kind of had five we have\nThe press and the people okay by the executive legislative um and a judicial are the three in the constitution then you have the fourth which is the press and the people I Believe what happens in this election could put all five branches\nInto chaos if they win the house the house will go nuts\nAnd they will impeach they will subpoena which those subpoenas we'll go to the Senate the Senate will be in chaos because of it because of the Democrats\nThey will put the administrative in chaos because it will be under impeachment and it will also ah have testimony that it has to give that it will fight they're going to subpoena his tax records he will fight that which will go into the Supreme Court\nWhich the people will rise up and destabilize the fifth branch if you will the people as they stand up\nAnd they're starting to fight kind of back and forth in the streets you know not in a mob sort of way just in an ... sort of way they will the house will then again I think tried to impeach Kavanaugh\nOr at least get him to recuse himself from anything having to do with the administration\nYou watch it all ... and ... and the press is already in chaos all every piece of society could be in chaos based on this election\nGoing to be a fun couple of years [laughter] it'll be fun apple years thanks to William ... ah give us a quick reports\nAnd it's going to be a fun couple of years\nIt'll be fun couple years thanks to you or give us a quick report maybe every day here as things start to change yeah ah and ah give us a look on on the polls I'd also like you to\nSummarize the polls that I gave this morning on the people\nAbout the you know what is it eight percent of the people are progressive hardliners\nTwenty nine percent are a conservative hardliners and the rest are are being called uh the uh what was it the burned out a quarter or the uh the ... the tired core", "show_name": "The Glenn Beck Program", "year": "2018", "city": "Charlottesville", "day": "11"}
