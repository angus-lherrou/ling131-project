to anyone no matter who worked for voted for the bill and one of them seven five and twelve sixteen ... dream [noise]\nThe decision in front of us where do we go for a few from here\nIt's actually really kind of an exciting time because\nLabels are worthless\nThomas Paine wrote heaven knows the proper price too attached to something so celestial is freedom it's true every single generation I think except for the last the boomers had to earn and renewed their freedom\nThey didn't buy or sell the label the greatest generation that that that generation didn't have it wasn't them who came up with that title [noise] he was actually the boomers their children at the time\nThere weren't labels like we have now for every you know every subset of every generation people saw themselves as people and Americans they saw a crisis not as anybody's fault but rather\nOh crap their turn to stand and do the right thing is what they did with their crisis that\nMade others years later bestow upon them the title the greatest generation\nI don't know if you noticed this but ah we're living in a time of great crisis than up people and I don't think it's going to India and be much different or a smaller scale and the great struggles of\nThe past\nAnd in that struggle all of the labels that we think we have now will fall away all of those that have been bought will become worthless and every new label for each of us will be purchased with blood sweat tears or actual courage\nAnd what we face in the end\nNot going to be smaller than what many of our grandparents or great grandparents faced in the world war is not going to be any less frightening than the global economic unrest of the Nineteen thirties\nOr is not going to be any less frightening than the global economic unrest of the Nineteen thirties but it's not going to be greater either it's just going to be hours\n\nAnd just like the generations gone by it will be our choice whether or not we survive\nI think this is a blessing\nThe boomers never got to see who they really were the boomers\nFeast it off the crisis of their parents they never really had to choose for themselves\nLike the greatest generation did life or death freedom or slavery they never had to push themselves as a group beyond what humans thought was even possible to achieve something as valuable or as celestial as freedom\n\nThe crisis that we're now beginning to see is a blessing it's a blessing our parents never received\nEach of us\nIt's going to have to choose we're gonna have to pick between black and white slavery or freedom good or evil life and death the choices are going to be that clear\n\nWe will all know in the years to come who we really are if we choose carefully who we really are otherwise we will be painfully aware of who we simply allowed ourselves to become\n\nWe can become through this struggle exactly who we were born to be our best and highest self\n\nIf each of us were honest and we began to see the struggle in the proper like we did admit that it's the softness of our foundations that have caused all these troubles it's are wanting an easier life not making the hard choices not having to say no not having to say yes\nBut Brock Obama nor Donald Trump or the problem or the solution there symptom look around you no matter who voted for I think all of us will\nAnd many of us may have believed for a while or even engaged in this warfare it's becoming more and more clear to more and more Americans that our neighbors\nAre not the enemy no matter who they voted for\nAnd if you're not there yet or your neighbors not there yet\nAsked them to ponder this\nWho and your family came here I don't care if it was three months ago or three centuries ago why did they come here they came here to make a better life from\nA country that would not allow them to follow their dream for one reason or another from a country that that didn't value hard work\nTo a country that did value hard work and allowed you to keep what you belt so you could live better than you did before or you could have a better life than your parents or your grandparents you could afford a better life for your children so they could achieve even more than you did\n\nThat at that opportunity is not coming because we have just to bless land\nBecause we have all kinds of climate and you know Great Plains and mountains and and shoreline it's not that\n\nDoesn't even come from the people 'cause quite frankly sometimes people suck it came from our mission statement it\nCame from the American thesis that all men are created equal endowed by their creator with certain inalienable rights among them life liberty and the pursuit of happiness and while that mission statement was and always will be aspirational as it's never been fully achieved\n\nIt has done great good even in its\nEven in its worst interpretation it has done great good\n\nIt shaped and given the best chance to succeed when it's protected by the guard rails of the constitution and the bill of rights people came here because of our laws which come from the American ceases that's what created the modern world\nIt is indeed why people still die in the middle of the night on the desert just trying to get to the side of the border\n\nCan I ask you went on this question\n\nIs it really that much of a stretch to believe that you and I are not alone in or out of our doctors\n\nTo really that hard to believe that our neighbor who knows how sick we all are really wants everyone who disagrees with their doctor to die\n\nIs it possible that\nOur neighbors have seen the flaws in their practitioner as we have an hours but we haven't talked about that\n\nIs it really that much of a stretch to think that if we stop spending all of our time looking at what's wrong with America or what's wrong with them we might be able to see and search for the things that are right with America and good about our neighbors\n\nPerhaps were not as sick as all the doctors tell us are perhaps our doctors our politicians that are parties are more akin to bad crooked chiropractors that you've gone to and have done more damage to your spine than good and will continue to bilk\nUs out of every single dime week after week until we finally stand up and say you know what no\nOr we're broke\nAnd I understand why we haven't wanted to listen because most likely our friends have all said don't go down that road\nOur family might've said don't don't don't go to him and then you really believed in you fought and now you're sitting here and you realize geez they're right and I don't want to be wrong I don't want to tell them that they were right\nThen again perhaps we are beyond help and we only have months to live\nBut if it is that way I don't know about you but if we're going down I Want to go down with my friends in my family around me and all of them all of them\nEven those who told me not to listen to my doctor or the one I angrily chased away because I just knew they were wrong I Want all of them by my bedside\n\nI think we should spend some time\nEspecially when we look at what's happening in Portland in and realize it's really easy to jump on the bandwagon and light fires\nIt's really hard to put fires out it's easy\nTo lose friends and family and chase them away it's a lot harder to bring them back\n\nToday there are four stories in the news that talk about our founding documents and our structure of our country our constitution say they all failed well\n... no not really no they were just forgotten our founding documents really are only an idea that's it I think a really good idea that says yeah we should all be able to choose who we want to be you know build our own life charter own course\nAnd be left alone if we want to be left alone or be or right on top of each other if we want to but whatever we choose we can live our life with dignity and security that's a pretty damn good idea\nBut that idea has failed\nJust that nobody really remembers it or believes in it anymore\nIt's just that nobody really remembers it or believes in it anymore\nI still do\nAnd I think you do and I will bet you that your neighbor does as well\nI'm not a doctor well actually I Am I'm a doctor if humanity's which means I can treat any anything in the human body so listen to me here I'm I'm a doctor I think our illnesses all in our heads\n\nI think we've been convinced by those who suffer from some sort of societal Munch housing by proxy\nThen were fatally ill and will only survive because of them and I have to tell ya that's ally they need us to be sick and I don't know about you but I've had enough time in bed we're not as sick as they tell us\nThey've convinced that they've filled in the line for us because we never had to fight for it we never had to fight for what that blank is as a country we say I am what worthless racist over you know\nWe as a country we are a powerful force of good\n\nWe are people who make mistakes but learn from them we is that people are always looking at a better tomorrow not a dusty\nBroken passed we came\nHere for a reason and one of the reasons is we wanted to leave the past in the past we wanted to charge a new course\n\nIf we choose to see things the way they are and couple that with who we always have ... ... to be\nOur best selves better not not better than the neighbor just better than you were yesterday can you just be slightly better than you worry yesterday not perfect not like him not like her stop comparing yourself\nCan we be better than we were yesterday if we can do that and see each other in the best light put our past in the past\nAnd our strife and are coming crisis in the right\nRight light down the road down the road after we've done all of this hard work some other generation that will come along we look back and name and give a label to us\nI Believe that label is going to be good I Believe that label could be great\nBut one thing is for sure it will not be the one we choose\nIt will be the label we have earned\n[noise]\nSponsor this half hour is simply safe [noise] simply safe you know and I love it simply say is the

humanities\nScholarship at base less up on finding proof and more upon attending to social grievances has become firmly established if not fully dominant within these fields and there are scholars increasingly but bully students administrators and other departments into adhering to their world view\nSo Dr James Lindsey ... along with a couple of other friends decided you know I let's find out what this was all about and let's see what the lines are and they learned an awful lot ah they learned something\nAh quite valuable that you just can't get away with anything you have to fall into a a set pattern really Dr James Lindsey a is joining us now he is a thinker he's not a philosopher but he is a thinker which I like a doctorate in math\nA background in physics uh James how are you sir\nThe sink or which I like a doctorate in math or background or in physics uh James how are you sir good Glenn how are you [laughter] I'm good um so tell us what you were tell us what you were trying to do what were you trying to prove\nWell we were looking into these fields to find out whether or not their scholarship has gotten so kind of ideological bias that if we put forth I'm really absurd arguments or that they might\nYou be willing to publish those so long as they've solved fell in line with the political views that they seem to be forwarding and plays a scholarship\nSo the first you didn't you didn't really understand the political view part right because the first few the studies that you use submitted a you've got back they were rejected\nYeah um well it's not quite that actually we I think we understood the political view but we didn't understand the need for a scholarship we started this project out and as you said we got the first several papers are back rejected we started in August by Thanksgiving everyone are literally Thanksgiving a day off\nOr we really realized we were in trouble um we weren't getting anywhere with trying to host them but the problem wasn't we didn't understand the politics so much although there's still a lot to learn there and there was for us to a very complicated they call it a matrix of domination that you have to understand um\nBut it was more that we actually we're not trying to work their scholarship and so there are two things that are needed\nTo to get these papers and one is that you actually have to understand what they call scholarship you have to do it according to their rules you you have to understand the concepts you're working with and present them knowledgeably and then you also have to

and uh we get the dog park and there's this this dog they're living out the paper it was crazy this dog\nWell oh yeah that's by far what we consider to be the most important evidence that we gathered\nIn the process of of this project that the papers got published or that they got awards in some cases are one case and all of this is fine and it says a lot in his disturbing\nBut the reviewers comments show that these ... peer reviewers which it worked out between two and four or five or paper so we ended up with something like\nForty five or fifty total a set of comments they they really did engage with what we did they really looked at it they said our analysis was good winter analysis was terrible they didn't raise an eyebrow about the data we gather the idea that\nUm you know the dog park paper contains\nA bit of completely irrelevant evidence about\nWere dogs go to the bathroom and unauthorized ways as we were today and it's completely irrelevant to the paper but nobody raised an eyebrow about how ridiculous that is um they were concerned however that we\nIndicate that we're human not dogs so that we can be sure that we don't claim that when a dog there was a ... ... thing of another dog whether or not the dogs they go home to want it or not\nBecause how could we know that as being [noise] mental ... and they were really concerned as I Hope everybody's seen in our little\nVideo we put out to announce the project they're really concerned with the fact that we respect the dog's privacy and the process of inspecting their genitals um [laughter]\nAnd we run out and I don't know what what specifically were they concerned about I mean the ... ... what I mean\nYou got me man\n[laughter] and then it was done in the privacy of a a veterinary office [laughter] okay um let's see you did fat body building which quickly is what\nAre the the idea that what needs to be added to the professional sport a body building is a category in which fat is displayed politically so that fat as just considered another issue or that equal with muscle\nAnd to say that that's not true is to be mean\nTo fat people pat phobic as they call it\n[laughter] ... and that was accepted\nYeah that was expected that was a pretty pretty exciting acceptance um\nEspecially because uh we actually had a real scholar who let us use his identity ... who wrote that who we claim growth that paper and he actually as a professional body builder\nOr Mr northern hemisphere in Nineteen Seventy eight or something that I mean this guy's Seventy years old and just stack and the picture in my mind of this guy being the author of this paper for fat body building was just kind of hilarious\n[laughter] that's another thing to a lot of these papers you had a completely fake organizations you had completely fake scholars coming from colleges that I think didn't exist in some cases I mean it some of this would have been easily just provide basic checking would it would it wouldn't have had\nI think so I mean this kind of a is this is a tricky point and I don't want to get too far into the into the weeds here but honestly scholarship should stand or fall on its merit not on who did it and so\nInterrupted to teach them what that feels like\nNone of that was questioned\nWhat if this were published and they were real if this were published what what would that mean to the university system would would what does that mean\nSo all events is a really complicated I'm there will be people who try to take this out in fact we got the idea from a news article about somebody at the University of Pennsylvania who was employing a similar but less extreme version of this in her classroom and got in trouble for it a late last year\nSo they decided it didn't come to us out of the vacuum this was actually something that people are attempting in classrooms and so there would have been some some are educators primarily working and social justice\nSide or the fields topics\nCourses I guess is the best way to to say that but also probably into some of the general ed stuff who would take up some degree of the suggestions as you know experimental but but legitimate to use in the classroom and this was being submitted to\nThe gold standard journal this wasn't some fringe of journal in education and this was the gold standard feminists philosophy journal had Asia that we were working with here which is where a lot of ...\nJournal in education this was the gold entered feminist philosophy journal hype Asia that we were working with here\nWhich is where a lot of the literature that like this already exist but you don't mind me going on a little bit this this kind of what's happening I'm we think that what's happening here is kind of in the equivalent with ideas of money laundering called ideal on dreams\nSo they take they take these these bad ideas some of which are just opinion some of them are prejudiced some of them are genuinely terrifying like this educational thing and then they launder them through the academic process and they come out with the stamp of academic approval that makes them look like they're real knowledge\nSo you'll hear people say oh well there was a study or we've basis program on studies that show well that's fine when the studies or could but when the studies\nAre coming from a place that can't tell a\nTruth from from prejudiced and opinion it becomes a real problem [noise]\nTeams one of the other ones I found um disturbing or was the uh H. O. H. two ... two was was accepted can you explain to explain this one\nYou know that paper was accepted by a show at the center and I was just mentioning that patriot stood for hoax on hoaxes so it was a hoax paper we wrote that was about writing academic hoaxes just the code namely gay for convenience what they argue is that that you can\nOnly properly criticize things that go against social justice and in particular you can only use humor to make fun of or or do satire to deflate\nThat which goes against social justice if you use humor against social justice if you criticize social justice what that means as you never really properly engaged with it therefore we don't have to consider your criticism and that's one of the huge problems going on in this\nThis set of of fields is that they don't accept criticism if you tried to criticize them they say that it's a privilege preserving epidemic pushback that a scholar named Allison Bailey huge\nHuge in the education literature they say it's white fragility that's Robin to Angelo who has just had a big book published on that this year but introduce the concept in twenty eleven which\nSays that if I'm somebody was privilege in particular white people for her work uh is challenged so that their privileges Clinton question that they are fragile and don't know how to deal with it because of privilege made them weak they don't know how to psychologically deal with having that challenge and they act out in anger or grief or something like that\nAnd trying to maintain their privilege and so\nThese ideas are already getting out there we just took him to step further\nAnd didn't you know it's interesting guy because the one about hoaxes he is interesting in that if it took to criticize what you guys did they would almost half just cite your paper as that was\nThe idea yeah it was definitely to put them in that position and I've asked ... to stand by the paper that they accept it and publish in our right names they haven't responded yet but we'll see what they do I'm\nThat way indeed people who want to criticize her project from a position of interest I Know feminist them will need to cite cost in order to criticize us\n[laughter] I can we get one more to go on and on the you talked to us on the scary front at the feminist mind comp or\nWill you also did the white man's mind competed to one time and this was accepted in the white man wasn't right correct correct tell me about them\nSo I'll do though the white one first because I didn't get in it was much more frightening it was written in from the position of an auto west\nOne first because it didn't get in it was much more frightening it was written in from the position of an auto West Nile graffiti where the researcher is reflecting on and hurt the state's her own experience\nAs a white lesbian women coming to hate her own white mass and it was rejected partly because the scholarship wasn't quite er which is the case in all of the papers\nBut also because the position that the author as a good white\nRather than being sufficiently ... or whatever to critical race ...\n... so there was there was an explicitly political reasoning behind why it was was rejected and it was that the the author as a white woman was trying to make herself look good by criticizing her own white was was one of the main reason the feminist one was\nWell hold on just a second hold on just saying then that took\nMind the parts of mine Tom where he was talking about Jews and replace the words Jews with a with whites\nYeah in that case it was either whites are white and this and then we edited the text around it and added a whole a whole bunch of literature and rewarded things so get past plagiarism check and things like that so yeah that was a\nBit started with scanning through mine comp picking out passages about the Jews and replacing juice with whites are white mass\nShootings and editing around it\nUh the feminist one didn't do it quite the same way the feminist one was not about it didn't take Jews out and replace it\nWith with men for example it actually is the chapter in my income where Hitler explains the need for the Nazi Party that chapter twelve and what its members would be expected to hold to and including especially the sacrifices that have to make to be Nazis\nAnd we've replaced our movement the party et cetera he doesn't mention Nazis specifically in that chapter\nOr we replace that with intersection all feminism or solidarity or ally ... something to do with with the feminist movement\nAnd criticize the idea that uh some feminists do what they called choice feminism which is the idea that if a woman is living her own life the way she wants to end considers that to be a statement of feminism\nThan she is doing feminism it's salmon is for women to have you know full agency and make their own choices in the world that's what this paper was criticizing\nSaying that no no the responsibility if they really want to consider themselves feminists is to be to make sacrifices stand in solidarity with other oppressed people particularly of you know women of color or women of other marginalized status is\nJames [noise] couple of quick questions um they\nHad to be one of those things that you entered into and hope that you were wrong in when they were accepted you had to celebrate and then short time later going\nGood God this is bad am I right\nThat's exactly that is exactly right so especially the ... paper I think the one that got accepted\nUm the idea there was that we were trying to it's very different from mine off of course do I mean as you get it for one to one thing uh\nBut the ... the the politics of grievance come through I really am glad I get to talk to you about that if I can because politics of grievances everywhere and it's certainly being used in the academic left as we were trying to demonstrate we called this stuff grievance studies we see it everywhere right and I think this is why we're so divided\nA politically right now I was really happy to talk to you because I mean I Know we don't want to getting in touch with you but you're a real dude and that's why I wanted to talk to you thanks you know you had this whole may a ... about how things were\nWhere you under Obama's time and I thought that was\nTalk to you thanks you know you had this whole ... about\nHow things were going where you under Obama's time and I thought\nThat was huge and I was like you know this guy Glenn Beck is is is a bridge she's looking for reconciliation it's on your on your Twitter bio we need to be talking to each other again so our project was you know where people on the left were left liberals\nI'm not ashamed to say that I Know you consider yourself a classical liberal and conservative on the right\nThat's great I'm we're on the left needed a responsibility for our own lunatics and so our project was kind of that you know or left wing people who want the left\nTo come back from the from the edge and we hope that you know the same things happening on the right and we can all START I think you know people in general I get a lot of sense that people send me emails about this now all the time especially\nUm we're all kinds of sick of all this nonsense all the fighting all the polarization and we can't get anything done I think we want to get back to production politics\nAnd as long as we're relying heavily on this grievance stuff which clearly the academic left is I think we see a lot of it coming out of the right wing media sphere as well from my perspective\nI think as long as we're focusing on that we can't have productive conversations we can't ... remember you know you're an American I'm an American your person I'm a person we\nHave ... most of the things that we think income and even though we have\nSome probably pretty serious political differences but I think we also have in common that we want to have better conversations we want to move society and a direction that benefits us all and it's just a matter of working out the details and I really hope that you know that our projects kinda reaches reaches that point does that make

Republican\nOr ... or rooting for conservatives to have a chance here to pass anything I'm obviously UD both to really have a good chance of passing anything and as we've seen over the past or\nA past couple of years even that is no guarantee you have to get anything done um but\nUh what you're seeing now is really good polling or for the GOP in the Senate a lot of these races that were close have moved to geo peas direction\nUm to get to fifty is which is what they need of course to have control with Mike Pence was the deciding vote you need to have a a there is about ten races there um and they've knocked out most of it's not just the ones that lean in their category get them get them to fifty there's the ... additional seven tossup races where they could get all the way up to fifty seven if they were to sweets those\nUm you know maybe even outside shot at something dramatic maybe even getting to fifty eight\nMost likely you're probably in that area of fifty three fifty four right now which is an improvement over the current situation in the Senate but if they lose the house that doesn't mean anything is that yeah you know it doesn't mean it means something but it doesn't mean a a heck of a lot 'cause you're not gonna be able to pass anything 'cause you know the house is going to have both the other way and the houses where it looks real things look very bad\nFor Republicans um it's interesting the way that they're looking at this is not whether\nHe usually it's like we'll we'll ever will the party loser gains seats right that's the way we usually typically look at these things and then there's the control angle as well who will control the house full even notice you haven't heard a lot of talk about whether Republicans\nWill will gain any seats large because it looks like it's not even possible at this point in fact um the the polling models that they have working right now uh five thirty eight has one which they have um the ... the chance of Republicans maintaining their current amount of seats at less than zero point one percent\nAnd you might say oh well they've gotten you know there was issues with dating a Trump right which is the thing every time I talk about polls were like oh well they didn't get truck right well first of all the national polls were almost exactly dead on for Donald Trump or it just didn't get the\nAh electoral college right but that also wasn't what they were pulling and right and some of the states were were obviously wrong but for example uh five thirty I Believe had about thirty percent chance that they thought Donald Trump or when they're saying there was a point one percent less than a point one percent chance that the Republicans will maintain the same amount of house\nSeats in the house in fact they are saying the equal chance\nThat Republicans maintain the same amount of seats as Democrats gaining eighty three seats\nNow both of those are ... stream outliers right like I don't think either one of those is going to happen right but the chances of of of the of the Democrats just controlling the house are about eighty percent\nAnd he's like no I'm not garnered you're young women they break his window and chased him down\nPolice nothing nothing\nNow I don't know if you saw the uh the mob in yes and I did use the N word gosh I don't know if you saw the mob in Portland this

burning\nFlags whatever that's pretty scary and the mayor ... released a statement at a press conference where he said I was appalled by what I saw in the video but\nI support the police's decision not to intervene how how how can you how can you support that decision I I don't I mean I guess the the just the idea of look this is wrong but we want to make it any worse\nHe's trying to make it sound as if um the police this is his angle for the mainstream\nOur police can do no right they they act and they're just thugs they don't act and their do nothing's so they have no\nWay to win it's a great observation there are two political parties and whatever you do one of them might criticize you yes that is that this is the job of being a mayor I get the job of being a leader supposed to actually have an idea and do something and\nYou do one of them might criticize you yes that is that the job of being married right out of your job of being a leader you're supposed to actually have an idea and do something in which I think he did by the way I think you're right it would you would not speak is dismayed right when you say for public consumption that is exactly what he's doing yes his his opinion is oh jeez where we're damned if we do damned if we don't\nBut in reality what he wants is a is much more on this side but yeah the ...\nMore on the end of a side and you can back that up with how he reacted to the FBI\nThe FBI building in Portland is ... is under siege for ... to ... I mean think of the balls and these guys they take the FBI building and block it off so FBI agents are are now trapped inside the building\nThey call for police police say a we've got a call the mayor why I'm calling you dispatch police we have to call the mayor the mayor goes on and says if the FBI thinks that this city is going to back them up there in the wrong city\n... excuse me what what ... so the FBI had to get federal officers to come in and get everybody out of that building and into safety\nSounded nothing Portland did nothing to these guys that I mean whoa what is this\nIs a I mean it's it's close to anarchy right it's certainly the way that that you think it would come if it does it say you know the idea that you\nThe FBI can't depend on police officer forget the FBI just these are people that these are actual real individuals who are in danger or and\nThat was a woman who has the food carts across the street from the FBI um she was a a threatened with an inch of her life\nI think they've had to move out of the city her and her family um they took her stuff destroyed it a threatened the neighbors who are coming down trying to you know stick up for\nI mean they're just ... they've become animals they become animals and their claim these are they're streets now they're not\nThey're not punk if you pay for them because I think a lot of the people who are trying to make it to work are the ones who actually paid for it your streets since when\nBut read enough history usually people are who are um\nYou know national socialists or Marxist radicals of some sort they're in power and they let this they let this stuff and go until the people have had enough\nAnd then they do what they want with those people and they you know use those people as cover to seize even more power that's the way it works on a national scale I have no idea what this Portland mayor is doing\nBut it's insane\nMeanwhile Alex ...

in insecure enough already\nI Would digested and say it's my fault time rubbish\nIt affected me and I started to think it's all going to go I'm going to lose everything\nIt is fascinating to read these things from him because what I've always felt about Michael ... was she was just having fun\nHe was just living a dream and I wondered and I never spotted in him I just wondered\nIf it was ever going to get old to him because what makes him I think the best performer I've ever seen on stage\nIs that joy he just has a joy of performance and it is it is so in fact she was yeah he loves it\nMean you can tell when you see 'em live you can tell he just absolutely loves doing it or at least at one point but they're starting to talk about I mean there's conflicting reports that he's actually thinking about stopping it completely he says I was learning with ...\nUm but they're starting to talk about I mean there's conflicting reports that he's actually thinking about stopping it completely\nHe says I was learning with passion that I was afraid I'd become a mere poor photo copy of my heroes but when I come back from this terrible time I realized I'm not a mere photocopy I've learned everything I can from them taking it found my own soul my own voice my own style and now know critic can take that away\nIt needed clarifying now I'm just seeing the music I Love maybe when you let go that's when it comes back to you it's a lot like love\nHe is um he he I think he's joking about he's because he says\nI miss the guys in my band so when my wife had to go back to Argentina I said to the guys come on over to the house let's have a drink order some pizza place some video games and jam\nThey came over and we partied and I said let's play some music and I thought wow this is fun it was then that I realized I missed making music I didn't even know I missed it\nThat was about a year ago so why would he possibly be saying that he is now\nIt seems like it might be one of those situations where the Internet has taken a somewhat a sarcastic comment and turn it into reality his his spokespeople are coming out today and saying that he's not actually going to retire because he's in the middle of a tour in a book or their album released and all that other stuff\nSo here's what he ... here's what he says exactly to the reporter\nHe pauses there are three reasons I wanted to do this album one because I felt a debt of gratitude deeper than I can explain to the millions of people all over the world who prayed for us and showed us compassion that gave me faith in humanity\nTo because I Love music and I feel I can continue the legacy of my idols and three because of the world was ending not just my own personal hell but watching the political turmoil in America and watching Europe breakup there's never a better time for music then he suddenly stops\nQuote this is my last interview he says quite solemnly I'm retiring from the business of made the perfect record and now I can leave it at the very top end quote somehow though the writer says I don't think he really means it\nIt's unbelievable because you know that it was put all over the media as if he was retiring well he said it was his last interview he's got other interviews scheduled\nLike he's had a whole press tour for this album is just silly and most important thing though is is looking at that and saying that is really the type of thing that ... that changes your perspective completely right you go through something like that and you stop and you examine all the nonsensical idiocy that you you participate in everyday\nUh and you can re prioritize you don't want to have to go through that to do it but sometimes it's the only thing that makes you kind of re prioritize the things you're doing in your life or and and he seems to have I mean he he is making thirty five million dollars a year if he's out there a touring and stuff and he's able to walk away from that\nUm because he just wants to spend time with his son how many times do we hear excuses um according I Would have had more time with my family that was completely real guy yeah it's nice to see somebody who actually you know kind of size to see\nThat he he got through it and has made it into a good thing\nYou know I I have I have\nProbably more respect for Michael ... play\nThan any other professional that I ever met in the entertainment industry because he has found a way to keep his feet on the ground and he was afraid I mean when everybody when everyone it was very popular to hate me\nShe didn't I mean no popular hate you\nThe popular to hate me he didn't but I mean no popular hate you I Know but he but he would and he was never taking a stand for me he just wouldn't he just didn't understand that he was like I'm I'm not in politics I'm a Canadian why do I care and then you get out of it and then you get a fight at a ...\nYeah he said the guy turned around and said I could leave you look what Beck and he's like I'm Canadian Idol vote what what does it matter what does it matter to you and the guy threw a punch and he said I threw punches back and he said I got to do it\nGot into a hockey fight [laughter] you got to do a hockey fight [laughter] I Am so happy to hear\nThat his ah family is um is doing better and his son has made this miraculous turn and ah Michael ... you've given enough if you want to give more we will certainly take it\nBut uh do what's right for you do what's right for you and for your family and your real fans\nWill be thrilled no matter what you decide\n[noise]\nI mean unless it's leaving the music business than they're pissed off [noise] yeah [noise] by the way his new album is out in a few weeks a couple of tracks automotive already been released and they're really good really good really really good [noise] alright sponsored this half hour relief factor a relief factor is a\nWay for you to escape the pain naturally did you buy depending chance listen to the um a pod cast this weekend\nUh the one from ... ... I mean I've heard a I I mean\nThey were there when we were recording at all I listen to it again this weekend with my wife and uh he is the I just think he's wrong on this I mean I you know how do you say this to a to a father even though it did ah that lost his son to opioids\nA cause he's saying there's no reason for any of these opioids you shouldn't have any of them oxycontin Vicodin none of it should be available at all\nAnd um I just think that's really really wrong or because we have a lot of people certainly understand the position he's coming from from his position yes but I mean look at Pat Pat if he\nDidn't have drugs I don't know what drugs these on but if he didn't have drier when there are many heroin yeah there are many days he wouldn't he wouldn't make it to the middle of the street to meet his dealer no he wouldn't make it to work he wouldn't be able to get out of bed yeah\nNow if you are in a situation where you want your life back and you've tried to everything may I suggest you try really factor stop taking all of the pain medications I have this I stopped taking everything last Christmas\n'cause I just I just couldn't do it anymore I just didn't want to live this way anymore and I have my life back\nA hundred per cent drug free created by doctors for key ingredients that help your body fight against inflation and that's where the majority of our pain comes from fry it tried for three weeks they have three quick start it's Nineteen Ninety five", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Glenn Beck Program", "city": "Charlottesville", "day": "15"}
