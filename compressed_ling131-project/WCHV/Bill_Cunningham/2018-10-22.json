argument at which the Saudis at this point more or less have confirmed that an unsuspecting Jamal cause Yogi walked into a Saturday a consulate and that's the amount turkey it's them both turkey to be tortured and killed over a seven minute period\nNow that's bad not good but\nThings happen in that part of the world all the time if you steal something you chop off your hands\nGood but those things happen in that part of the world all the time\nIf you steal something you chop off your hands men and women are hand or use source to chop their heads off on a regular basis a woman who commits adultery stoned to death in the public square nasty violence is happening all the time and not part of the world according to CNN especially\nWe're now supposed to get twisted into knots\nAnd drop our support of the president and want to blow up America's relationship with Saudi Arabia which could cost us a half a trillion dollars and now Saudi Arabia has a relationship with Israel as a counterbalance against Iran ... drop all of that because the Saudi Arabian was killed in Turkey\nI don't get it I don't understand and the other thing\nThe moral outrage felt by CNN is not shared by them when a police officer is killed for example ... officer Jason Alice who was killed in May of ah twenty uh Thirteen about five years ago his killer has not been apprehended\nCNN did not even a report is death\nThis year in America about one hundred cops are going to be killed the great majority of the perpetrators will be located but on the other hand some what I'll be located\nYou mean to tell me that the death of ... ... cars show he has more impacted my life and then the death of a police officer or the death of a truck driver or the murder of a college student in Iowa\nOr a school teacher or a child\nInnocent kids or kidnapped and raped in America all the time\nYoung black men about seven hundred will be gone down in the south side of Chicago women are raped and brutalized in torture and on a regular basis happens inside of America much less in other parts of the world so why is the media focusing on a murder in Turkey\nBecause if it's a journalist excuse me ... show was not a journalist there was a part time contributor to the Washington Post but even if he was quote a journalist\nDoes that have more value to me that a police officer or someone to someone I American soldier killed absolutely not\nYou know I I I'm waiting for the outrage from CNN about forty Mexican journalist murdered in the past two years in Mexico by drug cartels have you heard about any of their you know who they are\nTo me because show narrative as a hustle it's fake news it's a ploy\nUsed to attack Donald J Trump to undermine his Middle East policy which is works so well they're exploring his death and weaponize thing is death as a cudgel against the Trump stir that's what's going on\nI guarantee you he his life as no more value than a truck drivers lie for cops life a soldier's life or waitresses life for coal miners life a taxi drivers life all the might be murdered brutally tortured happens all the time in America and elsewhere so why is the death\nOf a Saudi Arabian in Turkey big news because the media wants to use that as a club against the president and his Middle East policy and I think there is those at CNN and mainstream media that do not do not like the fact that Israel now has a friend in Saudi Arabia\nThey don't like that and I bought the half million Syrians killed by Iran and by Russia by barrel bombs any of those ...\nIn Saudi Arabia they don't like that and I bought the half million Syrians killed by Iran and by Russia by barrel bombs any of those lives have meaning to CNN no because they cannot be used as a weapon against this president they want to act as if\nWhen Trump says bad things about journalist so Maui indirectly cause the death of democracy Yogi in Turkey who Nell believes is crap\nIt's unbelievable but let's continue\nBlonde becomes available to never does one eight six six six four seven seven three three seven the thing is\nTonight if we can focus on illegal migrants swelling to ten thousand value to reach the U.S supported by the Democratic party incentivize rather mainstream media and the fact that ... if he was my father if he was my brother\nI'd be outrage at is that it was ... it should not have died\nSaudi Arabians do this all the time Syrians Iranians Iraqis inside of America there are several other black guys killed every year in Chicago and one hundred dead cops can you name one cop killed in America this year give me the name and your mind ... give me the name of one cup right now\nNPR ... which is subsidized by the taxpayers is the same I end up look at the head of the past set of who's back because they understood oil as political opponents right both\nBush and Obama and Secretary Clinton looked at the other way at that guy 'cause we needed to face the supply Afghanistan\nPlus services African Business conference that Obama held were fifty African leaders and I think the daily mail newspaper looked at it and it was a row gallery of human rights violators and corrupt officials but you know the media like CNN and MSNBC and NPR\nThey just falling over how the great or bomber was reaching out to Africa not looking at the human rights background of this spot\nFortress African leaders so the whole thing is sick\nOr no and and you went over that quickly but use backers than had a leader\nWho would boil alive his political opponents and while that was going on Obama and Hillary replacing floating around with this guy and the media that that was no big deal right to boil alive your political opponents that's okay because Obama\nHad the relationship and Hillary had their relationship and use biggest in the media didn't cover that are all did they\nKnow and you know it's funny there are people on\nNPR that work two hours to a two hour show every week and and they make three hundred thousand dollars plus a year now see that's fine except I don't want to subsidize them you know ... you know why should we pay for NPR PBS slit you don't like Facebook and Google and Microsoft Starbucks and Amazon\nLet them pay for it or people that like it in San Francisco or Boston or watch the average the horrible taxpayer half to subsidize in the yard that the clowns they have one that that station on a regular basis with their little fire as a propaganda\nAnd then there's hundreds hundreds of rent their ears in thousand radio stations those five hundred television stations but we taxpayers subsidize PBS and NPR for what reason what what's the purpose is because they're left wing liberal Democrats and the Republican Party has no ... that's why it's done\nWhile I'm not for killing people but I mean hell no words you know like it's not a nice after utopian world is like brick set a\nIn a ... human life is very cheap around the world and you know but people who pick and choose their atrocities and there does spots or should be condemned and and that's the the media thank you\nAnd your great thank you for your call let's go to Jim in Chicago the belly of the beast gym in Chicago welcome to the bill Cunningham show Jim go ahead\nThings are just to let you know I uh I have a home in San Pedro Sula Honduras [laughter] than I Am also a resident of the country and I am totally opposed to what's growing up going on\nAnd tell me you spend time and Honduras talking about the circumstances the violence the economy is\nIs this kind of like it because if you live in Chicago I live in Chicago it all you hear about from people that love other places they ... they're talking about Al Capone about violence but it's like any section you know there's a lot of wonderful places there sure there's a lot of stability and all that area's however [noise] part of the problem is the government there\nYou know there's a lot of wonderful places there sure\nAnd there's a lot of stability areas however [noise]\nPart of the problem is the government there doesn't do things well they think like Obama they just want to raise taxes\nFor example if you go to a restaurant or food it's Fifteen Percent sales tax on food and if you order like a like a drink it's Eighteen percent tax for a drink at a restaurant you know and plus the value of the ... been sliding to the dollar is not the twenty four limbs per dollar used to be just a few years ago it was like twenty\nJune ... is the government democratically elected one isn't\nWell this last election there was a big uh uh this name as his initials or a jail age\nBecause he used to be before Honduras just had one term for four years and then when the bomb was president he somehow was able to get the legislature to make a two terms and people didn't like that and there was a lot of writing in the streets in fact they closed on uh they're they're called the ... they're called cloud as\nWhat they did is they close on all the highways and stuff so people couldn't get to the airport and actually suspended flights in San Pedro a couple of times because of that [noise] and and what they did this last time you know they have these these like toll booth leaving the city there's three ... three major told those\nUh and they they just burn them out they just destroyed the buildings and the toll booths are no longer collecting tolls\nAnd that's a that's a major hit you know and that's that's just it's amazing when I was down there the one time I couldn't actually get home I had to wait for two days and you could hear the gunfire in the background 'cause San Pedro was like a huge valley surrounded by mountains\nOr do you what's the what's the life for the average Honduran huh what's it like\nWell if you have money you do well if you're poor you don't want to be there because there's no public assistance to the public hospitals are Laden with cockroaches [noise] but you know there's a lot of beautiful restaurants there the food is wonderful you know you it's it's so it's like it's mixed\nYou know I've been going there for thirty some years in fact my ex wife I'm a his from there and that was part of the attraction I went there and I have two daughters with her they're teenagers now and I'm Still good with my my in laws and things it's nice but you know you gotta be careful you don't want to do a bad business deal with anybody because it's a good chance who could get hurt\nIn Illinois now you said you're again Hondurans Guatemalans El Salvador and Nicaragua coming to America while you again\nWell it doesn't serve a purpose you know the same energy and you see a lot of this is being ... funded by these left us you know George Soros types and and you know they should spend the same energy and resource to try to fix what's wrong in their own government\nSaying stand your dream fix your own country ... wind leaving the best and the brightest might be leaving you leave behind those who can't function so it really in the long term mental that's\nWhat happens a lot of people with means a lot of Hondurans they should have gone to Spain\nAnd a lot of them come illegally here you know in fact I hate to say it's one of my good friends actually got killed about five years ago he was involved in a bad car deal the transaction [noise] and he got off right they got killed right before Christmas\nSo you know going in and you get a gun and kill somebody\nYeah and his brother actually had a tourist season he\nLeft his beyond he's done in the California for the last five years he ... he gotta you're going to get married is going to try to get us paper view these via marriage so a lot of people with resources have left and come over here and then try to stay here you know by getting married he was doing something else to become legal right\nNow it's it's a big problem he also down there you know their energy consumption they keep raising the price for a for electricity it's all diesel powered a generation it's not a fishing is expensive\nAnd they keep raising the price of energy\nIt's for for electricity it's all diesel powered a generation it's not efficient as expensive and they keep raising the price of energy\n[laughter] you know my water bill's gone up you know like fifty percent of the last four or five years\nSo it's a broken society nothing's working and it's getting worse\nIt's nothing but it could be a better manage just put it that way\nWell who's doing the managing it is a military a democratically elected it doesn't matter and Honduras\nWell the president was actually reelected the second time but a lot of people thought he stole the election that's why there's a lot of writing the streets and that's why they had these strikes you know but that's all kind of I don't know\nWhat the problem is you know they keep raising the prices of everything [noise] so if you're if you're stuck down there and you're not you don't have a job where you can be tied into Dallas so to speak you know things keep getting out of sight it's just like that as well\nNo that is well jeez but it's the whole thing with inflation and try to keep up with stuff\nToys there's about a thirty eight forty million people who live in Guatemala Honduras El Salvador Nicaragua about thirty five to forty million how many would come to America given a choice in the Democrats got in charge and a complete open borders how many would come\nBy privacy mall [laughter] all of them [laughter] forty million right that would come [noise]\nBut you know it's it's funny because there's also a lot of there's a lot of a love for American hunter stores like however stores you'll see the American flag you'll sit on the wall she lays there so there had attack that was even that does is getting off the site or a little bit I was thinking it would be good to be kinder as the fifty first date of\nYou know like oh my God [laughter] and the reason why is because\nPeople if we if we could come and run their country and give it a lot of it it would people would jump to that and they would be more patriotic\nAnd you didn't have a gym thank you but here's some fact during the violent death rate in Honduras is Ninety five per one hundred thousand\nNine of the ten most violent countries on earth or south a U.S border sixteen the twenty most violent or sell U.S born on the other four are small countries in Africa so we're ... we're taking in large numbers of immigrants from those violent places on

who briefly block them\nThey're getting help but every term from sympathetic Mexicans offering food water and clothing the coverage of our media indicates that they're joining it up against the Trump stir Armenia believes that somehow that this event with tens of thousands\nOf individuals coming from those violent countries on earth is a net negative for the president I Do not believe that\nI think the main reason that Trump won the presidency and twenty sixteen and that Republicans will keep the house in one to keep the house and the Senate in about two weeks will be the fact that this immigration issue is you want to remind Americans what's at stake in this election\nThe courts can look at that legislation again and say wait a minute you've gone too far the Congress did not give you the authority to make this rule\nAnd there are a number of examples in the book where you can see that the that the agency has gone well beyond what Congress actually authorize so\nIf the court is willing to step in and take those steps and that's what fortitude is necessary that's why the book is called the digital forward it to they have to have the strength\nOf character that go in and make these decisions that will turn down regulations of um of administrative agencies then we can actually began to reduce the amount of regulation and the rules have come out of Washington\nPeter Wallison let's go back in time does not hot summer in Philadelphia and Seventeen Ninety seven article one they said the founding fathers said and we believe that\nThe Congress the house in the Senate or the most powerful instrument talent is a government because of the best reflects the will of the people\nIn reality at least for the past fifty years it was perceived Congress is number one\nIt was received the president's number two and they and the court system is number three in reality number one is not the Congress one might say it's the presidency is the most powerful number two is the current number three is the Congress the Congress\nIs feckless foolish any relevant and and so what were the founding fathers day if they were transported from Seventeen eighty seven to twenty Eighteen and October twenty Eighteen and they looked at the situation today when that Congress is foolish and cyclists\nI think they would be amazed amazed but when they studied it for a while I think they would understand why this happened and I think the reason is that the courts have given administrative agencies not the president actually it's administrative agency which even the president doesn't control they'd given administrative agencies\nSo much authority by passing laws that are very very general better set of goals oriented laws\nAnd that gives the agency's tremendous authority to make the major decisions that they should not be making Congress should make the major decisions the agencies should only be filling in\nThe details and owned unfortunately overtime because Congress has because the courts have not stepped in to stop this Congress has been encouraged to pass these very general laws\nThen they go home to their constituents and they say you see I solve this problem for you and when the constituents complains about some new regulation that's come out the congressman says oh well I didn't vote for that\nThat's the administrative agency and what the what the constituent unfortunately doesn't recognize is that the congressman has to take responsibility has to be accountable for that\nBecause the Congress men did not vote for legislation that restricted the independent agency in what it was able or what it was able to produce\nThe laws with just two general and what will happen now if the court access I Hope they will ask you\nIs that they will begin to look carefully at the underlying statutes and say this you did not have this authority you know you are not given this authority by Congress so you cannot make this rule that goes beyond what Congress intended\nOf course one of the things came up during the um\nAnd this authority by Congress so you cannot make this rule that goes beyond what Congress intended\nAnd of course one of the things came up during the um during the hearings and the confirmation of Brett Kavanaugh a couple of weeks ago was the fact\nThat uh the United States Congress is exceedingly weak and that really are because they're so weak the liberals to progressives want to use the court system do impose like legislation\nOn we the American people because they're so unpopular whether it's gay marriage or abortion or whether it's immigration whatever it is there are certain things that are so unpopular in America and the Congress or foolish in fact close therefore they look toward the court system to be a second legislature\nAnd that was never intended by anybody in fact one might argue to go back to your original point the administrative state is more powerful than the United States Congress and might be more powerful the most powerful branch of government is ... is the administrative state\nSome called the deep state that have been in existence for years if not decades and what they want to do is simply outlast as president and outlast the court and continue to exist so it is the administrator state right now more powerful than the Congress\nYeah I think undoubtedly it is it is making the rules that uh we live under and Congress was supposed to do that and there is a way to address that as I say and I think it's the courts where to step in on\nA read the statute as they were written by Congress they would be able to say to administrative agencies you have gone too far and to the extent that they do that\nWe have some control over the administrative agencies and the effect that will be\nTwo course Congress to begin to act\nBecause if what the administrative agency has done is something that the American people would like and the courts have said no you weren't given that authority by Congress the American people will then go to Congress and say we want legislation that does this\nOr if it's something they didn't like then Congress won't be pressured and the agencies will will not be able to make the rule anyway but the point is we are a democracy and in a democracy the people's views should prevail\nAnd that's not what's happening in the under the current law system\nAnd give me an example for four or five years ago Obama was saying look\nI'm the president I'm not the grand potent tantamount the dictator I cannot give dreamers certain rights to be in this country because the laws against it but by the time a president or run away president in my view Obama was a runaway president when it came to legal immigration\nAnd it just created new laws out of a ... that had nothing to do with the Congress have all the time that gets up to the United States Supreme court it takes one to three years even get there\nAnd in the meantime the dreamers have done with the dreamers are going to do\nAnd you may like or dislike what Obama is doing but at the president is set that through the ice or ins the president can do anything you want why why can't the next president do anything he wants in other words it into some sense it's the rule making ability of the administrators state\nThat ... that have been they've usurped the power that Congress\nYeah well you're you're correct as long as the courts and I'm here speaking principally the Supreme Court does not act one is is Supreme Court lays down the rules you know um that says\nThis is the we are going to be reading statutes as they were written a then it gives all kinds of people who are who would like to challenge administrative rules or even presidential decisions an opportunity to go right into the district court and get it\nWho are who would like to challenge administrative rules or even presidential decisions an opportunity to go right into the district court and get a ruling and what we've seen in the last year\nMany times is district courts have been making rulings against the Trump Administration and the reason they're able to do that is that the Supreme Court has not has not\nPlaced any kinds of strict limitations on what the courts can do in fact what the what the Supreme Court has done in this so called Chevron case the central he said to the to the courts you should defer to what\nThe administrative agency and interpreting their own law yeah\nAnd that of course has given them license to do whatever they want\nYou know it has to stop I took home your book last night to read a ... page Ninety four\nNow you have a chart beginning in Nineteen Ninety three which was not a long time ago on may twenty five years Clinton was in the White House doing what Clinton did in the White House but in Nineteen Ninety three there were four thousand three hundred and sixty nine or rules forties ... rules which you know\nNow is a lot well and twenty Seventeen\nThe cumulative final rules published in the federal register\nAs a hundred and one thousand three hundred and eighty so we go from forty three hundred under Clinton do one hundred and one thousand three hundred and eighty and its accelerating at the rate at three to four thousand new rules every year and by the time another ten years go by it'll be two hundred thousand rules\nAre well that's entirely possible the way things are going right now of course the hundred thousand a hundred and one thousand is cumulative number since ... since Nineteen Ninety three right um but yes it will continue to go on three thousand four thousand rules in any year\nBecause there is no discipline on the agencies right now because of this Chevron decision will Nineteen eighty four and because there isn't any a ruling from the Supreme Court and it says Congress cannot pass to the agencies its own legislative power that's a violation of the separation out\nOf power in our country I Want to share of the American people on on the thought on page Ninety five you say one recent study found\nThat the cumulative cost of regulations between Nineteen eighty and twenty twelve which is what a a thirty two year period reduced American economic growth by over twenty five percent\nWhich amounts to annually Thirteen thousand per person in America annually and so this is gigantic it's huge it's growing and the only entity that can really stop it\nAnd the president can't stop it that Congress could stop it but they're fools and feckless individuals the only entity in the world that can stop it is not a state Supreme Court", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Bill Cunningham", "city": "Charlottesville", "day": "22"}
