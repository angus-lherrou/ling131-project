whether they are going to do it\nLet's continue with more coming up next to this my interview with the president then at the top of the last our way of Bill O'Reilly O'Reilly factor is on tonight also in about an hour or so we have\nWe were unable to make and I said we're going to tax you cars coming in and then what happened and they made a deal they made a deal they made a deal and it's a deal that we're very happy with I Hope they're very happy with I Hope everybody is but it's a fair deal for us and\nWe have now we just need to deal with South Korea which is fabulous as much a a much improved approved deals you know improved I Will say that Hillary Clinton do you remember she made that deal and she said it's two hundred and fifty thousand jobs and she was right for South Korea so they got two hundred and fifty we didn't get two hundred and fifty\nIt was a terrible deal so essentially we terminated that deal and we made a new deal with south where so\nMany jobs and talking to my Everytime I cannot Mexico are we talking about a million\nWas you're talking about millions of jobs potential don't forget we've opened up countries that were just totally close to it if you look at Canada we couldn't sell our dairy products out there and if we did it was a three hundred percent tariff people don't talk about that you know if I put on a ten percent or twenty percent Arab they make a big deal if they have three hundred\nActually three hundred percent two hundred and Seventy five percent two hundred and eighty five percent these are the terrorists they charge so essentially that's a wall because if you have to pay a tariff like that you can't sell the product is so expensive so we've opened up Canada and we have a very good relationship now I think they respect us more than they did before\nBut now at least it's fair in our farmers are in love with it you see what's going on it's beautiful now we're working on China and we're working on the European Union which of absolutely taken advantage of our country is the European Union has been brutal and the way they took advantage of the United states for many years\nI mean they were formed to take advantage of the United states that was a reason they were formed how can we\nHow can we take from the United states\nSo the European Union they formed and they they're very unfair to us they have barriers where we can't sell into their into into their countries\nThey have tremendous tariffs that make it impossible\nAnd yet they show Mercedes Benz and BMWs by the millions they come in during the Indians and we charge him essentially no tax it's two and a half percent but for the most part they don't even not elected\nSo we charge them virtually nothing and they send millions and millions of cars if we want to send a a piece of grain okay we want to send a piece of grain we can't do it and to the European Union so it's unfair uh we met with them I told them I'm going to start\nTaxing your cars because Obama they wouldn't even talk to them right they said we're very happy the way we are and that's that was that Obama just went away and then a with us I said look we want to talk I didn't hear from them I said we want to talk I didn't hear third time I said listen we're not call me back but\nI'm going to give you one more chance and he said that's okay I'm going to actually cars at twenty five percent coming in which is frankly more money right it's devastating to them but it's more money and they immediately helped in a plane and came over and talk to and now they want to make a deal I I don't know that we're going to make a deal with them I can tell you they want to sure but we're going to make it one way or the ...\nWe've got all the way of five hundred million a year five trillion over ten we've built Shanghai we felt Beijing at some point we've got to start building America they got the new airport we don't have the new airport they got the new bridges we don't have the bridges at some point in our money's gonna come back to America\nYou're so right so China's been taken out five hundred billion dollars you people have no idea what that is five hundred billion we have rebuilt China can't do it and I have a very good relationship with President Xi but instead we can't do it very simple we can't do it anymore we're not going to do it anymore\nSo we've put on two hundred and fifty billion dollars worth of tariffs\nAnd by the way there's been no impact has been in effect what people don't say is that we're taking in billions of dollars in our treasury because at twenty five percent\nSo we're taking billions of dollars and we have we're going to create jobs now some of these things that we're not buying from China or they become expensive because of the terrorists they're going to start building these plants here to make the product here which is the old fashioned way that's the way we used to do it so China\nHas been look China is the biggest of them all by far it's probably sixty percent of our trade lost we lost\nOver the last few years an average of eight hundred billion dollars a year on trade we lose with everybody those days are over bill\nNow Wesley wherever the midterms coming up one of my favorite movies is Jimmy Stewart it's a wonderful life I look at Bedford Falls\nBelow Sea Tac the house Schumer text the Senate your life

nights ago he was in my hometown erupt Cincinnati and he got a hold of me on a on four or five days at a time and that's about ... available to stop it and say hello when he's in town\nWhen the president ask you to do something especially one who is this charismatic as consequential as President Trump forty five actually have no problem doing that some things scheduled brought in and I said to heck with it\nI Want to be with the president and he's a warm caring engaging person the way way works the rope line are private time together our discussion was fabulous and a and I'm going to share that interview with you here coming up in about five or six minutes\nAnd I think you're going to find it very good because you get you're going to get a sense of the man and what he what lies ahead what the interview today I think are tonight on sixty minutes I thought was ridiculous Leslie stall did a horrible lousy job I think my time with the president a couple of nights ago was much better\nBecause if you have to pay a tariff like that you can't sell the product is so expensive so we've opened up Canada and we have a very good relationship now I think they respect us more than they did before\nBut now at least it's fair in our farmers are in love with it you see what's going on it's beautiful now we're working on China and we're working on the European Union which of absolutely taken advantage of our country is the European Union has been brutal and the way they took advantage of the United states for many years\nI mean they were formed to take advantage of the United states that was a reason they were formed how can we\nHow can we take from the United states\nSo the European Union they formed and they have their very unfair to us they have barriers where we can't sell into their into into their countries\nThey have a tremendous tariffs that make it impossible and yet they still Mercedes Benz and BMWs by the millions they come in there and Indians and we charge him essentially no tax it's two and a half percent but for the most part they don't even I liked it\nSo we charge them virtually nothing and they send millions and millions of cars if we want to send a a piece of grain okay we want to send a piece of grain we can't do it and to the European Union so it's unfair uh we met with them I told them I'm going to start\nTaxing your cars because Obama they wouldn't even talk to them right they said we're very happy the way we are and that's that was that Obama just went away and then a with us I said look we want to talk I didn't hear from I said we want to talk I didn't hear third time I said listen we're not only call me back but\nI'm going to give you one more chance and said that's okay I'm going to tax the cars at twenty five percent coming in which is frankly more money right it's devastating to them but it's more money and they immediately helped in a plane and came over and talk to and now they want to make a deal I I don't know that we're going to make a deal with them I can tell you they want to sure but we're going to make it one way or the ...\nWe built a sign of way of under ... billion a year five trillion over ten we filled Shanghai we built Beijing at some point we're going to start building America they got the new airport we don't have the new airports they got the new bridges we don't have the bridges at some point our money's got to come back to America\nYou're so right so China's been taken out five hundred billion dollars you know people have no idea what that is five hundred billion we have rebuilt China can't do it and I have a very good relationship with President she said we can't do it very simple we can't do it anymore we're not going to do it anymore\nSo we've got put on two hundred and fifty billion dollars worth of tariffs\nAnd by the way there's been no impact has been about fact not what people do say is that we're taking in billions of dollars in our treasury because it said twenty five percent\nSo we're taking and billions of dollars and we have we're going to create jobs now some of these things that we're not buying from China or they become expensive because of the terrorists they're going to start building these plants here to make the product here which is the old fashioned way that's the way we used to do it\nSo China has been look China is the biggest ... by far it's probably sixty percent of our trade lost we lost\nOver the last few years an average of eight hundred billion dollars a year on trade we lose with everybody those days are over bill\nNow Leslie wherever the midterms coming up one of my favorite movies is Jimmy Stewart it's a wonderful life\nI look at Bedford Falls below sea takes the house Schumer text the Senate your life becomes miserable the last two years what do you say the middle class Americans all over the country that say you know what\nWe don't want Bedford Falls the way it looks we want the New Bedford falls what do you say to those who say the mid term relax take it easy not important Renee see whether it's black burner Heller we don't\nAnd what Bedford Falls the way it looks we want the New Bedford falls what do you say to those who say the mid term relax take it easy not important Renee see whether it's black burner Heller we don't have to worry about that what do you say to motivate the base\nWell I Hope we're nation is going to do well first of all he's a great guy but I I just say just country what just forget it cut your way you have to go out and vote my poll numbers are so good but a lot of people say I'm not running so we're not going to get me one percent Rasmussen ... we know we're doing great and and then they say you can add a lot to it\nBecause we're people hang up and they say we don't want to talk to you that means it's a Trump voter I don't know if that's good or bad but that's what it means a we have to\nDo well I Will say I think we're going to do very well on the Senate and a lot of things have happened since justice now justice Kavanaugh Fifteen Fifteen to judge many many judges\nAnd we're going to have a hundred and forty five judges fairly soon when you think about it I mean a hundred and forty five and it'll be close to fifty percent of the whole judiciary not only to Supreme Court justices so\nBut that was a very big thing happened over the last couple of weeks with justice cabin or because\nI've rarely seen a person treated so badly the men are great distinction a great life and the way they treated him was horrible and since that happened Republicans are looking so is everybody they see what's going\nOn under the law of unintended consequences because since I've been many women were spurred my air you know bill I'm with Kevin ... they don't want to say publicly but if you send in a weird sense Kevin all as motivated the Republican face from otherwise it wouldn't have happened\nAnd you've been a great friend of mine and I appreciate it you've been a very terrific guy and so you're also a terrific talent you know a lot of people can't do what you do you know this is talk relatives Russian about uh that's not too many and Sean is you know showing us great but these are great people great talents\nAnd I appreciate it do we have to do well I think we're going to do well in the Senate I think we could pick up some seats in the Senate and the polls\nIf you look three weeks ago and you look now\nIt's like especially when it's ... well she was she was nine points down now she has four or five points up Marcia from Tennessee that almost all of them\nNow I don't know how you doing here I Know it's a tough race but uh it's unfortunate because he's such a good\nMan I mean I don't know Sherrod Brown says socialist but you know he sees a lot of Trump voters are voting for shared with his he's going around in a lot of people think he's my best friend in the world the ads are like Trump pads he talks about you know it's amazing except there's only during this period of time out six weeks\nAfter it's over so it's one of those things but I Hope it does well and uh I Hope that Steve does well I think he's doing well for example to when I hear is doing so I think that's very important and I'm here for him\nBut I just want to thank you for everything you've done and and hopefully people are going to realize that this is a very important election midterms I think frankly I think people are viewing this is very important you know usually midterms are like sleepers yeah people they are energized and for those that say that the\nThat the blue is energized bringing the Democrats and we're not ... I think personally I think we're more energized\nCc Lebanon they lined up yesterday morning I see there's twenty thousand trying to get into two thousand yeah it's a problem with the size of the right way to see what happens if you're not going to believe the energy\nBut we had it in Erie, Pennsylvania the other night with twenty five thousand people outside of a twelve thousand arena it's been amazing and if that kind of you know action shows up in three weeks and you imagine it's just a little more than three\nWe got the energy for the next three weeks because you're like Elvis a law and that Nineteen sixty eight yeah I Know it's a good old and I've got three more weeks I Love the other three weeks and while I\nHave twenty five days and twenty five days I'm Out campaigning for many of those days I Do all of them but you could only move there speaking of corporate so often rock cafe and Secret Service and all of that but\nIf I'm Out campaigning for many of those days I Do all of them\nBut you could only move this big equipment so often rock cafe and Secret Service and all of that\nBut they were very very busy and we're going to the races that are close we're slightly ahead or slightly behind and we'll make it a lot of steps and just when we're doing is the the should win yeah he'll he's really good and he should win but uh I Will be very upset if he tested but I think he's going to\nAs the president you're the best you're a great American idol they're that all the time you know you're a great America keep doing what you're doing for the voices you don't hear in the face as you don't see you're going to see a few and have an hour or so but those people you're the hero I was with Reagan an eighty four when he came here I thought Reagan was the star\nHe was the Rolling Stones or the Vidocq Society you're on the Ed Sullivan show I'm Serious about this\nWhat I really do appreciate your support such an important voice and you've been with us and uh\nYou know just say hello to all you have like a lot of um you're a great America thank you thank you very much for thinking\nLet's continue with more built counting the great American live with you every Sunday night\n[noise]\n\nWhat happened you used to go hours without visiting the bathroom\nNow it seems like you're constantly getting up to ... and you're even getting up at night to go this is not okay listen the makers of super ... to ... the number one prostate formula are introducing a new one pill super ... prostate piece three advanced\nWith three key ingredients that are great for your prostate if like picking three prostate supplements and want to celebrate we're sending free bottles to men who want to cut down on bathroom trips yes your first thirty days supply is free\nPay shipping and handling just dial hounded two fifty on your mobile phone and say the key word empty\nEarly research suggests that an ingredient in ... three advanced may help support an normal prostate sauce combine that with a production and urges to pay and you have a formula you'd be crazy not to try try ... free\nDial pound to fifty on your mobile phone and say the key word empty again dial pound to five zero and say the key word empty\nAre you considering a safe to secure your valuables or firearms let's face it shapes are not very attractive they usually end up getting stuck in the garage or in a closet\nWouldn't it be great if there was a safe that had to look up a beautiful antique so you could display it in your living space as an air a little while also having easy access to it while there is check out the rhino iron works shape at rhino safe dot com\nAmerican Made an antique styled our Shapes Our part art part furniture and all security\nAnd if you're like the classic look of our rhino fireworks apes we also feature beautiful matching tool chess and furniture with hundreds of thousands of satisfied customers and a huge network", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Bill Cunningham", "city": "Charlottesville", "day": "15"}
