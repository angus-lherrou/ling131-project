I saw the identity would change as well because\nYou know they were more threes we'd make more threes up and down to it but we haven't seen that yet so I think the identity that this team wanted to have we're not seeing it and I'm Still going to say there's a chance to get it but they got to start doing it\nYou know I mean you know yeah that's that's my reading on this and they've got to get better chip that's all I mean you ... you want to change your identity you know bring it you want to change your ... you know move the ball around you know diversify your office of sets right now they're predictable\nYou know and then the NBA when your predictable you you you you know teams will stop you\nSyria they'll stop you very they know what's going to go to John to the pound the ball and go to the basket and is going to be fifty guys waiting at the room for him\nAnd I just think really Glenn that's why and and we know Dwight Howard is not the player that he was eight nine years ago but he still can\nAnd I just think really Glenn that's why\nAnd and we know Dwight Howard is not the player that he was eight nine years ago but he still can block shot you know he's still can clear the glass as good as anybody in the league and the fact that you're going to have a ring protect during their right you know you're not going to have these guys just driving down the ... and just finger rolling the ball over the top of the of the front of the room for easy laying\nOn agree I agree ... chip thanks for the call buddy hang in there with us man we we care ...\n... of course I'm gonna try to make it out to a game again this year like I did last year\nWell if you do you need to come and say hey okay All right good men good man All right when we come back we'll take more of your calls eight seven seven three six nine three three three wizards\nLose a boy they later tonight that got barbecue by the clippers one thirty six one for 'em blend concert mark for a real good dino joined us and Brian is with us give us a show it's seven seven three six nine three three three this is the Budweiser post game show on the WTO Washington Wizards radio network\n[noise]\nWe're here with Doug dancey advancing swimming heating and air conditioning Doug good to have you back follows here what should our listeners be doing\nIt once it rained finally stopped the customs should be thinking about getting a tree in the summer as soon as he bumps guys pharmacy service for the wintertime 'cause we're still struggling with a unify working Carson's a great time still do the changes we have plenty of time now and it's a great time you don't need anything good food when I moved here and there are some incidents something's\nIn our listeners should know about the I so they can get in ... up to five hundred dollars in this counseling qualifying a Muslim Americans saying also on mine every one of the last person to do all that smokes muscles I'll come out in the U.S what you have the less the termination\nWhat you need to fix your age we see brown and dancing plenty heating there's been around since we've been ...

independent American standard heating and air conditioning dealer for details\nYou really like around people and you're not my identity our dog he's quite the part about counting getting a lot of the

to you by Matisse let the humane society and the United states and the ad council\nAs a quick little spur of the wizards ... doing a lot of ... and to find that first aggression\nAnd so you hear a Jeff Greene within the game they're not because as mentioned earlier in the first half Markey more it would take an elbow in the face from the new law gallon Ari an exit the game with concussion like symptoms but they got some nights contributions from Jeff Greene in that third quarter looked like the wizard might be able to buy back\nInto it or they would get it down here in eighty one Seventy one but then the corporate broken open\nWash it across Centre Court [noise] defended by Gish Alexander crosses over on\n[noise] do\nLots of are so far as your office they're not easy to do their job some in downtown unable to the basket and ... everybody sitting back watching [noise]\nAnd [noise] you know in that case that it's just a great job of playing refund any and helping out the guards\nAnd that's been the story early on in the season for the wizards when they have all the struggles it's because the authentic going stagnant a lot of one on one a lot of ... a lot of one passing a shock goes up\nSort of like Bradley beyond when John while we're talking about after the game friday night a lot of guys look like they're looking for their own shots and only really worrying about their own shot unfortunately John and Brad also or contributors to that and when things are going downhill\nIt seemed like they take it upon themselves more and more to good play one on one or two very\nLittle effect didn't it then later on in the third quarter it would\nPatrick Beverley [noise] not really known as a three point shooter\nThree little effectiveness and later on in the third quarter here which\nPatrick Beverley [noise] not really known as the three point shooters painting from three gallon Ari [noise]\nAll the clothes\nUnfortunately but at this point it out there I said let us use a free agent three in a row well why do you say that say I don't know\n... dino filling in for Dave Johnson the night I don't know why you bring in such good luck for the clippers who might have to have an investigation into who died he was on tonight that smart\nDid a great job I had a lot of fun with them but in the end they didn't have too much money they would go on to lose one thirty six one oh poor on a night where defense apparently was not their main objective or one thirty six points for the clippers\nNine clippers sport in double figures led by the by a terrorist is twenty two points in a lemon rebound\nClippers shot beep beep four percent is a teen attempted hundred in three field goals\nAnd insanely high numbers game was up and down the whole time which is on the other hand shot forty percent for the game in under twenty percent from three five or twenty seven\nBy the clippers wearing it sounding fifty five percent from three sixty I'm twenty nine we talked about the little ball movement for the wizards yeah they only had a scene of the fourteen turnovers\nWhile the clippers thirty five to support the turnover nothing to be a real good about if you're the wizard nothing to feel real good about if you're Scott broke so let's hear what he had to say after the last Sunday to the clippers\nJust just to go back and change things out 'cause the fatigue were quite so hard to get back into it\nBecause just knowing that we're going to have a play guys throughout the day\nIt started as secular order\n...\nI've got to we've got we've got to just play better regardless of what a lot of south there uh\nWe got about Sanders out there no matter what livelihood out here and we have to take a guy that are\nSet a prize of how we defend America's consistent approach to the defense of them\n\nThat we're all busters\nAnd things\nOf that we're all ... about saying together\nWe've all been in a situation nobody is saying on the team that you've never had a house or or bad stretching the season\nI Know how they pay a lot of time\nIf it's not a long season all we know where we all know how to marathon in this way and you have thrilled approach in and say what the ups and downs syndrome that image out in an airplane for one another and we've got to figure that out how we can do that do that better be communists\nFor him with the help for three years we've had um stresses either that\nOr we're going to have stretches and the teacher has helped me the basketball team you just gotta stay together and our guys well you've got to tell her to make three\nThe three is a ... or or way I'm\nEarly in the season there's no question but it's a\nNight it was it about making making three there's about stopping the ball and and getting the getting pizza stops consistently that we started out to a game of intensity\nIs it about making ... about solving the ball and getting these us off in the system we do we started out the game was intensity on the defensive in and then we let it get away with a narrow in the second quarter and then we go to the tin\nOr his advisors three over yard and then after a couple or three\nTwenty one at that time\nAnd that's what Scott Brooke sad to say after Sunday's one thirty six uh one oh four last of the clippers and you know I\nI don't really know what to say other than you know you heard the champ call into the post game show a you heard what he had to say he doesn't really know what this team's identity is and at this point in time the way I see the way they play the game like Sunday's game against the clippers\nQuite frankly it looks like they should have taken the teen name off at the front of the Jersey and put the ball player names on the front of the Jersey because for a lot of the night it looked like five individuals on the court together it didn't look like a cohesive team and until they figure out who they are as a team\nThe things they need to do as a team to play well and be the best version of themselves they are what they look like right now which is the one in five basketball team and you don't want to be that team\nGoing forward or this is a team that has aspirations of not just making the playoffs but making a run in the playoffs will the team that we've seen so far this season is nowhere close to reaching that goal so they have to turn it around to stay in Memphis\nI Will hear a little bit more reaction from the locker room injustice second wizards lose one thirty six to one oh four to the LA Clippers in staple center we'll be right back on the

the first half finished with Eighteen on the night\nI'll put it can't feel good considering they got throttle the game tonight one thirty six one oh four of the least competitive this outfit his look so far on the young seizing the wizards are now one in five it's early in the season they dug holes before and come out of them just fine but you don't like to take such a whole early in the season\nPushing their baby strollers and then the ... you\nKnow they make the mistake of up panning the crowd and showing the visual and I've seen pictures of people handing out money to these folks I've seen trays of hot meals being handed I've seen medical supplies\nAnd so on they are you know trying to uh I think\nThat you know how the Mariel boatlift and not only destabilized South Florida but it ended up leading probably to a Jimmy Carter's a election down fall and the following election although Jimmy Carter help that out quite a bit himself\nI think that that this is an attempt by leftist government and perhaps some of the open borders advocates around the world to destabilize the United states and to embarrass Donald Trump right before the most important mid term election of his lifetime\nI think it's embarrassing him because on balance\nBecause it was going politically against the Democrats all of a sudden a bomb scares the bomb threats began as if now the media doesn't deal at all with the migration that look so bad and according to CBS News about eighty percent\nOf the so called a migrants are young males between the age of Fifteen and thirty it's impressive offer a woman with a baby to walk two thousand miles through jungles in the heat and sand in deserts that ain't gonna happen somebody's organizing on this much like the boat live from Juba there are a leftist politicians who hate Trump\nAnd want to destroy America and they want to flood the southern border\nRight now there's Fifteen and twenty thousand one hundred Fifteen or twenty million ...\nWell you know there are a forty one million people in Central America and I bet a good deal of them have\nTheir eyes on what's happening here and how we handle it the problem is that we have gaping loopholes in our asylum laws and if anyone in this care of and no matter what even if they said on national television ten times that\nThey're coming here for a job as you've heard people say all I Want is a job in Los Angeles when they put one toe in the United states they say the words political asylum and they are in like Flynn\nThey are here they are going to be released into the country and they're going to be on a backlog of probably as long as three to four years never showing up for their cases eighty percent of these folks who exploited the asylum loopholes never show up for their cases and simply disappear into the United states\nThis is a gimmick they're using our own policies twice this year the Republican Congress has tried to close these loopholes and they have not had a single democratic vote to uh to do so and you ask ask yourself why who really benefits in the long run for Massey\nIllegal immigration ... when you look at studies of immigrants as they become citizens and how they vote sixty five percent of them end up registering his Democratic\nColleagues I forgot to government assistance\nThey all yeah I mean and you're barely making it you're going to vote for the party that and you the most goodies and uh you know twenty five percent a vote Republican but if you think about you know twelve million illegal aliens a sixty five percent of them would end up becoming citizens and voting Democrat that would\nThat would that have thrown every American election to the Democrats in the last Twenty years and everyone for probably the next forty\n... and the other issue you read and democratic literature is that if and when Texas flips through the Democratic party and becomes a deep blue state the way the politics will be fashion for the next twenty to fifty years there'll be no chance for Republican ever to win the presidency again\nTaxes as a blue state and you might throw in Florida because California for most of it\nThere'll be no chance for a Republican ever to win the presidency again taxes as a blue state and you might throw in Florida because California for most of its history was a deep red state run them re gray haired it easily Nixon carried raised like California\nFlip it goes up a legal migration Terry who says the next target Texas flips and it's over but David re a fair here here's a question Trump is talking in the way I Would like him to talk he's normal he reflects mid western values conservative values\nHe's saying the army or the national guard will not let them crossed in America how do you physically stop maybe twenty or thirty thousand people in mass from getting one whole into American soil then claiming political refugee status how\nPhysically we're not going to shoot them there's well ... how do you actually stop ...\n... that's the million dollar question without going into Mexico because I really think\nThat that is the question and I don't know that anybody has the answer to that I'll tell you how you would stop them if it existed Trump's border wall if you had a border wall there they wouldn't be walking in the United states except through legal ports of entry or they would have to walk\nWay out into the desert in Arizona or to come over that's why we need the border wall and some of these heavy crossing points but that's all it takes is one ... in the United states and we're done and you\nAnd you're done and orange on the long list oh yeah and all we need to do is and so fair has called for called we believe this is the beginning of a national emergency just like the Mariel boatlift was we've asked that Congress the president calls Congress back\nTo Washington this week to close these asylum loopholes if we could close these asylum loophole or if we could\nPut asylum courts with detention centers right on the border so as they came over to ask for political asylum they had their hearing and they were immediately sent home because\nNinety nine percent of these folks would not qualify ... for political asylum their economic migrants than we would have in the end of this nonsense\nWe can't get those loopholes closed nap if Congress failed twice you're going to we think they should come back and close these loopholes anything short of that\nAnd and it's kind of the ah you know a cat and mouse game we have to try to keep them from getting in the United\nThe owners are probably very for it takes ten Democrats the United States Senate to move legislation\nRight now there's fifty one there might be fifty four fifty five after the election whatever the number is unique numerous Democrats to switch party line vote with the Republicans in order to say that much like Mexicans of Mexicans come here and they get one foot in the taxes they're thrown back immediately in Mexico and you're done\nWe every loophole when the law that says your group from Central America Asia Africa\nAnd you're making do America no matter how you get her legally or illegally\nAnd you claim refugee status for political purposes\nBut then you begin and the hearing process that takes three to ten years so unless the Democrats agree to do this no changing the law will happen I mean Trump God Bless him I Love him he can tell Tom Foley ones but you cannot stop twenty thousand\nPeople or twenty million people from flooding our southern border from Central America claiming refugee status they have no shots they have no medical Clarence them no financial support\nThey have no work shows that we need most interested in a third grade education and there's nothing we can do to stop them unless the Democratic party agrees and what makes you think they're ever going to agree\nI mean at some point maybe they're going to put the national interest to their own political interests me is that my pipe dream\nYou think they're ever going to agree\nWell I mean at some point maybe they're going to put the national interest to their own political interests is that my pipe dream yeah\nNo it won't happen\nNow that's why I feel bad I feel terrible yeah\nYeah I mean the president really is extremely limited in what he can do in his best bet is to try to get the Mexican to stop them in Mexico because once they get to the U.S border they're going to walk you know five miles outside of the port of entry and they're going to step right over a fence and they're going to be in the United states hoping that\nThey get apprehended in fact if they see the border patrol they'll run towards them to ask for political asylum and then it's all over and until we get these detention facilities on the border with these asylum courts as we did in the late Nineteen nineties when Central Americans were pulling this\nA stick with us too we get that back\nIn turn these cases around and get these asylum loopholes or a close we are going to be stuck with this mass\nWell I I I don't know I'm filled with hope all the time but I yeah I lost\nMexico says to the Trump bring the United States Army one or two or three miles into Mexico and politically that would be the death knell of the Mexican president if he allowed American Soldiers on the Mexican territory that ain't gonna happen and the thing is not going to happen is the Mexican president was elected\nAnd I just recently under an open borders policy and what she wants free flow of information I don't know what we can do other than bitch complain and moan\nAt the end of the day the Democrats aren't going to agree to this and so unless they get\nHammered at the at the ballot box Nancy plus it goes down hard a week from Tuesday and the Democrats get hurt in the Senate ... ... ... we don't need we need about ten Democrats\nUnited States senators to give the same treatment as Central Americans that we get the Mexican which means er here illegally immediately sent back you'll have to go through a hearing process the liberal activists attorneys are there are the news media is their Kamala Harris and all the rest are just loving this\nAnd the goal David raid there thinking strategically is make Texas a deep blue state and if that happens the Republicans are do you in and done\nWell you know it it's a great political strategy if you're a Democrat because they're scaring Americans away left and right so you're only option left his to import future citizens and they are going to do that from central in Latin America and\nYou know perhaps that explains why they're sitting on their hands while we have ... of tens of thousands of people coming towards our southern border this ... of of actually be stopped\nBy Congress until then Trump can build his wall he can uh put up a the types of a deterrent that we have on the border to house families together",
