say All right let's take the time the Democrats might be very happy about that frankly because you know the longer they can drag this out the worse it probably is for for Brett Kavanaugh\nMeanwhile

Kavanaugh and uh I mentioned earlier tonight that every now and then I check in with Fox which I think to an extent may have lost its way and I'm Chris\nWallace the ah the store I guess the object to star Sunday Morning said quote for testimony is extremely emotional extremely Ron extremely credible no one could listen her delivery and those words without believing her talking about these so this is a disaster for the Republicans\nAre genuine Apollo telling them said quote I think Dr Ford is exceptionally credible go rogue\nKarl Rove said forward is credible unbelievable\n... having listening to that I thought okay he's done then\nI watched his testimony and I said that guy you call them Jimmy Stewart I Believe that guy that's exactly how you ride would act under similar circumstances not there's so many holes\nAnd the story of Christine forward you could drive a Mack truck the middle of the room on either side and I can lay on all the hose the Jews in her story so kind of give me your take on what's going to happen later this week when the FBI gets done and what do we do with Brett Kavanaugh I think it will be a great Supreme Court justice\nYeah I mean I listen I I assume I Hope uh and I think you'll be a Supreme Court justice but I don't know because\nThe whole point of this was Jeff Flake in my opinion this was set up\nShop for like ... is the United states senator your kitchen women aren't allowed to get an elevator with the United States Senate and the Capitol building how did they get in this whole thing was a Senator Jeff flake they asked them to come in\nThat was his cover for demanding an FBI investigation [noise] you know how did those two women getting the elevator that convinced him to change his mind from a yes vote to I Want an FBI investigation and the answer is that it was set up from day one and he wanted those two women in the elevator and he wanted to use them as cover\nSo there has to be a reason they want this one week delay and of course it is either because they're going to have ten\nMore women come forward right at our claim that brick capital raped them or attempted rape them or whatever he did to them who knows what they're going to say sexually harassed them\nIs that Dianne Feinstein knew about this in July\nIf this was real how can any once it gets real when they interviewed him one on one face to face and never mentioned that there's a woman claiming you attempted to rape or they have it for the last days to see first if they might be able to beat him some other way and then this is going to be their last chance Hail Mary\nTo try to destroy and let's just go ahead and ...\nAnd and they're using the same deal they used against Clarence Thomas talking with the exact same playbook it's the same playbook they used against judge Roy Moore I mean I don't know anything about Roy Moore bill I really don't and I thought his answers were kind of ... strange and invasive and I wasn't quite sure whether I should support him but in the end I came down and the idea that this\nWas forty years ago and a bunch of women were making up stories none of which could be prove none of which had evidence and none of which had witnesses you cannot allow a man to be defeated based on that and they decided to work with judge Roy Moore let's use it with with Brett Kavanaugh it's very clear\nThat that's what this is if it was real Feinstein would've brought it up and one on one meetings with the man show can you imagine if I'm up for a major job and someone gets a letter that says oh Wayne rooted tempted to rape me and you sit across to me and you say nothing but then two months later you bring it up well that means the whole thing was a farce in the beginning\nSo look ... hairs on my column basically said\nI Am Brett Kavanaugh Brett Kavanaugh as me Brett Kavanaugh as you and if they could do it to him\nThey could do it to anyone I grew up in it all Catholic neighborhood mostly Italian part Irish I was number one in my class like red capital I was a sports star like Brett Kavanaugh I went to Columbia He went to an Ivy League school Yale we both got out of the chief great success in life and now they're trying to destroy him and I can tell you one thing\nGuys like that do raped women there's no way it doesn't happen find me a case in America where a guy who's number one in his class and it was ideally educator with the sports started a great kid has\nTons of women friends and tons of childhood friends who stand up for him and becomes a well regarded judge and suddenly you find out he was a rapist or attempted rapist or a gang rape is it's the stupidest ... ever heard I grew up with nothing but Catholic school boys and let me tell you we all like women\nBut we're all nice guys were like the date when we don't like to rape women I've never heard anything so outrageous and so stupid and my entire life show me a witness okay no problem there are none nobody saw it happen it didn't happen\nIn the name she provided indicate that she's not telling the truth the primaries burnt Kevin O's man he's a he's a he's a he's a father whose husband female friends used to do little daughters there is no credible evidence whatsoever you did any of these things\nYou did any of these things there is no truth there is no fairness and there's no evidence there is no facts but Fox News host declaring an incredible how is it possible with that record and the judge Nepal aton over Chris Wallace on Karl Rove good boy that's credible\nCredible what the hell is in is credible I Want to hear incredible\nCredible because they didn't breaker because no one tried to break her no one that single decent question I mean here's the deal if if I was a criminal awaiting trial I Would be for that woman\nRachel mentioned will come after me hey is the most competent first Alina much our life at least well I didn't maybe Diane Feinstein harder\nSome say she worked for the Democratic party for as I'm concerned\nThe only thing she did she said after the fact that there's no way I Would bring charges against them in a real courtroom well okay thank you\nMe a lawyer who would say after everything we know\nWhich is there's no witness there's no evidence of that but thirty six years ago is single lawyer or a prosecutor in the world that would actually say I would bring charges and I'll Fight just summing it ought to be in jail you up with that person in jail\nBecause God Forbid they come and get my son or my daughter you know these are horrible people they'd be willing to say something like that they don't even know what they're doing they don't even understand the law for God's sakes\nAnybody can charge anything of anybody without a shred of evidence you cannot move forward with the word of one person\nNo backup that's impossible for thirty six years ago and hospitable and so she didn't even get a lot you know showing great deal with that either a ... person if right thinking mind whenever prosecute brick capital here's a man who Lindsey Graham by the way my here yeah yeah it was fantastic\nAnd when he said that nobody starts out as Bill Cosby and then for the next forty years as I said there's no such thing that was a great point you don't start out as a rapist and then for the next forty years have a perfect impeccable records this guy's appointed more female insurance and that one person has men were to say about a\nClassic job nothing set\nHousing went out and we we got to do and a half twenty seconds when our regret for America don't come Newsmax TV and so much more and when we got to go but thanks again for coming on the bill Cunningham show\nThat this is unfair it's lies no evidence no facts it's fake is the fake news and when we ought to go and I'll be watching I'll be watching tonight in the morning\nI root for American River capital itself we for now he's our next Supreme Court nominee\nGod Bless America thank you and thank you Bye bye

hired\nTreat her as though she were a child she's a doctor and not take the opportunity to necessarily poke holes in the many stories that she had concocted she didn't like to fly a ... that we find

difficult is because she wanted to front doors Thirty years later and that's the first time the therapist took notes\nAnd the therapists notes her own therapist do not confirm her story according to

the named Brett Kavanaugh and ... different numbers of individuals is holding her so the therapist knows the ... story in fact in obstructed or story but they send it seemed to ignore that too\n[noise] why it seems like everybody on a lobster ... wants to ignore all of the holes that cannot like you said that's what I Want to withstand a court of law and any jury that would look at the testimony would not find the evidence you know I heard a lot of the feminist the missile interests I call them on the left\nI say that survivors must be believed uh well we believe that they have been

miles from the party how she got home she has a very selective memory and like I said I'm not saying something traumatic that it happened\nDinner I Believe that at some point in life at some point in her life it probably did\nCorrupt but she did not display to me like the burden them up the proof that I needed to believe that it was Dr Brett Kavanaugh and also what saved his his wife I Do believe that this father by keeping a diary a calendar of sorts\nAnd without Brett Kavanaugh's calendar it would certainly come down to jot he said she said and the Democrats want to use these weaponized sexual allegations as political tool\nI think Dr Christine for nothing more than a political pawn of the Democrat Party while they choose to ignore other women who have come forward with crab credible

credible\nWith police report Dr reports text messages and allegedly a video that that exists proving or at least giving us evidence that he allegedly emotionally and physically abused no less than two women\nAnd I'll give you another part of this or you know it's just like the dog that didn't bark she told the committee the primary impacted event occurred during the four years directly after she said she went on to struggle academically I struggled at a Chapel Hill and in college when I was Seventeen I was off to college at a very tough time\nShe skips completely her junior and senior year in high school I guarantee you\nIf there were bad grades are bad behavior by her her junior and senior in high school the to academic years after the event took place when she was Fifteen Years old that would've been a dog that barked we would have found out that she flunked out advice go that you did poorly so\nThe school that you did poorly so how is it possible that she did well in high school good enough to get into a Chapel Hill which is our school to get in to\nGet three advanced degrees including two masters and a doctorate writes sixty five books in periodicals travel all over the world to to Haiti and South America and Europe\nAnd uh in Israel and she went to a she went to Hawaii nine times\nShe seemed objectively they're very full life what she would have written Seventy five books except for this terrible event how come we've not heard about what ... what happened to her academically entered junior and senior year I submit you the reason is they didn't do it\nAnd she did quite well which is the dog that did not bark and there there was no objective indicator and why would she left the house with their best friend Leland Kaiser girlfriends still there if there was two purported attempted rapist running around drunk\nHow'd you get out of there who took her home why didn't you notify the girls the next ah the next day at the swimming club but at the country club or or the first day of class she told nobody counsellors mom and dad girlfriend she kept it secret for Thirty years then had a recovered memory\nAnd psychological services counseling session because she wanted a second front door and how is that her lawyers got away with lying\nFor ten days about her wanting to drive from California to Washington when in fact she was staying in Delaware at that time and flying all over the country why wasn't that a bigger deal because you've flat outlined\n\nWound that isn't that another example of Democrats using women as political pawns or tools and the political assassination game that's just the politics of personal destruction they want it the political theater they want it to expose her someone dead stomach exposed to she was and someone made sure that\nShe would have cameras and lights and a national audience in front of the Senate Judiciary committee that was a set up in order to try to make the old white men on the Senate Judiciary committee their own white Republican are bad\nYou know Steve King tweeted out just the other day and I say that's the old white men are relentless sleeping racially and generationally profile by the tolerant laps and air quotes tolerant\nLeftist media outlets and politicians almost universally profiled and stigmatized Republican senators\nLooks like racial profiling us back in style if you are left us for not only as an old white man that that we're going to question her but Brett Kavanaugh as an old white privilege to guide the Sacramento Bee or when he was crying that's just what white privilege looks like\nYeah so they they they\nCall it a massage or their crime Republicans massage it is an old white men and that's coming directly from the vicious violent violent laugh and missing dress\nFeminist no say that the woman that crave unanimity\nDemanded a public forty million audience to listen to her story she was never properly cross examined and uh and the questioning from the Democrats was laughable\n... and at this point uh what's gonna happen later this week do you think you're making bars of Reagan babe dot com I assume the FBI Thursday Friday was gonna give largely a clean bill of health that will not be sufficient Jeff Flake whose last name as should be an average of another ... not an now\nAh I I guess she's going to he's going to vote for unless he's pigeonholed by another Ted Cruz CBGB's screaming out I'm In an elevator God Knows what's gonna have to get all your crystal ball what happens later this week\nI'm I think it hurts ... however now that we've given the Democrats are another week or in this you know ... seven FBI investigation I've uh Brett Kavanaugh I'm sure that Michael ... or by the glory alright well up here\nWith another victim I mean right now they're probably scraping the Yale yearbooks to see what they can come up with\nBecause the truth doesn't matter to the Democrats it's simply the perception is simply the narrative and they can use their buddies and the media in order to further to the same and destroy a potentially and allegedly assume ugly innocent man\nBut they can try to ruin him in a court of public opinion because it benefits that politically\nAnd Meghan they couldn't care less about sexual assault victims they couldn't care less about Christine forward\nThat's why the league tour identity to have ...
