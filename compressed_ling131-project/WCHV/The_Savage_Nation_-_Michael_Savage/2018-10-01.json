people and quickly dispatching leads to their colleagues around the world will follow up with additional interviews\nOr verify the information you're signing onto so you can spy on an opposition party campaign\nThe lead up to that campaign remember you signed it in October\nOf twenty sixteen and then you were telling Trump before he became president in January twenty Seventeen that it was salacious

it doesn't matter to any ... ... it's about power\nThis is what America needs to understand here this is why why Hannity always talk about\nEvery two and four years racist or sexist homophobic xenophobic Islamic phobic a massage in this day and dirty air water and by the way Obama once said Republicans their plan is a dirty dirty water you know and of course we're going to throw granny over the cliff and kill children\nThat's the way Republicans are portrayed now it's their playbook but they're playbook slander\nTheir playbook is full of lives you know Republicans if you go before a predominantly black audience as they don't even want to count you in the census [noise] and I don't want to play it it they don't even want to count you in the sense is that why\nOr Republicans have you liked him in Missouri crosses that going to burn\nThey don't even want to tell you in the sense is that why or Republicans have you liked him in Missouri cross is that going to burn that's why you know we have all this identity politics look at is America better off today\nThan it was two years ago when you the American people elected Trump\nBy every measure yes and look at the trade deal that no one's going to spend any time talking about today\nAre at all which oh the president who's going to start trade wars with the rest of the world actually got a better deal for American manufacturers you know those jobs that are never coming back\nThat we now have a thirty year high of those jobs coming back CNBC Trump North American trade deal is a new dawn for the U.S auto industry\nIs is great for American farmers is great for American manufacturers it's great for our auto industry you know a lot of my conservative friends they don't say the same thing I don't like his position on trade and I'm telling you I said to them all\nYou don't know I'm like I Do everything in Donald Trump's life as an association\nIf you don't say that Canada and Mexico that you're pulling out if you don't take a strong stand to make them believe it\nYou know they walked prime minister Trudeau to the final our last night grabbing concessions so that America got much better deal than we had with NAFTA\nAnd the St nobody thought it would happen with the new president of Mexico and nobody thought that we can get NATO to step up and pay more considering we pay over Seventy cents of every dollar for defending NATO or the NATO alliance and nobody thought that our Western European allies that were barking and complaining and having an hauling that\nDonald Trump ones better trade deals with our partners nobody thought that could happen\nIf you don't say you're going to start at the start of a trade war if you don't say it and act like you mean you're not going to get concessions\nAnd the fact is no American president prior to him even dared broach the subject and meanwhile we see manufacturing jobs leaving states like Michigan Ohio Wisconsin Pennsylvania and for all the talking hatred of Donald Trump style\nThe fact that he breaks a lot of dishes to get things done and he says a lot of things to negotiate are we better off than we were two years ago are Hispanic Americans better off African Americans women in the workforce better off youth unemployment\nFourteen states unemployment low unemployment records his old records\nConsumer confidence Wall Street fight every objective discernible measure with doing better\nEnd result shouldn't matter but in thirty six days Democrats are hoping that they've created enough smoke and enough mirrors what did they do in a ears when Obama was president their policies failed on a spectacular level and if I had time to get back into it\nLet me tell you it was never going to be limited in scope this investigation ever\nIt was never going to be you know just a week or so no that's not what they want and when the FBI comes back and all they do is real from\nWhat under penalty of of a felony the four people and the professor Ford case it said either they don't remember or it didn't happen like the case of the one I witnessed she said was in the room when the alleged incident happened\nThey're not going to be happy and they're going to try and stretch out even further and ask for more investigations they've got to find one little nugget\nThat didn't happen they're not going to be happy and they're going to try and stretch out even further and ask for more investigations they're going to find one little nugget that says because the FBI doesn't get recommendations the ... the FBI is is not going to give they're just gonna give okay this is what they said\nBecause they don't have any authority in this particular case\nYou know and now we've got to look in all three claims even the ... you know you wouldn't believe thirty six years ago routinely on weekends that boys were drug in girls and and then lining up in the halls waiting to you know rape gang rape these young women\nBecause that's what the woman said\nAnd that's what they want to investigate now\nUm it is seemingly having an impact\nAccording to the Remington research group forty eight percent in Missouri likely voters planning to vote for the Republican candidate Josh Hawley\nForty six percent said they plan to vote for McCaskill but then the question of McCaskill's opposition a cabin or whether it's impacting their vote forty nine percent said it made them less likely to vote for McCaskill\nI think Democrats are going to be watching those kind of numbers very closely look their hope is is\nThey they hope they've created enough smoke and fire over Russia still no evidence whatsoever\nThey hope that they create enough smoke and fire here that they can make this all about election day and that you'll forget how awful it was under Obama\nAnd that you won't get up and he voted for Trump most people don't go out in midterms mid term elections are about\nThose people that show up motivating your base to get out there if you want Nancy Pelosi as speaker and Chuck Schumer as your majority leader you'll get the government you deserve\nIf you if you want to tune in on election night in thirty six days\nFive weeks from tomorrow and hear Nancy Pelosi the speaker and Chuck Schumer is the Senate majority leader\nIf by the way Mitch McConnell's railing about\nFord was not told of the chairman's offers that's interesting why do they keep them from her that was an interesting side bar there is I Know that Tom Cotton and Lindsey Graham on to investigate Dianne Feinstein now why did she holders for six weeks would have plenty of time by the way it was six extra weeks to investigate\nWhy do they hold it because they wanted to create this crisis at this time but no there's a lot at stake in in this upcoming election now we did have um the case\nWhat what is the woman's name Rachel Mitchell was the one that was asking questions for the Republicans in the Senate a professor Ford and she did a very strong analysis of the case you said in the legal context here is my bottom line\nAnd he said she said case\nIs incredibly difficult to prove but this cases even weaker than that she said Dr Ford identified other witnesses to the event and those witnesses either refuted her allegations or failed to corroborate up for the reasons discuss below I Do not think a reasonable prosecutor would bring this case\nBased on the evidence before the committee nor do I believe that the evidence is sufficient to satisfied a preponderance of evidence standard even and\nYou know I that's a pretty powerful statement\nNow we have what else do we have here so we got some other blue state numbers that are really interesting to watch um there's a lot of reasons why in New Jersey this was surprising to me\nBlue state numbers that are really interesting to watch um\nThere's a lot of reasons why in New Jersey this was surprising to me Democratic Sen Robert Menendez is having a tough time getting re elected this is not a state anybody's been paying a lot of attention to 'em it didn't help him this weekend when he used professor Ford's allegations to bash Brett Kavanaugh and he tweeted out Sunday\nOr Saturday the details of professor Ford's testimony or heart wrenching to hear I Hope every single senator not only watches but listens and two days later the political had a headline shock poll shows a dead heat in Menendez Senate race in New Jersey\nAnd by the way you know think Christine Todd Whitman and\nUm what's the what's the name of the past Governor Christie Christie himself Chris Christie Christie Todd Whitman Christie a lot of Christie's in New Jersey\nUm but anyway it was forty five forty three within the margin of error in New Jersey Grassley is urging the Justice Department announced
