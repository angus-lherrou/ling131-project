president just spoke out about it I'm going to play some of what he said at the bottom of this half hour\nOut if those reports are all accurate it's a whole lot bigger than previously reported and growing\nAnd what you have is members of the caravan chanting guess we could as they're making their way through Mexico all day to day I've been defied the will of one country vowing to test the spine of another\nMexican police who failed to stop them at the country's border with Guatemala now service escorts it appears for the care of on as they're now battling north\nAs members clear that they have no intention of staying in Mexico Leah buys for the U.S new estimates cited by L. universal which is a Mexican newspaper say the Caribbean now has fourteen thousand people many of them are already in Mexico while others do wait\nOh that would put them in the category of illegal immigrants not an asylum seekers because you're seeking asylum you have to seek it in the country that you first appearance but they appear confident that\nThis confrontation is going to come down to this is this is extraordinarily dangerous for the country here but I Am telling you\nPolitically the American people fundamental is white Kavanaugh matter they believe in the in the core values that this country was built on a due process and presumption of innocence they also believe that we are a nation of laws otherwise why have the\nAnd yesterday they were traveling through Guatemala we noticed people from El Salvador even people from Bangladesh\nCan you imagine what they had to do to get here they infiltrated themselves in the caravan and tried to cross with the crowd that would have been benefitted them greatly\nUm so you've got the care of and continuing their march now a couple of other things that you've got to understand here and there is a political thing\nHaving been to the border everywhere from the Rio Grande the San Diego\nHelicopter horseback boats all\nTerrain vehicles you'd foot I've been out there I've seen even gang members arrested right in front of me while I was there so and the entire family from El Salvador arrested right in front of me uh I've been to the drug warehouses which I played it many times I've seen the tunnels that have\nThat have been dug this is not just I mean this is the biggest rushed we've had\nBut on top of it and maybe they think the Gavin Newsom is going to win and they can all go to the sanctuary state of California and there'll be safe and get the free health care the Gavin Newsom is promising every Californian legal not legal wherever you come from free health care free free free\nLuck for the people of California when that disaster happens\nBut you know you you watch this and there's not one Democrat saying one thing about this because they've always supported open borders\nNow did they not know that by priests precipitating this confrontation\nThat there could be innocent people that end up getting hurt here\nI guess for them they would use that as just another reason to hate and blamed Donald Trump\nYou know or maybe they're hoping the Trump won't do anything and that it's all talk no action they don't have any legitimate claim for asylum in America because you that would be the first country they go to the way they have so we can send them back immediately if we have to\nBut if you have five seven fourteen thousand people\nConfronting our troops along the border of what good is going to come out of this\nYou know it's some you know while they're breaking the law they're criminals there not respecting our laws and our sovereignty and at the end of the day\nIf you let intend fourteen thousand what's gonna happen next week and what's gonna happen in the week after I think you know the Democrats have always believe that\nAnd fourteen thousand what's gonna happen next week and what's going to happen in the week after I think you know the Democrats have always believed that the change in ... in you know allowing illegal immigrants in the country of somehow helps them politically in the long term\nBut I don't think the American people want to open borders the American people fundamentally believe in the rule of law\nThe American people believe in immigration but they want legal immigration\nAnd when they see the magnitude in just one crossing and then recognize that this is happening every single day at our borders to me this is going to energize them more to want to go out and elect Republicans that will fund fully the wall\nPresidents only had three and a half billion dollars so far to build the wall he's trying to get the Congress to give them twenty five billion against the twenty five billion you'll have enough to fully completely secure our southern border\nThat mean nobody ever gets it and not at all we just want legal immigration on and make sure who you are when you come here can you take care of yourself and do you come here and share our values and do you want your piece of the American dream then fine\nSo you've got a Democratic Party now that is ... ... believes that nothing is relates to due process Kavanaugh\nNo presumption of innocence Kavanaugh now they're supporting lawlessness mobs all over the place now they're not speaking out against the the confrontation you have leaders in the Democratic party encouraging the kick them we can't be civil with people we disagree with unless we won the election\nYou know get a crowd confront them tell them they're not wanted anywhere anymore Maxine Waters follow them into department stores and gas stations in grocery stores and you see what's happening it happened again even this weekend\nAnd the other issue that should be on everybody's minds in Fifteen days is after eight years of Obama we had Thirteen million more Americans on food stamps eight million more in poverty\nThe only president never to hit three percent GDP Growth in his entire presidency for one year\nWe had the guy accumulate more debt than all forty three other presidents before him combined apps the track record of Obama\nThat's what he left us the lowest labor participation rates in the seventies lowest homeownership brightened fifty one years what do we have now for a million new jobs including four hundred thousand manufacturing jobs he told those were never coming back\nWe have

Post to show gay he's waiting for all the facts he's not rushing to judgment but it's very clear that the Saudis have been deployed citizen dishonest about all of this and he's now measuring what the proper response is going to be probably a follow some of what\nThe western European allies did when we found out putting was poisoning you know some of his citizens\nAnd by the way just moments ago the president who's headed to a campaign rally for Ted Cruz down in Texas that over a hundred and what Fifteen thousand people wanting to go to this thing they don't have enough room they already I think they increase the venue\nSo is that over a hundred and what Fifteen thousand people wanting to go to this like they don't have enough room they already I think they increase the venue twice anyway there so the president before he jumped on read more\nRobots are horrible thing and it's a lot bigger than five thousand people\nWe got to stop 'em at the border and unfortunately you look at
