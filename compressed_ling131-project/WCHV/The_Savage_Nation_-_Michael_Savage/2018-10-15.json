things that Democrats will never say is when we're now we're going to impeach forty five but just don't do any voting don't troll any party\nMember and then Maxine Waters they keep telling me not to say it but I'm going to fade and Pete forty five and ... forty five\nShe's she's honest about it she's telling everybody here we're going to do it but they're telling me not to say because it's not going to help us in the election and twenty two days now we have a piece of Democrats are being advised not to speak about their unpopular open border policies that is very difficult to win on immigration\nIs who's a memo obtained by the New York times and left wing consultants for the center for American Progress that's put dusters group\nAnd uh the think tank third way inviting Democrats running for reelection spend as little as possible talking about immigration and the immigration issue\nWe're more than a one and a half million immigrants are admitted to the country every year\nAnd they reported sanctuary attacks packs a punch says the poor page memorandum put together by the center for American Progress\nAnd a shared about a dozen briefings with Democrats in ... so they can't talk about anything they want to do me interpret that for you let me lie any way we can never tell you what we plan on doing what we know what they plan on doing endless investigation impeachment of Trump\nOpen borders which they won't talk about impeachment they won't talk about you have shifty shifty announcing plans for nearly a dozen brand new anti Trump investigations in the house alone\nIn the house alone if they get control of the house is why I'm telling you if every house race if you don't get out and twenty two days I don't care what Democrats name as on the ballot if you vote for the Democrat you're voting for below sea you vote for a democratic senator\nMcCaskill Donnelly Heitkamp pastor Nelson or you know this woman out in Arizona whatever her name is that thinks Arizona's a crazy\nCinema I mean you're you're voting for Schumer it's the same thing you don't vote it's a half a vote for the Democratic senators and house members\nAnyway Washington Examiner points out Trump is likely to face at least five new house investigations are caucus led by Nancy Pelosi will lead to ruthlessly prioritize the most important matters first he said\nAdam Schiff member of the house permanent select committee on intelligence listed five different investigations he says that the Democrats will start once they take over\nAnd one that will prove his charge that Russians are laundering money for property is owned by the Trump family\nAnd the intelligence we'll assess the work of Robert Mueller et cetera et cetera I mean it just is never going to end\nEver they don't care about the the country of the future of the country or the way Hillary says in an interview Bill Clinton didn't abuses power with a twenty two year old intern with the sex toy in the oval office\nWhat role if any did you play in criticizing the character of the women who have accused bill sexual misconduct\n... now but I take responsibility for my life and my actions\nShe also stood by his side as he was impeached after lying about his affair with a White House intern some today have said he should have stepped down or member let me just\nThat here you know she's defending him all she wants but that doesn't address Juanita Broderick Kathleen William Paula Jones and her saying the bill did not abused his power how can you say she's an intern in his classic workplace sexual harassment because he's got all the power he's the president\nOr whatever I mean I don't know why Hillary so defining on the issue but she is um so we got the ... let me tell you what's gonna happen no one twenty two days because I think this was important we have a CBS News battleground poll showing that the house races are in a statistical tie\nMy advice to you is to think three weeks from tomorrow you're going to turn on the TV and get bad news because maybe that will motivate you and the agenda simple impeach investigate open borders eliminate ice they want their crumbs back they won Obamacare what else do you really need to know\nAnyway they find that the battleground states the race for control the house is now within the margin of error which means a statistical tie\nThe same CBS survey finds that for Democrats to when they have to rely on voters who say that they're going to vote this year but did not turn out in the twenty ten or twenty fourteen midterms\nIf the elections were held today Democrats would stand to win two hundred and twenty six seats they claim more than the two hundred and Eighteen needed for the majority Republicans winning the remaining two hundred nine but the margin of error and each of those\nIt's tight why keep mentioning names on Hannity every night and on Hannity dot com\nMarsha Blackburn has pulled out of a bigger lead against Brett ascending I have to believe the tape that was put out by project very tosses putting some a highlight on that you know the new rock star of the Democratic party Pedro roar Scott something like sixty million dollars

point lead for Heller and unimportant race versus Rosen in Nevada I mean Heller that's an important seat to hold\nIn the case with Arizona mix ... finally taken a lead there I've got to believe that her leads going to get bigger once it begins to resonate\nWhat a cinema has been saying about people in our own state whenever she travels abroad I if you look at some of these other you know districts it's very very tight\nI honestly can't tell you what's gonna happen in twenty six states like a twenty to twenty two days I Can't tell you but I Will tell you got to personalize this
