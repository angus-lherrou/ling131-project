to one in six on the season with one of those seven Ninety five loss in Memphis to finish up there five game road trip on a board game losing streak\nWe're approaching the top of the hour here so before we get the Scott Brooks and Bradley bill let's pause ten seconds first station identification on the WGLA Washington Wizards radio network\nThe CBS Nineteen whether earth already forecast every ten minutes every morning on WC age me am and FM Charlottesville to brag Frederick [noise]\nAnd thank you for taking with us here on the Budweiser game show\nCertainly a lot of frustration mounting as the wizard\nTo do some good paying fees and to have a ...\nCertainly a lot of frustration mounting is the wizard\nTo do some good things that things and to have a bounce back season after getting knocked out in the first round a year ago\nAnd through seven games to get back to the first round seems like it's going to be quite a hall\nAs the wizards are already one in six on the the than following tonight's one step in Ninety five loss to the Memphis Grizzlies but hey you know one guy who was always candid whether it is they win whether it is they lost in that wizards locker room mates Bradley bill\nHe played a good overall floor game tonight with Seventeen point seven states to steal three blocks although he did have four turnovers as well unfortunately for him he was not able to hit open looks throughout much of the night he finished at five and six team from the floor for a twelve for three and forty minutes\nA but for Bradley bill tonight's loss had more to do it but with the turnovers\nTurnovers or five hours early on\n[noise] on digging ourselves or\nJoining the whole game trying to cross the whole crowd at all and [noise]\nSometimes you run out of gas and so so you get them around and so\nWhen I'm really going on around them going on other on the handle so\nHis ...\nMostly to stick with him in\nI mean we need to go through as fast as possible and\nEverybody's a little fancy and frustrated I mean nobody's more frustrating than we are on his\nContained under a better job of doing that and every night send us your guys are ready to your shirt and my parents are going that I'm going to go\nThere are so I put it all myself for\nStarters for the better we all got\nThis case you know because this is not perfect\nOn those credit we satellite missions these were\nYou know you're actually run our names we're\nA lot of positive attitude was great guys just not like we don't like a turban\nJust got to figure it out on the\nAnd that's just that's just a matter of fact she plays earner and just couldn't [noise]\nCouldn't have together [noise]\nPut it in half together would certainly help with your team I think at this point just putting a full court are together or has been enough of a struggle but like you know a much more much more cordial interview I guess you could say from Bradley\nThan what we got friday night after the last in Sacramento when it felt like they were guys already pointing fingers at one another through the press conference through the post game availability\nI'll get into that a little more in a second but let's also hear what Scott Brick sad to say\nA following tonight's one o seven Ninety five law to the Memphis Grizzlies\nWhat do you say is I think it's areas\nThat second half um they got off from the three point line I think they may chat a fourteen or Fifteen um\nRats out prior to that were pretty solid on both ends we just couldn't smile shot in that first how are we kept\nOur ten outta Fifteen um\nRats are prior to that we were pretty solid on both ends we just couldn't smile shot that first happened we kept battling tonight and it was definitely a they made they made shots and that's a third and fourth quarter that we could not [noise]\nI don't know if we look at the table I don't know if we could have been much better in their in their face but they they made them and give them credit they set the big shots in\nI we we definitely turned them all over a more than we normally would um but as well just seem to this team is a\nSacred turnovers or one of the best for the lawyers are rolled out print journalism scoring off of them but like I said are often you know we we we got a lot of good luck in that first house that's kind of like a broken record but it is what it is right now we just gotta keep fighting through an sticking together and playing for one another\nTonight we did that we just some things that go or wait a second half\nOf them are the three point line\nHis played like even think that this team is one that is\nNot a good story he's not a good start we all we all got to just do things stick together and and then play better\nAnd we will do that I Believe in all of our guys I Believe in the work that they put in believes\nThen the the shops that they work on every day I Believe in the defense tonight was much better uh are rebounding was much better her transition defense was much better we just got to put some games are gathering and get some confidence on all sorts of in and get a couple of wins along the way I think working\nWould be right back you know it's a long season we've got still Ninety percent of the season left earlier you mentioned\nThat you just said yeah and I was going to feed you left but how do you not given collective pregnancy we're always thinking like where there is always tomorrow\nAs well I mean there is there I mean we just started\nSeven games ago got Seventy five more games let's\nSay say it um [noise]\nThe marathon and that is we we all know that you've done this week for a long time ever a former player saying [noise]\nFor employers say in the future players are going to say it's a long grinding things and you gotta you gotta be able to stick together during the laws in and continue to\nCite for some of the eyes that take place and then when you do that you got a good team and the guys aren't going to split apart we're going to be frustrated and they're going to be frustrated at times I mean they're going to be frustrated at times of each other\nAnd that's what teams do you got to fight through it together and figure it out together and you know I have all the confidence in the world that we will have a couple of times announced\nGotta stick together you sensing is a\nWith no definitely not a problem but it's something that I said I said after every loss\nUm insane it for a year as I'll call my coaches and send it to me and then the such true\nA Jew or you're always important when you when you have a tough law office stick together\nWhen I'm not one of our guys want to turn them all over not one of our guys want to miss a shot and one of our guys all of the game but\nYou do that you got to just gather and fight for one another for the next night\nAfter the game ... minutes Sacramento's two words together so we have you know you have to stick together as families do stick together things aren't going to always be a perfect and you just gotta\nYou gotta understand that there's going to be some tough times you know we're having a tough start of the season whether it's a start you know I've always believe I live my life um you know you got\nSent back to always make for great comeback send you know we've had a minor setback right now and if you keep working together they can come back we're going to be fine\nThank you so there's a few things in there\nSet back right now to keep working together the comebacks gonna be fine\nThank you so there's a few things in there that Scott bricks had to say tonight that I think are worthy of breaking down and this is Brian Alvin here on the Budweiser post game show or those were ... comments in the aftermath of tonight's one o seven\nNinety five last so the Memphis Grizzlies they put the wizards overall record the one in six which is tied for last in the eastern conference\nWith the Cleveland Cavaliers\nYou heard at the very beginning of what Scott Brick sad to say there when he was asked what he thinks went wrong\nA saying that again they just couldn't get enough shots to fall and then the Memphis hit some tough shot I'm not buying that um the talk coming into this game\nFrom the players to the coach to everybody talk coming into this game was there's no need to panic it's only six games in the season but we need to show some sort of a sense of urgency and we can't let off sensitive struggles affect us on the defense event\nAnd guess what in the first quarter of this game you could see the defensive urgency you could see a sense of urgency\nOut of this team that hey if we get a win tonight and we go to win three on the road trip you know what everybody would have taken that before we came out here sure we can't undo what we did in the first two nights of the season at home but two and five were okay we'll be fine\nTermites in even mold brick guaranteed shut

the racetrack each and every weekend I'm you know people get\nThirty seconds snippets sometimes of drivers on camera you know and and make their impersonation off of what they see their and their

I'm sure they'd be a little bit but the obviously we've got to try to win that yet so um it was a good weekend\nI think I Know the answer this before I even asked what I'll do it anyway these next two races now are you going to kind of take it easy or you're gonna you're gonna go full bore and try and pile up a couple of more wins I mean obviously you're already going to raise for a championship in homestead but you've got some ah some sponsors and a lot of guys who work on that truck to try and make you happy right\nYou know why the goal is to learn so um you know there there might be not as much pressure if the strategy ... or whatever and that you know you're rich projected ship but um there's a little bit of a pride factor there I'm just trying to raise the bar and you can we can work out so\nUm I think I speak for for everybody you know that's what I say we gotta we gotta keep big and so I'm there and I also feel like if you let your guard down a little bit sometimes it's hard to know or where it needs to be so\nIf they can sell 'em there and I also feel like if you let your guard down a little bit sometimes it's it's hard to know or where it needs to be so um we just keep going down and um yeah honesty when another race for before um said would be phenomenal um they're great race tracks or so\nUm but yeah I think you've got to keep pushing and um and I know everybody feels the same lines so that's that's what we're going to they're\nJoining let's go back to more real for a second or what happened in the cup race aside or have you been a little bit surprised that it hasn't been as much of the traditional short track beating in banging\nAnd Martin drill as we've seen in the past I mean I Know we had the last lap deal with with looking into one direction you had a little bit of a a dust up with with my aunt Snyder but relatively minor incidents compared to what we've seen in in in years past right\nYeah for sure I wasn't expecting that separates the way crazier than that you know if you talk about that we start with my that was still a thirty five laps or whatever so nerve maybe forty so\nUm you know the whole time that we're we're running green the NFL for sure well we are going to get another ... years so\nUm and then it never came so yeah I think the racing was definitely call them or I'm having said that the reasoning I don't know exactly I think maybe some of the guys trying to race for the championship or for more inclined to just take what they were given for the day and and not make any\nYou know bumps or bruises or try to make any enemies or whatever so on and maybe the other guys were respecting the guys running for championship I don't know but um whatever it was it was kinda nice to\nSee a little bit refreshing sound those are people\nTaking care of their stuff that's not always a bad thing but I Know a lot of people like ... feet in the bank and but um yeah a lot of stuff not destroyed I guess is is the terminology we should use so um yeah I thought it was good um but not you know I don't know that it'll stay that way forever let's put it that way\nYou have one confident as always change in this war do for sure will for grandfather clocks now I mean are at the top of the hour do you have to put your plugs in in your house with all the the the ringing\n[laughter] well not exactly so um yeah we got obviously\nWe've got a basement up here I'm offered the north and um so we got a couple of them lined up next to each other so\nI'm kind of cool obviously I've got four kids so I'm you know we always make the joke that each one of my kids will get a grandfather clock from day one when I get over ...\nSomething to remember me by I guess but um yeah it's cool or you know it is one of the coolest trophies I'm In and it's especially the trucks here so um yeah I Can't believe we've got four of them I think it's just really cool that such a historical places to go there and run like we do is just a lot of fun but uh it's definitely a cool trophy\nYou mentioned you definitely want to try and get some more wins before the end of the year particularly a home soon I'm guessing but along the way you still got a team made alive in the playoffs and Justin Hayley in\nEarlier this season when the playoffs started I saw him at at Las Vegas and that was I think one of the first races that you guys had Timothy Peters a running with you again and and Justin just stood there\nAsking him a bunch of questions in watching everything that was going on and later he said you know what when I get a chance to soak up up the knowledge like that I'm going to take every opportunity that I get how refreshing is it to have a young guy in this day and age who realizes that he doesn't know everything yeah\nWell it's\nIt's really refreshing obviously and um you know that's that's kind of part of my job is to try to help you know as much as I can but I'll be honest you know if you're never too old to learn something so you can actually learn something from those guys for sure um you know sometimes when you're\nLike me get preconceived notions that's not saying that he and a half or maybe it takes a different point of view to change your mind a little bit I'm adjusting ... doing a good job\nPreconceived notions on things and uh you know maybe it takes a different point of view to change your mind a little bit um adjustments obviously doing a good job and has won a couple of races this year so\nI'm you know and it's this team and his program of August they got things figured out the way dust mites them and and that's cool to see so\nUm you know they weren't just decided hey buddy and you know everybody's working hard so the school sit payoff warm and um I you know I Hope or race and justice for the championship come around me in and says anything I can do to help them I'd be more than happy to do that\nYou know in a place like a Talladega you can obviously draft with the team made and help 'em out that way but it's different tracks the the mile and a half for example I Know it's more of a factor in the trucks on the news and the other series but it's too much on the track that you can actually do to help with the may ... at facilities like that\nWhere I think the biggest thing you could help and what's his obviously if if you find something in practice um whether it's a line or a set of change or something like that but you think was you know a step in the right direction um I I think that's probably one of the biggest thing you can do is get that back to still\nUm you know right away so that they can work on it or try it or or whatever the case may be something\nOn you but you know as far as the race goes you know there's probably not a lot I can do because you know sometimes for seven different strategies or whatever so on and that's about all that play out but uh\nYou know there's things on the racetrack I guess you can do a little bit about I'm a little slack and if it's the restart and in the air traffic or whatever you cut them a little extra room to make sure he can do the things that he wants to sell 'em but there's\nReally not a time that I can do to affect the outcome of the race but there's there's always just trying to help them I'm like I said and the and the ways that you know that we just talked about", "show_name": "Mark Levin Show",
