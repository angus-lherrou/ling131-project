model is\nChase Eliot gets his win and that moves them on to round three of the playoffs and he joined just on the gas line now the driver that number nine Napa Camaro Jay so\nA lot of stuff was made about how you got that when and it seemed almost a a a carbon copy of what happened with Ryan blaming the week before but I guess the the moral of the story is must be present the wind you can't take advantage of situations if you're not there and ready to seize the moment right\nYeah I I reckon show so we'll take it certainly hasn't things doorway that we had a pretty fast cars as well but if a if you know whatever it is will take a guess sticker and onto the next you\nKnow you got to remember it that way because there are times when you have the good car and you don't necessarily a wound up with the finished you deserve so the good comes with the bad for your\nUh as as we move a little bit forward now we're looking at Talladega and I know after the race you were saying how relieved you were not to have to worry so much about that race or Kansas but that you can't just sit idly back because we've seen how important these playoff points are\nYeah there there is huge and it's important to to keep that in mind for sure I think is as you go along you are not only trying to get ... points but trying to keep them out to get out of\nTo keep that in mind for sure I think is\nAs you go along you're not only trying to get playoff points but trying to keep some other guys out of a of the playoffs or ... you know the guys that are close to that cut line and pressure situations\nI think will ah will be good and you know just kind of keep the hammer down and um and keep them keep them in a corner I think it'd be nice because you know when when the when you have pressure on [noise] on you for weeks and weeks like that it can it can certainly add up and and I think that'll show separate medicine the boys\nAnd a lot of ways to hopefully uh hopefully we can\nHandle it well and um yeah try to grab a another when the seeking it'd be great\nHaving said that now is you moved to Talladega this week and you finished third there earlier this these and you've been a solid plate racer but\nThis this race as everybody knows is one that can suddenly spin out of your control through no fault of your own when you're racing in a race like that does it wound up being one of those where your your brain is more tired than your body at the end of the day\nOf federal how hard you crash [laughter] if you crash but yeah it's a it's one of those things I mean there's no point in worrying about it too much because it's going to be what it is I think you go in there and you try to control the things that you can control\nUm there are guys that have been winning these races consistently advocate Brad and Joe is to me those two\nUm that do it often and do it a lot um and are just lucky I mean you don't just\nDo it and when those races that often and the left yet I'm Sorry but you got to be [noise] you got to kind of what you're doing so there is art to it I have not figured that out I've crash more than anything so just a trying to [noise] you know about the speed\nOf our cars that fast cars at this place since I've been here but I've just crashed law so I'm trying to make it to the end and and put ourselves in a better position\nWhen when you're in a situation like that a lot of these racist things can happen that are out of your control but it's super speed ways in particular and maybe even more so Talladega\nHow frustrating is it that that you feel like you're in a lot of guys say this I didn't do anything wrong I was making every move I wanted to make and suddenly it's just completely out of my control was that hard to put behind you or is that just that's the way it is that those type of tracks\n[noise] ah [noise] I mean that's just count on a way it goes to be honest with you I mean there's really nothing you can do about uh other people you know you can kind of control your your own thing and try to pay attention to much of a\nYou know what's going on around you you can but I mean you can only do so much and still be aggressive and still try to have yourself and physician so it's tough I I don't know ah I haven't figured out the arc to maybe ... or ... or ... so you got some time and you can tell me\n[laughter] I bet they'll keep those secrets are pretty close or listen I saw a that you're going to have a little bit of a different look on the Napa Camaro this week until the folks about that\nYeah we do have a have a new luck with and a half of obviously they have all kinds of parts is enough auto parts that\nUm [noise] you know sport in their uh their headlights uh this weekend so um they uh\nYou know ... ... batteries NAFTA breaks all that stuff throughout the years sometimes they'll put it on a car and and promoted and uh we we never done the lights before so looking forward to that Carlos great and looking forward to a you know getting on track\nShifting gears a little bit now well last week it was announced the NASCAR was going to go with something similar to the all star rules package for uh several tracks next year and you're one of the first guys to\nOh last week it was announced that NASCAR was going to go with something similar to the all star rules package for uh several tracks next year and you're one of the first guys to to respond and tweeted out that you were going to keep an open mind about it just at a glance what do you think about what we're going to be looking at for next year\nI'm sure some more to you know what you saw the all star race but you know as I've told many people out this point I don't really care what they do I mean first off I don't make the rules are really doesn't matter if you know whether I see here and worry about it or not\nBut he has made a big thing is as long as the best guys the best drivers and the best teams can still go and writes the top and when I'm I have no issue with it that when a\nYou know you feel like that's not the case any longer than I Will I Will certainly speak up and and have a problem but ah yeah the all star racy solve [noise] I guess a Kevin won it he's and he's one of the most racist throughout the year having Carl I guess now so um [noise]\nHow can you say that the best it and rise to the top that day they were you know on a roll a [noise] ... having all year and then show does that too so long as as long as the best cars invest drivers cries of top I've I've got no problem\nAnd I think that the the creamed generally has a way of rising to the top for sure\nListening to chase before we let you go I wanted to get your reaction to the announcement your friend and former teammate Casey came made today that he was going to have
