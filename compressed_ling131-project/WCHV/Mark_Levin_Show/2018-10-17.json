effect in manner possible to protect our homes and business\nSo I feel like the comedy combination of those two things is is very challenging but um it's still just a race car or it it still takes the same things to be competitive and go fast\nYou know when I watched you come up through the truck series and the extremity series for that matter you you learned your ropes as you say a little bit in the early part of the season and then about halfway there was a seemed like a light bulb that came on and you took off like a rocket to the end of the year with a cup series\nEverybody is you know a notch above the same way as people say college to pro sports but what has been the thing that has\nEncouraged you the most and kept you off the emotional roller coaster of the highs and lows in that situation\nYeah I think having good teammates I think having a great team owner that has confidence in you or Mr Hendrik has given me everything every you know opportunity to succeed and especially with this opportunity next year so um he doesn't put much pressure on me when it comes to this rookie year and performing\nBut I Know that that we both want to perform really well so um I think when you have people that have confidence and you you avoid the ups and downs of of a difficult season\nWhat's been the one moment you'd like to have back this year\nUm I like to have a a couple mistakes back I think about um Charlotte the Coca Cola six hundred [noise]\nWe uh we gotten an early crash and I'm ... the car was was really free and I just I knew that and I just did it\nDid it really just for that as well as I should have so um that's a long race I Would have liked to to be able to run every lap of that race and understand it better um but but what I really look at that mistake and and then some of the other things I Would I Would take us back but I also learned a lot from it\nWhen you move into the twenty Nineteen season of course we're going to see a completely different rules package than we've seen is going to be like what we saw in the all star race but with about a hundred and fifty more horse power\nHow did you enjoy the time you had with that 'cause you drove that in the event of these series I Believe it Indy right but we were bringing it in yeah how how do you think that's going to translate to the cup series and are you looking forward to it\nYeah I'm looking forward to it I feel like it's going to translate well it's a it's a new challenge for everyone\nHopefully I can adapt a little bit quicker than any other guys but I feel like everyone that is always competitive are still going to be competitive and you're going to have to raise the same guys for the land so I look forward to that challenge and um I think it's going to be a new thing that that

motor sports writer Alex Bowman about his first appearance in a monster energy NASCAR up through the playoffs and a whole lot more it's this week's NASCAR lied to his interview\nBut then in those stressful part of the last three personally\nThe rose bowl was was the most stressful just being a cut off race and not having a lot of confidence in myself as a horse race or in going to hurt corps and being right there on the edge that was a stressful day but they were able to make it worse\nLike had a bit of news this past week and she adds obviously Jimmy Johnson getting a new crew teeth in having entering China going over to William and it doesn't affect you in the early but are there anything in any way that it actually does\nAffect your team on the competition tied ... dairy and\nMoving into the role he's moving into\nUm will definitely affects um attacked\nThe competition I think he's a great asset for the team and um I think it'll be great\nAnd doing that and um you know having\nChad with with William will be interesting to watch and Jimmy having a new group of people be exciting to watch as well so [noise] um you know hopefully a\nHelpful for cars you know there's obviously a lot of shop on going around there but um for us where ah\nKeep the same\nKind of doing her thing who does it have the effect that kind of frightening things up across the organization maybe giving everybody a little ... maybe\nYou know it it's kinda hard for for me 'cause there's not a lot of change from from where I said so\nIt's really a lot of the same for me but\nThe competition meetings it'll just be Chad speaking as a different group chief and Kevin obviously coming on board will be cool so you know it's it's just a little different from where I fit I'm\nNot going to change a ton but uh it'll be interesting to see you know we've we've made a lot of progress over the course of this year and hopefully this is just a more of that progress\nI saw on social media Ware hinder kind of a throwback lunch in the past week and you find that enrichment part is that I mean I Do regularly occasion\nYeah so that was the opposite Hendrik throwback much in the first one that I've been a part of I don't know regular thing\nOK Zhang yeah so that was the opposite Hendrik throwback much in the first one that I've been a part of I don't know\nIt's regular thing or there's far year to year but may first gave me\nA like a like a nationwide\nArlington throwback jacket from I don't know two or three years ago and when the elderly are now like I\nI appreciate it being nationwide obviously based on your side you have an initial um\nHow do we have anything like you have like a ... or something and they're like no we don't have any one about a fire we love you know we went and found that image of fires too high\nAnd that thing was worn out it was faded a little crunchy\nNot comfortable at all and didn't smell that great um and did not fit I'm a little heavier than he was a struggle to stand up straight in it but no it was a it was cool\nI was going to ask did you get to pick it obviously answer that question where do you have to figure out to like grow back or did you sign in like strange black cases constantly hammering\nKnocking out exactly what I just\nWalked up to a shadow boxing broken\nAnd put it on in there and so he really cool man yeah I don't I wasn't there\nI was down in a meeting when they found that I don't know exactly where it came from I Hope somebody out of\n\nYour car guy and I know you have coming out against us read can you just remind not\nA I'm going to lose my car in the story behind that\nWe um we're both our guys and we get to trash talking to each other and we both have already that make over a thousand horsepower and um he does a little more of a race car whereas minds of the little more of a streetcar but we just kinda got to come back and forth one day and decided we're going to race or paying so\nIt doesn't run 'em and I drive my most every day so it's a it's a little interesting 'cause I've\nShown up shop with it and be like All right let's go to the max the race right now and he won't do it or is it running but um when his car does Ron it's probably going to smoke me and uh I'm going to lose a car over it so uh it'll be interesting to see if that rate ever does or doesn't happen 'cause we've been putting it off for quite a while\nWhat was it in writing gentlemen's hands day she just understanding\nIt it it's a it's a handshake and time writing but you know work I'm sure like we're going to get the track and his lane is gonna be like fully yet the mindset that baby powder on it or something so you know by now pill battle to try to win that thing so it'll be a it'll be interesting\nOne of the car projects do you have going on in the works are hoping you have in the works yes\nDo I have I'm kind of like a daily driver Cadillac Egypt the that that we're building right now it's about done on just the type of you odds and ends on it\nShould make little under a hundred horse power I'm really really nice car and then I always got much illegal stuff going on so getting ready to go to start with the measure it drops actually going to leave before we go to home said that's a that's a little bit of stress right now or wait in line of what we need to be ... I\nDon't do the hard fast side of it but the rest\nOf it I I'd be myself so lots of for I Am not in my shop working on that stuff but uh we're getting\nClose and I really enjoy that uh that type of racing a lot on the new throughout the winter\nI haven't thing to do when I checked her social media to look for extra your dog spending Roscoe what kind of personality\nHad this really intriguing\nThe one I check your social media to look for your dog Roscoe what kind of personalities\nRoscoe had this really intriguing personality I'm called and all he is he is a handful he's a rescue I don't really know what the story is I got him when he was pretty young\nIs really good for a couple of years any kind of just if I was in line and I'm a new\nDog is all over the place when he's not at home at home is a pretty good dog but he ... he leaves the house and he lives in his mind he starts whining barks at everything and\nHe's either that home dog and then I have faith in who is like\nThe sweetest like doesn't care like do be super nice dog ever and eating go anywhere he loves dogs he was dog bars comes racetrack will go wherever so they're like polar opposites\nUm and they love each other and get along great Roscoe has like a total of three dogs that you can be trying to kill and it's funny because he's really good at home and\nMy girlfriend never believed to me about how ... it was around new dogs and how she took him to her house without asking me and he liked got at another dog at her house so he stays at home he's on lockdown at all times is a danger to himself but\nUm [noise] you know just a little bit of a psychotic\nChancellor add more up to this is my personal dreams have like a farm with like twenty dollars [noise] I was home more I\nDefinitely would and I have the room for it um\nEverywhere except in bed because they sleep in bed with me in ways eighty five thousand sea weighs ... pounds literally will just lay on top even crush you [noise]", "show_name": "Mark Levin Show", "year": "2018", "city": "Charlottesville", "day": "17"}
