Briscoe driving to victory lane and he joins us now in Studio ... congratulations on when did that one Saturday and they're in Charlotte\nYeah thank you as a certainly a big win it's it's really cool obviously being the first one or the ... and being able to say that I'll always be the first one or there so I definitely a special day and uh hopefully can do it again\nSo before we get too deep into the actual race itself I'd like to get your your perception your thoughts your analysis on when the car came off the lift gate practice and you go out onto this brand new race track what were you thinking when you were driving around there making for slap\nYeah the first thing was it just looks super cool you know how everything was painted it all to curbing you know they had you know shrubs and one of the corner all that we had the heartburn turn it just looked cool to drive around that and look at the atmosphere was really neat and then obviously\nOr the fans were really excited for two so just from an event side of things in the presentation that Charlotte motor speedway did I was super excited to get on the track and it was a definitely a little more narrow I guess you could say than in a lot of people expected\nBut uh I thought I thought it raise a lot better than what people were expecting to wasn't near as much of a crash faster\nOr anything like that so I thought it was really good race overall\nWhat was the hardest part for you which part of the course was the most demanding for you\nUm you know honestly that the ... it was tough when they had the tire barrier whereas start of the week and once they moved back uh it really helped everything I think I made it easier for not\nNecessarily easier but has made it a less havoc I guess for the whole entire field but that part definitely it was tough uh then the final part of the race track Fifteen sixteen Seventeen oh we're going a hundred and Seventy Seventy five mile an hour on the bank and\nA diving down from fourth year going down to third in his second it's rough and bumping you're bouncing all over the place sliding all around and it's tough to slow down and not we'll hop right there so are those two are probably the most challenging but they're also my my two favorite parts of the whole entire racetrack\nFans up knowing the um ... we were against leading to the back stretch it came with the speed that mercury and we saw all the\nAll the corners and practice all over the place really and are just like ... the best record in the world to do when they dropped the green playing against the ... going to end the corporation on Sunday I thought you know a lot of corners when they do everybody strapped their their heads on the right direction\nUh we may laugh to put on a good show for everybody I thought those theories and fortunately for us when our shopping seeing our Chevrolet with so fast the whole weekend as well as our cup car there was smoking mountains are both ... and it's fun to have to good race cars made my job way more fun and it's just a matter of uh trying to attack that place um\nI I thought you know myself and also deal and talked about yesterday a lot of\nTimes where if you tried to run a hard getting more trouble so you had to attack\nNonstop I think that's why the show we were able to put on for the fans was what it was\nYou talked about there were calls for carnage which we heard a lot of those a lot of those calls came from the garage saying we're going to ... a lot of race cars we did tear up some race cars now mean don't get me wrong we had some contact but I don't think that we got as much as everyone thought we were going to get why why were folks calling for a lot of wrecked race cars this past weekend\nI think just with everything about 'em and everything that they need new testing to ... that that may for so much uh just\nSo much tension um you know obviously what the changes that that NASCAR made and that's a nice item to the place and going back as soon as practiced started bam right off the bat were tearing four or five six race cars that so um you're supposed to think what you put in front of you in front of it and it was\nA matter of all they do is they think a lot of race cars and that's what everybody expected but like I like I talked about everybody transitioning to a little different mindset\nYou know practice you're all out and you're going to have you found yourself you know trying to trying to breed trying to read the new laws ... states you kind of states tired you can do a lot of different things that\nYou don't attack as hard as you can make it to where you can kind of refocused keep yourself come and I think because of that while the the race card cap was a subsidized for a little bit around with a you know make the lab with a ... if you'd call them\nMuch where you take it out of your comfort zone I mean we we get so logged into the schedule hey we're going to Charlotte we're going to Texas we're going to Dover we're going here we're going there\nAnd you know what to expect no one knew what to expect outside of the testing that was done earlier this year so when you hit the track for practice even qualifying and the race how much did that experience take you out of ...\nTake you out of your comfort zone and didn't challenge you more as a driver\nYou know really for me I think that was the fun of it um you know with big\nFinanciers not getting it all on insulin weakening until Thursday and I'll say I didn't get to take part in any of the cup testing over the last couple of months so\nGoing into it it was like hey it's it's open window open opportunity for everybody that's what I think as race car drivers you hope to be able to be somewhat of a level playing field and that's what that's what the rules resented it presented\nA lot of opportunity and so a lot of guys rise up to that occasion and what's not to know that we were able to do that in some form or fashion and know that um everybody was out of the comfort zone because of that um you didn't really have strict headlines that you're looking for you're looking for the race revive the headlines and I think that's exactly what it did\nAnd that's what a lot of folks did as well you did it quite well again tenth on Saturday and of course you were able to run in the cup race on Sunday\nThere as well we're talking with Daniel Henrik as he gets ready to make the way up to Dover, Delaware for this weekend's bar harbour two hundred for the NASCAR expertise series but before that we talked in passing\nAbout the news that came out last week that you were going to jump in the number thirty one car for Richard children's racing in the monster energy NASCAR cup series in two thousand Nineteen when did you first find out that you weren't eligible for consideration\nAnd what was your reaction when you got the phone call saying you've got the job\n[laughter] uh you know as far as you know consideration of knowing it was even an option you know that goes back a\nCouple of months a lot of stuff was up in the air rumblings about not new ones coming back and not coming back and obviously we don't have that kind of shook out and\nReally wants he made his announcement you know the pace of making that happen getting thirty one really picked up at a rapid\nPace I'm fortunate to have a couple of opportunities in front of me and was really really hoping that I was going to end up in the situation that ended up in what it is here at our yard but didn't know exactly how that was going to turn out and just try to have faith that work out the way it's supposed to\nUm I'd be lying to you though if I told you it was sold for for weeks on end if it was time for weeks on end um but I have that that they have or an ounce there I I signed a\nPaper in the in the uh in the arts your motor coach there nine thirty in the morning there\nShouldn't wanna wear out so um didn't didn't have a lot of time to really really think on it um it was just a matter of just trying to take it all in an industry think like I said earlier that the half people take take shot give you a chance is not only this level but at every level of ever been out\nAnd believing you to not only do the job on the racetrack but do the job off the racetrack there's so much you know corporate corporate money in in in you know partnerships involved in doing it to like this is not just\nA team on and saying hey you're our guy it's a lot of partnerships they got to go through to the approval process is in bad ways on everybody um thankfully all the partners we have it or see our were able to get behind the idea\nOf me being full time you know and supporting their brands and with their brands supporting me a ... that's what caused all this is having everybody comes together\nThroughout the hey let's just give us get a shot and I'm a I'm forever indebted to each and every one of those guys and look forward to doing them justice has a kickoff twenty Nineteen\nI Can't imagine how exciting the moment was as you're sitting there in that motor home getting ready to sign that contract\nYou know as a short track racer from ... who you're sitting in the middle of Charlotte motor speedway in Concord getting ready to sign a contract to become a monster energy NASCAR cup series driver when you were putting pen to paper what were some of the thoughts that we're going through your mind about where you've been once you've been able to accomplish and what's ahead of you\nKnow honestly I figure I put the pin to the paper and pen would run out of ink or something\nSo\nYou know anything built into one moment in that moment of sitting right there in front of you and all you got to find your name so that's a that's an incredibly humbling feeling but I thought my gosh don't filming out in\n[laughter] it was a it was\nReally cool to think about them to try to get it out as quick as possible for anybody changed her mind and that's not older by before it's just been such a humbling experience than to go through the process but I understand the ins and outs of what you gotta do to be successful in business and have a sitting right there um I just tried to take a deep breath and enjoy it\nWell are you did and no doubt you will but there's something else for you to enjoy before we get to two thousand Nineteen and we kick off the season with you and the thirty one car and that's winning a championship and the NASCAR expertise series you head into this\nWeekend's race at Dover or elimination race number one\nYou are well to the good my friend you have you got a ton of room to work with you're going in there right behind Christopher Bell who's already locked in and you're going into a race track this weekend that can\nBe pretty intimidating what's it like going to Dover knowing that you're safe as far as championship contention is concerned but you can't get to comfy because\nIf something reach out and bite you then the whole thing turned upside down\n... exactly right I think it's it's honoring and respect and that part of a of a ... mile a nobody feels comfortable tomorrow what situation you're going to go there so you got to\nJust uh I think try not to try to look too much on on that thing out of it and just going to attack the place of had um you know some of the the best racism I'd ask my career at Dover New Hampshire a couple of either and solid\nAnd I think just from attacking the place and look forward to doing the same thing with like South Park hotel in several layers we go there and and um you know over the place that myself and Danny stock when I've really been on the same page\nAs far as what I Want what I Need out of the race card in really be good wants to play ... and give herself a shot in Iran so I'm not going to be in the first round 'em all we had a shot in the house and it's like I said with Richmond which was probably my\nSecond uh second favorite track up and look forward to getting through throughout the playoffs and\nI'm looking forward to doing it with a fast race car and hopefully having a shot and it's all said and done\nDover is quite the thrill ride very fast race track in you slam down into the corners and you get launched up onto the straight away is what's that sensation feel like\nOh it's a sensationalize you can't even explain to anybody um I recently found out that actually the ride along their people and go and fans and go experience of what it's like in the closest one that you can but they're from the driver's seat you know driving and turned on and having a racetrack fall out from underneath\nThe suspension of the race car in the lateral vertical do you feel in your body is unlike in the world you go and\nTake that kind of multiply that in the race was once the rubber built so all the sensations changing that changes\nThat are really really rapid rate or from from practice to race from McCall supplied come out you pick the rubber backup\nLook stations change again so it's keeping your body and your self acclimated and then moved back from as fast as possible to go changes I think part of the success that we've been uh been fortunate to have their hopefully we had just a little bit more to go there if we can\nYou hear us describe all of this I Begin to get to thirty pm eastern the bar harbour two hundred on motor racing network Daniels the rest of the NASCAR explicitly series\nAnd slithering through the mayhem it was Ryan ... who took the checkered flag and he joins us now here on NASCAR live congratulations dry and welcome back to the show and wow what a win for you guys on Sunday\n[noise] they'll appreciate it um [noise] you know the wild race you know a pretty\nPretty tough weekend for everybody um but that new configuration of tractor oval that was a not a lot of people really what to expect and um [noise] you know it we had a pretty strong Carl day you know we're we were in the points um we had to have a really good day we're only four did a good so\nOur our strategy calls I thought there at that they were great ... that's the way that stage or that really put us in this position towards the end of the race a three star to part of the front and we've got the third there on the restart and a half in the last quarter we're with to capitalize on that so\nLittle surprising I wasn't expecting that at all and um I've never been that way before our two leaders like each other but um you know we'll take it and um but now it's just go that way to capitalize on something like that happening\nCurious what was the car radio sounding like as you're you're going through all too and onto the back stretch and through the through the inter loop the ... there and did someone key up and tell you that the leaders were wrecking did you need them to key up until you that\nI'm I'm you know so when I went through the when I was exiting the extra sick she came um I saw the seven eight forty eight really close to each other and one little thought with remind them like him something might happen here\nBut I'm honestly I was ... I was happy with where we're going to finish what we were going to be in to the next round on points than we did our job for the day and um\nUm will take it and move on and then once I got off of the old track turned four and I got breaking into the last ... ah I saw the forty eight sideways and then I guess ... ... ... ... and um when I saw both of them spinning\nOr that's when the radio really lit up and uh you know just when I was brought her yelling at me get through you and I almost wrecked\nTrying to go to fast to make sure I beat those guys I didn't know if you're going to get straightened out and keep going but we'll often in the last corner and trying to get through there is because like it but um yeah you know when something like that happens it's just unexpected and are\nThere you're almost like you're watching that when something like that happens in gonna miss your corners but I'm like I said it it uh we had a little bit of luck on our side and um [noise] but you know the same time we put ourselves in that spot\n'em all day and and I'm ready to come away with it but uh yeah it was it was definitely um [noise] a lot of emotion on the radio or just a little bit of surprise and a kind of hard to process what just happened but um but all seem to go forth I'll ... I'll ... I'll be in that spot some time I'll be leading a run in second\nDirect direct a leader and in third place away and it all kind of comes full circle but a Sunday was already I guess to a\nLady luck on our side so\nGoing into the race we heard a lot of you guys talking about how you anticipated it to play out one way a lot of contact a lot of chaos and we got a little bit on Sunday but we didn't get as much as everyone thought we would why do you think that is and why was the expectation settled a lot of contact\nYeah yeah you know that's both really everyone when everyone was talking about leading up to it was always going to be your best that we're going to spend more time with her ... and ... and the first two stages were really call you know super super calm and\nUm I we saw that next to raise the day before I was a really clean race to it and a lot of accidents I mean I think that's just because everyone respected each other and a race in each other really hard but but not just running all over each other so\nThat was a that was pretty cool to be a part of a with a lot of respect in showing that they are but since I'm a lot of heart racing but um [noise] yet it you know you never know how these things you know plant honestly when you go to a new place\nLike that and experience you expect the worst just because you know that's just kind of your mindset you I got it I Want to expect the worst and if it's better than what I expected then it's going to be a good day and um I just think people were afraid of that because it's a big unknown you know\nAnd all of the the troubles people we're having in practice and things like that and\nI say I think it calmed down a lot of the race because we're all in a group you know it and in practice you saw a lot of cars reckon just because you're trying to make last time\nAnd trying to get every outside of your car and in the race when you're kind of racing other people and and you're judging I'm kind of where they're breaking zones are and stuff like that I think it it kind of calms everything down so that was a little bit unexpected I you know we had we had a couple you know that big wrecking the one they're\nTowards the end of the race but that was really the only big Iraq you know with the last ... couple of correspond but yeah it was\nA it was called which was a ... which is nice but at the same time there was a lot of heart racing going on around ... more coming up with Ryan Delaney\nOrange dot com has you governor out our original digital ...
