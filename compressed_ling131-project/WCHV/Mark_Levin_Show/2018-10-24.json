Seventy five FM am twelve sixty WC H. B. [noise]\nIs NASCAR live now facts of Mike badly\nThank you so much for joining us on this week's NASCAR live as we head into Martin's bill speedway this weekend one of the questions on everyone's mind and act Raj is how to make a race car go faster over the weekend in Kansas are Alex Haley had a chance to catch up with Ryan Newman screwed Jean Luc Lambert and find out what that recipe consists of\nYou know it's a it's a lot like a a a short track that a lot of guys I'm In a sport grew up on and I'm a lot of the a lot of the things that we have to focus on top of course the weekend or keeping up with a racetrack keeping up with a rubber that's down on the surface and that changes from the town that we get there and and start our first practice until you get\nYou enter keeping up with a racetrack keeping up with a rubber this down on the surface and that changes from the time that we get there and started first practice until you get\nInto the race and it starts getting really black for so I'm Will ah will be trying to keep up with that and trying to make a car that has really good long run performance in ah keeps tires\nKeeps tabs on it late in the wrong because you got to run a lot of laps and uh that's where the that's where the money gets paid out as as having a car that can uh can far off good with decent speed but but really be good late late in the long run\nIn late ... of the month of October running in the foothills of the mountains obviously the colder temperatures concrete corners what kind of challenges to that present\nYeah you know the the temperatures of of the the atmosphere when we're there is going to dictate kind of how the rubber gets lay down and that that'll change the way the weekend goes for so we'll we'll be watching that um as we approach this weekend and and seeing a what we predict will happen first during the race and that'll influence what kind of set of decisions we make going into the race\nIs a condensed weekend meaning practice all on Saturday qualify race all basically come compacted there are you a fan of that and if if so what do you like about that and what are the pros and cons\nI it's a challenge I'm excited for the for the new a challenge that we're there we're looking at it does present some\nSome opportunities for us but also some uh some some different things that we need to consider so\nUm I think that uh still comes down to having the right car for the race I'm qualified as important there but it's not as important as having long run speed you've you've got to be able to have a car a run late in the run keep the tires on it we've had tire where issues there and a lot of times when it gets cold does get worse didn't seem to be the case in the spring\nBut that'll be one thing that will be ... trying to stay on top of it but\nI'm the ah the format with the impound and and not being able to work on the cars for qualifying will make stepped away our our decisions heavily towards race for him\nAnd Alex hating joins us now on NASCAR live after spending time with Luke Alex and talking about the condensed weekend seems like that's such a departure from the norm from these teams I Can't imagine just trying to make sure everything is buttoned up and perfect by the time race day comes considering that you're doing it in such a shorter window\nYeah no question about it Mike and I think the the biggest factor about this is your race car better be right when it leaves the race shop because with this condensed weekend means you have your old ... a few minutes on the on the track or practice\nAnd if you have to go chasing the set up for the race car because the symbol is off just a bit at the race shop or whatever the case may be going to put you even further behind the eight ball so time is precious this weekend at Martin's\nWell and you can also factor in that yeah that cars got to be right when the leaves the shop but you can't afford to have any inspection misused either and you have to either go around or you lose practice time and all that I think I think the same time is up the essence of Martin's would be an understatement\n[laughter] yeah no question about it so yeah there there's there's pressure on these ... pressure on the car cheats and everybody at the race shop who prep sees race cars let alone once you are in love with the car race track you better have everything buttoned up and ready to go because\nThis condensed weak and while it can be a great thing for re famous if everything's pardon the pun hitting on eight cylinders or if things are a little bit behind and you're chasing your tail somewhat yet time time can be very valuable you could find your self on the eight ball in a hurry\nAnd of course speaking of that Martin's build this weekend is race one in the round of eight we've got stops at Texas and I assume Raceway in Phoenix coming up on the top foreign points well then transfer over to the championship deciding race and homes that Miami speedway a short track a mile and a half\nA mile race track Alex what you're telling me about how the round debates going to play out here over the next three weeks\nWell I think Martin still is\nThe way a short track a mile and a half mile race track Alex what you're telling me about how the around debates going to play out here over the next three weeks\nWell I think Martin's bill is one of them that's going to be kind of a toss up because I can see any of those eight drivers realistically getting up there and battling for the win I mean we we've seen Kyle Busch access their harvests let a lot of laps there\nAre obviously chase LA it was in position to win this race a year ago he's been very good there boy or knows how to win it it's just a a great test and and I think it's going to be fun to watch how that plays out when you get to the mile and a half at\nTexas motor speedway that can be kind of favors the the steward horse racing cars and the reason being and it's no secret in the garage the Rauscher tourists power they have\nFantastic top in speed that's where there are the best when the rpm stay high and that's the type track that Texas is now the Toyotas on the other hand are fantastic with the lower in their airpower band if you will is at the lower end of the rpm gauge so\nI assume Raceway is the next ten can give Toyota it a bit of an advantage although Kevin Hart at because one many times at Munich so I I like this rounded three completely different types of race tracks three different types of uh styles that these drivers must adapt to it I think it's a great test to see who are final or will be\nAnd you know you talk about Kevin Harvey I'm surprised he's yet to win a playoff race you mentioned his successes that I asked him Raceway\nI don't even know if he can bank on that I I think this is an up for grabs type of around but even though they're still good they're not as good as they had been in the past just for the simple fact that they are still to claim a checkered flag in the playoffs\nYou know while that's true there's there's no denying any of that I I Would tend to look at the ... the other direction I think they have been in a position to win not once but twice so far in the playoffs easily\nThink back to Dover Kevin Harvard was the dominant car until they had that missed your ... wrote that just that fluke thing were outlawed nut knock the valve stem off and he had to come back to ... wrote under green lost all of his tracked position so he dominated the first half of that race was well on his way to winning it\nThen if you look back this past weekend is well I can just Harvey was the dominant car again until a self inflicted dust up that road speeding penalty relegated him to mid back and he was back there and all that dirtier couldn't do anything with it so\nWhile you're right he's yet to win I still think Kevin heartbreaking that four team led by Rodney ... they are doing quite well they've got to clean up these little mistakes that are happening uh these ancillary type things when you come to ... wrote which we all know is a necessity in NASCAR Racing\nIf you can be mistake free down their chances are harder it's going to win and he's been in position to do that already I look for him to win at least one of these next three\nAnd his next shot isn't the first day the five hundred coming up Sunday Martinsville live coverage on the motor racing network begins at one thirty pm eastern time ... dropped by NASCAR live Alex have fun at the paper clip this weekend\nLook great forward to it thanks for having me on\nThank you sound like say coming up we'll hear from rusty Wallace and later Eric ... will join us [noise]\nOnce they leave here Sunday night three races to go so I mean the intensity has ratcheted up to you know is off the charts and people remember last year's rice how exciting that was finished under the lights were starting at two thirty Sunday probably do

the Martinsville Speedway grandfather clock we hear about it all the time but what is the history of that walk the ball the trophies that you can give out why did you folks go to the grandfather clock has that trophy\nWell it goes back to my grandfather player old who started the place and the ... the manufacturing facility that that made those clocks was just about three miles down the road from the track here so that family and my family had a connection and\nAnd my grandfather just decided hey let's let's give them my grandfather clock it's something that's meaningful to them and it's not just the trophy there's going to set off on the corner of a room and collect dust and you know kind of like ...\nIt's something that's meaningful to them it's not just the trophy there's going to set off on the corner of a room and collect dust\nAnd you know kind of like a hotdog you you do things that ah ... you started in over a period of time and that's been sixty some years now at the clock\nIt just has grown into a\nYou know you hardly hear the word Martin's will speedway without the word grandfather clock attached to it so it's become one of the most cherished sought after a you know everybody wants that clock and I can't tell you how many times I've heard drivers get out of the car and the first words they say to me is whereas my grandfather clock they love it and some guys that's the only\nThat's the only trophy so to speak they have in their house so that that does a lot for what that means to the guys and you know we were glad we have something so\nUh we'll sought after as that grandfather clock\nBy the way you can go to Martin will speedway dot com and check out the history of that clock it's a it's quite a history behind that by the way you brought up the
