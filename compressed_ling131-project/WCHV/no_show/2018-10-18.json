oh okay well\nUm I work at a truck driver never on I'm On a buying a house later in life like retirement and I'm Wondering a law that idea on how to invest that extra money I have to buy a house in ... now you know that's\nA good question how old are you a fifty four fifty for near single Hanukkah and how many years do you think before you buy a house\nI'm I'm thinking oh it's still\nOkay All right cool but as long as you got more than five years I Would use a simple growth stock mutual fund or a series of them\nFor something like that I probably would just use an index fund because it will grow virtually without paying taxes on it until you pull it out as a what's called a low turnover ratio which means the taxes aren't charge much on the growth until you cashing in\nAnd so I'll start a business in the five hundred and fund an index fund and use that to grow for the next five ten years or so and do you buy a house\nAs long as you leave it alone as long as you're planning to leave it alone at least five years you can survive the gyrations of the stock market and you should be fine\nIn that and that that's exactly what I Would do I do a similar thing Scott and sometimes I've got some extra money and I'm just saving up for my next real estate purchase as an investment\nAnd um even if I don't have five years in that case I'll ride the market with it and I because I can afford for it to go down if I mess up a little bit but yeah\nSmith and um even if I don't know five years in that case I'll ride the market with it and I because I can afford for it to go down if I miss a little bit but yeah that that's the direction I Would go good question Robby is one of those in Pittsburgh hey Robbie welcome to the ranch\nIn Asia and Dave how are you better than I deserve what's up\nOh thank you so much for taking my call yeah I had a quick question uh so I Am a nurse or by profession and my wife is a nurse and that that is I'm Wondering if I should go back to school again next year\nOr so my question is if they work for me to go to school now I'm thirty two years old and my wife is\nUh twenty nine we make a combined income right now after a two hundred and a two hundred and twenty thousand\nA year um so if I go to school it's going to cost me ... years of not working\nAnd intuition off around Ninety thousand dollars ... uh but uh our gross income after I go to school and be successful and yeah that would be close to a three hundred thousand mhm so uh\nBut it's a year now\nAre right now around Seventy thousand\nOkay you're saying there's going to cost you a three hundred room three years and you have um three years of Seventy thousand missing plus nine out of pocket yeah okay can you cash flow than on the out of pocket and can you live on her income or you're doing this\nI can live on her income for sure that's how we did it when she was in school and um but I don't think I can catch anything right now because I and I also don't have a house or at the moment so I was you know planning on buying a house\nOr are putting it leads to putting it down payment for a house next year before I start school so\nThen you need to wait until you can pay for school or whatever but you never in Thirty years we're doing the show recommended to borrow money to go to school okay you got the cash flow to do it it's just a matter when you do it and once you put first where people are checking you might plenty of money to come up with ...\nYeah plenty of money and you don't have to have the whole money up front you just got to see in your budget how you can cash flow would um I can see it pretty easily ... to take to go through the clash again or go now that it it it it's a three year program so thirty grand a year\nOr thirty grand a year yeah and and she makes what a she makes a hundred and fifty thousand you can't cash flow thirty granted a hundred and fifty\nA wrong not when I'm not in cool\nNo if you're in show she makes it a hundred and fifty thousand dollars in ... thirty thousand over a hundred and fifty to go to school year for three years\nI I'm Sorry fifty thousand it's it's a it's going to be around a sixty thousand a year\nI thought you said it was Ninety thousand I'm Sorry I I got that wrong it's it's a sixty thousand a year seems high yeah it is that is a it is an expensive program you know go to a less expensive program okay\nCasual whenever you're going to pay for it\nFigure out what to pay for the times you go you know there's certainly have an all stop stacked up ahead of time but you got to see where it's going to come from I Would not recommend you don't get student loans because here's the thing everyone the sharks that program doesn't finish it but every one that takes out student loans just aren't that program has on student loans that they've finished or not\nAnd then you've got what's known as a freaking mess\nAnd so I'm not suggesting you're dumber you can't pass the test or something like that my life happens do in the last thing you want the only time debt works deserve everything works\nYeah senior Dahmer you can't pass the test or something like that the life happens do in the last thing you want the only time debt works is if everything works other than that that doesn't work and so we tell you to stay away from it thanks for the call open\n... light eight to five five two to five

they only go actions\nUm they're like own medical bills um went into the car they got 'em rethought the cause of the ... I lost my job\nAnd that I think I think like a phone bill and then there too mhm\nOkay so how much is the ...\n[noise] I'm actually only like a couple of grand on bill it gets to have on there is\nA nine nine thousand\nFour hundred and forty five dollars from an old apartment mhm how long ago it was a three and a half years ago okay and how ... how much how old is your medical data again\nI Would say about to dial it\nMuch other than that if you go\nTo the rest of it is it makes the narrow like when I saw a ... I think that phone bill and the olive payday Lowe is well you know\nSo your your total that's less than twenty thousand dollars\nRight and then I have um my car which is a twelve thousand mhm okay and what do you make a year\nI'm a little bit off for forty five I make a thousand a week I'm a independent contractor\nMhm and you're single or married you're married or\nI'm twenty eight on Saturday the\nHappy birthday does she work outside the home\nI'm no she stays at home and takes care daughter\nOkay well\nLet me tell you what I'm hearing okay and I think I'm hearing maybe I'm wrong I'm a ... cat used to say that debt is not the problem is is a symptom\nOf something else that's going on I'm right and it sounds like you guys have never told your money what to do you've never had any savings for emergencies so every time an emergency comes up you get thrown out of an apartment suit your car gets ... and you end up with a mess\nYes they're so we've got to get you on a plan where you are telling your money what to do or you're going to be back here if I'm going to want to ... go way which is what bankruptcy might do maybe I'm if it did that made you have zeroed out all of a sudden except your car\nIf you don't change the habits that causes ... in the first one as you will be back right where you are some day do you agree\nYes there you know so we really need to get under that says bankruptcy doesn't solve that are you going to solve that in the mirror you and your wife learning how to handle money I don't think you're bankrupt I think you're scared disorganized don't know what to do and have done nothing so far\nI think you can probably settle that old apartment that for three or four grand if you saved it up and offer them a lump sum settlement\nUh I'd I'd actually calls them ... multiple times that I started listening to you know they were the first video that I was looking out for the tie to get that collect bears you know for months\nWe call them a multiple times where I thought that was the first video that I Will look it up and try to collect there's you know under you\nKnow it doesn't change my answer to whether it's governor thirty thousand new film of Ankara\nIt's all about you getting control of your money\nAnd when you do that then you're going to see your way through this bankruptcy is not that problem but have you got your\nPoint of view out almost total money make over both read that take an extra job sell everything in sight and let's get his mask cleaned up I'll throw you out of\nIt was meant by\nThose are the rams you show [noise]\nOne of the smartest things you can do is take good care of your teeth that will save you tons of money in the long run to help I recommend all my listeners checked out one dental dot com it's not dental insurance one dental as a dental discount program that functions like a membership club\nVery cool as it should be well done very well done and we're proud of you you guys are amazing great job well I got a copy of course always before you retire inspired number one best selling book and that's the next chapter in there's nowhere to go on and be millionaires\nNow and be outrageously generous as you're going on\nMy health thank you\nYou wouldn't believe the percentage of millionaires in the study that we just did a a word in the military for Fifteen or Twenty years at the twenty year mark and other second career sometimes the numbers that were career military all the way through\nAnd um they use sometimes a twenty year military retirement and then the second career on top of that had to pull them into serious well so you've got a great position very very cool stuff\nAll right Chris in San Diego California sixty three thousand dollars paid off in twenty two months making fifty fifty nine counted down let's hear a debt free screwed up\nOne two three we had\nVery very well done [noise]\nTrisha is in Huntsville five Tricia how are you I'm good thanks how are you better than I deserve what's up\nCalling about my mom um I'm not really sure how to handle her situation she had taken ... three times over the past few years and she had to file for bankruptcy and now she doesn't know how to manage your money\nJust to kind of name she doesn't know that she just won't do it\nExactly and now he's going to have to have surgery on her ... and she's coming to me because you have to file ethanol right that she's going to have to be without her paycheck and St Tammany that she can't\nMaintain that said hey I'll let you can find today mhm\nWhat's ... what's the surgery on the wrist\nHad I not something that's very painful and it's out of here and a half to ... you know homes have been there\nI'm probably for about a year or so\nOkay well I think this was her wake up call\nOkay I think it's time for her state work long enough to build up enough pay pay in a savings account to be able to survive the time the shoes off while she was only ...

I was going to say through through um his his friendship with Senator Harry Reid but that's not that's not entirely correct and I don't want to do this service hair he beat for the ... contract quite quite openly in legitimately and through the the standard contractual\nProcedure and he don't have a large chunk of that a tip work but of course justice the government requires that people selling their the secrecy oh it's so\nAll right but of course justice the government requires that people selling their their secrecy how it's\nSo robot big yellow and and um his organization had everyone under nondisclosure agreements so actually the people involved in this work what kind of um stone twice\nSo to speak they had they had to have government security clearances but also the commercial non disclosure\nAgreement so so again there is a lot of this story that we don't know and that's the other thing in in aliens at the Pentagon and I've seen a lot of you know you pick up the the media um reports of this you go onto the bulk some forums you see a lot of speculation\nI was always taught at the ministry of defense\nOr you know when I was doing analyst with for example a briefing you must always differentiate between ... you know and\nWhat you're saying and that's not a skill that everyone practices when they they make films documentaries but I Try to be rigorous on that and and we don't even speculating I say I'm speculating and when I'm not I'm not so\nHopefully even though there are large parts of the story we still don't know I'm only ... about where we don't know that these things\nThe bottom line what\nWell [noise] I I didn't want to I don't want to get too far into spoiler I I think one one thing that I Can't say which I think it's a\nPretty good summary off of what I think has gone down\nIs that I Would say their laws\nAnd then use that would deliberately a believer faction if I can call it died within the U.S government and some of those people were permanent employees and some were can tractors and this believe a\nFraction so that the phenomenon was on the radio\nAnd and they were to write and that of course\nDidn't entirely know what to think that\nDidn't rule out the possibility that they were dealing with something extraterrestrial paranormal and actually then I Believe a function became or or certainly interacted with overlapped with with a tip [noise]\nAnd they effectively\nI guess ... when John ... to\n... those those beliefs and those hypotheses within government with taxpayers' money and and that of course given us in an interesting opportunity to find out about this because\nAnd I hope we'll we'll have time to get into this late but now of course talk of congressional hearings to to get to the bottom of this but\nBut the bottom line to answer your question is is that I think it was a believer find ... they made them move they came up against some road blocks\nCouple of different road blocks one road block with they simply going to a point where you know they they looked at this and\nAnd they investigated but because they didn't get a definitive answer the feeling was that they'd taken it as far as as they couldn't what else can you do the other sort of wrote block but they had this is very controversial is they hit us\nA call it's a religious road block from from some\nRoad block but they had this is very controversial is the hitter\nCalled it a religious road block from from some senior people in the Pentagon who frankly for that you I thought it was from the paranormal with him on it and therefore didn't didn't think what we should be having anything to do with it\nWell do we do\nDo we want to do so well\nI mean um it it was studied whatever the it was but I I as I say that there were people in the Pentagon ... who who's deeply conservative religious beliefs\nLead them to think that they are dealing with it they don't make a demonic\nPhenomenon here and like come on I've come up again there's a couple of times in in the u._k. as well at the ministry of defense in fact one of one of my bosses was I'm a ... you know they're pretty extreme with the S.\nAnd indeed the the individual who wrote the declassified intelligence assessment\nOn on UFOs in the ministry of defense ... project ... he would have wanted to get to go too far down that road he had some slightly old beliefs as well and there's a passage in the Bible\nIn the book efficiency I think it is where it refers to cite as being the prince of the power of the air and and I think he's where a lot of these conservative religious\nPeople get the idea of the U.S how this might be demonic\nAnd there were a lot of religious folks that believe that\nYes and and it's it's frustrating in a sense because and and it's almost ... ironic in another way that that you know you have a bunch of people\nEven in the Rio de da da and and in the u._k. and the ministry of defense had a bunch of people who thought yeah this we're dealing with a real phenomenon and we should be\nInvestigating yet researching it in a ... a scientific manner and we come up again skepticism and you might think well that's fine that's that's what you'd expect 'em\nThat skepticism isn't the sort of\nClinic who are intellectual\nOr humanists skepticism that I think most people\nI associate with that concept it's actually it's a deeply trying to belief driven skepticism itself I mean it to to have effectively the so called us either skeptics in the Pentagon and um\nSay that they don't they don't believe in extraterrestrials but they believe these things demonic well it's just in one sense it's swapping one arguably fringe belief for another so we'll at least by these people wouldn't skeptics told they would\nI Know about

do you think at all but the alien presidents appears to have any kind of threat to us as a human species\nWell this is talk of them were grappled with a lot\nAt the ministry of defense and I didn't find the um law to oil in the snow when the ten year program to the class finally heavily into the question\nLast two files in in the what's now being a ten year program to declassify lease them\nGo heavily into the question of whether there is or isn't a threat and how could you tell and who should make that assessment and in fact um it it gets quite\nFractious um between different divisions in the ministry of defense and and some of the the letters make quite amusing reading\nAs as the intelligence people are telling some of the other people you know who do you think you are to suddenly put yourself into the role of of of an intelligence analyst and and you know you that's not your job and um what what the intelligence people\nConcluded they they made a a kind of analogy and they said\nI'm a ... if you don't mind actually go to document in front of me yeah this is a this\nActually hasn't officially been released yet\nI'm tonight it last night I'm\nThe same can them critical question is do you a piece represent a possible threat to the defense of the real we could argue that ceiling for the sake of the argument that something exists\nLay has never shown any hostile attend intent and therefore kennel represent a threat however Russian aircraft attempting to penetrate the u._k. defense reaching in the Cold War never showed hostile intent but they certainly represented the threat is\nThe only logical conclusion that we can come to is that we do not know if you a piece represent a threat to the defense of the brown\nAnd so this this gets quite interesting because ah parts of the the ministry of defense was saying to parliament the media and the public know there's there's no evidence of any threat here we we look at these things to see if there\nAre any defense interest but no no no sweat and yet into and they they were classified documents saying well look we just don't know we have not yet made a proper assessment and\nSo we we can't tell\nMe well what about the alien abductions on I mean wouldn't that be some kind of\n... it would be if we could absolutely say that it's it's physically rail and not not some sort of combination of hoaxes inside the logical delusions and\nAnd and other misunderstood phenomena the the other thing is of course we don't really know what's going on some of the people who claimed to have had these\nAbduction experiences say that it's really really traumatic and and suddenly researchers like part Hopkins and dates Jacobs a good will always\nYou know that this whole style and it's it's a threat on the other hand people like John Mack and and some of the other people who take him on new agents spiritual\nView of this talk about healing and things like that and it goes back to the idea of who who can really say I mean this sounds bizarre but in military um there is actually in a ...\nFor um working out whether there's a threat or not or all of this is the kind of them\nWe don't know the values but intelligence and military circles we say that threat is defined as being a constructive capability plus intent so so you look at the capability you look at the intent and then you would count\nConstructive capability plus intent so like you look at the capability you look at the intent and then you would count whether there's a threat and if there is what ... what kind of a threat\nIt is well we have some idea about the capability of you ate pay and and again that the file the ministry defense filed state like clearly you know pizza maneuvers\nWay in excess of anything that we've got so the capability we we know has a higher value what we don't have any idea about his intent if the if there is an intelligence behind this phenomenon and frankly we don't know what it is we don't know what it once\nWe it may be unknowable\nIn the u._k. the strong of a loyal\nTo march in Greece\nSpeculating about extraterrestrial intelligence and and agenda and motivation said it may be trying to process to try and figure this out he said it might be ... the analogy would be trying to explain quantum mechanics and you can find the\nWell we don't know what it is we don't know what they want to continue categorically scenic that it's happening\nI Can't say that abduction is happening no I I don't know that but I mean visitations visitation\nWell what I can say is that that seems to be strong and credible evidence that you a pay are real that hey do routinely penetrate tall already defense\nRegion um but in the u._k. the U.S and presumably elsewhere\nAnd they all seemed bite pilots they ... they performed speech and maneuvers that we can't match so in that sense yes this is a real phenomenon and of course we've now seen which brings us back to the ... story we've now seen those declassified videos of of navy\nF. Eighteen people on it chasing some of these things\nNow is a matter of fact let's talk about these ... ... what's your take on\nWell so far we got three three videos\nI'm pretty amazing do yeah I absolutely I if I sat\nDown and watch these things with um pilots with I I've actually being in a situation where I\nI I watch these things and been sitting around a table with with a commercial\nAirline pilot and I'm retired military pilots and we've we've bounced around and and nobody's saying that this is is fake or anything and of course of course it's it's not um [noise]\nWe don't know again and I I'm not one of these people you know sometimes I listen to people being interviewed makeup announcer for everything\n[laughter] I'm sure you've probably interviewed a few of them don't want to name any names I Hope he will will respect the fight but I'm not afraid to say I don't know\nWell I Do I mean because you're not a skeptic by any means but ... your research you're a darn good one and the scene that you don't know is that's fine with me\nThank you I mean I'm not no I think time I'm a skeptic no either I'm only a a ... hour all believe everything kind of person and again let's be honest they're all they're all quite a few in\nThis field I mean the real real life in my experience of looking at this government\nOh there are quite a few in this this field I mean the real real life in my experience of looking at this government the real real situation is is far more complex than than real or not real and skeptics persist believers and\nThe idea that there's ever going to be one solution to the U.S probably mystery is is I think\nYou know crazy I I just don't think it's going to pan out that way\nBut but to go back to your question yeah we've seen those three videos um we know that there are a more videos that I think will be something that will come over the next few weeks and months there is always the pressure\nGoing on behind the scenes to say well come on this doesn't happen in a vacuum these sorts of incidents have been going on for years\nUm we have a number of pilots home rankled talking about there there must be many many more videos Lou Elizondo has said that there are other people involved\nIn in school they have said that there are of course none of these people\nWant to preempt ... the cod or the CIA and and any other agencies involved might decide on that so I mean I think if if people stop talking about stuff that's genuinely still classified and the government hasn't released those people will end up getting a

you know she wasn't there but everybody in the town when she would go to visit her grandparents everybody would say oh you have to see the ... you know you'll\nLove it [laughter] what do you think that it's not a big deal you know\nNo well it's it's great to a point which is of goes it goes back to this this thing that I think a lot of people in this field do no\nI'm the idea that this phenomenon suddenly started in Nineteen forties having is of course crazy I mean people have seen strange things in the sky since the dawn of time but I think the other interesting thing about this this whole and these these familial wrecked elections is is the fact that\nYou know these these phenomena are always interpreted through the lens of of personal belief system and culture\nAnd and it is interesting when you come up against couches where where this this thing is is almost commonplace that it's it's like oh yeah you know that that's the thing we don't necessarily know what it is but yeah it's it's real\nInsurers reelection outta Andy Norwalk, California now why Andy Glyn\nHi George you're agreeing patron and Mr ... it's a real honor I listen to many times and you're very informed and or anything to listen to a two part question if I made a first of all a based upon all of your knowledge of\nThe western powers all of them made all countries and for that matter let's say the eastern bloc countries ... approximately how many as long as you've been following this how many uh aircraft and uh pilots have disappeared and this guy while pursuing\nSo called UFOs and are based upon your response I I have a second part a final question if I may\nMickey with us sorry I thought you were going to hit me with pot too straight away what what what are you for that will be down part one\nI'm ... now I'm going to sound a little bit skeptical on on this I Would say beyond through his last and then a lot of things that I've I've read in in the UFO and alternative belief communities\nI mean I've seen some people talk about pilots carry missing and and you ... and I think you know unfortunately flying is an inherently dangerous\nUm occupational certainly was in in the early days in a lot of motivate off just\nDisappeared because they crashed now now of course then you have\nYou have some ... cases\nA ... ... the mentality case he didn't disappear of course but he crashed chasing a UFO which skeptics say with the planet Venus we coming off of cost the fortieth anniversary of arguably the most\nFamous disappearance of old time involving a UFO Frederick Valentin\nFortieth anniversary of arguably the most famous disappearance of old time involving a UFO Frederick ...\nOh yes that was strange reason I think we're literally I used to weigh in Australia right\nYes I absolutely over the or is it by trade I think all the times men straight making the best straight is part of the past month the excuse me I'm geographically challenged in that you will but\nUm but I I don't buy into the room as that that I've heard that the pilots were whip\nXing and disappearing or all the time as a result of\nOf that we had a case in the u._k. tragic case involving a pilot who who just\nLouis I cross into the city in you know I think Nineteen Seventy it was during a night exercise and some people years later tried to attribute a UFO a story on to that but I pulled out the board of inquiry\nFile which was about two inches thick I went through every single pipe in lock filed and I couldn't couldn't actually substantiate any of these UFO rumors or think I think the answer the question is is very few\nNursing or what do you okay go ahead and they said oh okay so the second part question based upon your your response to this\nUh as you probably know during the Eisenhower administration there were so many aircraft that we're a suddenly a malfunctioning falling out of the sky and uh yes in some cases just suddenly disappeared that the Eisenhower administration gave\nThe order to\nStop the pursuit the aggressive pursuit by American aircraft obese UFOs or and secondly I spoke to Dr Heinrich ... before he passed away a Chicago radio station for about a five to seven minutes\nAnd I asked them what are the chances of\nA life or not existing on other planets and not coming and visiting us a and he said impossible that that was his response impossible so I I appreciate your perspective I Do personally believe\nThat they dominate the skies any time\nAnd every time that they come a within our airspace there's so many thousands tens of thousands and God only knows maybe millions of years and I had the bus they could be entered dimensional they could be ... are both but\nI don't think we're much match and they do have air superiority and [noise] I Do appreciate the other end of pleasure talking to both of you\nIn the Persian and will set by the way you know\nAnd and he made a really interesting point which goes back to something in the British Intelligence assessments project on the line and that was a I I don't like to cool it amusing but\nAh I it was kind of\nPoignantly amusing maybe ... that was a line about the flight safety and safety implications off you ate P. C. which goes directly of of close to the point just made\nAnd there was a recommendation in Port check combines final report and it said I don't know how it in front of me but but if I typically\nA pilot's encountering you a pay should take no action apart from trying to place the object is done in other words\nYou know whatever we dealing with here don't mess with it\nDon't mess with it at all we're going to take a break pretty soon\nYork jacked done in other words you know whatever we dealing with it don't mess with that\nDon't mess with it at all we're going to take a break pretty soon that can tobacco final phone calls but I also want to talk with you you've got a thriller out called blood brothers don't you\nI Do a kind of a different thing for you\nYeah I um although I Know for having run the program I did a lot of other things in my Twenty one years at the end of day in my final thing was in the direct threat to the security we did a counterterrorism and things\nLike that for I've written to find novel about alien invasion I decided to write a thriller about terrorism and counterterrorism and the intelligence agencies it's our turn\nNow and it's going to look back on I think November Fifteen\nSomething amazing happened which will you will see small I actually called ... almost staggering at least one dish that you could come back to bounce off but I kind of why is it might have results coming for\nClock it kind of are very close to ... excuse me ...\nAll the networks beautifully on Richard Haass throw here we're talking about the power of reading up your immune system who says he'll this gentleman's heart perhaps the immune system tend to call one of the bodies fears is powers to he'll visit\nC.

visited do you think most of them looked like the so called daily in Gray's that people described or do they will apply costs what do you think\nWell it's tricky question because I think the media kind of might have this kind of\nTrump or me or whatever you call it of of the alien gray and then it becomes a self fulfilling prophecy because I think when people say oh I've seen one of these aliens gray large head ... shaped\nIt gets reported but when when somebody says they see something that doesn't quite fit the mold maybe it doesn't quite make the cod or or get the coverage but in my experience when people work on and it just as when they report UFOs they come in all shapes and sizes\nAll they sure do what you just saw almost saying then that people basically they here this year this and then they think they see it\nYes I think that plays a big part in this but I Can't say what\nYes I think perception plays a big part in this but he ... and who who can say watch 'em well

told us money to be able to do in\nTerms of you know hiding themselves mosque unnatural appearance a deception I it's unimaginable so so again I think we're in this territory where\nWhat we watch what we think we see in perceive may be very different from the reality of what's going on and they may ultimately\nBe unknowable to us a species of our town level of development what you thought of ...\nWell it's it's clearly a it's clearly going to be some something eggs don't take I guess we are in in sort of\nStar Trek parrot tree in in one sense of some sort of foster light\nTravel ... again

I wanted to read about you know I I I decided when rock Obama came into the presidency I said you know I'm going to choose a founder and I'm going to start learning about the found this one style and it just happened to be washed\nAnd and you know the thing is is that uh you know the man\nDid you know that this this is the ... it's not it's not fact but it's a rumor that ah ah he he ended up or he didn't take the uh the body and the blood the Eucharist it at a church when he went to one of his fiscal killing in church\nAnd the minister said to him you know you were the president United States you're setting a bad example what why are you taking the body and the plot\nAnd uh and and he stopped going to church [laughter] but when he was on his own he was on his deathbed there's a rumor that he had a Catholic priest call his room while he was dying\nSo that he couldn't convert to Catholicism so there's a rumor that he became a Catholic and editing I'd ever heard of the Catholic Church you don't take body in the blood of any other church other than the Catholic Church you don't go to another church and take communion\nWell there was also a deep seeded feeling and this was part of the whole um Virginia act for religious freedom and so on and so forth that because the king command you do you do go to church than it was ... it was not wholly it was not\nAppropriate and that uh there was a distrust because the the king would use his power over the church to find out what the citizens were doing a and weaponize in the faith\nUm the in wholly inappropriate ways ah there's evil people\nShould learn about the founders and and they don't teach them in in the classroom but it was the animal and it runs\nInto their state because it was a big part of their lives they shouldn't shy away from the teachers should should tell the students yeah this person was the godly course\nThis person of bleeding and divine Providence when George Washington won a few battles or he is the weather changes in the middle of a couple of battles and one of them was a battle it just looks out and then at the ... after the battles ... he would say you know that was the ... the weather saved us\nAnd there's also asked me what do we know and then they should teach that stuff in the schools\nAnd that's it after the battles you would say no that was designed to the weather saved us well and there's also no matter what we know and then they should teach that stuff in the schools man well then you know why because they're secularists ... leaving this stuff and they don't make it in helping the body and that and that's why they need to feel\nThere's a humility factor that goes into that as well but that I don't think exists in our public swearing anymore or something that a ... one of them with other people's Washington never trusted as far as you can throw he always thought Jefferson was a little too much of an intellectual\nA for them but Washington trust the Jefferson enough to make ...\n... ... and and to help his buddy Madison get this constitution and put together\nBut one of the things that Jefferson wrote that I think ... is is that a government that's big enough to give you where everything is also a big enough to take them all away and that's where we are now that's where we are as it is that our factions have given us enough stuff\nThat they are now tell us listen if you don't support me you're going to lose all the stuff on bringing you are and and go into that restaurant and beat up anyone who's going to take away yourself\nSo all of a sudden we've become like this ... roaming heard of animals who are out there defending our feed rather than just being neighbors with each other and it said oh man\nIt's a big deal when when when uh people offer you charity\nAnd and you and your decline it\nAnd you're saying you know I'm a I'm a rough it out I mean they're not to the point where you're you know you're starving yourself or your children or anything like that but there you need this ethic now in our society where you know take care of you know I hear you and you would you would go out and you would love to live a certain lifestyle\nThat they didn't they demand that people give you the stuff\nYou know you work for what yet and\nI think that happened in Jamestown and I think they figured out in the\nHouse if you if you don't work\nOr in a hurry and it actually of these people you know survive and and and it's it's the individual man I mean at the heart pushing individual power the individual probably socialist mark I don't listen

eleven dollars a and it's been up and down like Wall Street has so but you have to go in and talk with them because they have the expertise to\nDenver Riggleman or Dave Brat or bend climbed you pick a Republican or they're going to you're not going to be able to get your prescription drugs you're not going to be able to get medical care a ... it's almost like Halloween they're playing trick or treat with it which is not the case but it makes for\nA frightening sounding mailers and and they're counting on driving those seniors into the polls under the fear of losing all their health care I mean it seems to me you're telling me that the impression is just the opposite of the seniors get the fact that\nI'm ... their health care is it any better on Google left and that they want some more freedom\nWell ... in a while I was talking to her mother who is in her late they lose their mother was an or eighty\nAnd moved here from California because of the\nWe have less of a axes than introducing California and\nHe was he was very very\nAdamant and very vocal\nRepublicans in Congress\nAnd spend a lot of Obamacare So mhm I'm not sure I'm not sure that I [laughter] I don't know if you're a stay at a website I knew that as\nBut but they're out there saying that the Dave Brat or Denver Riggleman is going to take away all of your health care which is not true of they're they're just like they do with broadband versus Internet or illegal\nAnd there's going to take away all of your health care which is not true of they're they're just like they do with broadband versus Internet or illegal immigration versus immigration they take one word twisted around like some sort of Orwellian nightmare and make it means something else in their rhetoric\nAnd then if you catch

pro public eye and Rolling Stone he said Joe I Love your show and you're absolutely right but I have a feeling this one's going to get you into some sort of trouble uh comparing pro public to Rolling Stone magazine\nOr lots of people love pro public because they seem to think it's some sort of adjunct\nTo National Public radio and NPR oh I hear this all the time from people that they uh sanctify pro public because they somehow think that it's removed from the pressures of mainstream media well it may be buddies are referring back to his\nStory that the New York times published on Monday written by ProPublica\nAre at the behest of his I enter Brian's I enter Brian is the Charlottesville high school student or who among many\nAchievements is the one that was afraid of the robber tea leaf statue\nAnd gave the metaphorical middle finger into her classmates at Charlottesville high school who had\nVoted overwhelmingly to prohibit and the word is being used individually and voted to prohibit the media from attending there memorial service\nAfter the Parkland shooting inside and Brian couldn't stand for that because what good is there being a tree falling in the woods if there's not a news cameras there into\nChronically so as I end up you know obviously feeling like nobody paid attention to her for a while got pro public could write a a Rolling Stone esque story\nOn the racial divides in our schools and showing how a ... these Jim Crow laws are still keeping the black kids down and that the statistically look at how many ... and others and this is why statistics\nAre considered manipulate of all it's not that the masses phoney baloney but the it's the interpretation of the mathematics what can you get the numbers to back me up with\nAnd there were a suit to subs types to this Rolling Stone esque story in pro public and the New York times about the racial divide in Charlottesville schools\n\nNumber one it's about as righteous as the Rolling Stone story about Jackie and rape on campus because yes I I denied none of this the test sticks that there are black kids who don't read as well as white\nKids but it is not a what's the phrase is there a charge somewhere in here councilor because believe it or not and this borders on me taking the side of our quarter million dollar school superintendent Rosa Atkins\nBut are you going to charge\nA quarter million dollar school superintendent Rosa Atkins but\nAre you going to charge or with racial discrimination because it sure sounds like that's what you're ... you're threatening and if you're not going to then your fish or cut bait\nBecause what you're doing is you're writing a column and publishing it in New York Times now other than in Charlottesville daily progress note\nShe she didn't call Warren Buffet and Yahoo News service the Yahoo daily progress\n\nTo publish this story being the Charlottesville newspaper why she didn't even call Warren Buffett's Yahoo Richmond Times dispatch\nTo publish this story she didn't even call the Amazon post in Washington\nShe got pro public are in there as Barry fairly put a lot of people give pro public to gravity because it's a pro public\nOr they're just trying to get click bait like TMZ as a matter of fact I think TMZ is been right more frequently than pro public or\n\nBut because we assigned this gravity to do these organizations it's not fair and it's not righteous in in Rolling Stone\nOr ... pro public uh there's\nThey're being used as full grooms to divide us and it's only to elevate people stature so that money can be sent on the end\nSo that so that some checks can be sent in the mail to do something about it and those same politicians in last segment I pointed out are out there saying they need comprehensive campaign finance reform will insist that if you vote for them they'll fix the racial problems\n\nAnd the second most dishonest thing in the story is thinking that another batch of left wing status are going to fix any sort of racial divide in achievement and there's racial divide in achievement that that is not that is without question there is racial divide in achievement\n\nBut there are two points of order number one it's not done specifically because one group is black and one group is white or Latino or Asian life right now\nMuch to the chagrin of the state is there's a class action suit out in front of the U.S Supreme Court climbing up well one of the ivy league gets Yale\nOr their quota system an admissions makes it harder for an Asian student to get into Harvard or Yale runner these Ivy League schools\n\nThis is what happens when the state is get involved\nWC age for you time six twenty seven so don't they don't sit there and listen to Leslie Coburn or any other city council candidate in Charlottesville tell you give me a chance and I can be the state is\nThat it's going to fix everything because uh like the pro public in New York Times Rolling Stone story its ally\nOf

an officer for comment and rescue estimate a hostile situation I'm\nTo to ... well I Can't imagine anyone arguing would be perennial all stars in bill and wall a lot of teams would have just been happy to say hey we just need to grow from there and tidy up a few things but the the the wizards went in and and brought in some big names\nSignificant I mean at first and foremost is Dwight Howard in and he's had a sore back\nAnd make people have sort of ... now but but uh there was no reason to believe it's anything anything serious and look here's a guy that did you look at is not going to be a future hall of famer and\nWhat do you could help this words which team do is become a better defensive team that's really what what would slip last year and a it was a year where you put up\nYou know I asked her by everybody deals with with issues but we miss John Wall for forty one game so you know he's healthy he's feeling good and and like all MBA teams you need your key players on the court ah most of the time they they they really can't miss\nHalf of the season for you to have the kind of season that that you that you want to have but then you're bringing a Jeff Greene who you know as you talk about your passion for bats\nHalf of the season for you to have the kind of season that that you that you want to have but then you're bringing a Jeff Greene who\nYou know as you talked about your past or bad for growing up it was the same with me when we were growing up you know everybody had positions you were a point guard your shooting on you were a small well now if you throw it out it's become position was basketball I mean you've got to be able to guard\nYou know one through four the traditional positions if you will see ever Jeff Greene who fits right into that that situation and it was a little bit on winning teams\nBrings up winning attitude you know we've never had a backup for shooting guard like Austin Rivers of his his caliber before so this is work it's got to be done on the court or what gives you that reason for excitement as all the way up to no one is is the body of work of the players that are on this roster and and you say look\nThis is a better team last year and so this is a team and outlook broaden last eastern conference where things are shake it up a little bit ah that that you want to believe can compete because just two years ago uh the wizards were one game away from the eastern conference final they need to get back to that level\nWell and was shot Brooks and having a season of finding out who besides you know on Wall you count on and certainly Bradley bills stepping out\nAnd and big games from ... and and like you said then you you looking guys who may be looking to put that championship onto that resume that saluted them do their\nCareers like Dwight Howard a you know that that's a motivator and and the Jeff Greene having seen it you know playing with LeBron and seeing what intend to the means and what getting a big stop means over a big dunk\nAh can mean to a team um I think that there are some really really exciting things going on\nThough I think we should have you on the broadcast and I've had a better that Twitter as well as you do [laughter] I don't know about that that you're showing your your basketball is true it real or your God it's so like a\nPlace that they are recording us whatever you just said I'm going to say tonight on the on the block as the wizards and ...\n... but your point is exactly right I mean these guys\n... is coming in the best shape of his life and and like he's got the biggest target on his back at you know what that means he's found other ways to score penetrate we've watched these spin moves in the uh the pre season that that okay you're you're gonna run him off the three point line and he can he can burn you\nYour job all these are guys now there are no longer babies and the career and and you know part of what you were just saying if they\nYou know the White House and he ... he understands he's now a legacy part of his career uh the the title I mean we we expected\nUm Dwight Howard day with his skill set in his dominance that okay that guy is going to win a title at some point um and and you know I almost liken it to a\nUh we're getting along and the two so to speak with with Alex Ovechkin and people say wait a minute is he never going to win a\nA Stanley Cup title and any ... any change that I'm not saying the same mentality or or ask for it but it's it's the same kind of feeling when players reach ten twelve Thirteen Years in the NBA that you know okay now it's down is about the legacy but I'm not leaving behind\nAnd and that's where I I think that there's a special in South Bronx has shown that he has the ability to to get all the parts are working together I mean I I cut my teeth in Madison Square garden watching a Patrick Ewing and a\nAnd a ... Pitino electrify a crowd more for the defense of stops a than the ... passes in the in the paint so that's and that's the part that I\nI think Scott Brooks brings it real quick on the coaching staff I'm ... ... ... talk and talk about the addition she brings a too\nI'm In ... ... talk and talk about the addition she brings to the NBA and the NBA reaching into the WNBA and and here in Charlottesville women's basketball has you know we were one of the pioneer places at UVA for women's basketball\nUh and uh and and they see the NBA saying well this isn't a a a gender specific game if you get if you've got skills you've got skills\nNo exactly and it's and that's the beauty of of a basketball and and the beauty of it it's so competitive uh so you need to be innovative and you need to say you know what we need to maybe listen to different voices um you could argue\nOr not argue but the women's basketball game is a is a little you know different brand of basketball and I I'm not saying you know one is better than the other I'm just saying it's it's different because the size or whatever because of that you\nKnow each learn from the other end I think that's what's happened with with with Christie ... through the summer league where she she cut her teeth and the players really reacted well to to her and and and then it continued throughout a training camp and\nSo I think you know as you're looking as teams are looking for ways to get better it's it's you know when I started doing this a hundred years ago there was\nOne head coach want assistant coach and that was it fortunately the the game has grown to the popularity where\nYou can have larger status but it's not just about people it's what you do with those people and and the and the people you select and and ah Scott books and Christie ... somebody that we're we want to shoot more threes we want to better be a better ... points shooting the volume team she understands that concept\nA from her experiences as being a a lead player in in in college and and also there's still a player in fact she is she's not retiring from playing yet so that's what might be the first where we have somebody who's going to be coaching in the winter and and then playing for the mistakes that are women's team in the in the summer so\nI I think that's what makes the the NBA uh exciting a league is is that it it doesn't\nStand still it's not the same old and it's constantly adapting both on and off the court ah with with the times and you know that's that's part of the times the development women's basketball\nContinues to grow and and there's there's a synergy there now with the with the men's team that that you know we're going to see it in every practice with first to tell her involved\nAbsolutely and the you know I got to remind you your GM knows a thing or two about those Knicks team says well\nYou already ground phones he's very much these days president buddies

dot com and Corey good to hear from you my friend how're you doing today sir\nHey Joel thanks for having me on this morning I appreciate it\nOr you sell a habit of shoes left to make it through November sick so I Know you've been wearing the shoe leather outgoing and shake and pretty much every hand in Virginia\nBut I got to tell you something or we're going to win this thing and we definitely worked harder than Tim Kaine and uh we're going to win the everything is pointing up or I'm telling you if there's a different feel out there are people are a very energized on our side\nWell if the number of emails I get each morning from McCain campaign telling me what you're going to do to me if you're elected there are any indication that he certainly believes it so [laughter] that's what it's worth\nThey sent out a ... this TV ad it's a core a third as dangerous and then I say darn right down I mean I'm dangerous to the to the to the establishment of dangerous to the things the way things are the U.S that I'm going to go in there and stir things up\nA and of course Tim Kaine finds that dangerous well ah for for most Virginia that's Virginia's has a good thing when you're just there are things up the U.S Senate\nWhy no away every time I'm anywhere where there are any any Corey store yard signs they've managed in a heartbeat so uh I Know they're getting out there on the yards or even around the city of\nCharlottesville talking talking about this and obviously this is a a moving target in Saudi Arabia in Turkey and the the uh Islam is reporter or a columnist or they vanish is the reformer prints and all this but you know these are the things that make international\nRelations you know so important to have somebody who understands how this stuff works like you know you made a career working in international trade Corey so this is the stuff that really you know it I Can't say a gentle touch or a delicate but a deep understanding of what's going on and all these places\nYou know one thing we have to understand it's a show he was not a good guy himself a no of course we we don't want a encourage any regime including the Saudis\nAre too you know to do something gruesome as the ... uh but at the same time we've always known that the Saudis have human rights abuses we oh we've always known that a lot of regimes across the world that have human rights abuses\nAre but if we do with the Democrats want us to do which is to put sanctions on these countries and so forth the only thing that's going to happen is you're going to have a pro US regimes like the Saudis or they will collapse and then you're going to result a with a with an anti US\nPro terrorist regime and Saudi Arabia and not only will they have an additional human rights abuses by the right to have a regime that's against the United states so you know we don't have a there's no there are no Mother Teresa run regimes out there and this is the fact of life\nAnd um you know that's why but the president is doing by pursuing an America First\nA foreign policy that's the right thing to do\nWell and and energy policy to and and you know this is you know one of the first times in my adult life where\nSomething is happening in the middle east and the lead story in every news coverage is what will America do without all the oil at least now where a net exporter in in oil and natural gas and energy resources so what happens here is much more along the lines of human rights\nNatural gas and energy resources so what happens here is much more along the lines of human rights and things like that and and proper behavior of a governing body a you know and their own internal matters and we don't have to worry about whether or not our petroleum resources are going to go away\nWell that's right that's a much bigger problem for the Europeans and the reason for that is because the United states under President Trump has been pursuing a pro oil and gas and coal\nAh exploration program we have our own resources or the world's largest producer of combined oil and gas and very soon we will be a net exporter and that means we're not going to be reliant on the Saudis or anybody else in the middle east for that matter\nAnd that means we're not going to have to send our troops over there to defend a these regimes and that's good for a national security is good for our men and women in the armed forces it's good for the United states\nUh but what we can't do is be naive and our foreign policy and think that these regimes that that are pro United States that they're always going to have you know ill or human rights practices of course they aren't\nUm then but if we if we undermine them we undermined the Saudis if we undermine our allies I have human rights abuses the only thing you're going to get a return\nIs an anti US regime that will threaten us national security and trust who may be supporting terrorism you know uh and uh and who will have their own and human rights abuses so uh although we should uh obviously be concerned about the Saudis apparently did\nUh we should not jeopardize relationship with them over this incident\nWhat's the expression be in the room and as long as we ever relations and we can be in the room with people in and work on their human rights issues uh at at a table rather than a you know across the pond or across the fence line\nCorey ... talking about some of the more internal issues is a matter of fact this has come up with a couple of times people have asked me\nAbout the school security in some of those issues I guess it's been quiet for a while so people\nUh you know as the campaigns get closer some of the stories like Parkland started to come up again\nAh and ah you know you were dressed in Prince William county it's come up in some of the congressional races as well the ... school security uh how has it been working in Prince William county since you guys came up with a plan to a public school resource officers and sheriffs in into the schools and kept us up\nWell it's not a good thing you know we have Ninety five schools in principle county we've uh we're we've placed armed security guards called school resource officers and every one of her middle schools and high schools and we're now in the process of putting retired police officers and all of our elementary schools\nAnd these officers are not just there to protect the kids which they do very well and prevent incidents like what happened in Parkland\nOr that they also work together with the kids and they improve the relationship between the police department and the children who are in our schools that's a good program now not every little Kelly's going to be able to afford to do that and that's why you have places like Lee county and the extreme southwest Virginia right on the Kentucky line\nAnd they've chosen uh they would like to uh to arm teachers a concealed carry who were willing who are trained to make sure absolutely\nA competent to to possess a firearm\nAnd um you know that's what we county would like to do and I think we should allow them to do that not ten came to the Democrats of course\nThey don't want to let them do that they don't want to let their own law they don't want a local locality a in a local school system to make their own decisions with regard to how they're going to defend their their kids that's but because that's what Democrats think they think they know\nKelly a and a local school system to make their own decisions with regard to how they're going to defend their their kids that's but because that's our Democrats think they think they know better than everybody else and Tim Kaine has made it very clear he's very proud of his F rating from an array\nA temp came to light the seas every single a semi automatic rifle and the United states\nUh and require that everybody I get a permit to to even only on even if you have one year that you inherited from your grandfather they like to give your son he wants to make you get a permit to do that\nThis was like Democrats think they want to take firearms away from law abiding citizens and of course the only ones who will be left with firearms in that case will be the criminals but that's how Democrats think they want to take away your firearms but not those are criminals\nFull length of the pie is ah here along the side of the United way Thomas Jefferson area and they're working in conjunction on so many different things with the latest thank you guys for coming on in this morning how are you all doing today\nWe respect we let let the glad to be here with me\nI Need to like red light yellow light oh don't worry about it that's why it out\nRespect we let let so glad to be here with me if\nI knew like red light yellow light oh don't worry about it that's fine\nAlbert has that effect on people so thanks for coming in what is coming up with a woman United the last time we spoke ... guys who just finished your grant luncheon and that was great so now we're onto the next grant luncheon or what's the next ah programs coming up the line of\nThe we have a membership open house coming up next week it is on Wednesday October twenty fourth five thirty to seven thirty PM at old metropolitan hall on the downtown la\nA beautiful place what a great spot I've only been to one to events there\nAre but it really is a great use of a little store front but it's right in the middle of it all and uh it gives you a little privacy but all public access was really a nice spot is a wonderful then you have you hold events there yet\nWe have we've we've done this been doing this event for several years at at the back out and okay so is it very centrally located and it's an opportunity for like minded women who are interested in learning more about women United in philanthropy\nThey come out and meant mingle with other members and to hear from the past grant recipients oh so they're going to be there is yes they're going to be offering a report as well\nMhm I Know their report if I remember correctly generally are circles around what they were able to do with the grant money that they've received through women United if either the previous year or ... years passed right\nYeah so we have three um grant recipients who are going to be coming next week I'm there the African American teaching fellows the women's initiative in Georgia feeling house and combined they received a total of sixty thousand dollars and do we get to hear about the impact of the size\nI I think that really makes it tangible for people because it was certainly you know all we want to help all we want to you know we foster these organizations in the work they do but actually hearing about how the rubber finally does meet the road I think it was really impactful for ... folks Elizabeth\nIt's incredibly impactful and that's what we really want to focus on is the impact that we can make up on women and children and our community that the entire mission of our organization and as a collective giving organization we as numbers pool our membership\nDonations together in order to create these grants that it's an incredibly rigorous grant process um but hearing the impact of what they these organizations have created for women and children\nIs really what we're all about ... minutes so inspirational for our members and is also really educational for anybody who wants to attend\nIs it also fair to point out that you know the more people that are involved number one the more grant money there was which makes the process easier because then more people can get grants or so about ... winnowing out process to become a simple or\nWhen you have more members but also you can have an impact as a member of women United\nIn you know the discussions about you know what grants or you know brought forth nominated that kind of thing where the lemons\nYes all women United members have the ability to nominate an organization I'm for grant consideration and then all when the United members have the ability to serve on the grand committee which reviews all the different grant proposals\nThe grant committee will narrow um we had that I think twenty something nominees this past year and\nThe grand committee looks at all those applications narrows it down to five finalists is tough job it yeah it's not an easy job and then the membership as a whole has the opportunity to have to vote on the five finalists to see which ones will be the grant recipients\nAnd you do this in a fun way to I mean it's not like it over there\nWho has the opportunity to have to vote on the five finalists to see which ones will be the grant recipients\nAnd you do this in a fun way to I mean it's not like that that I don't know if you've ever seen the play or the movie twelve angry men where you're in a room for too long in the wall start feeling like they're close again a little I was like\nYou you you do with it in a ... immune clue serve I guess is a word that gets overused sometimes but everyone kind of gets together and it's and it's much more relaxed\nAtmosphere while you discuss and then the the groups make their presentations and it really is it's not as much of a yoga is it is you you really feel like you're doing something\nYeah you definitely feel like you have an impact and that is wonderful you know as an individual member my particular you know donations and I feel doesn't go very far but when we pull it with our two hundred other members and we are able to work sixty thousand dollars in grants that's amazing\nYeah well and that's the other point is that the collective giving organization where it's all membership driven there is no a fundraising drive there's no telephone on there is none of that it's just you know the more members you have the better you can give and the more generous you can be\nExactly and then more organizations that we get nominated as well\nThis is true also so yes yeah there is an inverse curve yeah there are more people making decisions as more towards the\nGuy's gotta hang on a second I Want to circle back around to talk to her that I made I made the comment earlier this somebody uh\nYou know we hear on a lot of ... think tank so I I I appreciate that do

Today I Want to go to this issue of this this reporter this guy with the Washington Post yesterday or it's not an American citizen\nLived for a long time in Saudi Arabia and it looks like he walked into the Saudi count council a in a counselor in in Istanbul and it looks like he was murdered now Mike Pompeo was asking the president to give the Saudis a couple of days they say they're going to get to the bottom of it\nBut I don't really have any doubt that this guy was murdered and murdered by the Saudis and I doubt it happened without the crown prince and other top people in Saudi Arabia knowing if that's the case\nYou know I Know Democrats want to pressure Donald Trump into doing whatever they want to do and making this the biggest litmus test but let me remind people\nThat Hillary Clinton in the Clinton Foundation took millions from the Saudis she never brought up their horrific treatment of women killing gays and lesbians she never brought up one time the persecution of Christians and Jews in Saudi Arabia\nUm and the same would go for a look at how they treated Benghazi but with that said we already know the double standard exist what are you what do you think that's why I think\nI mean I think first of all that the president is right to be cautious\nOr do you indicate Clinton's that we don't necessarily know all the things that are going on in that I I think there will be very foolish\nFor us to a break a relationship with Saudi Arabia which is the key to containing Iran a\nBut but I think we have to get to the bottom of it let me also point out to folks oh I'm just now working on a novel for next year called collusion in which the Russians are decide they want to push in the U.S Senate\nOr if I were writing a novel about a Saudi journalist being killed and the circumstances are just strange\nThat that they're going to kill him in the Saudi consulate in Istanbul knowing that the Turkish intelligence services monitor them all the time they're going to do it with a team of Fifteen people um\nIt's almost like if they did do it and I'm not saying they didn't I mean clearly something terrible happened and and clearly\nInvade them do it on their sloppy and stupid and you know ... it's unbelievable the position they put any of their allies\nAnd you're right we have this on precedent alliance against the Iranian had Gemini with the Saudis Israelis Emirates Jordanians and Egyptians and it you know now that creates massive complications\nWell and but if you look at it you know we've said pretty clearly we're not going to tolerate the Russians poisoning people in Great Britain and she led to very specific sanctions\nOr I couldn't imagine a circumstance where if we do in fact decide that the evidence is overwhelming under the Saudis have the least promised secretary of state compel that they're going to give him the fool\nTo decide that the evidence is overwhelming under the Saudis have the least promised secretary of state compounds that they're going to give him the full report you know again or they may well be lying but\nYou know in the end we discovered that there are key people in Saudi Arabia and all I suspect it will be sanctions but that's different is one thing that sanctions it's another thing you know to go wild and break up the the alliance and the relationship and the Israelis have been very clear\nThat they regard Saudi Arabia as such an important a defense against Iran or do they have urged us to be very careful in this process\nWe've got to go but um this is ... uh it does complicate things but people do remember that our arch enemy are aligned with U.S Russia the former Soviet Union to beat Nazi is\nThat's right and I think sometimes you just said you know we have taken steps against Russia in concert with the British over killing ... trying to poison and several people but we didn't we didn't go to church\nIt's unbelievable you know border patrol then you've got the sanctuary cities and now we have a sanctuary state of California what does that mean\nThat means people that we know are here illegally that broke the laws to get in here no respect for our sovereignty no respect for American law\nWell now we know those people when they got caught committing other crimes some of them well pretty serious six hundred and forty two thousand crimes I mentioned included yeah murder in some cases\nHow many parents angel moms have we've put on this program and angel dads on this program and they tell the stories about illegal immigrants that were in the justice system that were let out on the street because they were in a sanctuary city\nNow the sanctuary state of California with a with a sanctuary state free health care for all legal or illegal candidate Gavin Newsom out there in California you know talk about ... California Good grief\nYou know we now have on record number of migrant parents entering the U.S with children surging to record lows listen they want their kids here\nIn some cases we've actually found out that people that claim that the young children with them about their children turn out not even be their children\nBut they want to beat Donald Trump over the head with a hammer over this he's the one that stopped family separation he's the one that's been saying build the wall\nHe's the one that's been saying you've got to pass laws that I Can't do it by executive the odd happened under Obama nobody cared happened under Bush nobody cared but of course the standard double standard is so transparent and so obvious\nWay of House Republicans now calling for an investigation here we are watching this these videos of members of the illegal alien caravan actually being paid according to congressman Mac hates a Florida\nHe wants an investigation into whether the illegal alien caravan now head of the U.S is being bankrolled by wealthy Democrats in America so Larry is to watch you know there was I saw a conspiracy theory tweet out their bodies are some prominent Democrat it'll actually remember the name but\nActually says sources say your so scared of losing the midterms he's tweeting at the real Donald Trump an impeachment hearings that you your team influenced the caravan\nSo they're blaming Trump for their care about if the dog bites the beast things you're feeling sad um its final Trump's fault if he cures cancer he wouldn't be liked by some of these people\nUnbelievable alright eight hundred nine for one showing us auto free telephone number you ought to be a part of the program you know we also have Trump saying the president saying well we may have to use the military at this point to protect our borders\n... president today tweeted this morning I must have been the strongest the terms asked ... Mexico to stop this onslaught and if they're able to do so I won't call up the U.S military and close our southern border\nI'm watching the Democratic party led because they won't open borders and existing week laws of salt into our country like whoa\nBorder I'm watching the Democratic party led because they won't open borders and existing week laws of salt in our country by Guatemala Honduras El Salvador\nAnd leaders are doing little to stop the flow of people including many criminals from entering the United states through Mexico and the third Tweedy emphasize the importance that he places on stopping the migrants\nFrom ever entering the country said the assault on our country at our southern border including the criminal elements drugs pouring in as far more important to me as president than trade\nOr the new trade agreement that he has with Mexico and Canada hopefully Mexico will stop this onslaught at their northern border\nIs that all Democrats fault per week laws have been trying to fix it now for a long time\nRight eight hundred nine four one Sean as our toll free telephone number you want to be a part of the program Dan is in Michigan Dan Hi how are you welcome to beautiful Palm Beach where here Rush Limbaugh for the full hour on Hannity tonight what's going on Dan how are you\nA ... good good hey I'm ... I Want to just go back to those documents that that are not with the inspector general you know the final court documents that a couple of weeks ago Trump order to be declassified right right okay [noise] and then Rosenstein came over the White House immediately\nAnd I didn't go over from what I understand it was a phone call\nOkay but I Want to paraphrase what Rosenstein basically I'm a I'm On a truthfully point what was the same basic called him up and said look Mr President myself and my buddies are trying to impeach you put you in jail if you release these documents it's going to\nPrevent us from impeaching your tail and put you in jail and it's probably going to explode in her face\nAnd you aren't going to be a free man so which do not released the because we still working to subvert your presidency\nAnd then after Sean after the phone call Trump find out found out all this stuff about Rosenstein and the stuff that was after the phone call why wouldn't Trump realize they're trying to impeach them put them in jail called the inspector general say get that to the White House\nSit around the oval office ... these two things released arrest\nFrom my understanding is there being extra super careful that the president still committed to de classification of releasing the ... the on redacted Pfizer warrants these are the main thing is we need\nWe need the Pfizer warrant applications one we need the gang of eight material to we need what's known as the thrill twos or the reports Bruce or especially with his contacts with Christopher Steele because we already know because there's some of the leaks and communications\nThat Christopher Steele who\nUnder oath and under threat of perjury in Great Britain and in in Iraq and tore even he couldn't stand by his own pony fake Russian ... that he was paid for\nYou know you've got all these people now that now the or doesn't want to talk or Glenn Simpson pleading the fifth Rod Rosenstein not only not turning

has now grown\nTo as many as four thousand perhaps even more well the president came out this morning and threatened to shut down the U.S Mexico border he says he might just send the military there he says that several Central American countries are allowing many criminals to head to the United states\nThe president was referring to the caravan of migrants I Know\nThe Associated Press on AOL and all those other news organizations they called them migrants well the fact is there are people who are planning to enter this country illegally\nIf they actually went to a border crossing and said I'd like to claim refugee status the fact is that eighty five to Ninety percent of those trying to claim refugee status or told that their circumstances do not warrant refugee status under American law\nTuesday of this week the president threatened to cut off aid to countries as well as to El Salvador\nDonald Trump also took a swipe at Democrats for open borders and weak laws don't call that a

I'm delighted\nThat Democrats have poured thirty eight million dollars into the race and awards says he will not share it with other candidates so that's money that could have done a lot more competitive races in places like North Dakota\nSo um I think it's it's crucial for America's safety that the Republicans keep both houses of Congress so that the kind of house representatives doesn't become a nonstop impeachment show trial\nBut um I I don't think a cruise has got to lose to fill a lark I think part of the reason the polls showed cruises all her well for a while is because the bad blood from the presidential race\nA cruise has got to lose to fill a lark I think part of the reason the polls showed cruises all over for a while is because the bad blood from the presidential race I was a crew supporter through the convention my girlfriend\nHated when he did at the convention I kind of liked it I rallied to ... you know during the general election but still they're still bad blood 'cause\nThere's a lot of support for Trump in Texas and a lot of people were irritated with his dog it fight against the president I don't agree with that but you know that was one of the things depressing truth Cruz that support Trump has come to Texas and done rallies that its\nCruz has worked well with President Trump it's funny in the last debate\nOr work was trying to run away from the rest of the Democratic party is talking about how he could work with the president uh you know he's worked with with Republicans in Congress but his saying that he could work with Trump better than cruise what Chris pointed out you'll have called for President Trump's impeachment\nDoes not somebody that that Donald Trump is going to work with\nThat I mean ... if if I were elected in Texas it'd be like we didn't have a senator like Senator had died and we just decided to leave the seat open because that's how little impact you would have\nLooked on the other hand drawn is his real name just to twenty twenty as though I mean we've seen people sort of short changed the\nThe process I've always thought that a lot of people had to go through to become president you expected them to perhaps run for the house for the Senate maybe become a governor run a state for a while get some real experience we saw Obama short cut that\nBy saying oh I don't doubt that I I can be in the state legislature in Illinois I'll hop right to the Senate all immediately start running for president\nI'll spend very little time and accomplish almost nothing in the Senate never having run a big organization of any kind never signed the front of a paycheck the short cut all that is Beto O'Rourke thinking well run for Senate I'll get some named millionaire a raise a bunch of money and then in twenty twenty all run on my good looks and charm\n[noise] yeah I think you know somebody to sit down with Robert Francis a walk and say just because you drive ... to see in an accident does it make

feeling that if you don't put an amateur like I'm going to put it on Twitter and\nI'll hear one I already have in the article was twenty eight million dollars my hope is a recent refugee from New York City to to to Dallas I Hope he uses that twenty million to pay for her to the rest of his life so we never had to drive again that will make me feel safer on the road\nNo kidding well I just I I look at this and I understand that there were people who said that the slam on Trump was well this guy's just a reality stars well no he's not because in addition to having a very popular TV show he actually did a lot of things in business\nAnd they say oh you know the only turn you know\nEven if you took his worst critic for New York times and said he inherited a lot of property from his dad great\nJohn I Wish somebody like you would write the piece that says how many people in America have inherited\nA million bucks from their parents I didn't uh but how many of the heritage and a million or ten million or a hundred million and they have quickly turned it into half that amount or attempt of though yes but it's ... go ahead\nI I Know I Know someone who is one of the ranch great grandchildren of John the Rockefeller are you telling me about going to Rockefeller family gatherings and he says\nI Know I Know someone who is one of the ranch great grandchildren of John the Rockefeller are you telling me about going to a lot of other family gatherings\nAnd he says like forty percent of them don't even have jobs they just so to get around going to fund raisers age and then they take their private jets to environmental events and save the planet and [laughter] you know Trump needs something he he he ... he didn't he didn't get lemons he got apples but\nHe ... he may be apple cider factory created lots of job yeah we'll look he's done a great dog and the American economy is doing great on foreign policy is a lot better president than I ever thought it would be when I was cheering for Ted Cruz\nI Know and I always back Trump but I ... I've said to people we all say well he only made a few billion dollars I said that's very hard to do ask anybody who's inherited a giant amount of money how hard it is to turn into a really large amount of money\nAnd I said and then go back and ask yourself if you would inherited a modest some by comparison from say you inherited fifty million dollars\nAnd you went down to your best financial advisor and said well what can I Do this and he said well fifty million times five four or five percent\nYou can sit back and collect two and a half million dollars a year you know two hundred thousand dollars a month\nAnd you'll never put your money at risk and you can sit on the beach with two fifty thousand dollars a week you could check into the nicest hotel and ... and sit there for the rest of your life or a hop on a plane every week and go somewhere else\nAnd I I Try to get some government assistance you know I don't I'm not ashamed\nOf it you make a teen and are your girlfriend makes sixteen you said\nAbout yeah about she works in the restaurant industry says she gets tips too you know like she she makes minimum wage plus tips\nRight so she's making maybe thirty thousand a year and you're making about thirty ... so you're making seven sixty five Seventy Seventy five thousand dollars a year\n[noise] close to it about you know a little less than that but yeah\nOkay well it I guess but you want your fellow you know X ray or hold on you want your fellow taxpayers to help you pay your bills why\nWell well here's a here's where it is you know I'm\nPaying all my bills I'm not I don't have any like extra curricular things I'm spending money on doing the average life\nYou know I Try to get a car payment I got I got into that all paying\nYou know but why why do you think it's immoral for you to ask your fellow taxpayers to to help pay your bills why don't how 'bout this make more money\nHow can they are paying how come how come people who aren't working get solved and I don't want I Am working ... towards the the looming around\nI'm the first guy you're going to talk to who's going to say\nIf somebody is able bodied and of working age they need to have a job and we need to start having these work requirements that the president is pushing the Kris Kobach is pushing it in Kansas we need to have people in office who will say if you're capable of working and there were seven million open jobs you need to go get one of them\nAnd if you can't live within the paycheck yearning now\nI've got two suggestions either reduce your spending or increase your work activities find something you can do where your work is worth more\nSo and and that's almost every I can you name me a job anywhere in America where somebody cannot learn how to do an additional skill that makes them worth another two or five or ten dollars an hour named the job as an\nPot I couldn't I couldn't and and I I mostly agree with you I used to work two jobs I've been known to have two and three jobs my whole entire life me too we got kids now\nWe've got kids now and ah I don't I'm not really a big avid fan of you know kids go into sitters for one Tiger Woods to they're they're really expensive uh nowadays there they ... want how much I'm making an hour\nOkay I I got out and can I Do is let me do a test with you here's an idea yeah live next to people there are other people in your neighborhood right\nA\nHow about that on tonight when you get home from work or tomorrow when you're off\nGo around and knock on doors in the neighborhood and say I don't make enough money to live the way I'd like to live would you give me a thousand bucks and and maybe even make it easy to give me a thousand bucks is your would you give me eighty bucks a month would you feel comfortable asking your neighbors for some extra income\nAnd maybe even make it easy to give me a thousand bucks is your would you give me eighty bucks a month would you feel comfortable asking your neighbors for some extra income\n\nHe I wouldn't personally\nOkay and that and yet you if you want the government to go collect the money from the people and then give it to you what's the difference between you asking your next door neighbor he could just spare me an extra hundred bucks a month for doing nothing for you\nYou you won't ask your neighbor for it but you want the government to come take it from your neighbor the point of a gun and give it to you is there any moral difference between those\nUnder the impression that I already pay for this service what service not doing that with a well taking money from ... ... ...\nThey are but in theory what we should be\nI Can't have how can they can how can they don't take that money and just keep it it's well I Want to pay for somebody else they\nDid ... did about a year ago the U.

curious we always take naysayers to the front of the line on this program and adjacent joins us now Jason you heard that story and you and I disagree on how ridiculous that that decision is\nI'm Sorry

last couple of years we've talked a lot about\nThe opioid crisis and I've done my best to try to give you a straight data because we now know that about Seventy two thousand people every year and the United states over does and the overdose because of opioids but we're actually lumping to problems together\nAre based on the numbers I've been able to find out about five or six thousand of those Seventy two thousand die because of abuse of a pharmaceutical drugs the kind of come from a legitimate companies\nUh and the other Ninety percent die because of street drugs\nLike heroin that comes across our borders and there is a real connection to the borders and I thought we'd get Derrick malls on who's a former special agent in charge us a seat of the United states to burden of justice drug Enforcement Administration in special operations division\nAnd he's involved in a documentary called not in vain a dark welcome to the program\n[noise] hey how are you break it to be on the program I I'm doing great but I you know I don't happen to have a heroin addiction and frankly I haven't had anybody in my family at least that I'm aware of\nWho's had that but I I Know of some\nYou know for some folks I'm acquainted with who've lost kids they've lost family members\nBecause of addiction to heroin an addiction to pharmaceutical drugs are I Want you to tell my audience you know before they go see not in vain this new documentary\nAbout this connection because for a long time I've emphasized that your former agency the DEA says it about Ninety percent of that heroine comes across the border from Mexico so part of the solutions\nYour former agency the DEA says about Ninety percent of that heroine comes across the border from Mexico so part of the solution seems pretty self evident doesn't it\nYeah no exactly and so the public needs to know first of all we have not only a public health crisis but we have a national security emergency because\nThese Mexican cartels that it's dumping poison all over the country is what's killing people yes you're right there's a low percentage of pharmaceutical pills that are actually killing Americans right now\nThat they asked majority is being killed from the mixtures of this potent sent in all the synthetic\nA drug coming right from China and the labs in China and then mixing it with everything and large the thing is is that it's not just\nSomebody that's addicted on heroin it's a college kid that things taken the Arab world pill is going to keep 'em alert in ... in ... in class and stay focused but what they don't realize is the pills are mixed with pencil and by the way\nFor the view is one kilogram of fencing all can kill about five hundred thousand adults because it only takes two grain to milligrams\nOf fencing all to kill an adult but we have a we have a much larger issue laws because you know another thing is these terrorist groups like Hezbollah they're tapping into the criminal networks to their funding and their resources or we had a case a couple of years ago when I'm On Jumo is moving to a hundred million dollars a month\nTo support Hezbollah and he was moving the proceeds furloughs that is a\nYou know cartel you know so we have a very serious problem and the American public just doesn't understand it can impact anyone of us if you look at not in vain Marron rigs was Twenty years old she was a beautiful young girl who had very much\nYou loved her family passion for life typical kid you know playing sports he was a capital of the golf team and lots of friends and then her brother finds that debt\nBecause she got addicted and then she went out\nOn to you know by some of this stuff and it's it's mixed with whatever was in the particular you know package you she she bought but the point is is they don't know what they're getting and that's the issue Mexican cartels do not have you know train cameras that are actually caring about quality control they\nCare about making money and grow in their business enterprise and the scary part large is the fact that China is developing all of these chemical compounds and dumping it on our country\nChina is a communist country so you know what better way to disrupt the Americans by you know then by killing their their their children and by you know destroying their communities and so we have multiple at facets of this problem darn\nScott I'm Talking to dirt mauled who's a former special agent in charge of the dia de da\nDe ... take the kind of effort that that this country does to try to interdict some of these drug operations inside their borders because that seemed like the logical place to stop and we can try to stop it from being smuggled in but as you pointed out a tiny quantity goes a long way\nOr the Chinese doing much of anything to try to go after these drug a drug criminals that are making it\nLet's put it this way in China are a lot of these chemicals are not even illegal to export and these cameras that they hire their their very clever because they know what they're controlled substances are so they know the molecular formulas and they change\nA little bit of the formula so it's not even like technically illegal and so the U.S government\nThe department of justice the DEA has had several meetings recently with China to try to get them to understand that this may not be illegal but it's destroying lives all over America so there has been some\nWe were China to try to get them to understand that this may not be illegal but it's destroying lives all over America so there has been some increased cooperation but lost honestly\nIt's really that it's nothing to brag about I mean the ... the politics the politicians will make like everything's moving down to write at but it's a bunch of BS to be honest with you from my standpoint I mean they not aggressive enough with them it is China\nIt's a very complex situation I don't claim to be a Chinese experts but we do know and your listeners know\nThat China is a really really big national security threat to our country and this is just another piece of it you know they're they're hacking opt computers they're stealing our identities they're going after our financial grades than I lecture grades\nSo you know dumping poison in our country\nJust a side thing but one note I Want to tell you you know when we went after these Afghan heroin traffic is for a long time we actually had a few of them say selling heroin to the west is like a jihad against the west are making millions of dollars and we're killing Americans\nSo this is the same concept in my opinion on that this is partially what's going on depending on you know who in China is actually sending at all well\nMay be good about what they accomplish if they can manufacture the drugs cheaply and the Chinese government turns a blind eye to it and allows it to happen they not only damaged the United states they have is incur tremendous human costs as well as financial cause and all that cash from producing new stuff\nFlows back into China one way or the other which is good for trying to because ... and the soup financially so they they get hurt and I get to hurt their biggest competitor the military as well as economic competitor and they get some of our cash at the same time it's a win win and I\n[noise] I call it a two for one special laws I mean they win every which way and and by the way the Mexican cartels are just in it for the money and they're making billions of dollars as you know and they're right on our border and\nThere's so many illegal here in America right now involved with the cartels different aspects of the cartels distribution a you know whether it's the money collections that drug distribution stash houses you know\nCompartments these guys are all over our country a and honestly we got a shutdown that damn border and I want to really make a difference but stuck it in the military involved in my mind you my opinion\nMy opinion it sounds a little bit traumatic but if you look up on the website\nDepartment of state has criteria for how you designate a foreign terrorist organization and in my opinion based on good all common sense\nLook at what the Mexican cartels are doing and they meet the criteria to be designated a foreign terrorist organization if that happens then we'll have different authorities to use our military and others to kind of feel that order\nAnd knock this nonsense off with just put the politics you know if you look at nine eleven\nThe Iraq War the Afghanistan war you added up every one that died\nAnd then even the Vietnam War it's still less than how many people died last year from trucks so what is the American public in a ... wake up stop listening to these phony politicians that are in it for their own personal pocket books in their wallets and their futures they're not really in it for the public safety or national security aspects\nThe story is told in not in vain and it's a brand new documentary out Derek molds is very involved and Derek thank you for your work at the DEA and know that it's dangerous and tough job and things are working on not in vain we appreciate you taking the time tonight\nThat Trump had said it's a scary time for\nYoung men um only if you lie and insert ... white men in there and do you bring on um you know professor of urban studies and and host of the BEP network to talk about white supremacy I'm halfway through the segment ... switch true why from\nSomething we made up in the back room here at CNN to an actual Trump strategy asking will this Trump strategy work uh it's really absolutely outrageous them and in my note to readers and I wish anyone listening wouldn't go find it and print it out\nUm put it in put it in your wallet for the next time people say oh there's no such thing as fake news um these are the guardians of the first amendment yes every once in a while there was a typo no this was a deliberate vicious racists lie about the president\nNot only was it not corrected in that segment if there's been a mistake I think it would have been corrected before before the first commercial break 'em and you know come up with something different to talk about as far as I Know it has never been corrected on\nI think it would have been corrected before before the first commercial break 'em and you know come up with something different to talk about as far as I Know it has never been corrected on CNN Anna ... after 'em or I guess I don't know about the same time I called was running other people may have noticed this she send out as they tweet\nI'm saying I made an error I'm Sorry about that something to that effect absolutely no mention of what the error was it goes to her pathetic list of ...\nOf of of Twitter followers and as as small as CNN's ratings are I Believe more people saw\nHer segment with why then you know went to ... Twitter feed to see it as a vague I made an error how about a segment ... correcting the entire segment\nWell and what's crazy as they could have done some legitimate journalism and said it is a scary time to be a man now and then I'll tell you this is one of the things I kept emphasizing is\nIf somebody can come out with a thinly evidence accusation that that has nothing behind it no witnesses no nothing and the person bringing the\nCharge can't even remember all the details where where who how\nAnd that can destroy\nA man or and as I pointed out in these gender ... times\nA man or a woman's or you know uh uh uh their entire career they're good name their family wipe them out financially and say oh I'm Sorry\nIt was a ... it was a false accusation or we think it was wild but by this time you've already destroyed the person it is a scary time when that could that one little accusation can end up destroying a person and wait until the first time\nYou know that a woman says well you know this this professional woman came on to me and they destroyed a doctor or a lawyer or a politician or you know\nThe one time you can be sure you're going to see it again is one Trump gets another Supreme Court nominee which is why I Am insistence that he make it a man\nI'm everyone thinks oh don't worry they won't be able to do anything with a woman yeah because you know they loved their tail and they they love me you know this has come up with something new now that we know what their play book is they're not going to be able to pull the false allegation of a high school groping on the next one it would be too embarrassing\nSo they'll have to do something slightly different and frankly you know you reminded me of you remember back when the ridicule was heaped on on Gerald Ford because Chevy Chase portrayed him as being incredibly clumsy and we knew if you look through the man's history he was an athlete he\nWas the fact of layer at University of Michigan\nAnd I stand out he was a stand a football player who did very very well but if you have a comedian pretend that the president is a clumsy guy than people today will say well you know you remember our clumsy George Bush George Gerald Ford was\nAnd you say you know he was one that was the comedian playing the parody on the anti Republican pro left a television show set and I live\nIt had no but it becomes and they used to make fun of Reagan saying oh Reagan imagined those things from the movies and then you'd go back and say no that was actually based on history is you are right who are pretending that things happen in the movie\nThis is what's driving them absolutely mad about the Internet seemed is still believe they're operating in a world without the Internet does the platform ... um well let's start with Alex Jones that Roger Stone and gab and again is ... they're coming after Gavin get us out of the funniest people in America um\nWho else out my low you know apple let's let's start with those but they're coming for ...\nLet's start doing it back at them a ... a friend of mine I stole the line from him but I told them if you're not going to treat it I Will because he's headed to me than I\nThe floors well let's start doing it back at them a ... a friend of mine I stole the line from him but I told him if you're not going to treat it I Will because he started to me that I\nAgree I think this this\nUm I was accused of um the pretend an former journalist sola data Brian yesterday of being a Nazi apologist and walk around with us and for all of your listeners who are on Twitter or just find that tweet and reporting on Twitter\n... being a Nazi apologist can get you as a crime that can get you in prison in many countries in Europe\nThat's very true her book is called resistance
