and they've gone through a bitch now or never had to enjoy your life\nAnd not let your investment Joan you do you welcome to the program\n... thank you very much a large I really appreciate being on where you are right\nSo when people talk about oil and about energy and about ways to make sure that they have the money they need when they hit retirement age is that a good place for people to be a parking their money\nWhether it should be large it it really depends on the company and what they're trying to accomplish there are a lot of smaller oil companies that are doing very very well in West Texas especially if you're probably aware of the west Texas a\nCrude is probably the number one at all and maybe the ... are you right up there to it but there's a lot of small companies that are that\nI Would like good investment opportunity I'm not so big on the larger companies because you really can't control what they do but if you invest in some of the smaller companies\nThe smaller companies by the way you can buy stock in those things to really you can almost into what you're doing and what's your investments doing right now\nSo in other words if you buy an Exxon BP or one of the larger majors you just going to be one more little fish in that big pond but if they're buying stock in a small company did that with ... and the ground because an awful lot of the actual wells are not drilled by the big guys are built drove by the little guys right\nThat's exactly correct to eat the smaller companies are are are\nLeasing themselves out to the larger companies\nAnd the large companies really don't care about the little guy I always tell my clients so they'll come in and say you know Warren Buffett's great investor and I said no Warren Buffett is a great fire because he can afford to buy into the ... and he can control what he does because he can buy stock to make their control but the little guy can't do that like most of my class or not the kind of investors obviously\nBut what I tell them is supposed to take a look at the small guys take a look at what they're doing All right now we've got oil contracts drilling contract for some of the small\nCompanies that go out three and four years in the future because of the price of oil and the way all his being found you know we are now the number one oil producer in the world is you're aware of the United states and a greater percentage of that\nIs coming out of West Texas out of the Permian Basin\nNow here's the question you wrote a book called how to enjoy your life and not let your investment zone you find a lot of that people want their investments wind up controlling who and what they are\nAbsolutely people come into office almost every day and they're concerned about not only were they put their money for what it's doing for them and if they're having to watch that on a regular basis in fact are losing sleep over it because\nThey're reading what the big guys say what the stock market's doing and what some of the pundits were saying uh Ben Stein just came out with an article Newsmax just a couple of days ago\nTalking about three things that you gotta watch out there is going to be a bus kinda got\nAll those kinds of things will panic the average guy and what they end up doing is letting their investments on them they are afraid to get in and then when they get in their right to get out so the reason I wrote a book for those people as hey there's other ways to look for things there's ways to invest for income as opposed to growth and a lot of my clients are of age\nThey're really not so concerned about making that money they made it already now they want to make sure they tape it and they have it when they get ready to retire and for as long as they live\nSo how do you go about doing that without losing it all because I get worried when I see people parking all of their investments in one place one small area and and that sounds like a bit of what your suggestion when you say you can own stock in a small oil driller\nTo actually be in control so that means you may have a lot of your your net worth parked in that one little company run\nAs a matter of fact I don't do that I tell them up front I said you do not want to put it all in one place where you want to do is still diversify but you want to do the evaluation or have someone that's our professional\nThat is involved with this thing on the day to day basis that will do the evaluations for you someone that you can trust in fact if you'll notice and there are large I've got a paycheck estates two hundred and two I quoted there's so many times that actually gives you ten questions you should ask your advisor and one of the questions is\nIf I put my money into places that will provide income as opposed to growth and still get a good return can you provide me that kind of investments as well and obviously what you try to do is give the client the best possible return or they can get\nSome of it and gross income but as they get older as you were quite aware as they get older they should really be a little bit more conservative what they're doing and that's what we try to do here in West Texas we don't mind them going after the oil companies we think it's a good opportunity for some of them but not for everyone\nHer an awful lot of people who have good retirement age or they're getting close to it or they're already in it they're not too concerned with buying stock and then holding it for Twenty years I mean to be honest\nI mean to be honest some of them may not be around in Twenty years they're already of a certain age but what they want is something that will make crude producers is solid streams so they can pay their bills and enjoy life\nThat's exactly why I wrote the book and when I had to let your not let your investments on you I Want my clients to enjoy what they're doing without having to worry about it I Want them to be able to go to bed at night and sleep well not worrying about the fact that the mark to\nCome down tomorrow and it very well could get on the situation as you are very well aware and I listen to your program a number of times that really appreciate the advice that you gave an some others that are on the show\nThat the market is strange it goes up it goes down and we've been up for a long time\nThings could really get kinky around here so I tell people all the time you really need to watch where you're going especially if you're getting close to that age where you're Seventy Seventy five after that area you live on that if the market goes down enough for another ten years and then what do you do your income is gone you may have to go back or it can be a greeter at Wal Mart if you're not careful\nYeah well I think all of us worried about that but let me ask you this do you worry about those folks who politically seemed to hate oil with a passion see I I think it's a great fuel and no it is because I I Am so much punch\nIs it there's a reason that a twenty gallon gas tank old will push it you know several hundred miles down the road\nAnd that they haven't been able to come up with something that is really the electric alternative or even the natural gas alternatives so I think the fuel is going to be around a long time unless you got a bunch of the political types like Hillary would promise to shut down every kind of fossil fuel that you could turn the off switch to and and and I'm worried about that\nWell I we we were concerned about it from the standpoint of the politicians they try to get on the other side but they're also going to lose their buttons they're going to lose a whole lot of things that the petroleum does that's not all\nBased on the automobile I mean there are so many things you have to call your product produce that electric cars can do and that and the windmills out here yeah we've got a window you can drive into El Paso Texas Texas\n... drive across the state and I promise you ... you will always be one of these giant windmills running the area I seriously all the way and also all the way across Texas nine hundred miles you're stuck with when males\nThey produce two percent\nTwo percent of the some of them are needed to protect it to the grid there you pop up there it's going around in circles and making I think uh we we just laugh about that much that we know what the basis for the economy is\nWe know what it will do and if they want to have it all companies that's one thing but they sure do use a lot of oil based products out there if they if we didn't have the all companies\nThey're far may not run but they couldn't button their shirt either their parents as far as that's concerned because everything's might have oil\nI'm Talking to the Carter who's the author most recently of it now or never had to enjoy your life and not let your investments on you you do I don't know whether you're ... you probably do agree with me based on what you said but\nYou know the those windmills irritate me because I Know that Texas has its own little interesting scheme on electricity weren't can't really be sold out of the state\nAnd so there are literally been times where people have sold electricity for less than than zero where they've actually pay well absolutely because and if people say why would you sell something for lessons here on the answer is\nBecause the tax incentives the subsidies are attached to it make it worth selling for two dollars a a megawatt less than one what is what does it mean to a negative two dollars that is you'll pay somebody to take off their hands\nOr check out the motives Sally Ride it's now or never the it's a pleasure to have you on the program we'll have you back some time\nTariffs that complicated customs clumps hidden shop online in Canada from the U.S they've they've boosted that I've learned not to a great number but it's forty dollars so that's twice as large so that's that's a that's a good thing there's a chapter on currency\nCountries are supposed to lead me for a third countries Canada Mexico weren't doing it but that say hey marker for agreements with other countries that that would be a obviously trying if we ever had an agreement with them but other countries as well so there there's a lot of you know these are what I Would call\nA quite a quite good in positive steps\nOdd job when you go to the negative\nWell before we get to the negatives I Want to know you mentioned China and I want to know whether or not this is going to have a side benefit of sending a message to China\nThat when we come to do business with them and renegotiate our deals with China because they're not involved in is that that they will get a message of how the United states wants to do business he's not going to have the desired result\nWell it certainly carries that signal you're absolutely right I mean I carried a very strong signal and doubt whether China will change its economic a model at least in some respects to become more of a market\nMore of a market oriented bottle that remains to be seen but to signal could not be clear show yes I agree with the rest of your your questioner no doubt\nThat was what looked is to say to China but the rest of the world for example talks with the Philippines are going on and some African countries and so forth\nWill they take it seriously\n[noise] well China is the big question mark my predicts do better than yours odd to try and use the economy is slowing down partly because of the trade friction up but uh\nFor other countries for sure they will take it very seriously they see the template this new agreement and I know it's you know it's a very long it's a thousand pages a lot of text and a lot of details but this is now the template for any trade agreement that the Trump Administration to try and do it [noise]\nAny other country and the key key provisions\nGlare and they they don't let them if they want to go forward they will recognize them so that starts with Japan were wherever we talked with Japan which of them have just gotten\nWell professor and now let's go to the negative what's the downside to us and to you\nOkay there's no uh it's it's as and I want to emphasize these are my in my in my by my metric bigger negatives on the positive but they're very small\nCompared to the fears before\nWe went was you know concluded on Sunday night a closely I'm not a fan of managed trade centers that if you like managed trade you liked disagreement show their big\nBig heaps of managed trade in the automotive sector which don't have any impact now but the agreement is meant to go for sixteen years with a six year review and in that period of time they may very well\nRun up against these land that's also in a textiles and apparently there's more of a managed trade flavor also\nI Will try and life is that a government put kill them and between us and Canada is no longer open to the companies or the other countries by this agreement it might be open to countries want but they're they're not committed to and I I like competition for government for journalism to either get is\nBetter quality a lower price Ohio's a ...\nNot a fan of managed trade either although I certainly understand why the concerns that are there that when you say we're going to run automobiles come in from places in North America Mexico and Canada ah that that we want to control the amount of content that's in them and that sort of thing I understand the concerns people have because\nIf you said what's the cheapest place on earth to make automobiles it probably wouldn't be the high tax and regulation environment to the United states before you even get to labor cause\nOf well why don't you you might be right back to the U.S and well I Would say north of that are taken as a year is a very low cost producer hold an awful lot of vehicles large trucks pick up trucks\nAnd and uh and media SUVs for sure maybe not small automobiles I Would agree with you there is a smaller called back cause but the last were very cost competitive thanks to these\nAre quite ingenious in elaborate supply

wow everything though we um we have an an interesting situation a we have one child and we're looking to expand our family however we're going to need to um work and they didn't they do ivy after a while we still have another\nSixty six thousand dollars left or to pay off and what what else hold into a were making about a hundred and forty thousand dollars a year right now\nSo you did a hundred and a year but a lot of that was from selling stuff\nUp pretty much a large like under what what's the math telling you\nThat it's got how long has he going to take you do the show the sixty\nUm [noise] if we if we continue on this course where how are you from literally sold everything so the rest of it's just going to be working really are I think it's going to be probably about another year maybe a little bit more\nThat's what I was thinking that's what I Would ask him on a cell that OK cool and so what is the pricing model of uh VS that you guys are looking at\nUm well we actually met with a doctor a few months ago and got a ballpark of about twenty thousand\nMhm I'm uh just you know we haven't found anything or start any any process is yeah we're just still kind of shopping around but twenty thousands or we're looking at a we've spoken with other couples and it looks like it was kind of around there um\nLet me give me a little inside okay this comes like a lot because babies are important\nBut I mean having kids is a big deal it's an emotional thing and it causes people to uh\nYou know to to change their financial directions and the to violate things and everything else so let me tell you I I absolutely know nothing about medical things I Am a medical idiots okay but uh I have actually been involved in about this decision probably a hundred times over the years\nAnd what I Am hearing\nWhy we're talking with a ... in Atlanta is very grandmother died\nFamily couldn't keep up the house or he's moved in it and they're paying the mortgage and\nWanting to know what to do whether he should fool with this or not and whether you ought to try to buy or work it out or however\nOr somebody what you told me so far sir\nYes oh okay so you know ... ... Ninety five thousand dollars on the house that's what it takes to pay the mortgage off correct\nCorrect okay\nAnd the next thing you need to do is you need to talk to a real estate agent\nAnd find out what this house was actually worse because right now you don't\nYeah I don't I don't I don't know ... if if my wife my wife so great grandma so I Know where I live on the lowest say there was a it's a hundred and three ... I don't know if that's even ... they're not\nAre not like it's not always that accurate but it's probably not that far off we could use that for discussion purposes okay if you if you found a house that was worth a hundred thousand and you could buy it for Ninety five thousand that really wouldn't be that great a by\nI just being okay by it's not like you're getting ready for a great deal there where you just went wow that's the best deal ever ride yeah this\nIs from like to even get kicked out 'cause someone gated or should I leave or should I or I should I go back ran over\nWell where no one on the long term whether you want to\nOwn um well my wife she we kinda do want to own because we got a daughter she's four and my wife she that school and now so we just trying to kind of settled down right now mhm\nHave you got every angle area if I'm like I say my wife great grandma's house has she been here her whole life so she likes it it's like about two and a half three acres\nMhm and um it's kind of in a country will part of Atlanta gotcha okay and how old are you to my wife\nShe turned twenty yesterday and and I'll be Twenty one and a couple of days so we both twenty now\nMhm and you got a a one child you said and how much do you have\nA we don't have any do okay and what's your household income\nI make about every player but I'm trying to also get in school but I had to kind of work with the center that was that much I um I pay about six hundred and Seventeen dollars a month\nAnd your wife doesn't work [noise] [noise] okay that's pretty\nThat's pretty China has lied on your budget\nIs is very tight on your budget\nAnd we found out about you not too long ago one of my friends from church he recommended me to start listening to you but now we actually kind of made a budget and stuff on how to eat\nAnd we're already kinda you know trying to start it off a little better and you\nDo it good for you okay well here's the thing if you wanted to buy the house the only way you can buy it is the ah the relatives that are involved that would be the air's a this would be great grandmothers children or grandchildren\nThat would be the air since there was no will someone would have to petition the court you'd have to get a lawyer and go to probe a court in probate court would have to rule that the house could be sold and would assign someone to sign the deed as the cellar\nTo be able to give it to you you're going to have to have a court action to do that that's going to cost three two or three thousand bucks to get all that done\nOkay I don't think you need that expense right now yeah though\nWith all the with the numbers you gave me in the situation you're in um now is anybody going to throw you out as long as that mortgages paid I doubt you're gonna get thrown out\nYeah 'cause that's what I was thinking should I\nI feel kind of want to actually start even going into real estate 'cause I Do construction as what I Do know I kind of this house is kind of it's not beat a it's kind of beat up and fight the last few years she yeah\nHere's like other relatives staying there kind of beaten it up so I I mean I don't know if it's like maybe weren't more maybe you know what I'm saying they Lincoln flipping and get another house or Lipitor unless you become the owner of it\nYeah and and that's why I'm saying like I Do I Need to use that I see in a statement learning anything they just hurry up and now like my in my name or should I wait until you what I\nWould do if I were you I Would be willing to walk away from the ... some day when you get I I Would treat it like you're renting it\nYou're probably not gonna bother to own it and if you do you're going to go through a lot of hassle to become the owner going through this court action that I'm Talking about okay\nSo uh what I Would do is pay that rent or pay that payment of rent I Would not spend any money on this and I wouldn't fret about becoming the owner today\nIt's inexpensive rent in the Atlanta area it's a place you like living any money you spend on it just say to fix it up is money you're probably gonna lose you're probably not ever going to become the owner of this thing\nYeah it's going to be and it's going to be a really strenuous process with the courts to become the owner of this because we don't even know who the heirs are\nYeah well I don't I Know a couple of days they is this is not that many on 'em\nOr that they actually even know about it like I said we we been here for a year so I don't know like should I I I'm not like should I be worried that I'm staying here paying their oil and I just keep paying you\nKnow because that's not that you shouldn't be worried because it's not bad rent\nYeah but I'm I'm just worried like can't nobody can manage me out because it's not in my name\nYeah they can get you out the people that only can they are the heirs but they'd have to all get their crap together and they're far from doing that\nYeah and they're they're they're far away they're like in another state and\nYeah but there knowing that they're not worried about this is what I'm saying yeah they're not worried about this at all it's not bothering them one way or the other they're not going to get any money out of it when it sells 'cause it's not worth much more than a vote on it if it was valuable now there'd be some sharks and the ... are circling\nPotter circling right but it's not got any ... because it's not worth any more so you're not going to get kicked out but some day you're going to want to move on so don't spend a bunch of money on it 'cause some that you're just going to walk off and leave it\nYeah 'cause they 'cause I've already done paying eight and ... before David Nadler some something you know and I make my life because\nThat's money whatever money you spend and make her happy is money is gone\nWhen you leave because there's going to come a day two years from now that you guys are going to stand up and walk away or you're going to go to the trouble to get the heirs to take the thing the probate court\nAnd get the deed transferred to your name and you can probably do that but again it's going to cost you a couple of thousand dollars and you'd want to make very sure that the property was worth more than the mortgage before you did that and um\nAnd you don't want to spend a bunch of money renovating his house because you're going to very likely move on in about two years but in the meantime I just looked at it as cheap rent the place you kinda like living\nAnd uh you know six hundred bucks rent in line is not a bad gig on two and a half acres so I'm sitting there in front of you for now\nIt's not hurting anything no one's you're not stealing anything you're not doing any more harm the mortgage companies getting paid they're happy the relatives that aren't going to get any money anyways still aren't getting any money everybody's happy but just look at it like you're a renter and some day you're just going to move on\n... worried about being the owner and then if you really want to be the owner then get ready to spend three or four thousand dollars and six months a pain in the bud court actions and you probably can work this through if you can gather up all the people you need\nTo sign on it and that's what you're facing\nSo it's an interesting situation but my guess is it's not worth any more than his vote on it my guess is ill as probably fairly close on this if we thought is worth two hundred thousand bucks is a relative thought it was worth two hundred thousand bucks and Ninety thousand was owed and they were going to get a hundred thousand their pocket when it's all\nKnow sharks would already been circling they would have been trying to figure out some way to get that thing sold and get the courts do it when you die without a wheel and you have to go in and the judge has to you know authorized the sale of the asset and it has to go into a pool to be dispersed too the heirs\nAre just like it would in a wheel but it's just a lot bigger mess\nAnd do you can't get clean title to this thing unless you do all that and you do not want to become the owner of it any other way of doing it properly and getting clean title 'cause you won't be able to sell it if you don't get clean title so that's how you do it if you decided to do it later but for today I Would treat it as cheap rent\nIt's a rental house how much money would you spend on a rental house that you're gonna move often you don't home not [noise] not any as what you would do hope that helps ma'am thanks for calling in this is Dave Ramsey shower\n[noise]\nI get a lot of calls from listeners not knowing what to do with their timeshare I don't care if the reason you want out is because you were

did one ah\nDid one would just it was always crazy people 'cause she kinda Jerry Springer thing going there was always just nutty people on there and I was trying to help them with their money and it was just like I'm the only seen one of the whole dead gums that it was crazy but there was one of the lady that um that they would bring on this lady that was a psychiatrist or psychologist or whatever\nAnd so she was there to like help crazy people with a crazy and I was there to help crazy people with their money thing and that was a it was those shows those kind of show\nAnd um she and I ended up talking in the green room after that and she was the one she gave me that shouldn't be in a study and I read through the whole study I was amazed there was a huge correlation\nBetween extreme levels of financial control\nAnd domestic violence so if you have a friend who is not allowed to go to the grocery store by herself without her husband\nOr her boyfriend if you have a friend that is not allowed to touch money in any way because her husband her boyfriend is incomplete extreme control of every decision around the finances I'll give you a Ninety percent probability he's hidden\nOr\nThat's how that's how strong this study correlation was I mean there's just because there's so many it's a it's all about control\nAnd it's all about bullying at a different level [noise]\nAnd um and so there's just the sicknesses involved there and it shows up in the money believe it or not and and you can see it and and after doing that reading this study all those years ago

[laughter]\n\nThe phone number is ... eight to five five two to five ... eight to five five two to five terror he starts us off this hour in Sacramento Hi Gerry how're you\nDave I'm doing very well and just to let you know I Do a doormat BMW it's at night I actually it's a two thousand but I still adore it so that keeps us that free\nOr it's all good with me how can I help\nExactly okay so um my husband and I we have a house that we don't for Twenty years that was our first family home and we have turned it into a rental and has been for the last Fifteen Years and so our\nMonthly mortgage is about eight fifty per month and we are in the process of looking for new tenant and we have um narrowed it down to three of our top heck\nBut they um unfortunately all of their credit scores are in the low six hundred and they do have little marks on their credit such as a bankruptcy\nI'm due to divorce or medical bills and a collection and um some uh one of our perspective tenants actually just has a um\nA credit card debt that they're slowly paying down but all three of them have actually gone through financial peace university and half certificates that they've all for it at me and and that they have their emergency fines and they have\nUm the parasite income so and I am wondering is that\nI'm a show of a determination a good enough to rent to them even though they have a checkered a credit history pack\nYour average people will trigger pass all the time I'm I'm worried about their future and handed it to the extent that they are past as an indicator of their future you don't rent to them if they go fast\nBut a lot of the authors of those stupid stuff in the past the question is are we still on that road and around in this case all three of them are at least making some level of effort\nTo learn how to handle money and not be in the mouse anymore the financial peas university certificates that's pretty cool I never thought about man go through after you maybe I should do that [laughter] well no it's\nJustin and Sarah are one of those guys are you wonderful day thank you very great welcome welcome where are you guys live\nWe are from Folsom, California right outside of Sacramento\nVery cool nice area yeah and I'm sure welcome good to have you all the way over here in Tennessee and all the way here to do your debt free scream that's correct I'll love it how much of you guys paid off\nPut up two hundred and twenty thousand and two point five years love that good for you very cool on your range of income during that time probably about two twenty two two forty okay making good money what are you guys do for a living I'm a peace officer\nAnd I'm In community relations for an aerospace company\nGreat well done you two very cool so what kind of debt is is two hundred and twenty thousand that's on\nOur house unless you're in California yes\nYou're looking at where people there were people you're fighting warehouse\nDid you ever imagine you have your house paid off or as young as you are how old are you too\nI'm forty six and ... forty seven\nPaid for house boom just like that and all because of you I didn't pay any of it [laughter] you mean by that [laughter] I just made you think you could\nDo it so he went and did it wow that's cool well tell me the story two and a half years ago what happened\nWell Dave about two and a half years I started listening to your show I listen to the podcast on the radio at home and I became very obsessed with it actually I talk to everybody I got I was friends relatives giving her head yes and I I did become a little upset don't you think\nYeah Dave actually the term I coined at some point in this process was hunting I think you need to go to Dave Ramsey rehab\n[laughter] be talk [laughter] I Love it was worse things to get addicted to I guess a proud of that [laughter] so\nHe got a little bit overboard and Sarah is like okay just come on but uh how quickly did you get involved Sarah\nOh very early on I didn't really have a choice you your voices on that and I'm getting ready every day so it was a you know I was in full\nBore and I and just Dusten was the driving force but it was\nReally easy to get on board so you guys are looked at it in together in all seriousness other than the overdoing the day Ramsey part I'm you looked at it together and said hey if we really rolled up our sleeves we can pay off the show that's it you know I had an a ha moment huh\nYup and we're we're a good team we bounce ideas off\nWe bounce ideas off each other and we always dreamed of the same conclusion as to what we were going to do and and here we are\nNow you don't have a payment in the world not that and and the grass does feel better when you walk on it I'm telling you it's not an exaggeration it's a great metaphor but it's also the truth yeah very cool very cool so how long have you been married\nEleven years have you ever been dead for a while you were married\n... know this summit recently now were you ever go back absolutely not too good to be free that amazing and gave my favorite part of our story in our journey is\nWe have that almost Seventeen year old daughter and um the term that we've heard over and over as Mars cut and taught and just seeing how true that is with our daughter it's\nSuch an amazing thing to see and she literally is you know a senior in high school and preaching your program to her peers and this is going to continue on and on and on\nWow so the family tree is changed yes settled down on just with the money part but with the lessons learned yeah oil done you guys think when you tell people to key to getting out of debt is\nWell I think it's planning having a plan communicating with your spouse and being real strategic with your money\nWhen we when they were shopping for groceries would go to the discount you know grocery places ... whether it's going if we're going to go out to eat um we're looking for coupons group bonds some sort of deal when you know when we go out to eat and\nWe pretty much every time we go out to a meal we share an entree and like\nNo I mean every single time so things like that um I don't I'm I'm not a big shopper so all my clothes come from discount stores I never buy anything unless it's on sale that's just how and I and I don't see that changing ever so it can change if you wanted to I mean

promo code Ramsey and you'll see the best possible deal out there\nThese guys are a great company blondes dot com shop is in Illinois is it a good idea to pay for the coverage offered by the gas company and the phone company to cover the lines that run from my house to the street\nIf something were to happen we are not in a financial position to cover any repairs um no I Would not pay for that and I would get in a financial position to cover the repairs it's called your emergency fund so you need to work your way out of that like we teach\nAnd that's maybe step to paying off everything but the house using the debt snowball\nAnd then from there\nOn once that's done once you're out of that everything but the house then we're going to build your emergency fund three to six months of expenses I Do not have any insurance on the things that run to my street on my house is not on any of them\nAnd if something breaks I Will just pay somebody to come out there and dig it up and fix it it's that simple I Would I Do that while I Would use an emergency fund how did I get an emergency fund a didn't give people like this money [noise]\nSo I had more money now are you taking a risk in the meantime yeah I mean you could something happen between now and the time you build it up but the point is get your financial act together and the weird thing is it causes you to end up with more money\nSo here's what's cool do you ever hear the term the rich get richer the poor get poorer\nWhile there are several reasons for that\nAnd it's not oppression and capitalism is evil that's not a rich get rich or poor get poorer because by and large poor people who do rich people stuff with money become rich people overtime\nRich people who the rich people stuff with money stay rich people

fiance and I were just looking for some guidance on something so we don't have very much that we've got about twelve thousand two hundred on a car that's worth about nine or should she got twenty six hundred in student loan debt and then we have our house mhm\nUm we bring home between four thousand I'm forty two hundred a month um and she's looking [noise] she's not really satisfied with their job a career path and she found the majority of our cars coursework to get an associate someone into the um about\nWhere that would fit into steps um 'cause she makes ten Seventy two an hour right now part time but she gets forty hours a week with some benefit\nI'm ... and the programs that she's looking at a as a radiology attack which uh would take her about two years to get done and uh that's made a salary I'm fifty eight year\nA lab technician would take about a year to get done with her current the stuff that would transpire and she'd be making thirty eight thousand after that or an HR specialists would take her about three years was shot that kind of the the last\nYou know choice of hers to get done so well you know we're not we're not that much debt and I just didn't know where where we should focus on first\nWas the first thing is I hear a wide variety of jobs elections here or course yeah she\nTowards the rat pick as their number one it's a really good program here in the local area it's like your now\nYeah you know and I think I hear that you guys were analyzing her career only on the short term income\nUm was she thinking long term she she right now she works in er HR I'm and she really enjoys that she just\nWanted to be doing ... years from now aside from income\nUm or fat but man come she likes working with people and she she was really excited about the rat pack because we did a site there that are kind of a an orientation type thing and she really enjoyed the the teachers and the the facilities and the idea of working with people in that way so of the three I think that would be the best long term for her as\nI said to your program did you say Oh yes sir and we're not at all really\nIt would be around Nineteen thousand but that and think losing remain and work but uh she would have to get for her associates as well as the actual a course work for the degree okay\nSo really what we're seeing is is we need Nineteen thousand dollars over the next two years plus we need a about Fifteen thousand to be dead free over the next two years\nYet so that's thirty five thousand over two years that's Seventeen five a year and you make about a little over fifty a yes so um sounds like you can do Seventeen time of year to me and be a free and pay cash for her school in two years\nOkay I've got a cat it was when when you got a map it out mapped the math out but um you know I may have done something wrong and I was doing the math but I don't think I did\nYeah no that sounds right um so he he plugging away at the desk ... snowball and the short term and save up to pay cash for the right type program\nWell you can you ought to be able to cash flow the ... program is what I'm saying oh oh okay do you need to look at I mean I I I think if she starts now and you figure out okay I got to save this much a month to stay a a one semester ahead of my payments right\nYou got to get you got to get that part moving and then once that's moving and then we start throwing money at the debt and you keep up with your monthly budget basically you saves a set amount above a month's discover the rat deck once you get started here okay and then above

I don't know if there's even ... they're not\nAre not like it's not always that accurate but it's probably not that far off we could use that\nFor discussion purposes okay if you if\nYou found a house that was worth a hundred thousand and you could buy it for Ninety five thousand that really wouldn't be that great a by\nI just be an okay by it's not like you're getting ... a great deal there where you just went wow that's the best deal ever ride yeah this is I'm not sure if\nI'm like they even get kicked out 'cause someone gated or should I leave or should I or I should I go back ran over\nWell where do I want to be long term with it\nYou want to own um\nWell my wife she we kind of didn't want to own because we are I got a daughter she's four and my wife she that school and now so we just trying to kind of settled down right now mhm have you\nGot every angle area if I'm like I say my wife great grandma's house and she'd been here her whole life so she likes it it's like about two and a half three acres\nMhm and um it's kind of in a country will part of Atlanta gotcha okay and how old are you to\nMy wife she turned twenty yesterday and and I'll be Twenty one and a couple of days but we both twenty now\nMhm and you got a one child you said and how much debt that you have\nA we don't have any debt okay and what's your household income\nI I make uh every year but I'm trying to the gate in school but I had to kind of work with the answer to that was that I don't watch I don't know what else\nI pay about six hundred and Seventeen dollars a month\nAnd they seem to always a mind and your wife done work mhm okay that's pretty shy and that's all right on your budget is is very tight on your budget\nAnd we just found out about you not too long ago one of my friends from church he recommended me to start listening to you so now we actually kind of made a budget and stuff on how to eat and we're already kind of\nYou know trying to start it off a little better and\nGood good for you okay well here's the thing if you wanted to buy the house the only way you can buy it is the ah the relatives that are involved that would be the air's a this would be great grandmothers children or grandchildren\nThat would be the air since there was no will someone would have to petition the court you're not going to get a lawyer and go to probe a court in probate court would have to rule that the house could be sold and would assign someone to sign the deed as the cellar\nTo be able to give it to you you're going to have to have a court action to do that that's going to cost three two or three thousand bucks to get all that done\nOkay I don't think you need that expense right now\nYeah though with all the with the numbers you gave me in the situation you're in um now is anybody going to throw you out as long as that mortgages paid I doubt you're gonna get thrown out\nYeah 'cause that's what I was thinking should I because I feel kind of want to actually start even going into real estate because I Do construction and that's what I Do know I kind of this house is kinda is not beat a it's kind of beat up and fight the last few years she\nNow here's like other relatives staying there kind of beaten it up so I I mean I don't know if it's like maybe work more maybe you know what I'm saying they Lincoln flip it and get another house or you know I Lived there unless you become the owner of it\nYeah and and that's why I'm saying like I Do I Need to you'd had I see in a statement learning anything they just hurry up and now like my in the game or should I wait until you what I\nWould do if I were you I Would be willing to walk away from the south someday when you get I I Would treat it like you're renting it\nYou're probably not gonna ever bother to own it and if you do you're going to go through a lot of hassle to become the owner going through this court action that I'm Talking about\nOkay so uh what I Would do is pay the rent or pay that payment is rent I Would not spend any money on this and I wouldn't frets about becoming the owner today\nIt's inexpensive rent in the Atlanta area it's a place you like living any money you spend on it just say to fix it up is money you're probably gonna lose you're probably not ever going to become the owner of this thing\nYeah it's going to be in what's going to be a really\nStrenuous process with the courts to become the owner of this because we don't even know who the errors are\nYeah well I don't I Know a couple of the day is this is not that many of 'em\nOr that they actually even know about it like I said we we may here for a year so I don't know like shit I I I'm not like should I be worried that I'm staying here paying the oil and I just keep paying it\nIn because that's not that you shouldn't be worried because it's not bad rent\nYet but I'm I'm just worried like can't nobody command me out 'cause it's not in my name\nYeah they're going to take you out the people that only can there are the heirs but they'd have to all get their crap together and they're far from doing that\nAnd they're they're they're far away they're like in another state and\nYeah but they're not they're not worried about this is what I'm saying yeah they're not worried about this at all it's not bothering them one way or the other they're not going to get any money out of it when it sells 'cause it's not worth much more than us\nWorth much more than a vote on it if it was valuable now there'd be some sharks and the bar circling right but it's not got any ... because it's not worth any more so you're not going to get kicked out but some day you're going to want to move on so don't spend a bunch of money on it because some of that you're just gonna walk off and leave it\nYeah 'cause they cause I've already done paying eight and ... before they had some something you know and I met my wife had because\nThat's what every money whatever money you spend or make her happy is money has gone\nWhen you leave because there's going to come a day two years from now that you guys are going to stand up and walk away or you're going to go to the trouble to get the heirs to take the thing to probate court\nAnd get to be transferred to your name and you can probably do that but again it's going to cost you a couple of thousand dollars and you'd want to make very sure that the property was worth more than the mortgage before you did that and um\nAnd you don't want to spend a bunch of money renovating his house because you're going to very likely move on in about two years but in the meantime I just looked at it as cheap rent\nTo a place you kind of like living and uh you know six hundred bucks written in line is not a bad gig on two and a half acres so I'm sitting there if I'm you for now\nUh now hurting anything no one's you're not stealing anything you're not doing any more harm the mortgage companies getting paid they're happy the relatives that aren't going to get any money anyway still aren't getting any money everybody's happy but just look at it like you're a renter and some day you're just going to move on\nQuite worried about being the owner and then if you really want to be the owner then get ready to spend three or four thousand dollars and six months of pain in the ... court actions and you probably can work this through if you can gather up all the people you need to sign on it\nAnd that's what you're facing so it's an interesting situation but um my guess is it's not worth any more than his vote on it\nMy guess is ill as probably fairly close on this\nIf we thought his worth two hundred thousand bucks if the relatives thought is worth two hundred thousand bucks and Ninety thousand was owed and they were going to get a hundred thousand their pocket when it's all\nKnow sharks would already been circling they'd have been trying to figure out some way to get that thing sold and get the courts do it when you die without away all you have to go in and the judge has to you know authorized the sale of the asset and it has to go into a pool to be dispersed too the heirs\nAre just like it would in a will but it's just a lot bigger mess and do you can't get cleaned title to this thing unless you do all that and you do not want to become the owner of it\nAny other way than doing it properly and getting clean title because you won't be able to sell it if you don't get cleaned title so that's how you do it if you decided to do it later but for today I Would treat it as cheap rent\nIt's a rental house how much money would you spend on a rental house that you're going to move off and you don't home not [noise] not any as what you would do hope that helps man thanks for calling in this is the Dave Ramsey shower\n[noise]\nGet

like help crazy people with a crazy and I was there to help people with their money thing and that was a it was those shows those kind of show and um she and I ended up talking in the green room after that and she was the one she gave me it shouldn't be in a study and I read through the whole study I was amazed there was a huge correlation\nBetween extreme levels of financial control\nAnd domestic

anymore\n\nBut this email I think indicative of concern I have in this as well\nBecause past history does add up to at very least I I wouldn't call it evidence but a pattern of behavior\nEmail from Mike yesterday said Joe I appreciate what you're trying to do but every time somebody says we should listen to the other side it's Democrats insisting that Republicans need to listen more nobody ever seems to tell Democrats the need to listen more\nWhen Donald Trump calls how Dick Blumenthal\nFor his lying about his Vietnam service everyone says the president is horrible for it\n\nWhy is it we're always the ones that have to listen to the other side\nAnd and that's I think you know as I said a pattern of behavior this idea that there's\nA side and another side this this is indicative of a much deeper problem which is the amount of cash\nWhich is conduit through these offices\nWhether it's a U.S Senate seat or U.S House of representatives seat or hell or Virginia House of delegates or Virginia Senate seat a seat on the album all county board of supervisors is just blood sport over\nA part time job that pays fourteen grand a year\n\nBecause there's patronage money because there's

matter if Ninety percent of the people I haven't found one person has that changed the name but that doesn't matter\nAnd I'm telling you a gel which you ought to get your point or ... or just going to have a night and now we're ... and then when I say that you're going to say what does that name I really don't know what it means but I'm telling you it's going to get to the point\nWhere it is at that point Charlie it is at that point where\nNinety percent of us are be herded by the ten percent that get on TV and I really feel like you and me and what we do hear a again the the vox pop Eli is Joe Thomas's just broadcasting to the echo chamber of but I don't believe it for a second when I see the amount of people that turned out\nAh for events they're not all ...\nTed Cruz you the Heritage Foundation conservatives\nUm so I think there are a lot more people out there listening than either the the\nThe name callers would have you believe bought\nAt ... at the same point you know the the five percent that are out there dominating the TV coverage because they jump up and down into the light their hair on fire and scream and call each other names we've got to stop covering these people because they're not the story there ... and this summer I\nI think you're I think you're west on deck state that's never going to happen because the people that are in your business and you know I Love you know hey hey yes country they hated\nBecause they have to go out and work for it they'd rather go have a sign to them by the government they look at government as a assignments they look into the er the b._b._c. or the or ... or any of these government assigned\nIs truth I'd love to say I would love to say the the book clubs get more coverage than the dumpster fires but the dumpster fires or what gets the coverage\n\nFear and loving fear unloading\n\nBecause otherwise it's waving the white flag if there's an example\nThe Donald J Trump is going to be is is out there giving all of us is that take the slings and arrows be righteous I'm not saying that you you eat we can get some grab as thick phoney baloney plastic banana good time Charlie and and dress them up in a red neck tie I'm saying that if you are righteous\nAnd you you are ready to serve your community\nAnd to do it not to aggrandize yourself let's not forget one of the the things that really makes these people mad about Donald\nTrump Donald Trump didn't need to be president\nDonald Trump's of rich guy\nWhy Donald Trump's lifestyle has actually decreased in stature he's writing and less well appointed airplanes and living in older you know less well appointed houses\n\nHe was before he became president he's probably\nAnd older you know less well appointed houses\n\nThan he was before he became president he's probably the first person in our lives certainly since the Roosevelt wandered around maybe a Kennedy\nWho's actually taken a step back in lifestyle to be president\n\nAnd that I think that they'd fury eights them as well because there's people need that kind of fat cat\nWife can't earn it on their own energy you when you got yours Trump\n\nBut we need people who aren't going to be on the album all board of supervisors to build a career for themselves maybe it happens maybe it happens anyway but don't don't run for the album Rome or green county school board because you're going to build a future gubernatorial run off of it\nIf you look in the mirror to brush your teeth this morning and you see a state senator looking back at you don't run for the Charlottesville city council please\n\nWe need people who want to do that and job and then move on maybe up maybe to another job I don't believe it up and down in the world of the body politic I don't believe that the you know Rob Bell is less important than Donald Trump\nI truly don't\nYou may disagree with me on whether the Bryce Reeves is higher or lower esteem then\nJason\n... but I I don't think there's a difference there serving their constituents\nMaybe it's because I I I work in a business where you're sitting by yourself Ninety nine point nine percent of all listeners to a radio program or sitting by themselves at this very moment I Will almost guarantee you are sitting by yourself\nYou're sitting by yourself right now\nYelling at the radio what may be doing but you and I are having an individual

out with my home improvement for the day this time of year those of us who are lucky enough to have\nTrees to provide some shade have to pay for that privilege by waking up their father leaves I've got a few tips for you that will make this autumn ritual\nA bit less painful don't break anything you can mow leaves the fall on your lawn can be removed easily as long as you're still cutting the grass when the grass stops growing and you need to start raking be sure to wear gloves to save your hands from blisters\nDon't break on a windy day and tried to rake before it rains not after don't break long distances bringing relief back to the leaves not the other way around if you have a lot of leaves try raking them onto a tarp and then pulling the tarp along with you as you work\nAnd if your community has a leaf recycling program participate in it you're autumn leaves could be wonderfully rich compost next spring finally don't forget to have some fun jumping on a\nPile of leaves is one of the great joys of childhood that never seems to get all get more info and Bob Vila dot com and right here at home with me about the [noise]\nFox News the CBS Nineteen whether authority forecast all coming up after John Peterson's award winning WC gauge the local news first ...\nWe can vote for that authority or just there's ten or Fifteen of them and only one of me so I guess they win mob rule is on the march\n\nAnd the politicians are doing their dance to try to stay in their office\nLike Niro fiddling while Rome burns\n\n... circle back to the uh a perjury trap I told you about with Kavanaugh New York times is saying well Trump's taxes show that these are the manipulate the tax code is really I you know as opposed to the federal government that they'd be laid at the tax code to target Tea Party groups\n\nAnd this is a world where people will send rice in through the mail to the president of the United states\nAnd the U.S senator and lord knows who else\n\nWe joke here when a package shows up for the radio station ... has it gone through security first\n\nBut this is what they want to do they want to silence opposition\nThey wanted to silence through\nEither guilt by association use David Duke and his Mary Annette ...\nAnd yes I mean the ones you think I mean because they were nothing more than David Dukes Mary and that's that's why we know who David Duke is and and David Duke is it you know the the nights in white satin\nAnd we know who he is and we've identified him in there than we can roll from that point\nAnd he and his local Mary Annette do their thing and then it's guilt by association your Ed Gillespie or your ... your Joe Thomas it doesn't make a difference you're guilty by association therefore you're deplorable and you can't be seen with him the only person who seems to continue to roll from that as Donald Trump\nAnd maybe that's the lesson or to take a couple of minutes out here we've got to John Walton coming up from the Washington Capitals there'll be on the radio to night after the Corey Stewart Tim Kaine forum\nOpen their defense of the Stanley Cup I Want to get into that as well the Cuban crew's coming up in a Louisa or the middle of verse out or you know what I'm going to jump to you on the phone first and then we got some clips from the Corey Stewart to McCain debate last night let me give you first Hi who's this\nIs Steve Steve how're you doing sir\nPretty good I add one one question a lot of questions but one thing to bring up on this on this of\nAl Thomas you know are seeing that uh or former mayor or city council member ... signature on up real quick and said he had no knowledge of it well if you're the you're the mayor during that\n... member ... jumped up real quick and said he had no knowledge of it well if you're the you're the mayor during that stretch which was a he had no knowledge of it then I'll come you didn't have any knowledge of it is basically a\nWell because that's the city manager style of government see if that's the kind of the word mayor ... that's why I referred a woman's head counselor Mikhail walkers just head councilor she's not mayor in the in the sense that most people you hear the word mayor which is the executive branch of Charlottesville government\nThat's that's the city manager\nOr the temporal city manager\nI understand that concept but at the same time wasn't the same mayor at that moment on that set all the current uh city manager that you worked for me and I'll have your job on two different occasions\nWhere he likes is cake you know you didn't know anything about what the\nWhat the what was going on with the police you know I don't buy it I think we need an FBI investigation\n[laughter] maybe we can delay any further city council actions until the conclusion of our FBI investigation\nOr or to take five days [laughter]\nBut that is why I bring up by ... but ...\nBut the this is my point about twenty Nineteen his signature seat is up for election in twenty Nineteen who's going to run for it\nBecause these are the decisions that are made and these are the authorities given by the seats and ... it's great fun and it's great theater to sit out here in ... verbal Molotov cocktails that Mike Seeger\nUm but you know we we've got to turn out when Kennedy Jackson or a Mike proves your a buddy Weber is running for city council we've got to turn out in in every single one of us has to turn out\nUh and and vote for this because this lunacy and and reporting is good because maybe some of the people who voted for Mike signature would started to consider a common sense you know free market here I Would even say the R word\nOr a for city council but at some point the this has to become so embarrassing to the rest of the city\nThat they will turn out because the city council seat or elected with five thousand votes in a city with twenty thirty thousand registered voters I mean it's a ... minute number of people we've got to turn the people out that's what we've gotta do Steve\nWell I I just thought it was it was laughable once the once they realized that you bought a new home\nThey're a write off main so close to the liquor store there they stand as you get the ABC or to a new that liquor store that didn't work but\nOne good one silver lining and then I'll go uh thinking the whole thing is we had we had a mayor that had

that's not about statues that's about anti Semitism and hatred and we have to speak out\nAgainst anti Semitism and hatred\nIs it was a frequent\nColleague and champion of Jason Kessler who helped organize that unite the Right rally in Charlottesville\nCorey Stewart was a frequent champion of a guy named Paul ... who was connected with the people who put that rally on who's a white supremacist an anti Semite Corey even called him quote my personal hero\nCorey Stewart went to Alabama to campaign for Roy Moore he has a defender that yet Roy Moore had been out and not only\nAs somebody who is preying on teenage girls but Roy Moore had famously said African Americans were better off\nIn the priest in the slavery times and Corey Stewart as late as last December was still trafficking in the conspiracy theory that President Obama's birth certificate was forged statue issues can be dealt with by the local governments are state governments if they listen to their colleagues\nBut what we can't stand this hatred and we have to stand against it and we have to make sure that\nPublic officials who associated with Senator Kay or not elected you have one minute chairman stories you very much they fly\nYou know I despise racism and bigotry and all shapes and forums and if I find out that somebody is that way I I absolutely denounce them and I did that in the case that the gentleman that he mentioned but here's the thing that folks what's good for the goose is good for the gander\nAnd you know we've had here in Virginia today and the fifth congressional district who ... up with not literally but his campaign is together in Charlottesville sharing office space with their congressional\nCandidate Leslie Coburn who is an open anti Semite\nWho is called Israelis a menace who has blamed every problem in America upon people at the Jewish faith\nAnd he's together in that office with her and he hasn't done that\nAnd you know the other thing as it get down the far left violent left wing group of antifa\nHe will not condemn them\nHe's very quick to condemn somebody who is absolutely got no connection to him but when it comes to somebody has a little bit closer he wanted done it\nAs from last night's he pulls debate notice the lack of people on the stage a lot of media people but I guess that's all that matters WC gauge be time seven twenty eight\nOver Seventy years she's
