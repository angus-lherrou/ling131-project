and others and we get into the message this evening Hebrew is twelve and I want you to agree with me burst fourteen and Fifteen the word of God commands us and he was twelve or fourteen\nSlow pace

then got tonight help each one of us to keep our hearts and minds stayed on Christ\nAs we talk about battling bitterness our previous and Jesus name amen\nI call your attention again diverse Fifteen\nOr the writer says working diligently list any man sale of the grace of God let any route bitterness springing up trouble you\nAnd thereby many beat a file I Want to say tonight that bitterness is like a cancer in age from the inside out of a person and no matter how long you nurse or grudge it just never seem to get better\nIt leaves you with pain and agony it such that life\nOut of your spirit I there were bitterness has been defined\nA feeling of deep resentment\nAnger and even ill will it as an added to the coldness where spiritual and emotional ... takes place and the day after day an hour after hour\nIt eats away at the sole sadly I've known people who've because of bitterness had become a useless\nWell listen bitterness is laptop potato game\nIf you don't get rid of it you're going to lose a and that's why God said put it away from you but you know oftentimes ... regulation has ignored\nAnd sometimes bitterness is embraced\nAnd its embrace many times because it it may be makes us feel vindicated\nIn fact at the time being angry with somebody feels good\nBut I Want to tell you the truth from experience the feeling don't last long\nEventually turns into hurt\nYou or hurt\nIt's an awful thing that comes from this'll be is again guide ...\nAll bitterness all of them we\nPut away from you but anyway bitterness comes from this will be to God regulation but then I as a thought about this thing of bitterness it likewise comes from dysfunction and relationships\n\nAnd you say what do you mean by that here's what I mean ah said that one person in the other can that happen in the Baptist church absolutely\nSo say it's worse than offends another person will be offended person\nSometimes rather than obeying the admonition to if your brother show ... against you go and tell him his fall\nBetween them alone right that is what Matthew Eighteen Fifteen says but right on to do that sometimes people rather than communicate the offense and confront they will consume isn't their hearts\nThey just try to various\nTry to keep it in holding to themselves they don't deal with is uh and and ah by confronting the person and and they say well you know confronting this person over here they won't do it\nSo they don't deal with it and and uh by confronting the person and and they say well you know confronting this person over here it won't do any good because they don't allow it or they\nThey won't apologize or they want to admit to it so why bother\nAnd ah that rather than to confront the person and communicate the offense\nThey conceal it\nBut in the process they set of themselves up to become a candidate for bitterness\nA better hand bitterness comes from this a main God regulation when it comes from dysfunction in relationships uh there's a third place that comes from it comes from being in different for righteousness\nAnd what I mean by that is\nIt is always right to do right\nEven if it don't make any sense to you\nAnd you see God Jesus tells us if your brother offends you tell him his fault between being him alone\nWhether you think it'll do any good or not is irrelevant\nWhen you take the position that said he won't he won't admitted he won't apologize it won't do any good human being in different orders right\nListen veteran is off to being shown by God's people\nAnd you know when you when you think about a classic example\nOf bitterness I'll let me ask you to turn to mark ... jet for six if you would\n\nIn March six verse for team it\nTells us there that want to hear it had heard about Jesus\nHe said that John the Baptist was risen from the dead and therefore mighty works do show for themselves and him others said that it is a last and others said this is a profit or as one of the profits\nBut when you hear and her there and he said it is John who might be headed he has risen from the dead bird heritage so had sent fourth and laid hold upon John and bound him in prison for her rodeo say his brother Philips\nWhy he hadn't married her for John headset on day here it is not lawful for the to have that brother's wife\nTherefore notice this her rodeos had a quarrel against him and would it kill them but she could not for a ... a heritage here John knowing that he was adjustment unholy\nAnd observed in and when he heard him he did many things and hurt him gladly and when it convenient thing was gone that aired on his birthday made a separate to his lawyers\nTy captains and cheapest days have galley and when the daughter of the said erroneous came in and danced employees territory and then that sat with him the king said under the damsel\nAsking me what sort of that will and I'll give it the end he swear under whatsoever they also asked me out and given the under the half of my kingdom and she went for then senator or a mother watch all ask for [noise]\nAnd she said\nNow when I when I read that I realized that bitterness calls the death of a shame\nThat you see that were there when it when he talks about how she had a quarrel again John that where the coral their means literally a it was something she could not let go\nSee here here's what happened a hair and was married to one lady but he became enamored with erroneous his brother his wife\nSo he divorced his first wife married her odious but yet John the Baptist said hey parrot\nSo he divorced his first wife married her odious\nBut yet John the Baptist said hey parrot that's not right you should not that's wrong didn't do that\nOf course there and really burn erroneous bridge she got angry about that and she had a quarrel against ... and would have killed in\nAnd when she got her first chance\nIt seems that every day in\nChurches all across our world\nRelationships are killed\nI mean killed\nOr you can go to nearly any divorce court and find a divorce is taking place because of bitterness that was not dealt with\nYou can go to any independent Baptist church no matter where you want to go and you can find people who because of bitterness the relationship has been killed\nThey won't talk to each other they won't sit with each other they are and to see each other how senseless was churches have split\nBitterness is data\nTo to relationships it will kill relationships are but you know ... likewise will kill somebody's effectiveness and serving God see a bitterness is a deadly things and it happens a pastor's I I was up\nAt about ... personal example I I Am very\nClose friend of mine was hers by another person\nAnd my close friends told me about this\nAnd a listen this friend of mine is is is like a parent to me\nOkay like apparent to me\nAnd so ah when I heard about this I\nWas very angered by uh in fact every time I heard this other fellow his name\nI started having these\nWhich not going to get even\nI couldn't hear the man's name without becoming angry\nAnd it was ... and\nThere was a time when I was talking to another preacher and this person's name came up\nAnd I started getting those angry resentful feelings\nI started praying for the man\nBut see ... can hit anybody\nIt will destroy affecting us it'll hurt your your your life it is a terrible terrible\nFly it as a bird [noise]\nIn fact a ... it's sort of like a cinder block time your neck or as you try to swim through the waters of life a little harder to use the more heavier because until it'll take you down to the bottom and that's why the ... tax follow peace with all men right\nAnd and how long this without which no man shall see the lord looking diligently west\nAny man's filled with recent God list any route of bitterness springing up trouble you\nAnd notice\nSay listen bitterness or does it just hurt me\nOr it can hurt you two\nIn in ... homes one spouse becomes bitter for some reason maybe not or a spouse or his spouse\nBut the other spouse is oftentimes the recipient of the acid which spills over into the relationship\nBitterness is a terrible thing more raw view it will steal from you or it will kill you\nThe bills over into the relationship\nListen bitterness is a terrible thing more raw view it will steal from you or it will kill the relationships it's a terrible terrible things and to a ... and it happens\nSimply because we've not handle things in the Bible way and uh now I I Would say there's probably\nSome people in this auditorium\nEither have or are having experiences are experiencing bitterness\nAnd maybe you have to end the some of the symptoms are these no one symptom of veterans is a tendency to mistreat the one who hurt you\nAnother a set of symptom is having an unpleasant false when their name comes up\nJust like I did or giving them the silent treatment or whenever you see them or if you don't get on the side for you when you say Hi but only to save face when others are watching you\nTaxing companies who choose not to elect to pay for what your neighbor needs it was one big redistribution scheme\nNow if you deal with direct primary care direct access to doctors and we've talked about health savings accounts and we also talked about atlas MD Dr Josh ...\nAnd Dr Lee s gross this model now has been duplicated around the country and what happens is there's no pre existing conditions prejudice at all if you can afford a cell phone you can pretty much afford a\nA direct access to your doctor no insurance no problem you pay for what you need fifty dollars a month for an adult ten dollars a month per child\nThey negotiate directly with the pharmaceuticals so they have Ninety to Ninety five percent reduction and we have high blood pressure if you have a cholesterol problem you walk out of the doctor's office with the medicine and a greatly reduced rate than you'd ever pay at any drug store\nIt's actually it's now been implemented in his working in over five hundred practices around the country\nIt was pioneered by my friend Dr Josh ... joins us now atlas MD and Dr Lee as gross president of doctors were patient care I'm I Am I pretty much explaining it right is there anything I'm missing and I would call this concierge care for every American\nI the only problem is Sean Everytime you talk about it our phone started ringing and we've got regular patients\nFailed you'll have a lot of them to write\n[noise] we we have a you know a A R o pan over there and yeah we're fulltime family physicians but no you nailed it\nWell I mean so and you have all these pace now the bottom line is I think most people like me and I have friends of mine that are doctors or you know and friends of mine that will take care of me friends of mine that will take a call at three AM if I'm not feeling well or which has happened occasionally in my life and these guys you know I ...\nI mean I pay them and they take my insurance does but they do it as more of our friendship but this is something every American can have access to\nAbsolutely\nYeah at Texas plane how you're making it work there and how it works for your team exactly\nUh you know I think this is like a lot of things um Silicon Valley style\nOr Netflix or Amazon Prime uh people are being be Hoover they they want a better product faster cheaper easier and and that's what Dr gross and I have done with our respective clinics\nIs just decrease the paperwork the headaches a half of the middle man so that now medicines are penny pill now you can call ... ... email your doctor now health care with your own private doctors cheaper than a cell phone\nI told this is now they implement how many places did you get this finely up and running around the country I don't think you're explaining it in detail enough here explain exactly what this service does and how this can be implemented for every American\nSure there's over a thousand doctors doing the direct care model across the country and\nIt's a flat membership rate based on age it's insurance free for unlimited home visits work visits office visits it free tele medicine so you can call text email your doctor we have no co pays for anything any procedure we can do in the office is free of charge\nStitches biopsies joined generations ultrasounds Hartman\nThe co pays for anything any procedure we can do in the office is free of charge stitches biopsies joined ... ultrasounds heart monitors lung monitors um and then wholesale medications and labs for up to Ninety five percent savings\nI mean this is a grassroots movement and patients just need to get out and let the doctors know that this is a better way to get health care and they support it and and that's why I think we've seen this gross so much in the last several years\nAnd then what's missing is the fact that it can be duplicated now I don't know the exact complications that might exist in say a big city like New York city you know nine million people or Los Angeles and San Francisco but in small towns and smaller cities it is working Dr gross that's the point\nYet it's working everyone but I think you know people really need to understand is that you know this is not a decision between you know\nThe former correct I mean we want to go down there they are trying to take down the path of socialized total government controlled health care you know at a time where people are able to choose their health care decisions based upon their individual DNA or going to take a one size fits all approach to health care it doesn't make any sense and\nYou know Democrats don't want their healthcare chosen by Donald Trump anymore than Republicans walk their healthcare chosen diagnose Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi so you know why are we inserting the politicians into health care with it that the government control health care system when you can have a better way through a direct primary care relationship\nWe're not we leave this is the failure of Obamacare you spend billions and billions more\nAnd you get far in theory or care because it never really was about the patient really was always about\nRedistribution of wealth and you know I can go over like I did yesterday all the top number we already have redistribution of wealth in America you have the top three percent of taxpayers paying the majority of income one percent pays almost forty percent the top fifty percent of wage earners\nPay Ninety seven percent\nSo what they've tried to do is ... ... for example they forced the young\nAnd generally healthy Americans to buy expensive plans that they didn't need and couldn't afford and then penalize them if they didn't get the plan when they would have been better off paying for one check up a year right out of their own pocket\nAnd also getting a catastrophic plan if God Forbid they had the accident or got cancer or at a young age which rarely happens had a heart attack right Dr amber\nYep this is a one size fits non model hum it's too expensive for young healthy people and it doesn't provide the service that older adults need in an affordable timely way and so we need to streamline the whole system the problem is that politicians have always tried to\nEnsure everything but now we're to the point of ensuring you medicines that cost a penny a pill I can get a thousand ... blood pressure medicine for four dollars and Ninety cents\nSo the big box retailers will show you Ninety pills for ten dollars a highway robbery we knew cancer or for for six dollars a month in some cases\nThe fact is now we just need less insurance that means health insurance is can compete on quality\nAnd and lower their price just like Fifteen minutes we'll save you Fifteen Percent on car insurance we need to get back to a competitive model for the patients are in control and cares affordable and insurance is just for the big stuff but the rare stuff\nWe're at you with Congress though in other words these are solutions no insurance no bureaucrats you know doctors being able to do what they do their the innovators in this upfront pricing lower costs no government mentally All right well that's true\nHow do you get Congress how many people are in Congress that are supporting your model I Know\nA middle and all that is true how do you get Congress how many people are in Congress that are supporting your model I Know\nFor example Rand Paul and I think Lindsey Graham or two people say well block grant the money and then let the states determine how to do it themselves which would then would I think open a path for people like you to expand I didn't even greater level\nNow health care's local I mean that's the important thing you know the health care should be between you and your doctors and one thing that's clear as the calorie is not coming from Washington to save us\nNow we wait for solutions from Washington it's not coming we need doctors and patients to get the other six cause problems themselves and that's exactly what this loop and the movement does is it to eliminate\nAny asking for permission from from Washington to take care of our\nYou know well look I Hope that these people in Washington and here you but it's it is interesting that the one look every American worried about their health care rightly so every American has been burned by broken promises you know and the fact that the Democrats have this perception that somehow they're the great\nThe great solution the healthcare after the Obamacare debacle is laughable to me but unfortunately with voters three weeks out of an election that's how some of them feel as I read these polls\nSo ah anyway I really appreciate both of you being with us Dr Josh number Dr Lee is gross the probably one of the defining issues that caused people make people think the Democrats are actually going to help them and it's not\nA we appreciate your time eight hundred nine four one shown as a toll free telephone number if you want

George W. Bush\nUm when Elizabeth Warren talked about the criminal justice system being racist front at that time she got so many people angry there's a lot of families out there that care about community safety and here she is insulting law enforcement so this is a different race and I think most people are expecting and I think now that uh she made it very clear that she wants to run for the White House some twenty twenty\nI'm In ... Massachusetts whatsoever\nOn this is a no brainer for a lot of people out there and and of course the integrity issue I'm not really concerned about her ancestry but the integrity of claiming Native American heritage is what I think people are most concerned about it and she says one thing all the time and does another she wants to raise your taxes Sean\nBecause you're a one percent or but she also herself detected fifty thousand dollars worth of closed in one year\nTo lower her own taxes that Israel is at this point\nFifty thousand dollars in old clothes that's like the Clintons deducting their use the underwear as a U.S that's all true they did it as a tax deduction by the way I don't think anybody wants their old underwear and they put a value to it you know I've always said that is just that\nThey did it as a tax deduction by the way I don't think anybody wants their old underwear [laughter]\nAnd they put a value to it you know I've always said this Jeff that basically liberals are generous only with other people's money and we had the latest numbers from twenty sixteen come out and the bottom fifty percent of taxpayers in this country they ought to pay three percent of the bill just three we have redistribution\n... percent pay forty percent of the bill you know I mean so I mean I don't know what else\nThe tax cuts the fact that they want their crumbs back they want to impeach Trump they want endless investigation they want to keep Obamacare disaster they wanna lemonade eyes open borders I mean that's the whole thing and hate Trump that's it\nYeah she wants to get rid of ice in fact it was a Cambridge a warrant supporter about a month ago that was arrested for putting a five hundred dollar bounty on ice officers I mean you know her rhetoric actually is dangerous in when Republicans wanting to fix health care make it actually affordable about a year ago she was the one that said the\nRepublicans want blood money from the American people know this is right after Congress in ... had been shot by that Bernie Sanders supporters so you know she really doesn't seem to be able to temper her rhetoric whatsoever and I think if you saw on Monday after the backlash of putting that video out\nA and she got a lot of backlash around the country including Democrats like David Axelrod even was critical\nOr she went on a twenty six I Believe tweet a rant about Donald Trump just obsessed with Donald Trump and has no focus at whatsoever on Massachusetts and what's important here whereas a you know I've been a legislator here for eight years I've actually\nPut two billion dollars in tax cuts back in people's pockets and they know it and we've been campaigning pretty strongly I think that again you're going to be pleasantly surprised in November six with what happens\nIs that I Hope so are you may not notice about my background but I live five years in Rhode Island ah in Warren Rhode Island's not far from the ... borders with Massachusetts and you know I spent a lot of time this was by the way when it was the greatest NBA time in history with magic\nVersus Larry Bird and and parish McHale and DJ and Danny Ainge I mean it was probably one of the best teams in one of the best rivalries ever in sports\n... annual hall then up by bend a Boston alone it's a beautiful city but I Will tell you that you know if the people of Massachusetts don't see through those I don't know what to tell them\n[laughter] look Steve grow in the former quarterback probably around the time you were there is not enjoy my race to Curt Schilling indoors but most importantly\nBy the way where the home right he needs to endorse or [laughter] or we need to get that had his locker Tom Brady is the most hated man except for\nNew England he's the most hated man in football number one because he's a phenomenal football player and they just don't like\nThe fact that he wins that much and they don't like the fact that they as you know a pretty wide who used to be a model they just hate him for it\nRight well look at you know\nShown a lot has changed since you've been here unemployment's now at the lowest we've seen in New England and Massachusetts since Nineteen sixty nine that's that's for the whole country the Massachusetts is even lower it said three point five percent right now warring wants to repeal the tax cuts of two thousand Seventeen that have given our state\nMore money as far as new jobs wage increases our states collected over one point two billion dollars in unanticipated revenue because of that she called the crumbs just like a Nancy Pelosi and she if she had her way would undo that\nAnd raise your taxes I think she said fifty percent with the the baseline and she's not sure if she had Ninety percent might be too much when she was on ah MSNBC a few weeks ago Ninety percent maybe too much but at least fifty percent and then of course she wants to make it fully government run health care which as we know has a thirty six trillion dollar\nPrice tag attached to it and of course that puts a bureaucrat between you and your doctor or if you like government run health care that you love having a you know to wait for a hip replacement like Canadians do or die\nThat puts a bureaucrat between you and your doctor or if you like government run health care that you love having a you know to wait for a hip replacement Canadian Stewart dialysis like people\nAre so many Canadians come to the United states when they need heart surgery because they get better care that they're willing to pay for here that's why\nLike government has to ration health care if they take it over and by the way there is no incentive to drive down costs once government becomes the guaranteed ... just like student loans you know it was a bit worn complains about the cost of college course she\nCharged two hundred and fifty thousand dollars to teach one course at Harvard or that you know the fact is when government becomes the ... of the loans or whether it's a student just salt or not doesn't matter those\nColleges get their money and so they drive to cost a year after year after year when government gets involved and takes the free market out of it as competitiveness then that's when costs become completely out of control for us the average Americans\nWell I Wish you the best in this race and I hope our friends of Massachusetts in Boston and everywhere in between will pay attention to you know the big lie of Elizabeth Warren and understand what a real true ambitions are here\nFor her to become president you got to re elect er and Jeff deal is offering a better economic vision and better security for the people of Massachusetts and I wish you well an eraser\nThanks Sean if people want to get

Sean huge fan of yours Trump's order a thank you what's going on\nHey I gotta I gotta kind of an idea that might help her out on the uh the midterms what do you think about getting Trump to your address to the ... and televised address that way the fake news can't block anything showing all of his accomplishment on TV\nI Love I Love the idea I'll tell you what would happen is the media will uncover immediate and now they're trying to blackout\nOf the Trump you know literally put a ban on all the Trump or rallies that are going on and by the way they do it to their own detriment because people want to watch them now I mean boxes run run a number of them we can't you know run every single one\nUh but uh I I Will tell you that that's pretty popular TV for a lot of people and there's a lot of fun and I think you know the fact that he's talking about positive results and that we're better off than we were two years ago it's a pretty good message why would the media want that when they were in the pockets of people\nThat the slant solidly Democrats solidly socialist left\nAbsolutely totally agree with you I think I think that would I think I'm doing that would be would bring people out of the woodwork so you know 'cause people people would watch it if you do to address to the nation just an idea\nWell I think it's a good one I like it and maybe should just do it on cable because you know everyone forgets how this was the most surprising remember Linda when we were battling you know that weirdo pervert late night host what's his name Jimmy Kimmel\nAnd I've heard of Howard Stern talking about it I Know that he's friends with Jimmy Kimmel and why is he battling Hannity Hannity's on cable you know Jimmy is on a network ... had any probably wants to be on a

coming\nYou know I don't know why [noise]\nTom wrote a into 'em to a lot of us who including um the great Mickey Lewis in myself [noise]\nMy wife asked me the other day when I actually had changed my views and started paying attention to conservatism and this is the way a lot of folks do it because a lot of us don't even realize were conservative and this is something that I've noticed since\nMy fifty five year journey began it when I was twenty two twenty there's nobody talked in terms of conservative\nOr progressive or liberal you were either a good mayor or a bad mayor you're either a good congressman or your bag\nCongressman the city of New York was bankrupt because John Lindsay was spending money on ridiculous infrastructure all things while the Bronx was falling into disrupt air uh and economic decay and they were just sending money to poor people in the Bronx rather than trying to help them get jobs\nIt wasn't ...\nAnd they were just sending money to poor people in the Bronx rather than trying to help them get jobs\n\nIt wasn't because he was a Democrat\nIt was because this was the wrong way to do things it was right and wrong it wasn't right and left\nBut so Tom's email goes on to say I realize that when I got back to Virginia and realize that the liberals an album rural county you wanted to control what we built on our own property and also wander to increase the taxes on our own property\nAnd now that we're on a fixed income until we would have to give up our land wanted their name on our property deed to weigh in control I you open space\nI started really paying attention to the constant stream of progressive and liberal media spin\nThat's what this is really all about Trump only said that people were beginning to realize that progressive is and was taking America quote over a course that is beyond the point of no return never more obvious than in Charlottesville or our morale county goes on\nTo the post script of this email um is you know starting the week off right sneaking into a country doesn't make you an immigrant anymore than breaking into a house makes you part of the family I Love that part of it um\nAppreciate it but it also opens up that ... as we are two weeks away from the mid terms\nThe low hanging fruit that you become political footballs is this idea that conservatives don't care\nIt may be a poverty is something only a progressive can address was talking about\nThis at the walk to end the old timers which by the way I give everybody a standing ovation for the walk to end the old timers with a momentary digression please you know standing\nOvations [noise]\nThere's usually is still a couple of weeks of fund raising that goes on after the ... that uh is involved in a reaching their goal\nThey were at their goal at the end of the walk itself it never happens two hundred and\nFifty nine thousand dollars I mean you guys were amazing isn't blowing way past that they help those impacted by all summers but at the walk talking to some folks who are part of the unity coalition or that I helped start up with you know democratic candidate Lawrence gone all the time we go\nAfter the riots in Charlottesville ... born by Terry McAuliffe and Brian Moran and I've talked to five or six people over the just the last two weeks who back me up on my\nInstincts regarding how our Thomas wound up the fall guy and you know it was a hundred and thirty four thousand dollar hush money confirms but the idea that\nConservatives don't care about the plight of a poor person or somebody who needs medical treatment is patently false\n\nIn the same way that a parent\nCan't be accused of child neglect because they don't give them a cookie when they're screaming for one in the grocery store\n\nAnd we've all been in you know some of us have been that couple where the kid is having a tantrum in the ... whether it's a big box store grocery store\nWe've all been in you know some of us have been that

something they don't know the best way to get it so they're just going to make a ruckus until somebody pays attention to them\n\nIt's not about caring about poverty or caring about health care in this false flag argument that the left is using approaching the midterms that they've circled back as I told you on friday now health care has been brought back as the classic it\nSince nothing else has worked and the poll numbers have flagged it's we'll out the classic hit from two thousand and eight\nAren't you afraid of what might happen if you get sick vote for us and we'll make sure there'll be government there\n\nAnd sadly you when you point out that instances in places where that's the\nCase what they're telling you isn't true\nWhat we're not doing is telling you we have better answers for health care or poverty remediation\n\nAnd it struck me we are but you've probably heard me say this\nBefore\nThat what truly is bothering me the most about our friends on the left\nIs that they treat poverty like it is like it's a chronic ailment\nThat somebody who is poor is always going to be poor Ralph Northam and his six million dollars to help provide\nMedical sterilization to the poor people that need to quote plan their families much more carefully is a great example of this how about you help them not be poor [noise] how about your work on that for a little bit [noise]\nLet me get to

you're doing for this year uh hopefully we see the numbers getting better but talking about some of the things we learned from the the report that the survey that was done last year\nYou know I think the main thing that struck me from from last year's report is that everybody you know they they they see the news to hear the news to understand that there's a threat out there um but when asking companies that were they planning to\nSpend more money or to to take any more action against cyber the cyber threat\nAh in general the the consistent answer was no we're not we're not planning to do anything so we are we ... we closed out actually the survey on friday and we're working on the report right now and we're hoping\nThat that those numbers will will change as we as we released this report that will see that there's a little more recognition of the threat and that that as companies they have to recognize this threat and take action to prevent that\nWe mentioned Thursday itself four to seven at the Jefferson theater a easy access and that is so many folks taking part in along with yourself a watch guard technology cyber security uh SAS um\nYeah I mean like this and do we

we could be doing I'm not really I think that people can panic and things that people come down\nWe're shortage jobs right now in the labor market based in the fact that we don't have the people to fill those jobs in the district [noise]\nI support free community college but also focusing on career on vocational opportunities as well\nSo we're doing a school through right now and I'm really excited to see a lot of our district schools already have those opportunities and our school so kids are already getting the training either go on to college a vocational training or writing to the job market which I think it's really exciting because for far too long we focused on everybody needs to go to college and end up in a\nAnd now we're seeing a shortage of plumbers electricians car mechanics so we need to make sure that we're respecting those jobs which are really good jobs to make sure that people that want to enter those fields have the opportunity as well\nUm and I think I don't know if we'll talk about this later but I Do support um honoring the um that you can forget student loans um if you go into public service\nAnd I also want to make sure that we are holding schools accountable these for profit schools that um scams students into signing up for their and they never get all of 'em legitimate degree we need to make sure that those schools are held accountable\n[noise]\nIt's like having a Fox News you're hearing your national ... am I on line and now that I'm sure\nThese\n\nMen they needed back from those a firm that fraud now\nThat two devices making it much more difficult for those students to get those payments I Do not support her approach on this\nI think that those institutions that the fraud college students need to be held accountable and right now in in the house there's going to take too long for this amount of time but there are two contradictory bills one Republican one Democrat\nThe Republican bill wants to uh give more money to on line to institutions and less money to students and they were and the Democrats have the other way around so I support the Democratic though right thank you\nJust sort of the candidates and the audience\nOr nothing to\nDo with these questions these questions come from the alliance okay I did not write them the alliance there just to be clear about that\nUm village were regional business allied supports comprehensive tax reforms that work to strengthen the economy and create jobs\nAnd promote investment what tax policies would you as an elected representative of the people propose an advocate for if elected Mr Klein well\nPleased that Congress has taken action to at least temporarily reduce taxes for individuals and for businesses reduce our corporate income tax which was among the nation's highest of the world's highest and uh I Would seek to keep that rate low ...\nYou use our corporate income tax which was among the nation's highest of the world's highest and uh I Would seek to keep that rate low because it is creating jobs it is creating economic growth and we're seeing that in in record him out here in this country and in Virginia\nSo fighting to keep taxes low I'm fighting to remove the tax burdens from businesses that create the jobs that would be my where my priority would be in Congress that's where it's been an enrichment for many years as well [noise]\n\nFor me um as far as tax reform as concerned\nWhat we're seeing right now is pretty incredible when you look at the job numbers were the lowest jobless jobless claims and forty nine years we have two point nine percent unemployment in Virginia right we're Fort when two percent GDP Growth what I've seen and businesses around here and even in my own business we seen this explosion was sort of consumer spending but also people that are buying stuff from us\nI can relate to it personally but it's allowed us to do is create twenty more jobs with the tax reform that we have right now\nSo by more range from farmers and the things that we've been allowed to do as a direct reflection of the job reform of the job before him in tax cuts act\nAlso what I find pretty exciting as opportunities those investment when you look at tax reform specifically not only there's about twenty percent of the opportunities zones from our federal law is actually right here in the fifth district\nNot only do you get a tax on capital gains if you start a business in these opportunities ... and the ... district but you can also invest in those opportunities zones and get those same tax advantages I find that amazing not only do we have tax cuts but we have the ability now to incentivize private investment into the state of Virginia Commonwealth in the fifth district [noise]\nI Do not support the child tax cuts it went to the ultra wealthy um and we see that it's not benefiting people I'm doing a small business to or where I'm hoping to talk to a small business owner and every precinct in the entire district we have not met one small business owner\nWho supports these tax cuts and we are not just black we are blindly going to small businesses were not targeting them by any means so when I Walk in there I don't know that political affiliation they these Trump Trump tax cuts have blown a hole\nDeficit so I support tax reform that support small businesses and the working class [noise]\nWith the Trump tax bill out at one point nine trillion dollars to the deficit and the United states\nOur grandchildren will be paying for that\nThis is not something we want to support and I would want to reverse it eighty three percent of the benefits goes to a major corporations and to the very wealthy and a lot of the middle class are going to be very disappointed when they look at their tax bills next spring\nSo ah the um this is not something I support and I really would like to reverse it that's that's the main thing how to do that or there will be a lot of discussion but a really just adding that amount to the deficit is criminal\n\nBecause it's a civil discussion having some fun so the one point nine trillion dollars is actually a CDO estimate over ten years so right now um when you look and see bill estimates they get very walking when you get about three or four years outside of that by the way tax cuts do not cause deficits spending does\nAnd when you look at the be all estimates they get very walking when you get about three or four years outside of that by the way tax cuts do not cause deficit spending does so we want to do is make sure as we increase tax cuts we\nAnd federal contracting who knows the audit trail and knows what to look for when you're looking at ways fraud waste and abuse in the federal government so we're talking about these type of things weren't talking about tax cuts in spending we need to be able to separate those into the tax cuts his purchase economy to incredible heights but it's spending that we have to get a hold of [noise]\nIf you would refrain from applauding until the very end it'll help things along okay thank you\nOr anyone else\nThere's been much talk of a trade war over the past year with China specifically related to agriculture and manufacturing both of which have a major presence in the Lynchburg region good each of you inform us of your trade policy do you support the president's proposed tariffs on various with ...\nIt was on a I'm a free trade advocate and I will be pushing for free trade policies I selected to Congress or want to make sure that uh the president's\nTerrorists are short term and in pursuit of the long term goal of lowering overall terrorists globally so uh I'm hopeful that we can continue to pursue that goal and that is the a goal that I Will take to Washington\nRestaurateur [noise]\nOr is it a co-op anyway old old if they do they're clapping for many standing up so\nI think when you're talking about free trade this is a very difficult question honestly for Republicans especially free trade you know ... people that believe in free trade for me looking at the you know the United states in Mexico Canada agreement that was a good first step but looking at China right now you're looking they've lost about three trillion dollars in their stock market over the last\nFew months especially since we've had these rumors of a trade war\nTalking to people in the fifth district when you look at dairy farmers and you'll get tobacco when you talk of soybean it's really a mixed bag even with timber so when I when I talked to all these farmers summers I listen we supported but if it goes too long we're in trouble they said we're okay was short term pain for long term gain but at some point this tariff might act like a tax\nSo for me I think we have to look at each one of these individually and for me being a business I Want to look at each one of these individually but we have to go back to where we have free and fair trade no matter what we do especially to make sure that the fifth the fifth district economy continues to grow\nAs well\nI Do not support Trump's terrorists and I don't support any policy that down without the um ... consultation of experts and that are fired off on Twitter at three o'clock in the morning and we need to be thoughtful about things that we are doing in our on our government\nAnd so I support pro American worker trade policies on and like I said I'm doing a small business to her and I talked to a small business owners just so sweet grass to a brewery in Canada\nWe are listening to the Lynchburg chamber a debate amongst the fifth and sixth district candidates on WC each ...\nReports in proving that modernizing of the American free trade agreement NAFTA\nWhy honoring existing trade partners with the United states eliminating the remaining trade distortions and barriers with Canada and Mexico and raising intellectual property rights and investment standards to levels equal to the United states what's your position on NAFTA and what changes would you support if any\nWell we uh have a\nAn administration that has successfully negotiated a changes to NAFTA and so\nUh we're well on our way to\nImproving our trade position these heavy Canada and Mexico a when it comes to intellectual property a China is one of the major offenders when it comes to violations of our intellectual property rights a congressman Goodlatte has pursued legislation and we also need to take a strong\nA firm hand with China when it comes to violations of intellectual property rights or is it when it comes to American so I Would support\nA negotiating renegotiating trade agreements in that area as well\n\nSo we did just a negotiate the U. S. MCA United States must go Canada agreement and some of the things I looked in there and when I started to read it you get a little bit excited for the fifth district specifically for dairy\nJust to negotiate the U. S. MCA United States must go kinda agreement and some of the things I looked in there and when I started to read it you get a little bit excited for the fifth district specifically for dairy um there's even people in this room right now that I've talked to concerning dairy and talking to dairy farmers about what they're going through and it's not just trade it's also dumping and some of the other things\nBut it seems like right now based on the fact that Canada has relax those dairy tears\nFor the fifth district I Would love to go there myself\nAnd talked to a candid about what we can do back and forth with his fifth district based on the U.S MCI know best a little bit of my sons are on China\nOne of the reasons we have an issue with China's based on technological theft which is something we have to deal with everyday especially in the DOD to one of the things one of the folk rooms that we're trying to use one of the pressure points is that that has to stop in order to get a trade deal\nSo we're talking about some of these things are some bigger pictures when you're talking about the u._s. MCA but also with China and some of the things that they're doing specifically in the department of defense arena but also in ... in stealing or trade secrets\n\nAnytime we talk about changing trade policies or\nAnything like that we need to keep in mind that we need to be supporting American workers in American Jobs so that's my number one issue my number one concern we're talking about trade policies on this that we need to make sure that we're protecting our workers protecting our job\nSo yes on NAFTA does need to be need to be changed in reform because it was signed into law when\nOur current Congress men was finishing his first year I'm In Washington and I think Clinton was president and um so yes things need to be changed after twenty some years\nBut they don't need to be a negotiations don't need to happen on the backs of agreements that are already on the table like the Paris accord and the TV\n\nI think the initial problems with NAFTA that seven hundred thousand jobs left the United states\nAnd say I went to Mexico\nI'm also one point three Mexican farmers were put out of work does for small farmers who couldn't compete with the corn that was coming in from the United states so there were big problems and I think he's in our president mentioned the same problems\nWhat's happened now yes I agree this is very good for fifth district dairy farmers um there are other provisions that that have been hailed as a big change like\nSome auto parts have to be made in countries where they pay at least sixteen dollars an hour\nThat's good if it's the United states but some of this parts are often made in Europe so that could be that could be taken up by parts that are made in Germany for cars that are assembled in Mexico so we really want to make sure that if it involves the United states and not other nations\n\nWhat is your position on the Atlantic coast been mountain valley like ...\n\nWell I'm an all of the above\nEnergy policy supporter so I support oil\nI support natural gas I support coal\nAh I Do support solar and wind but uh we have to make sure that whatever the technology whatever the resource it is transport it safely\nAnd so when natural gas is transported by pipeline a we have to make sure that it is done with a sufficient protections for water and so I've made sure by writing to both of our state\nDepartment of environmental quality and from work to make sure that they use the story that we have given them\nTo make sure that our water supply is kept safe\nAnd so I Will continue to be aggressive in pushing our uh\nPretty that we have given them to make sure that our water supplies kept safe and so I Will continue to be aggressive in pushing our uh administrative agencies to protect our water and make sure that our citizens are kept safe\n\nOr some people know me on this one show up\nFor me I'm a critical infrastructure expert in the department of defense says what I Do if anybody wants to talk about it afterward I'm happy to well I'm against the ACP in the MVP the reason why is because I always err on the side of liberty I also think that there can be a teacher can be agreements on protecting private property and grow in critical infrastructure an autonomous infrastructures\nLooking at what we have like HR sixteen eighty nine which was a bipartisan bill by Republicans and Democrats made it much more difficult for private companies to take public property to public or private property so public condemnation just for economic gain here's what you got approved to me\nYou have to prove that private property trumps the economic development somebody going through there you have to prove to me that's not just a money grab for a company you have to prove to me that our most cherished right a private property will always be\nAlways be protected something near and dear to my heart um if we want to talk about it afterwards we can because the red lights on\n\nI'm president and founder of friends have like us or which is a pipeline opposition group and I've been on the front lines for the last four years standing up for private property rights and against the abuse of eminent domain a for profit corporations should not be able to come in and take your land my opponent\nTo give them that right\nYeah\nMy opponent voted to give them that right to come in and take your land for dirty disastrous pipeline project it's going to devalue your land is not bringing us the jobs and not getting us any of the gas ... we're not going to benefit from any of that\nWe're only going to see destruction and I think it's absurd that we are allowing for this abuse of eminent domain um and when we're talking about jobs but when you the energy industry employs more people than the fossil fuel industry so vulnerable energy is the way to\n\nI'm opposed to the pipelines pipelines do not keep the lights on in Virginia they are utterly unnecessary\nThey're going through sustainable farms\nThey're going through a section of the fifth district where um we have wonderful thriving businesses and they're going to the plan is that they will go through communities like union hill in Buckingham which is an historic African American Friedman community where there will be a giant\nCompressor station spewing toxic chemicals and venting methane and sounding like a diesel locomotive twenty four seven\nThese pipelines will leak as much methane as the equivalent the greenhouse equivalent of forty six coal fired plants\nThey will go across a thousand waterways including the James and they leak into those waterways this is not protecting Virginians\nAre right that concludes our first section where will now move into a ton of questions submitted by the audience to get all the questions related to business and economic development will be accepted\nCandidates we asked that you'd be as direct and concise as possible so that we may I ask is many audience questions as possible\nThirty seconds to answer yes but we're moving we're moving right along if you watch could we go a minute and allow them to do that yes okay we'll do that\nBut we're moving we're moving right along if you watch could we go a minute and allow them to do that yes okay we'll do that I you all can\nNo doubt this is the first question and we'll go on the same order\nIf minimum wage because it's Fifteen dollars an hour how do you propose to offset the cost to businesses where those costs will not be passed down to consumers the quality of products endorsed services are not the ...\nThat's an excellent question that's based on the idea that ah when businesses are\nRequired by government once again a inserting government in between a relationship between employer an employee\nRequiring employers to pay a certain a Fifteen dollar minimum wage that it's going to come at a cost and is that cost going to be a born out through a reduced employment cutting back on ours\nAre not hiring that extra person a there are

Elizabeth Warren in which case you can look as hard then as far as you can to see if you can find some Native American blood in your background yeah\nThat's that she created her own problem with that

a little under two thousand miles away but they seem to be making pretty good speed at this point they've already busted through the wall of the barricades\nOr to get out of Guatemala to get into

remembrance project Murray welcome back to the program\nThat Lance thanks so much a man and again\nSo is this the October surprise that the Democrats usually a plan for every every ... every major electric Erika\n[laughter] right they orchestrated and then they try to place blame on President Trump's shoulders and you're trying to make him look like an evil person in the Republican Party as the evil when we're trying to do is protect our borders\nYeah and in fact the president said if he needs to put the military on the border\nDo you think that's what we're up against because this caravan started at one thousand it's now it's supposed to be at seven thousand or greater ... their numbers that are greater than that not now by the time it hits the border if he keeps growing away it has been it could be over ten thousand people trying to get into the United states all of the same time\nI think the ... the only way that we're going to stop this invasion and according to achieve many ...\nI think the military is only way that we're going to stop this invasion and according to a chief many ... out of the Archie the sector the Rio Grande valley sector and\nAnd uh Texas here in Moscow and he mentioned in the last two weeks there were fifty four hundred family units coming through and this is in advance of that care of and you know also you know they captured a gang members cartels and of course there were over\nSeven hundred pounds of marijuana and other drugs I think it's it's overwhelming for the ice age for the border patrol agents um there has to be some help there and that's what he's asking for is for reinforcements\nI thought we might actually get some help from Mexico when President Trump last week should should to Mexico if you don't help us stop this then we may end up with no trade deal whatsoever and I bought a New Mexico was trying to help but now I guess not\nRight and just think of it this way um I think that that Mexico of course is helping the Democrat Party and should\nUm the Democrats win this mid term they would of course move again to impeach President Trump and they would implement their far left agenda so this is a win situation for Mexico and and you know like a large that they have no intention in stopping this invasion\nNo end in trying to get Trump out of the way and if they can take away one house of Congress and then they stop him from passing anything as a bill which pushes them back to the only other thing you know ... is executive orders and I've been very proud that this president\nHas not used executive orders employees of legislation the way his predecessor did so frequently\nWhat else can we do to get those things don't\nBut I think that the making people need to speak up a they certainly need to be showing their support and making their voices heard calling the White House it to zero to four five six\nEleven eleven and telling President Trump that we support him and we support placing the military on the border in order to stop the invasion and protect America and American lives and also I think that we need to go ahead and them obviously go vote and vote for those who will\nStand for securing our border and for an America First agenda that President Trump is\nPushing forward but he can't do it alone you know we can send the use of military we can uh\nTake that trade deal off the table and you can you know we can also um implement some sort of um I Would say additional fees or assess fees wherever possible like their remittance fees you know Mexico has\nAssessed fees for the money going into their country from the United states you know let's pick it back on that and really make them feel the pain because every man's fees that that gardeners the Mexico and the Mexico\nJust about two billion dollars a month on those remittances that is what the from the money wired into Mexico you know\nThey have every intention again to continue that flow of money and to push their citizens um onto the American taxpayer while trying to collect the U.S foreign aid and U.S foreign aid has to be taken off the table as well a\nMemory or would you remind reminding my audience about them remember and project and what that is all about\n[noise] would love to we started in two thousand nine as a voice for victims killed by illegal aliens and naturally Lars November fourth of this year we're going to recognize the national day\nBy illegal aliens and naturally liars November fourth as they are going to recognize the national day of remembrance for Americans killed by illegal aliens\nThis is our seventh year to recognize his national day on the line and make sure that this issue is not swept under the ride once again and you know President Trump have also asked him to officially a nationally proclaimed this\nDay every member and I'm so that we can fix the problem you know these families are American families are permanently separated from their last one's never to see them again until they reach Kevin\nAll one hundred percent preventable and it's the lack of the spine and courage and doing the right thing that the politicians who I liked it to do and protect America\nAnd follow our constitution and that's the reason why there are ... are wonderful falling Americans who have lost their life\nSo you know we we do we also Lars has a chaplain St group and a crisis intervention group where we help the family and get the help that they need and psychologically emotionally to sell you know we're doing a lot of faith which is so very grateful that President Trump has\nSaid he Exxon with on this issue and listened to I ate all moms and dads\nThat you know we had to get all that stuff I think it affects the family and to help out and speak out\nYou know the only ideas I dad to yours I liked the idea of taxing the remittances but I think there may be an easier way to do it um\nYou know that the IRS has all kinds of rules even for American citizens if you go down to your bank for some reason and deposit around ten thousand dollars the IRS gets notified because they know that they don't want people hiding cash\nI have a feeling a lot of the remittance money that is sent back is money that's earned is cash by illegal aliens who are working illegally in this country and when they send it out of the country by going down to a\nConvenience store a place where they can buy Western Union money order and send it to their families that effectively hides it for tax purposes and have a feeling a lot of it was was as they've not pay taxes on it so say\nIf you're a legal American citizen or a green card holder you have a Social Security number if you want to send money by Western Union\nSay more than a hundred dollars a at a time you're gonna have to show Social Security number if you don't you have to pay a fee and you could make the the produce stuff you could make it five or ten percent and say this is a way of reminding folks that that you are not going to be able to dodge the tax man\nAnd that we understand that if you're saying that money south\nOr we can stop you from sending the money but we could say you have to and Social Security number or it's a five or ten percent the\nThe other thing I Would suggest to Americans as we're heading into the fall where it gets cold in most parts of America\nA lot of people decided to take vacation time and sometimes they vacation to Mexico both because you know there's a lot of sun and because it's inexpensive it might be a good idea I don't sponsor boycotts because I think my audience is smart enough to make their own decisions\nBut have a vacation in the United states and skip Mexico and ... send them a message that if they're willing to help people invade our country then we don't need to be spending tourist dollars which are also important to Mexico Maria what's the website very quickly for the remembrance\nBecause they couldn't afford coverage until the Republicans were killed that tax of course Democrats would like to put it back in place but it's not good enough to get rid of the penalty to get rid of the individual mandate if you don't also have deregulation and there's nothing for people to choose their no non Obamacare options available even if Obamacare's voluntary rather than mandatory unless you also have\nThe deregulation a deregulatory steps that we've seen from the Trump Administration and Democrats are basically saying look if we can't mandate Obamacare let's ban all the other option so people have no other choice then they're stuck in it and I think that's a far guys were any\nGood at talking about health care on the stump they would be carrying Democrats up on that things are horrible vote from them and they somehow said we're protecting preexisting condition or provisions\nWhich makes no sense because this you know they're basically voted to repeal a guaranteed renew ability and the short term market well you know if you get sick and develop a preexisting condition guaranteed renew ability is a great protections you don't have to go into Obamacare and yet that's exactly what they voted to repeal so if anything it was the opposite of what they kind of\nMade their talking points on this vote in the media basically let them get away with it to the extent they paid attention at all\nYou know ... over the weekend I heard more people document pre existing conditions do I I Want to I Want you to test my numbers on this and see if this works I Wish we could knock this issue\nThe more people document a pre existing conditions\nDo I I Want to I Want you to testify numbers on this and see if this works I Wish we could knock this issue out altogether once and for all\nAnd here's how I Do it I've talked to a few different experts including Betsy McCoy and you and others who know this issue well\nAnd they say you know for all the talk about preexisting conditions the total number of people who meet that description is about four hundred thousand and they base that on the number of people who signed up with Obamacare for pre existing conditions and the number of people who are in risk pools before Obamacare came along\nIt's four hundred thousand people out of three hundred and thirty million people in this country\nAnd the total cost of covering those people it's a high premium it averages thirty two thousand dollars a year\nBut in terms of a national policy is twelve billion dollars is a drop in the bucket in a federal budget that is four thousand billion dollars and you need twelve dollars twelve billion dollars to cover it\nIf we passed a law that said if you are you know judge to have a pre existing condition and it's not it's one that actually takes a lot of money to cover\nThen we're just going to cover you were just period unless you you know make more than five hundred thousand dollars years I mean you could set some income limits on and you knock that issue out altogether and say\nNow let's solve the rest of the problem was let the private sector do most of it and the only other big issue I'm aware of is the one where people say but if you're going along happy and healthy and some things strikes you down you need a above a triple quadruple bypass or you need a liver transplant or something like that\nSay fine let's sell catastrophic plans and let's not have the government do it let's have the private sector of the government were to say to the private sector insurance folks hey\nCan you come up with a product that's what they called the insurance industry my wife\nUsed to work for like a long time ago um have a product that will cover you for catastrophes right it's a kind of coverage most people have if they paid off their cars just one policy that covers you only if things go completely terribly wrong\nAnd those can be sold very cheaply to now you've covered people for catastrophic loss you've covered all the people the four hundred thousand that are that have pre existing conditions now the rest of it for the most part\nIs the stuff where people wanted Obamacare to pay for maintenance basically they wanted you to pay for everything from birth control pills to your annual checkup and everything else which I don't think should be the subject of insurance any more than I think my car insurance should cover the maintenance on my car now my wrong on the numbers and I'm not getting this wrong\nWell I I Would I Would disagree only with your last point at the end there because Obamacare actually in practice has extremely high deductible we are all paying these\nVery high premium so we're not getting coverage on any of that routine stuff or even a more expensive stuff than that and so you know the the perverse effect here is that we've got a centrally high deductible\nPlans but we're paying a fortune in premiums for them anyway and there there's no there's no other choices available because of the regulatory structure I'm Betsy is number four hundred thousand might be right I think that it's probably a little on the high end because the first four years after Obamacare passed before the exchanges launched there was something called\nThe preexisting condition insurance plan which massively subsidized people with preexisting conditions so they could get coverage if they were uh you know uninsured because the exchanges have launched yet and they the total\nEnrollment and that was about a hundred and twenty nine thousand now a lot of money thrown out of money prematurely say maybe they were twice or three times as many people that wanted to go and what if it was that if it hadn't run out of money but I think if anything has a high estimate from that say\nOh so so maybe it's a couple of hundred thousand it's the kind of thing that is a very affluent country a wealthy country like ours could easily say if you're one of those people with the ... the cats\nAnd it's the kind of thing that a a very affluent country a wealthy country like ours\nCould easily say if you're one of those people with a ... a catastrophic metal medical condition her condition that goes on for a long time to breathe existing condition caused a huge amount of money to cover we could cover it and we could say that's something we ought to do as a society unless you're already getting it through your
